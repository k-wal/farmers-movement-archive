07-10-2021||New Delhi||Amit Shah reviews Kashmir situation after terrorists kill civilians||Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday in the wake of terrorists killing seven civilians in the last five days, officials said.Also read: After prominent Kashmiri Pandit chemist, 2 teachers killed in Srinagar During the hour-long meeting, the Home Minister was given a presentation on the overall security situation in the Union Territory and the border areas by top officials.He was briefed about the latest modus operandi of the terrorists in carrying out attacks on soft targets and the steps taken to tighten the security arrangements, an official said.Shah is believed to have directed the officials to ensure that those involved in the killings are nabbed and to check further occurrence of such incidents.Later, Director of Intelligence Bureau Arvind Kumar held a separate meeting, which was also attended by top officials of Jammu and Kashmir.A woman principal and a teacher were shot dead at point-blank range inside a government school in Srinagar on Thursday, taking the number of civilians killed by terrorists in the Kashmir valley to seven in the last five days.Of the seven, four were from minority communities and six of the deaths were reported from Srinagar.Supinder Kaur, the principal of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School at Eidgah in Srinagar, and Deepak Chand were gunned down at around 11.15 am on the school premises.There were no students in the school.Makhan Lal Bindroo, a prominent Kashmiri Pandit and the owner of Srinagar’s most famous pharmacy, was shot dead at his shop on Tuesday.A “chaat” vendor, Virendra Paswan from Bihar, and another civilian, Mohammad Shafi Lone, were also killed on Tuesday in Srinagar and Bandipora, respectively.On Saturday, terrorists shot dead Majid Ahmad Gojri in Srinagar and Mohammad Shafi Dar at Batamaloo.According to official statistics, a total of 28 civilians have so far been killed by terrorists in 2021.Of the 28 civilians killed, five belonged to local Hindu or Sikh communities, while two were non-local Hindu labourers.Officials said due to the killings of a large numbers of terrorists of all outfits, especially their leadership, and the destruction of their support systems, the Pakistan-based handlers of the terrorists have got frustrated and changed their strategy. They have started targeting unarmed policemen, politicians and innocent civilians from minority communities, including women.In all such cases, the terrorists used pistols, which they can carry easily, the officials said.Most of these crimes are committed by newly-recruited terrorists or those who are about to join terrorist ranks, they added.According to official data, 97 terror attacks have so far been reported in Jammu and Kashmir this year -- 71 on security forces and 26 on civilians.In 2020, a total of 105 such attacks were reported -- 80 on security forces and 25 on civilians.

You will have six months”, the Bench told the ASG. “We do believe that six months is more than enough for a disciplined organisation like the respondent to arrange their affairs,” it added.The court made it clear that this would be applicable insofar as the RMIC was concerned. However, with regard to the Rashtriya Military Schools, the process will begin during 2022-2023.“Dehors the niceties, the fact is that all boys’ schools were going to turn into co-education institutions, is something the respondent has accepted,” it said after perusing the Centre’s affidavit.The RIMC is an Inter-Service Category ‘A’ establishment, administered through the Army Training Command (ARTRAC) under the Ministry of Defence. Christened the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College, it was inaugurated on 13 March 1922 by His Royal Highness, Prince Edward VIII, the Prince of Wales.“The question is whether it (RIMC) completes its 100 years with gender neutrality or not,” the Bench had earlier commented.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-nda-supreme-court-allows-womens-entry-into-rmic-dehradun-321494

The state government then appealed against the judgment and the dead man’s family too filed a revision petition.The pleas were heard and the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court reserved its judgment on March 12, 2018.However, before the verdict could be pronounced by the Bench of Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyay and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh, it was relisted. This required a further hearing.The online status on the court’s website shows that the case was last listed for hearing on February 25, 2020.Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra was booked for murder after eight people were killed in violence near Tikonia village in Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday.Four of them were farmers. The remaining four were two BJP workers, their driver and a local journalist.According to the complaint against the Minister’s son, he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down the farmers.The Minister has challenged this, saying there is evidence to prove that his son was at an event being held elsewhere at the same time.The farmers have also accused the Minister of making “provocative” statements against those  protesting over Centre’s agri-marketing laws.Opposition leaders have demanded Ajay Mishra’s dismissal from the Cabinet and the arrest of his son Ashish Mishra.

Congratulating him, top BJP leaders lauded his leadership and credited him for ushering in “good governance and development”.Home Minister Amit Shah, who has been a close aide of PM Modi for over three decades, said the journey of good governance and development that started on this day in 2001 when he took oath for the first time as the CM has continued uninterrupted.  The PM worked day and night for the people and country’s progress, he added.BJP president J P Nadda said Modi pulled the country out of an atmosphere of disappointment and put it on the path to progress and becoming “vishwa guru”. “The PM worked like a ‘karma yogi’ and infused people with self-confidence about making a new India.

07-10-2021||Lucknow/Lakhimpur||Accused not yet arrested as they are associated with BJP: Akhilesh on Lakhimpur incident||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday said Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son has not yet been arrested in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case even though evidence pointed to his role in the incident.“As fingers are raised towards MoS (Ajay Mishra) in the BJP government, the accused in Lakhimpur case are not yet sent to jail,” Yadav said while speaking to reporters at his residence in Lucknow before heading to Lakhimpur to meet the aggrieved families.“Those named in the FIR should go to jail. Government should take immediate action and the matter should be probed by a sitting judge of the High Court. There are videos clips, statements of eyewitnesses, the statement (of minister) in which he is threatening. As he (accused Ashish Mishra) is the son of the MoS, action has not been taken yet,” he said.“Do you think farmers can get justice till he (father of accused) is MoS?” he asked.The UP government has constituted a one-member commission headed by retired judge of Allahabad High Court Justice Pradeep Kumar Srivastava to probe the incident, a senior Home Department official said on Thursday.When asked about the BJP’s allegation that the opposition is doing politics on the matter, Yadav said, “The BJP is doing politics and it is a clever party. We want to know what was done in the Kanpur Manish Gupta case. Why are policemen still absconding? Why is an absconding IPS officer not arrested?”         Kanpur-based businessman Manish Gupta had died under suspicious circumstances inside a hotel in Gorakhpur on Monday and six policemen were booked on charges of murder.After meeting family members of Lovepreet Singh (19) in Lakhimpur, Yadav said the family wants justice.“People from all political parties are here so that the families get justice. The son of a minister will not be arrested as there is a BJP government both in UP and at the Centre,” he said demanding Rs 2 crore compensation to the victims’ families.“The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the matter. It has generated hope among the poor families for getting justice,” the SP president said, adding that the minister and his son are guilty and all the reality will come out in the open in the apex court.The former chief minister assured that if the BJP government did not help them, he will do all that is possible when his party is voted to power in the upcoming state assembly elections.He also met the family of deceased journalist Raman Kashyap and will also pay a visit to the kin of Nacchatar Singh (65) during his visit.Yadav had tried to visit Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday but was stopped outside his home by the police.On October 3, eight people were killed in Lakhimpur Kheri with four of them being farmers, who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.The other four were two BJP workers, a driver of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra and a journalist working for a private television channel. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/accused-not-yet-arrested-as-they-are-associated-with-bjp-akhilesh-on-lakhimpur-incident-321485
07-10-2021||Raebareli (UP)||UP woman duped of Rs 32 lakh by ‘Instagram friend from UK’, probe under way||A Uttar Pradesh woman has allegedly been duped of over Rs 32 lakh by a person whom she befriended on Instagram and who identified himself as a resident of the United Kingdom, officials said on Thursday.The woman, who lives in Raebareli district of the state, alleged that she got trapped after she was informed that a “gift” and some “foreign currency” worth Rs 45 lakh have arrived in Delhi for her from the UK and she would have to pay a fee to collect them, the officials said.Raebareli Superintendent of Police Shlok Kumar said the police have taken cognisance of the matter and the cyber cell is investigating the case.“Efforts are on to trace the culprits and bring back the money duped online from the victim,” Kumar told PTI.According to officials, the woman had come in contact with the man in September on Instagram where he identified himself as “Harry”, a resident of the UK, and exchanged phone numbers, starting off regular conversations over social media.“Recently, she got a call over Whatsapp from a woman, who informed her that a gift box and some UK currency which amounts to Rs 45 lakh have arrived for her in Delhi. In order to collect it, she would have to pay a processing fee,” an official said.“She was asked to make the payments online and in several instalments. Eventually, she ended up transferring around Rs 32 lakh after which there was no communication from the other side,” the official said.The woman then reached Delhi to inquire about the “gift” sent for her from the UK but realised she had been conned. She returned Raebareli and approached the district police chief on Tuesday.Kumar, meanwhile, cautioned people against falling trap to lucrative online offers and schemes, and asked them to confirm the authenticity of the persons they are dealing with in order to stay safe from cyber criminals.The Uttar Pradesh Police, as part of national initiative, had in May this year started a dedicated helpline number 155260 where people can report online frauds and cyber crimes.People can also call 112 immediately to report any online fraud, UP Cyber Police chief Triveni Singh had told PTI recently, adding early reporting of frauds helps the police start the process of blocking the duped money.Till September, the UP Police had brought back over Rs 2 crore that cyber criminals had conned from state residents and had got another Rs 5 crore frozen in bank accounts that were duped by thugs.

07-10-2021||New Delhi||Discussions with US under way on S-400 missile defence deal: India||India on Thursday said discussions are going on with the US on the S-400 missile defence deal, a day after US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman expressed unease over New Delhi’s procurement of the Russian weapons system.“This has been under discussion between our two countries for some time. It was raised and we have discussed it and explained our perspective. And discussions on this are ongoing,”  External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.He was replying to a question on Sherman’s comments on Wednesday on the India-Russia deal.Sherman, on a three-day visit to India, told journalists that any decision on possible sanctions on the S-400 deal will be made by President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.The issue of India procuring the S-400 missile system from Russia figured in Sherman’s wide-ranging talks with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Wednesday and both sides hoped to find a way out on the issue through dialogue.“We’ve been quite public about any country that decides to use the S-400. We think that is dangerous and not in anybody’s security interest. That said, we have a strong partnership with India,” Sherman said.“We want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems and I hope we will be able to in this instance as well,” she said.Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhary on Tuesday said that the first batch of S-400 missile defence system will arrive in India from Russia by this year.The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the purchase of S-400 missile defences from Russia.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems in 2019. The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.Following US sanctions on Turkey, there have been apprehensions that Washington may impose similar punitive measures against India.Russian ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev said in April that both Russia and India do not recognise bilateral sanctions as they are “illegal tools” of “unlawful and unfair” competition and pressure.

Commissioned by an unknown prince, an artist shaped a diamond, weighing over 200 carats, and a brilliant emerald, weighing at least three hundred carats, into two masterpieces. Testament to the technical skill involved, no comparable example of either is known to exist. In  1890, the lenses were placed in new frames, decorated with rose-cut diamonds.The original patron for whom these extraordinary spectacles were commissioned remains unknown, but they stem from a rich period of artistic and architectural achievement during the Great Mughal reigns of emperors Akbar (1556–1605), Jahangir (1605–1627), Shah Jahan (1627–1658) and Aurangzeb (1658–1707).“The quality and purity of the gemstones is itself extraordinary and stones of this size would no doubt have been the reserve of an emperor. The diamonds are flawless, thought to be from the mines of Golconda in Southern India,” Sotheby’s experts note.“Cleaved as a pair from a single natural diamond – possibly the largest ever found – they now together weigh 25 carats. The faceting around the edge displays extreme skill, arranged to hold transparency in the lenses while releasing light from the edges. The teardrop-shaped emeralds also originate from a single natural Colombian emerald, and now weigh twenty-seven carats. The bevelling of the emeralds has been precisely angled to hold the intensity of the colour in the stone,” they add.According to legends of the time, while ordinary lenses merely function to improve sight, these filters were aids for spiritual enlightenment – with diamonds thought to illuminate and emeralds believed to have held miraculous powers to heal and to ward off evil.In India, legend has it that following the tragic death of Shah Jahan’s beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal – in whose honour the Taj Mahal was built – the emperor is said to have cried so many tears that he needed to cure his ailing eyes with emerald stones.

07-10-2021||Kolkata||BJP leader Sabyasachi Dutta returns to Mamata Banerjee-led TMC||BJP state secretary and the former Mayor of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) Sabyasachi Dutta, who had quit the TMC to join the saffron camp two years ago, returned to the Mamata Banerjee-led party on Thursday.He claimed that the saffron party runs a “Taliban-style government” wherever it is in power.Dutta was welcomed into the fold by TMC secretary general and cabinet minister Partha Chatterjee at his chamber in the Assembly, in the presence of other senior leaders.“We inducted Dutta in the party, as per his request, on the very day our leader Mamata Banerjee took oath as an MLA. She has approved Dutta’s induction into the party,” Chatterjee said.The new inductee, on his part, asserted that he would humbly take up any role offered to him by the TMC.“The BJP is running a Taliban-style government wherever it is in power. This is absolutely condemnable,” he stated, shortly after the switch over.He further said that some misunderstanding had prompted his exit from the TMC, but that has now been resolved.“From 2011 to 2021, I was an MLA. I held the post of BMC mayor for several terms. There was some misunderstanding within the party. But that has been cleared. My new journey with the TMC begins from today,” the former legislator added.Dutta lost Bidhannagar seat to TMC’s Sujit Bose in the April-May Assembly elections.Reacting to the switchover, state BJP vice president Ritesh Tiwari said it only goes on to show Dutta’s “double standards and his lack of political credibility”.The saffron camp has been facing an exodus since its defeat in the Assembly polls.The BJP won 77 of the 292 seats that went to the polls. The TMC won 213 seats, while the ISF and the GJM bagged one seat each in the state elections.BJP’s Nisith Pramanik and Jagannath Sarkar later resigned as MLAs to retain their Lok Sabha seats, bringing down the saffron camp’s official tally in the Assembly to 75.Four saffron camp MLAs, including the party’s national vice president Mukul Roy, has crossed over to the TMC since the declaration of the assembly poll results on May 2.None of them, however, quit the membership of the assembly and continue to be BJP MLAs.Former Union Minister Babul Supriyo also joined the TMC last month.

07-10-2021||New Delhi||Mental health support high in India, yet pandemic stress continues: Study||Mental health support is high in India but there is still a long way to go as employees are taking on extra pandemic responsibilities, says a report.According to a study by leading payroll and human capital management (HCM) technology provider, ADP titled ‘People at Work 2021: A Global Workforce View’, support for mental health in India fared higher than the global average.Around 70 per cent of workers in India said their employer supported their mental wellbeing compared to 65 per cent globally.“It’s great to see so many businesses recognising the emotional and psychological toll the pandemic is having on their workforce and putting constructive measures in place to help them handle it,” Rahul Goyal, ADP’s Managing Director of India and Southeast Asia, said.Goyal further noted that “it is interesting but unsurprising to see Indian employees feel more supported compared to the rest of the world. Many Indian companies during the pandemic have helped employees with regular reach-outs, 24/7 counselling helplines, and even additional leave specifically for mental wellbeing.”      Despite the support, stress caused by the pandemic has still been a significant challenge for workers in India.The global study of more than 32,000 people noted that due to Covid-19, employees’ time and productivity are being increasingly monitored, risking further stress. Moreover, 1 in 3 respondents said they have taken on extra responsibilities since the pandemic.Staying healthy and balancing work and family needs were rated as the biggest challenges at work since Covid-19 began, as cited by almost 20 per cent of workers.Creating a safe home working environment and stress management were the biggest challenges by around 12 per cent, followed by maintaining productivity (9 per cent) and building relationships (7 per cent).Globally, the study also found that more than 62 per cent of participants say that their employer is more closely monitoring time and work attendance. This increased to 72 per cent for workers in India.“Efforts to support the mental wellbeing of staff are positive, however, employers are keeping such close tabs on attendance and time-management. This can add to feelings of stress and anxiety for workers,” Goyal said.This change in the way employees work has thrown up a multitude of new challenges for workers and businesses alike. While employers need to adapt quickly, they must also tread carefully.Being seen to be appropriately managing issues around stress, wellbeing, productivity, and morale is likely to be a key preoccupation for managers and HR teams alike going forward.“HR departments can lead the way in improving culture and workplace practices moving forward. Understanding how teams and managers work together and using employee data to identify opportunities for improvement is the first step,” Goyal said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mental-health-support-high-in-india-yet-pandemic-stress-continues-study-321463

07-10-2021||Kota (Rajasthan)||Remove Gandhi’s portrait from Rs 2,000 notes as they are being used for corruption: Cong MLA to Modi||A Congress MLA has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that Mahatma Gandhi’s portrait be removed from Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes as they are being used in cases of corruption and in bars.Drawing attention to cases of corruption in Rajasthan, Bharat Singh Kundanpur, the MLA from the ruling party in the state, said a total 616 graft cases were registered between January 2019 and December 31, 2020, with an average of two cases registered per day.In a letter sent to Modi on the 152nd birth anniversary of Gandhi on October 2, he urged the prime minister to replace Gandhi’s portrait on high value currency notes with a picture of his iconic spectacles.The Sangod MLA said Gandhi’s portrait should be retained only on the notes in the denominations of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 50, Rs 100 and Rs 200 as they are widely used by the poor and Gandhi throughout his life worked for the destitute.“It is my suggestion that a picture of Gandhi’s spectacles can be used on Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Ashok Chakra can also work effectively for this purpose,” Kundanpur said in the letter.The Congress MLA said corruption has spread all over the country in the last seven-and-a-half decades.“Mahatma Gandhi symbolises truth and Gandhi’s picture is printed on Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, which are generally used in practices of corruption and in exchange of bribes,” he added.He said the high value currency notes are used in bars, bringing “disgrace” to Gandhi.“Gandhi’s portrait should be removed from Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes and it should be used only on small currency notes which are used by the poor,” the MLA said in the letter. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remove-gandhis-portrait-from-rs-2-000-notes-as-they-are-being-used-for-corruption-cong-mla-to-modi-321457

07-10-2021||United Nations||The biggest perpetrator and supporter of terrorism masquerading as its victim: India slams Pakistan at UN||Pakistan is the biggest perpetrator and supporter of terrorism and masquerades as its victim and should stop cleansing its own minorities including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and Buddhists, India has said in a strong response slamming Islamabad for again raking up the Kashmir issue at the UN.Emphasising that the fight against terrorism has to be unrelenting and across all fronts, Counsellor/Legal Adviser at India's Permanent Mission to the UN Dr Kajal Bhat said that all member states must fulfil their obligations enshrined in international counter-terrorism instruments and conventions.“…let me express my dismay that Pakistan has once again misused this august forum to repeat at adnauseam their litany of lies,” Bhat said at the General Assembly 6th committee (Legal) meeting on ‘Measures to eliminate international terrorism'.“Here is the biggest perpetrator and supporter of terrorism masquerading as its victim. We condemn their Pavlovian response wherever the name of India is mentioned and reject all their allegations and insinuations," she said on Wednesday.India's strong response came after Pakistan's UN envoy Munir Akram again raked up the issue of Kashmir at the Sixth Committee meeting and made baseless allegations against India in his remarks."Jammu and Kashmir is, and will always be a part of India," she said."We call on Pakistan to stop cleansing their own minorities including Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and others,” Bhat said.While some states lack the legal-operational frameworks and necessary Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) capacities, others are "clearly guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism by providing financial assistance and safe havens to terrorists," Bhat said, in a veiled reference to Pakistan."We must enhance capacities of the former, but must collectively call out the latter and hold them accountable,” she said.Bhat said terrorism continues to persist globally, spreading into new areas, with terrorists having significantly enhanced their capabilities by gaining access to new and emerging technologies like drones, virtual currencies and encrypted communications for furthering their objectives and accomplishing their evil acts.“COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated the situation. Isolation due to lockdown, distress and economic uncertainty has made the world more susceptible to radicalizing narratives and violent extremist propaganda,” she said.Asserting that terrorists at one place are a “threat" to the whole world, Bhat said fighting terrorism collectively requires “action from all of us, without any exception.” She underscored India's condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and firm belief that there cannot be any exception or justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivations behind such acts, and wherever, whenever and by whomsoever, they are committed.“There cannot be bad terrorists or good terrorists based on their intensions or objectives.” A member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), India is already in the process of upgrading its Financial Intelligence Network to ensure quicker referral of terror-financing cases to law enforcement agencies, she said.India reiterated the need for early finalisation of the Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, saying the UN needs to do more in this direction.“We believe that when right action is not taken at the right time, then it is time itself that causes the action to fail,” Bhat said, strongly calling on states to unite in efforts and end the stalemate preventing the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT).“We all need CCIT as a law enforcement instrument that should strengthen the existing framework of global anti-terrorism conventions,” she said.India expressed hope that the UNGA Resolution of December 2020 that recommends to Sixth Committee to establish the “Working Group” with a view to finalising the process on the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism will “bring finality to the most important task in hand before the international community.” Welcoming the adoption of the 7th review resolution of the Global Counter Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) by the General Assembly by consensus in June 2021, Bhat expressed hope that the member states will “walk the talk” and implement the strategy by taking effective measures.India had contributed constructively to the GCTS negotiations, especially to strengthen the language on countering the financing of terrorism, prevention of misuse of emerging technologies, strengthen the rights of victims of terrorism, providing greater financial resources to the UN counter-terrorism architecture and obligations of member states to take effective measures to prevent terrorist activities.

The committee has also questioned Facebook's India head Ajit Mohan over the issue of political bias on the social media platform.The allegations of a Facebook bias towards the BJP were reported in The Wall Street Journal in August 2020 and had claimed that Ankhi Das, the platform's then India Policy Head had opposed the idea of removing hate posts by BJP leaders, warning that this could hamper their "commercial interests".Das later quit Facebook.Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has posted a staunch defense of his company in a note to employees, saying that recent claims by an ex-employee about the social network's negative effects on society "don't make any sense".IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facebook-failed-to-flag-india-hate-content-as-it-lacked-hindi-bengali-classifiers-321400

They did not find drugs on the ship,” NCP spokesperson and Maharashtra Minorities Affairs Minister Nawab Malik claimed.He also released a few videos, purportedly of the raid. A man named ‘Gosavi’ who is seen escorting Aryan Khan in one of the videos was not an NCB official, and his social media profile states that he is a private detective based in Kuala Lumpur, the NCP leader alleged.Further, two men are seen escorting Arbaaz Merchant, also arrested in the case, in another video, and one of them is a member of the BJP, Malik alleged.“If these two men are not officials of the NCB, then why were they escorting two high-profile people (Khan and Merchant),” he asked.The man seen with Merchant was in Gujarat on September 21-22 and could be connected to the seizure of about 3,000 kilograms of heroin at Mundra Port, Malik claimed, asking the BJP to come clear on this person’s credentials.“The entire NCB is being used by the BJP to malign the Maharashtra government and Bollywood,” he said, alleging that the anti-drug agency was targeting those who are against the saffron party.Notably, Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan had been arrested by the NCB on January 13, 2021, in an alleged drug case. He got bail in September.In a statement, Deputy Inspector General of NCB Gyaneshwar Singh said “some allegations” leveled against agency were baseless, and might have been made “in retaliation against earlier legal actions” carried out by it.Its procedure “has been and will continue to be professionally and legally transparent and unbiased,” the statement said.“Individuals named as Prabhakar Sail, Kiran Gosavi, Manish Bhanushali, Aubrey Gomez, Adil Usmani, V Waigankar, Aparna Rane, Prakash Bahadur, Shoib Faiz and Muzammil Ibrahim ere associated with NCB as independent witnesses (panchas), “ the agency said.Reacting to Malik’s allegations, local BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said during lockdown, the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government was the first to open liquor shops, it also decided to lift prohibition in Chandrapur, and now Nawab Malik has accused the NCB of being a drug lord.Aryan Khan was represented by a senior criminal lawyer when he was produced in a court, Bhatkhalkar said.“The reason why the court granted custody of Aryan Khan to NCB even after he (this lawyer) argued for defence is because of the solid evidence against him (Khan). Had there been no evidence, he would have been granted immediate bail,” said the BJP leader.Malik’s allegations question the credibility of the court, he added.The BJP leader also asked whether Malik was targeting the NCB at the behest of his son-in-law.

That said, we have a strong partnership with India,” Sherman said.“We want to be very thoughtful about the ways ahead, and discussions between our countries try to solve problems and I hope we will be able to in this instance as well,” she said.The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchase of S-400 missile defences from Russia.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems in 2019. The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.Following US sanctions on Turkey, there have been apprehensions that Washington may impose similar punitive measures on India.

07-10-2021||---||Agencies probe link between Kashmir killings and Anas Haqqani’s exultation over Somnath destruction||New Delhi, October 6Two tweets by a Haqqani Network scion which glorified the destruction of statues in Somnath have stirred social media users and given food for thought to intelligence agencies here.Making a reference of his visit on Tuesday to Ghazni, a city past its prime, Anas Haqqani glorified Mahmud Ghaznavi and his act of breaking the Somnath temple idol.Haqqani’s first tweet in Pashto went unnoticed where he made no reference to Ghazni’s foray into Somnath though he did say that the medieval age ruler had been a breaker of idols. His second tweet, an hour later, was in English and it specifically mentioned that he had “smashed the idol of Somnath”.Today, we visited the shrine of Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, a renowned Muslim warrior & Mujahid of the 10th century. Ghaznavi (May the mercy of Allah be upon him) established a strong Muslim rule in the region from Ghazni & smashed the idol of Somnath. pic.twitter.com/Ja92gYjX5j  This set the social media on fire with some Afghans berating him for digging up the past, others hailing his statement and Indians largely pointing out that the Somnath Temple today shines in full glory whereas Ghazni is a dust bowl.You can destroy our temples and not Dharm. pic.twitter.com/yGzBbsnAlx  However, intelligence analysts here differ from social media users. The tweet was posted on a day when Kashmir was rocked by the assassination of a septuagenarian Kashmiri Hindu and a labourer from mainland India.Intelligence agencies believe the Haqqani Network is guided by the ISI and point out that three members from the same family were inducted in the Taliban Cabinet shortly after ISI Chief Gen Faiz Hameed visited Kabul.From Salma Dam to Afghanistan’s Parliament, 5 Infrastructure Development in Afghanistan by IndiaOver the last several years, India has built dams, vital roads, electricity transmission lines and substations, schools and hospitals among others in Afghanista.. pic.twitter.com/vHy1kPRMxi  The Haqqani Network’s willingness to serve ISI’s interests leads sources here to treat Annas Haqqani’s statement as more than just exultation. They wonder if there is an ISI link between Haqqani’s statement and the killings of the most defenseless of civilians in Kashmir – an aged Hindu and a labourer from Bihar.A next generation leader of the Taliban, Anas is the younger brother of the Haqqani Network supremo Sirajuddin who carries a $ 10 million bounty on his head. Said to be fund raiser for the Taliban in Arab countries, Anas was arrested by the Americans and spent five years in Bagram prison where he was twice sentenced to death but released in 2019.The Haqqani Network’s fingerprints were all over a deadly 2008 attack on the Indian mission in Kabul that killed 58 including an Indian Army Brigadier and a senior diplomat. Besides it has repeatedly targeted Indian projects. Afghanistan’s now-defunct National Directorate of Security has repeatedly told its Indian counterparts that the attacks were directed by Qari Abdullah who lives in Peshawar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agencies-probe-link-between-kashmir-killings-and-anas-haqqanis-exultation-over-somnath-destruction-321011
07-10-2021||Lucknow||Rahul, Priyanka meet bereaved families in Lakhimpur Kheri||Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday finally managed to meet the families of the farmers who were killed in Sunday's violence at Tikunia village in Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and other leaders met the family of deceased farmer Lovepreet at the Chaukhada farm in Palia at around 9 pm.They later met the family of journalist Raman Kashyap, who was also killed in violence.Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda accompanied the Gandhi siblings during their meetings with the farmers' families.The entire route from Sitapur to Lakhimpur Kheri was heavily barricaded. The Lakhimpur district administration allowed only seven vehicles in the convoy to enter the district.Former Rajasthan Deputy CM Sachin Pilot and Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, however, were not so lucky as they were detained in Moradabad while they were on their way to Lakhimpur by car.Earlier in the day, AAP MP Sanjay Singh also went to Lakhimpur to meet the bereaved families.Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav and BSP General Secretary Satish Chandra Mishra will be visiting Lakhimpur on Thursday.Read also:Earlier, Rahul Gandhi reached the Sitapur guest house — where his sister and Congress leader Priyanja Gandhi Vadra was kept in detention — on his way to Lakhimpur Kheri from the Lucknow airport in his own vehicle. He had staged a brief dharna at the airport after initially being asked to travel in a police vehicle.Gandhi had reached the Chaudhari Charan Singh airport here this afternoon from Delhi along with Channi, Baghel and Congress general secretaries K C Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala.In a tweet, Surjewala announced that the Punjab and Chhattisgarh governments will provide Rs 1 crore assistance to the families of each farmer and journalist killed in the Sunday violence.Television footage from the airport showed officials telling Gandhi to take the police vehicle, which he did not agree to and sat on a dharna there.“We want to go in our own vehicles, but they want that we should go in their vehicle. I want to know why are you not allowing me to go? First, I was told that I can go in my own vehicle, now you are saying that you will go in a police vehicle. They are doing some mischief,” Gandhi told reporters.Talking to the press at the airport, Gandhi said he or Priyanka being sent to jail was irrelevant as the main question was “people being crushed by criminals”, referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri episode.“Those who should have been in jail are not being put in jail. We are being stopped from meeting the aggrieved families of the farmers,” he said.He also hit out the UP government after he was not allowed to exit the Chaudhari Charan Singh airport, where a group of CRPF personnel were seen preventing his movement out of the airport, despite permission being granted to visit Lakhimpur Kheri.“See this, is the permission! This is the permission of the UP government,” Gandhi said, gesturing towards the security personnel who had formed a human-chain to prevent his movement.“I want to ask them, that I am a citizen of the country and have come to UP and want to go (to Lakhimpur Kheri). Now, why am I not allowed to go,” he questioned of the government.“Definitely, there is some mischief,” he said, responding to a query from the press.Asked about Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra who is accused in the case, Gandhi told the press to ask this question to the government.Unable to move out of the airport, Gandhi along with Channi, Baghel and Deepender Singh Hooda, staged a sit-in inside the airport and said they would not end their ‘dharna’ until they are allowed to go to Lakhimpur.“Until they allow me to go, I will sit here. Farmers are being oppressed and looted, and the farmers understand this,” he said, adding “everybody knows for whom these laws have been made”.After he left the airport, it took Gandhi a couple of hours to reach the Provincial Armed Constabulary guest house in Sitapur, around 88 km from Lucknow, where Priyanka Gandhi was kept in detention since Monday morning.She was on her way to meet the families of farmers killed in Sunday’s violence in Lakhimpur Kheri when she was stopped.Earlier in the day, the state government had denied permission to Rahul Gandhi for the visit, and an official spokesperson had said that no one would be allowed to visit the violence-hit district to vitiate its atmosphere.Later, the state government allowed Gandhi, his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and three other Congress leaders to visit the violence-hit district.“Permission has been given to five leaders of Congress, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, to visit Lakhimpur,” Additional Chief Secretary, Information, Navneet Sehgal said. — With agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-priyanka-meet-bereaved-families-in-lakhimpur-kheri-321008
07-10-2021||New Delhi||Unitech case: SC orders complete probe into allegations of collusion between Tihar jail authorites, former promoters||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed a full-fledged probe into the collusion of Tihar Jail officials with Unitech’s imprisoned ex-promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, based on Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana’s report filed in a sealed cover.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah directed registration of criminal cases against Tihar Jail officials and other unknown persons under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code against those involved in collusion on the basis of the report.It also directed suspension of Tihar Jail officials, pending proceedings against whom cases will be lodged as per the report, following ED’s disclosure that the Chandra brothers were conducting business from prison.SC orders shifting of Unitech’s Chandra brothers from Tihar to Mumbai jailsThe top court further directed the Home Ministry to comply with Asthana’s suggestions in the report on enhancing prison management and allowed a copy to be shared with the ministry for for necessary compliance of directions.Besides, the court also took on record reports filed in sealed cover by Enforcement Directorate (ED), Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and Delhi Police, and listed the matter for further hearing on October 21.On August 26, the apex court had directed that the Chandra brothers be shifted from Tihar Jail in the national capital to Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail and Taloja prison in Maharashtra after the ED had said that they were conducting business from the premises in connivance with the staff.The top court, which then perused two status reports of the ED, had said Tihar Jail Superintendent and other staff are “absolutely shameless” for conniving with the Chandra brothers to flout the court orders and undermine its jurisdiction. Pursuant to the direction of the top court, the Chandra brothers were shifted to jails in Mumbai.The two ED reports have raised some “serious and disturbing” issues for consideration and will be dealt with accordingly, the top court had said.It had directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to personally hold inquiry forthwith about the conduct of the Tihar Jail staff with regard to the Chandras and submit the report to the court within four weeks.The ED had made a startling revelation that it had unearthed a “secret underground office” here which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons Sanjay and Ajay when on parole or bail.The ED, which has been investigating money laundering charges against the Chandras and realty firm Unitech Ltd, said in its report that both Sanjay and Ajay have rendered the entire judicial custody meaningless as they have been freely communicating, instructing their officials and disposing of properties from inside the jail in connivance with the prison staff there.Besides ED and SFIO, Economic Offence Wing of Delhi Police is also conducting investigation into the affairs of the Unitech Group and business transactions of erstwhile promoters of the real estate company.Both Sanjay and Ajay who are in jail since August 2017 are accused of allegedly siphoning home buyers’ money. The top court in its October 2017 order had asked them to deposit Rs 750 crore with the apex court registry by December 31, 2017.The brothers have claimed that they complied with the court’s conditions and they have deposited an amount in excess of Rs 750 crore and, therefore, they are granted bail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unitech-case-sc-orders-complete-probe-into-allegations-of-collusion-between-tihar-jail-authorites-former-promoters-321006
