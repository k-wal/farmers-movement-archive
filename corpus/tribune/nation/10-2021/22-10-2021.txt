The judge was hit by an auto-rickshaw with a passenger sitting in the front along with the driver.

We suspect that there may have been some casualties too. The helicopters will make another attempt early on Saturday morning in search of the missing members of the trekking team,” Kumar said.Besides, 15 people who had gone missing in Sarmool, the point of origin of the Saryu river, have also been found safe, he said.Twenty-one tourists and two ailing locals were rescued from Darma Valley of Pithoragarh district, DM Ashish Chauhan said.Two surviving members of a trekking team have already been rescued while the search for two missing is on, officials in Uttarkashi said.Kumaon Divisional Commissioner Sushil Kumar said, “Kumaon division bore the brunt of the unseasonal spell of record rains which damaged crops and property worth Rs 2,000 crore besides accounting for the highest number of deaths and large scale destruction of houses,” the official said.Fifty-nine deaths were reported from Kumaon alone with Nainital reporting the maximum 35 deaths followed by 11 in Champawat, six in Almora, one in Bageshwar and three each in Pithoragarh and Udham Singh Nagar districts.Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Friday visited Dungri village in Chamoli district to meet the disaster-hit people.Accompanied by Tourism Minister Satpal Maharaj, state Disaster Management Minister Dhan Singh Rawat and officials, Dhami trekked up the steep slippery slopes of the village with a stick in hand for an on-the-spot assessment of the losses.Two persons of a family were buried in the rubble of a landslide in the village on October 19.

22-10-2021||United Nations||India condemns abuse of UN platform by Pakistan to propagate ‘false, malicious propaganda’ against it||India strongly hit out at Pakistan for yet again propagating “false and malicious propaganda” against it at a UN platform, where Islamabad spoke in favour of its close ally China’s “protection of ethnic and religious minorities” in Xinjiang.At the meeting of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly that deals with Social, Humanitarian & Cultural issues, Sharma spoke after Pakistan’s delegate again raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir in her intervention at the meeting.“At the outset, we condemn the abuse of a UN platform by Pakistan to propagate its false and malicious propaganda against my country. We dismiss and condemn all such efforts with the contempt they deserve,” First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma said on Thursday.Sharma said India is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multilingual country of continental proportions and is guided by the principles of democracy, pluralism and rule of law.He also said that in the specific reference made by the Special Rapporteur in his report regarding statelessness, “we are disappointed that this issue is being wrongly and repeatedly linked with the issue of minority rights. Minorities in India enjoy all fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, which are justiciable.Sharma added that the Government of India has ensured the extension of all progressive legislation to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and to resume the pace of socio-economic development. “The residents enjoy more freedom and fundamental rights since all union laws now apply there. Women in particular relish greater rights and freedom than ever before. We strongly object to any attempt to politicise development issues.”                While raking up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan’s delegate started her intervention by saying that “we reject the unwarranted statement delivered by some states to undermine China’s independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty.“We commend China’s model of inclusive development, social protection, equal treatment and protection of ethnic and religious minorities.”     Human Rights Watch noted that at the Third Committee, 43 governments from all regional groups strongly condemned the Chinese government’s widespread human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in the resitve province of Xinjiang. Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, said the “global condemnation of China’s horrific rights abuses in Xinjiang should give the Chinese government cause for concern – and Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims reason for hope.                For the first time, all UN regional groups joined in calling for the violations in Xinjiang to stop and UN investigators to get immediate access. UN member states should establish an international commission of inquiry to formally investigate alleged crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and recommend avenues for holding those responsible to account.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-condemns-abuse-of-un-platform-by-pakistan-to-propagate-false-malicious-propaganda-against-it-328129
22-10-2021||New Delhi||States’ power to withhold consent for CBI probe not absolute, Centre tells SC||The power of state governments to give consent for an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation can’t include a right of an omnibus power to pass overarching sweeping directions not to grant consent in any case or to withdraw the consent already granted, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Friday.In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, it opposed the West Bengal Government’s plea challenging the CBI’s decision to register FIRs in relation to offences within the state, despite the state government withdrawing the general consent given to CBI. The Centre contended that the power to withhold consent was not absolute.A Bench led by Justice L Nageswara Rao deferred the hearing on the West Bengal government’s suit filed under Article 131 to November 16.Following a Calcutta High Court order, the CBI has registered several cases of rape and murder against TMC workers and supporters in connection with post-poll violence in West Bengal without the state’s nod.However, the Centre said: “The CBI is entitled to investigate all offences relatable to the entries in List 1, where laws made under those entries create offences. In addition thereto, it is always open to the Superior Courts to direct such permission in select cases where it is found that the State Police would not effectively conduct a fair and impartial investigation”.It said: “As a result, each one of the FIRs would have to be scrutinised separately for tracing it to the law under which the FIR is registered and the Entry in Schedule 7 to which the law relates”.The Centre said: “The CBI is entitled to interrogate/ investigate individuals that are Central Government employees. It is specifically stated that the CBI does not need prior consent from the respective State Government before proceeding to investigate its own employee, irrespective of the fact whether the concerned employee is within the territorial jurisdiction of the CBI to investigate upon or not”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-power-to-withhold-consent-for-cbi-probe-not-absolute-centre-tells-sc-328125
22-10-2021||New Delhi||Successful UPSC aspirants have no right to be allocated cadre, place of service of their choice: SC||A successful civil services aspirant has no right to be allocated a cadre or place of appointment of his choice as a candidate for the All India service he opts for serving anywhere in the country with “eyes wide open,” the Supreme Court Friday said.The historic judgement in the Mandal case was also referred to by the apex court to observe that the candidate belonging to the SC/ST or OBC if found suitable by the UPSC for selection on merits under general category, “shall be appointed against unreserved vacancies”.The observation of the top court came on the appeal of the central government against a verdict of the Kerala High Court, which had asked it to grant home cadre Kerala to A Shainamol, a Muslim woman IAS officer who was posted in Himachal Pradesh.A Bench comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian set aside the verdict of the High Court asking the Centre to grant Kerala cadre to the woman IAS officer.The Bench also held that if a candidate, hailing from reserved Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), or Other Backward Class (OBC) the category does not take benefit of quota and gets selected in the general category then later he or she cannot take recourse of reservation for getting cadre or place of appointment of choice.“The allocation of cadre is not a matter of right. It was held that a selected candidate has a right to be considered for appointment to the IAS but he has no such right to be allocated to a cadre of his choice or his home state. As stated above, allotment of cadre is an incidence of service.”“The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country. Once an applicant gets selected to service, the scramble for the home cadre starts,” Justice Gupta, writing the 36-page judgement for the Bench, said.Referring to the Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, the Bench said the procedure for allocation of cadre is a mechanical process and admits no exception except in terms of the rules.“The State has no discretion of allocation of a cadre at its whims and fancies. Therefore, the Tribunal or the High Court should have refrained from interfering with the allocation of cadre on the argument of the alleged violation of the allocation circular,” the top court said.Shainamol secured 20th ranking in the UPSC civil services examination in 2006 and she despite belonging to the Muslim OBC category was selected under the general category and was allocated Himachal Pradesh cadre after the Centre sought consent of the Himachal Pradesh government on November 13, 2007.She then moved the Ernakulam Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal, which directed the Centre to allot and accommodate her against “the outsider OBC vacancy in the Maharashtra cadre by virtue of her merit over the candidate already identified and allotted the Maharashtra cadre”.                Both the Centre and the IAS officer challenged the verdict in the Kerala High Court, which allowed the plea of the government challenging the direction of the Tribunal to accommodate the IAS officer in the Maharashtra cadre was allowed.However, the high court also allowed the plea of the IAS officer seeking the declaration that she was eligible to be allotted the Kerala cadre.The top court allowed the Centre’s appeal saying “The applicant though belonging to OBC has not availed any relaxations or concessions admissible to OBC candidates. She was a general merit candidate, thus not entitled to OBC reserved seat in her State. She was allocated to Himachal Pradesh cadre as a general category candidate falling in Rule 7(3) in view of her merit position as a general category candidate.” The Bench examined the question of whether consultation in respect of allocation of cadre is required to be done with the state from which the candidate belongs or with the state to which the candidate is being allocated.“The entire basis of the claim of the applicant is that there was no consultation with the State of Kerala. The said argument is however untenable. The applicant was allocated to the State of Himachal Pradesh and there was consent duly given by the State of Himachal Pradesh for her allocation to that State. In fact, no consultation was required to be carried out in respect of the applicant with Kerala State,” it held. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/successful-upsc-aspirants-have-no-right-to-be-allocated-cadre-place-of-service-of-their-choice-sc-328120
22-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi expected to attend inaugural session of Glasgow climate meet||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 22Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the inaugural session of the upcoming climate summit in Glasgow—COP26. His exact itinerary and India’s pitch for the crucial climate summit is expected to be approved at a Cabinet meeting scheduled next week, functionaries of the Environment Ministry said today.India is expected to specify its INDC pitch, which includes approximately 450-Gigawatt renewable energy by 2030, and other mitigation efforts. According to its long-held stance, the country will also pitch for the $100 billion per year climate financing by developed nations in Glasgow, they said.The upcoming COP26 summit (October 31 to November 12) is critical, especially with no certainty over whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend. There is tremendous pressure on developing nations like India to revise ‘nationally determined commitments’ (NDCs) and cut off coal/fossil fuels, and declare a net zero target.However, according to officials, India is doing what is required to help tackle climate change. Its per capita carbon emissions per year is 1.96 tonnes “which is far less as compared to what developed nations continue to emit”. Besides, “what is happening today is due to historic actions of developed nations”, they say, adding that “fossil fuels are essential for its growth plans and targets”.India is not against enhanced targets for renewable energy and investment in several new age green fuel technologies, but we cannot commit to phasing out coal, they addAsserting that India stands firm on its stated stance of “historical responsibilities” of developed nations, officials said negotiators will move to establish a mechanism for loss and damage due to climate change related events, compensating regions most vulnerable and help them prevent and manage mishaps in future. India has the support of 24 like-minded developing countries (LMDCs), including island nations, which are most vulnerable to climate eventsFunctionaries said India is willing to contribute to any fund set up to compensate for the ‘loss and damage’ caused by extreme climate events, the main responsibility lies with developed nations, the historic polluters, according to “polluter pays principle”.Besides India’s per capita carbon emissions per year are just 1.96 tonnes compared to China’s 8.4 tonnes, the USA’s 18.6 tonnes, EU’s 7.16 tonnes and the world average of 6.64 tonnes.The Indian team of negotiators will include representatives of the several ministries, including of course the Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Power, New and Renewable Energy, Finance, Agriculture and Earth Sciences.The chief negotiator is expected to be Additional Secretary Richa Sharma.There is tremendous pressure on India to update its NDCs declared in the Paris climate summit in 2015. The Glasgow summit aims to review and amend promises by countries and companies worldwide to contribute to mitigation efforts. Glasgow should be a COP of action and implementation: Bhupender YadavMeanwhile, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav today assured India’s full support to the UK COP Presidency for the meaningful outcome of COP26. He said the upcoming climate summit should be of “action and implementation”.Yadav had a bilateral with Elizabeth Truss, UK Foreign Minister, where the two sides discussed crucial issues, including UK’s COP26 initiatives, India UK Roadmap-bilateral cooperation, Commonwealth Declaration on Climate Change.Yadav said that the huge expectations from COP26, including a consensus on unresolved issues of the Paris Agreement Rule Book, long-term climate finance, market-based mechanisms, etc.Stressing that COP26 should also initiate the process of setting the long-term climate finance for the post-2025 period, Yadav said India welcomes the UK COP26 Presidency’s five key initiatives on sustainable land use, energy transition, low emission vehicle transition, climate finance, and adaptation.Both sides also underlined the need for strengthening bilateral partnership and collaboration to facilitate the collective R&D of cutting-edge technologies and the transfer of proven technologies to drive low carbon pathways.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-expected-to-attend-inaugural-session-of-glasgow-climate-meet-328117
22-10-2021||Mumbai||Court cites messages recovered from Armaan Kohli’s phone while denying bail in drugs case||Chats, messages, and videos recovered from actor Armaan Kolhi’s mobile phone indicate on the face of it that he was involved in illicit drug trafficking, a special court has said while rejecting his bail application.The special judge for cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, AA Jogelkar, rejected the actor’s bail plea on October 14. The detailed order became available on Friday.Kohli was arrested in the last week of August. According to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), 1.2 grams of MD was recovered from Kohli’s house, while bigger quantities of drugs were recovered from the co-accused in the case.The court held that after examining the material obtained during the probe, “prima-facie” it seemed that Kohli was “well-connected with the co-accused pertaining to the illicit trafficking of drugs”. Special prosecutor Advait Sethna had submitted chats/messages between Kohli and the co-accused along with their bank statements before the court.The judge noted that bank transactions corroborated alleged transactions (revealed from the chats).Kohli failed to explain the purpose of contraband recovered from his house and the financial transactions, the court said.“Contents in the chats and videos also propagate for the indulgence of the applicant in illicit trafficking prima-facie and therefore the prosecution seems to have invoked section 27A (of the NDPS Act) against the applicant/accused,” the judge said.Section 27 (A) is about punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders.The investigation was at a nascent stage, the court observed while rejecting the bail plea.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-cites-messages-recovered-from-armaan-kohlis-phone-while-denying-bail-in-drugs-case-328113
22-10-2021||New Delhi||SC directs Centre to issue order for grant of PC in seven days to 39 women officers in Army||In a relief to some Women Short Service Commission Officers (WSSCO) in the Army, the Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to issue orders granting Permanent Commission (PC) to 39 such officers in seven working days and furnish the details of 25 officers with reasons, who were not considered.The Centre informed the top court that after re-examining the case of each 72 women SSC officers, one officer has decided to quit, 39 officers can be considered for PC, seven have been found medically unfit and 25 officers cannot be granted PC as they have adverse ACR report of indiscipline and disobedience and poor operational report.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said that in respect of the officers forming part of the group of 36 WSSCOs who have filed four contempt petitions in the top court and are not found eligible for grant of PC, the Centre shall file statements in a tabulated form giving the reasons for each of the officers not found eligible or are denied PC.                   “In the above facts, we are of the view that ends of justice would be met, if to begin with, orders for the grant of PC are issued for all the 39 officers, in terms of the statement which have been made before this court by the ASG Sanjay Jain within a period of one seven working days from today. Compliance shall be scrupulously ensured within seven working days,” it said.The Centre has earlier told the top court that all these 72 WSSCOs have been found unfit for grant of permanent commission in the Army.The top court said that once there is a final order or judgement of this court dated March 25, 2021, the consideration for the grant of PC has to be confined to specific directions issued by this court.“An affidavit shall be filed on behalf of the respondents (Centre and Army) before the next date of listing, expressly stating that no reasons independent of the directions which have issued by this court have weighed for the grant or the case may be the refusal of PC to the 72 officers concerned”, it said. At the outset, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian stated that they have re-examined the case of 72 WSSCOs in compliance with the direction of this court and has found 38 officers eligible for grant of PC and a case of one officer is pending consideration, which in all probability will be considered for PC.Jain said that besides the 39 WSSCOs of the 72 officers, one officer has decided to quit while seven officers have been found medically unfit and 25 officers have been denied PC on disciplinary grounds, disobedience, and weak operational report.“The ASG has submitted that in respect of these (25) officers, they are not found to be eligible on disciplinary grounds and in certain cases on other issues such as integrity, or disobedience of lawful orders and weak operational reports. Moreover, it has been submitted that male counterparts of these officers have been denied PC on similar grounds”, the bench noted.The top court said that after the exercise of the grant of PC is completed, it would be necessary for the Centre to apprise the court of the ground which has resulted in the denial of PC to the remaining officers in the contempt proceedings. “The ASG has stated that a chart officer wise in respect of those officers who have been found not to be eligible for grant of PC will be placed before this court. Thereafter, the court if so consider appropriate may share the tabulation with the counsel for the applicants in which event they may pursue their remedies in accordance with law,” it said in its order.The top court listed the matter for further hearing after Diwali vacation.On October 8, the top court had given one last opportunity to the Centre to resolve the issue of grant of PC to 72 WSSCOs in the Army and said it should be concerning its order of March 25 this year, and thereafter it will close the contempt case filed by the women officers.It had asked Jain and Balasubramanian to personally look into the issue saying the court’s order was clear that if the women officers have got 60 per cent marks and have cleared medical fitness tests and got clearances of vigilance and disciplinary, they need to be considered. On October 1, the top court had restrained the Army from discharging the 72 WSSCOs, who were not considered for PC, till further orders and had sought a reply within a week on why they were not considered for the service.The women officers have alleged that the top court’s March 25 ruling was not considered by the Army and all 72 of them were rejected from consideration for the PC at one go.In its March 25 verdict, the Army was directed by the top court to consider granting PC to the WSSCOs subject to their obtaining 60 per cent marks in the assessment subjects, being found fit on medical criteria as per the August 1, 2020, order of the Army and having received disciplinary and vigilance clearances.On February 17 last year, in a landmark verdict, the top court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted a permanent commission, rejecting the Centre’s stand of their physiological limitations as being based on “sex stereotypes” and “gender discrimination against women”.The apex court had directed that within three months, all serving SSC women officers have to be considered for PCs irrespective of them having crossed 14 years or, as the case may be, 20 years of service.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-directs-centre-to-issue-order-for-grant-of-pc-in-seven-days-to-39-women-officers-in-army-328109

A large number of users posted a muted video of the incident on social media.But later many of the users deleted the video after the Police said it was the handiwork of some youth from the same community.Ghaziabad Police said the video was shared to incite communal violence. They had on June 21 issued notice to Maheshwari – who lives in Bengaluru—and asked him to report at Loni Border Police Station at 11.30 am on June 24 for recording of his statement but he didn’t turn up. Later, the Karnataka HC gave him protection from arrest.Loni Border Police, Ghaziabad lodged an FIR against Rana Ayyub and four others on June 15 under Sections 153, 153A, 295A, 505 and 120B of IPC for sharing the video without verifying its authenticity.

22-10-2021||New Delhi||If govt does not want tribunals, then abolish Consumer Protection Act: Supreme Court||Expressing displeasure over delay in appointments in the Districts and State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, the Supreme Court on Friday said if the government does not want the tribunals then it should abolish the Consumer Protection Act.A Bench comprising Justices S K Kaul and M M Sundresh said it is unfortunate that the top court is being called upon to examine and see that vacancies in tribunals are filled up.“If the government does not want the tribunals then abolish the Act... We are stretching our jurisdiction to see the vacancies are filled in. Normally we should not spend time on this and the posts should be filled. Unfortunately, the judiciary is called upon to see that these posts are manned. This is not a very happy situation,” the bench said.The top court was hearing a suo motu case on the inaction of the governments in appointing president and members/staff of Districts and State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and inadequate infrastructure across India. The apex court in its order directed that the process of filling up vacancies in the State Consumer Commissions as per its earlier directions must not be impeded by the judgment of the Bombay High Court which had quashed certain Consumer Protection Rules.As the hearing commenced, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appointed as amicus curiae in the case, apprised the court about judgement passed by the Bombay High Court at Nagpur Bench quashing certain Consumer Protection Rules.He said the Centre introduced the Tribunal Reforms Act in violation of the apex court judgement in the Madras Bar Association case.Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for the Centre, said the government is in the process of filing an appeal against the Bombay high court order which quashed certain provisions of Consumer Protection Rules.He told the bench that the Tribunal Reforms Act introduced by the Centre was not in contravention rather it was in consonance with the Madras Bar Association judgement of the apex court.The top court, however, remarked, “It seems that the bench says something and you do something else and some kind of embargo is being created and in this process, the citizens of the country are suffering.“These are places for remedy like consumer forums. These are small issues that people deal with and these are not high stake matters. The very purpose of setting up these tribunals to provide consumer remedy is not being met,” the bench remarked.The ASG submitted that there is no breach of the judgement of the top court and principles of Madras Bar have been duly incorporated.“The government is not making this an ego issue here in the supreme court or dragging its feet regarding the appointments,” he said.The top court, however, said We don’t want to comment but this does not paint a happy picture.”          The apex court also directed the states to submit data in a prescribed form within one week failing which the concerned secretary has to remain present before it.As the hearing ended, Justice Sundresh said there is a need to look at the problem from a different perspective and permanent consumer courts should replace consumer commissions which are manned by retired judicial officers on an ad-hoc basis.“We need to have a permanent structure like the permanent court. The time has come for us to have a permanent court for consumer court and have judges as we select it for district and higher judiciary.“We need to look at it from a different perspective. We have to rethink if we go on with an ad hoc continuance of members for 5 years etc,” Justice Sundresh said.The judge said, “What is the point of having a retired judicial officer?“What is the motivation level for him and what will be his mindset? How do you fix accountability? Is it required for the development of the institution,” the judge said.The top court had in January said that Consumer rights are “important rights” and non-manning of posts and inadequate infrastructure in the district and state consumer commissions across the country would deprive the citizens of redressal of their grievances.The top court had appointed senior advocate Gopal Shankaranarayan and lawyer Aaditya Narain as amicus curiae to assist it in the matter.

22-10-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi misleading country on vaccinations: Congress||The Congress on Friday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing him of misleading the country on vaccinations when only 21 per cent of the country’s population was fully vaccinated.Also read: No matter how strong the shield, can’t lay weapons till Covid war is on, PM urges caution during festivitiesThe Opposition party asked the Prime Minister to bring out a white paper on how his government intends to vaccinate all adults by year-end, a promise made by him earlier.Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh also alleged that the Prime Minister, in his address to the nation on Friday, did not talk about issues of inflation and terrorism confronting the country.He said that instead of offering condolences to the families of 4.53 lakh people who lost their lives due to the coronavirus, the Prime Minister is celebrating.“The Prime Minister should talk about the issues confronting the nation, but instead he is celebrating ‘Mahotsava’. The PM touched issues in a wrong manner and shared wrong data while trying to mislead the country,” he told reporters.Vallabh also alleged that “the PM gave the data which is semi-baked, as half-truth is very dangerous.”    The Congress leader said there are only two countries having more than 50 crore population and the claim that India is the first country to achieve 100-crore plus vaccinations is “false” as China had achieved 216 crore doses of vaccinations in September.He said China has double vaccinated 80 per cent of its population, while India has only vaccinated 20 per cent of the population.“We would like to ask the prime minister that it would have been nice if he had shared when we are going to start vaccinations for our school-going and college-going students. It would have been good if the PM answered when his promise of the entire population would be fulfilled by December 31, 2021.“Please share a white paper on how we are going to receive 106 crore vaccines in the next 70 days to vaccinate our entire adult population,” Vallabh said.He said that “we thought he would talk about inflation because from January 1 till date there is a hike in (price of) diesel by 29 per cent and petrol by 27 per cent.”  “Is there anybody on this earth except the prime minister’s few friends whose income level has increased in last nine months by 29 per cent,” he asked.“We were expecting you to speak on the issue when innocents were killed in Jammu and Kashmir, including 32 persons murdered in the last two weeks and nine soldiers gave supreme sacrifice saving our motherland. But the prime minister does not have time for any of such things.“We were expecting that the prime minister would offer condolences to the families of people who lost their lives due to coronavirus. He has no time for them and instead he is celebrating Mohatsavs,” Vallabh said.When 4.53 lakh people died due to COVID-19, the government was busy in celebrating Mohatsavs and the prime minister had words to offer to those who died, he also alleged.“When the PM addresses the nation, people expect that the prime minister will speak on something that is of their use, which affects their lives like inflation and terrorism. We expected you would offer condolences to the deceased families, but you did not do that,” he said.A day after India crossed the milestone of 100 crore Covid vaccine doses, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the country’s vaccination programme was “science-born, science-driven and science-based”, and asserted that it had been ensured there was no “VIP culture” in the drive.In an address to the nation, the prime minister said there is confidence in the country today. From various strata of society to the economy, at every level and everywhere, there is “optimism, optimism and optimism”, he said while also emphasising that people should not drop their guard during the festive season and continue with Covid appropriate behaviour such as masks.

Some miscreants have slightly damaged the car, but police did not find any visible injury. An investigation is on”, Das told PTI.Soon after the incident TMC  national general secretary, Abhishek Banerjee tweeted, “Under @BJPBiplab’s #Duaregoondaraj, attack on political opponent is setting new records!  “Physically manhandling a sitting female Rajyasabha MP, @SushmitaDevAITC is BEYOND SHAMEFUL AND POLITICAL TERRORISM by @BJP 4Tripura goons!

22-10-2021||New Delhi||Court denies bail to Sharjeel Imam in sedition case||A Delhi court on Friday denied bail to JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a sedition case lodged against him for allegedly delivering an inflammatory speech and inciting violence during the CAA-NRC protests in 2019, saying free speech cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony.Imam on December 13, 2019, had allegedly delivered a provocative speech, which, according to the police, resulted in riots two days later when a mob consisting of over 3,000 people attacked police personnel and torched several vehicles in the Jamia Nagar area in south Delhi.Rejecting his bail plea, Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Agrawal, however noted that the evidence in support of the allegations that the rioters got instigated by Imam’s speech and thereafter indulged in the acts of rioting, mischief, attacking the police party, was scanty and sketchy.The judge in his order said that cursory and plain reading of the speech showed that it was clearly on communal lines. “The tone and tenor of the incendiary speech tend to have a debilitating effect upon public tranquility, peace, and harmony of the society,” the judge said adding that “it is no gainsaying that fundamental right of ‘freedom of speech and expression’ cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony of the society”. The Delhi Police claimed that Imam instigated a “particular religious community” against the Central Government by creating unfounded fears in their minds regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).The court highlighted a portion of Imam’s alleged inflammatory speech in the order copy while rejecting his bail. While maintaining that the evidence in support of the allegations that the rioters got instigated by Imam’s speech was scanty and sketchy, the court said “neither any eye witness has been cited by prosecution nor there is any other evidence on record to suggest that co-accused got instigated and committed the alleged act of rioting upon hearing the speech of Sharjeel Imam.”  Further, the court said there is no evidence corroborating the version of prosecution that alleged rioters were a part of the audience addressed by Imam on December 13, 2019.It said that the essential link between the speech dated and the subsequent acts is conspicuously missing.The court said that the theory as propounded by investigating agency left gaping holes which leaves an incomplete picture unless the gaps are filled by resorting to surmises and conjectures or by essentially relying upon the disclosure statement of Iman and co-accused, he added.“Once the legally impermissible foundation of imaginative thinking and disclosure statement of accused is removed, the prosecution version on this count appears to be crumbling like a house of cards,” the court observed.While noting that the fundamental right of ‘freedom of speech and expression’ cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony, the judge quoted British poet and intellect, John Milton, as saying, “give me the liberty to know, to argue freely, and to utter according to conscience, above all liberties”. The judge also quoted spiritual leader Swami Vivekanand in the bail order as saying, “We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think; Words are secondary; Thoughts live; they travel far”.During the hearing on Imam’s bail, Special Public Prosecutor had told the court that Imam’s speech on December 13, 2019, was seditious, evidently on divisive lines, and tended to hamper social harmony.Imam, through his counsel Ahmad Ibrahim, said he is a peace-loving citizen and never participated in violence during any protest.He argued that no speech, much less the speech dated December 13, was aimed at spreading any disaffection against the government established by law or inciting violence or ill-will against any community.Besides this case, Imam is also accused of being the “mastermind” of the February 2020 riots, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-denies-bail-to-sharjeel-imam-in-sedition-case-328082

22-10-2021||Mexico City||Woman from India among 2 foreigners killed in shootout in Mexico’s Tulum resort||Two foreigners, including one from India, were killed and three wounded in a shooting at a restaurant in the Mexican Caribbean resort town of Tulum, authorities said on Thursday.Authorities said one of the dead women was from Germany and the other from India. The three wounded included two Germans and a tourist from the Netherlands.The shooting broke out on Wednesday night at a street-side eatery that has some outdoor tables, right off Tulum's main strip.The fight was between two groups that operate street-level drug sales in the area, the Quintana Roo state prosecutor's office said in a statement. The tourists were apparently dining at the restaurant and may have been caught in the crossfire.One woman died at the scene and the other in a hospital. One of the aggressors, who was also wounded, was subsequently arrested. There was no immediate word on the condition of the wounded tourists.Tulum has experienced growing pains moving from laid-back beach retreat to major international destination. It had long been spared the violence seen sporadically in larger Cancun and Playa del Carmen farther up the coast.But in June, two men were shot to death on the beach in Tulum and a third was wounded.The administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pinned its hopes on Tulum, where it has announced plans to build an international airport and a stop for the Maya train, which will run in a loop around the Yucatan peninsula.But Quintana Roo state, where beach resorts like Tulum, Playa del Carmen and Cancun are located, has been plagued by both violence and corruption.

She wants people with an unblemished record to be encouraged.In a meeting with senior party leaders in Lucknow about a week ago, she made it known that she would personally interview the applicants. She has directed that a schedule for her proposed tours be drawn up. The exercise for it has been started at various rungs of the party organisation.She is tipped to start the tours from eastern UP.The finalisation of candidates for about 80 assembly seats in Western UP region, which has been impacted by the farmers' agitation against the three central agro laws, will be done last. Besides the winnability quotient of the applicants, their commitment to ideology of Bahujan movement and nature of  association with the BSP would be factored in while deciding their cases.The BSP considers the coming assembly elections in UP as crucial. It has embarked on a mission of social engineering of Dalit-Brahmin alliance. The formula had helped it come to power on its own in 2007. The results in the assembly elections in UP will determine the party's status in future.Poor showing could also spell disaster and existential crisis with ruling BJP making extra effort to win over the Dalits, and Congress making efforts to revive through Priyanka Gandhi.Except for Punjab where the BSP has formed an electoral alliance with the Badals-led Shiromani Akali Dal, the BSP will contest the assembly elections in five other states, including UP, alone.Sources said Mayawati had taken note of the increased activism of its rivals in UP, especially the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.She has asked party men not to be distracted by the "gimmicks" of the rival parties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-begins-process-to-finalise-candidates-for-up-assembly-election-328058

Now, even the minister will not need it as the people will make him 'paidal' (out of power). The truth is that 95 per cent of the people do not need the BJP," Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi.The SP president also asked, "Does Thar need diesel?", referring to the recent Lakhimpur Kheri incident where four farmers were allegedly mowed down by a jeep (Mahindra Thar) driven by BJP workers.While talking to reporters in Jalaun when asked about rising prices of petrol and diesel, Tiwari had said, "Today, there are just a handful of people who travel in four-wheel vehicles and use petrol. At present, 95 per cent people don't need petrol." "If you compare with per capita income, the prices of petrol and diesel have not increased much. Today, the opposition parties have no issues with them. You see data before 2014. What is the per capita income after the formation of the Modi and the Adityanath governments? Today, per capita income has doubled," he had said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/95-per-cent-people-dont-need-bjp-akhilesh-yadav-hits-back-at-up-minister-328055

And that trust is increasing. And that's very important in the number of partnerships which we share,” said Sandhu, who has been making special efforts with his Congressional outreach.As close aides of lawmakers both in the House and the Senate, Congressional staffers, a number of whom are of Indian-origin, play a key role in shaping the policies and legislative agenda of the US Congress.Many of them in the years to come climb up the ladder to even serve in presidential administration.India, Sandhu asserted, plays a significant role in affordable health care, affordable medicines and vaccines.“I'll just give you one example. Six years ago, both the US and India collaborated for a vaccine. We partnered in bulk production of a vaccine for another virus called RotaVirus. That collaboration got the cost of a single dose down from USD 60 to USD 1. That is the kind of depth that is there,” he said.Reiterating that there is a huge potential between India and the US in the health care sector, Sandhu also referred to the cooperation in energy, climate change and renewables.Knowledge partnership and education sector is another key area of collaboration between the two countries, he said.

What an achievement!” Senator Steve Daines from Montana said.Congresswoman Robin Kelly said India had now administered more than one billion doses of the lifesaving Covid vaccine.“This is a promising milestone. Vaccination rates across the world are an important factor in our global recovery from this pandemic,” she said.The New York Times said the billion-dose milestone represented a turnaround in a vaccination drive that got off to a slow start, as India's governing party prioritised elections and took up a lax attitude in tackling the virus, continuing to hold crowded political rallies and allowing religious festivals to take place even as cases surged.Wishes also poured in for India from the World Health Organisation and the leadership of Israel, Bhutan and Sri Lanka along with other countries, after it scripted history on Thursday with the cumulative Covid vaccine doses administered in the country surpassing the 100-crore milestone.

22-10-2021||Washington||India among select few countries developing hypersonic missiles, says US Congressional report||India is among the select few countries which are developing hypersonic weapons, an independent Congressional report has said, amidst a media report which claimed that China recently tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile which circled the globe before missing its target, demonstrating an advanced space capability that caught US intelligence by surprise.The independent Congressional Research Service (CRS), in a latest report this week, said although the US, Russia and China possess the most advanced hypersonic weapons programmes, a number of other countries, including Australia, India, France, Germany and Japan, are also developing hypersonic weapons technology.While Australia has collaborated with the US, India has collaborated with Russia on this, the CRS said in its report.India has collaborated with Russia on the development of BrahMos II, a Mach 7 hypersonic cruise missile, the CRS report said.“Although BrahMos II was initially intended to be fielded in 2017, news reports indicate that the programme faces significant delays and is now scheduled to achieve initial operational capability between 2025 and 2028.“Reportedly, India is also developing an indigenous, dual-capable hypersonic cruise missile as part of its Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle programme and successfully tested a Mach 6 scramjet in June 2019 and September 2020,” the CRS said.India operates approximately 12 hypersonic wind tunnels and is capable of testing speeds of up to Mach 13, said the Congressional report which is prepared by independent subject area experts for members of the US Congress.The Financial Times this week reported that China has tested hypersonic missiles. However, China denied it, saying it tested a hypersonic “vehicle” and not a nuclear-capable hypersonic “missile” as reported by the leading British newspaper which also said that the missile missed its target by about two-dozen miles.The report said that China tested the nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August that circled the globe before speeding towards its target, demonstrating an advanced space capability that caught US intelligence by surprise.

22-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Not averse to protest, but roads can’t be blocked indefinitely, says top court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 21The Supreme Court on Thursday gave three weeks to farmers’ bodies to respond to a petition seeking directions to the authorities to end blockades of roads connecting the NCR to the Capital by farmers protesting against agricultural laws.Also read: Barricades put up by Delhi Police, not farmers: BKU after SC order to unblock roadsA Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul — which had on September 30 wondered how highways could be blocked perpetually — posted the matter for further hearing on December 7.“I am not averse to their right to protest even when a legal challenge is pending. But roads can’t be blocked…. Ultimately some solution has to be found,” Justice Kaul noted.“Farmers have the right to protest but they cannot keep roads blocked indefinitely. You may have a right to agitate in any manner but roads should not be blocked like this. People have the right to go on roads,” the Bench, also comprising Justice MM Sundresh, said. Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7 last year ruled that roads and public spaces couldn’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent had to be in designated places alone.On Thursday, it clarified it was not concerned with any of the larger issues and that the only thing it was looking into was that in view of its earlier orders, roads should not be continuously occupied.On behalf of some of the farmers’ bodies, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said the blockades had been caused due to the manner in which police arranged security. He alleged that prevention of their passage to Ramlila Maidan was causing the blockage at the site. Dave demanded that the matter should be sent to a three-judge Bench as the earlier case on the issue had been dealt with by a three-judge Bench.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta objected to Dave’s submission, terming it an attempt to browbeat the Bench.The Bench said after the parties filed their replies, it would decide whether to pass orders or club it with other matters pending before a different Bench.It was hearing a petition filed by Monicca Agarwal — a women resident of Noida – on the issue. Agarwal — a single parent with some medical issues — alleged that due to blockade of roads by the agitating farmers travelling between Noida and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes.Another Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar is dealing with Kisan Mahapanchayat’s plea seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow it to stage ‘satyagraha’ at Jantar Mantar in the Capital.“You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city and start protesting again here… The residents around… are they happy with the protest? This business should stop…. There has to be a balanced approach,” Justice Khanwilkar had told the counsel for Kisan Mahapanchayat on October 1.SKM suspends YadavThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha has suspended Yogendra Yadav for a month after he visited kin of BJP worker Shubham Mishra, who died in Kheri violence. Yadav said: “Grief cannot be partisan.

The Indian side eventually expressed readiness to provide large-scale humanitarian assistance to the Afghans,” said Taliban Deputy Minister Zabiullah Mujahid. There was no Indian readout of the meeting, leading to analysts wondering whether New Delhi’s foremost concerns about terrorism and inclusive government, voiced by PM Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, were also discussed. Analysts noted that both sides are yet to deliver on the demands expressed in the previous official meeting between the Taliban and an Indian diplomat in Doha on August 31. The Taliban are yet to act on their assurance to Indian Ambassador in Qatar Deepak Mittal of providing safe passage to Sikh Afghans.Similarly, there is no word from New Delhi on the request by Taliban’s Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai for reopening commercial flights and facilitating the travel of scholarship students to India.The Taliban team also met the Iranian delegation as well which later expressed its dissatisfaction with the round table.“The third meeting of the Moscow format ended without serious results, which should have been published in the joint statement of the meeting, despite serious and meaningful discussions on regional cooperation for peace, stability and security in Afghanistan. In my opinion, the weakness of the meeting management and the lack of efforts to reach a consensus is the reason for not issuing a joint statement,” said Rasoul Mousavi, senior Iranian diplomat. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-relents-on-afghan-aid-but-wont-recognise-interim-govt-yet-327634

This shows the clear commitment of Pakistan Government. So there was no discussion on blacklisting. The government is cooperating with FATF and we urged it to very quickly address the remaining four items as soon as possible,” he said.No discussion on blacklistingPakistan has already completed 30 out of 34 action points. This shows the clear commitment of Pakistan Government. So there was no discussion on blacklisting. —Marcus Pleyer, FATF chiefPleyer denied it was pressure by India that had led to Pakistan’s retention on the Grey List. “FATF is a technical body and we take our decisions by consensus. It is not one country but 39 jurisdictions and the decision is taken by consensus on a jurisdiction to be put under increased monitoring,” replied Pleyer when asked whether it was India which was instrumental in keeping Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018.In a further blow to Pakistan, Turkey, its closest ally in FATF, was also put on the Grey List along with Jordan and Mali. Pakistan is estimated to have lost over $30 billion in foreign investments since being placed on the Grey List.Since June, FATF has been focusing on Pakistan’s money laundering deficiencies after the Asia Pacific Group found a number of serious issues. On terror financing, Pakistan had addressed all but one of the 27 action points. The revelation of Pandora papers has also led FATF to recommend a sweeping number of changes in which anonymous shell companies are used by criminals and the corrupt.“The same money is often used to facilitate further crime.

You can’t just pull out Rs 8 lakh from thin air... You are making unequals equals by applying the Rs 8 lakh limit,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud told Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, who represented the Centre.Posers to govtAdmitting that fixing eligibility criteria to avail of the EWS quota was a policy matter, the Bench said it was entitled to know the reasons behind a policy decision to determine the constitutional validity of such decisions.While hearing petitions filed by NEET aspirants challenging the Centre’s decision to introduce 27 per cent OBC and 10 per cent EWS reservation in NEET-All India Quota, it sought to know the basis for the Centre notifying the EWS criteria on a uniform basis across the country.“Among OBCs, people (earning) below Rs 8 lakh income also suffer from social and educational backwardness. Under the constitutional scheme, EWS are not socially and educationally backward,” it said.The Bench wanted to know if difference in rural and urban purchasing power had been considered while fixing the income limit; on what basis asset exception had been arrived at; and why residential flat criterion didn’t differentiate between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.Expressing displeasure over the Centre not filing an affidavit on the issue despite several questions raised by it with regard to the EWS eligibility criteria on October 7, it posted the matter for further hearing on October 28.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-sc-questions-centre-on-rs-8-lakh-income-norm-for-ews-327652

The target now is to open it by June 2022, two months ahead of the scheduled deadline of August.The tunnel is coming up on the 329-km Tezpur-Tenga-BomdiLa-Tawang route that leads to the LAC in this sensitive sector in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh. At present, it takes about 12 hours to complete the long-winding route and it often gets blocked due to heavy snow for three-four months during winter.Nowadays, the tunnelling site on the north face of the Sela is buzzing with activity as winter is fast setting in at these heights. The minimum temperature has already reached freezing point. Col Parikshit Mehra, who is overseeing the work on the Rs 700 crore project, told mediapersons from Delhi, “We have set a target to open the tunnel by June 2022. We are using the Austrian technology and doing 100 m of tunnelling every month.”The tunnel under the Sela will provide year-round connectivity and shorten the route by 90 minutes. The BRO had made a new alignment that covers a total distance of 12.04 km, which consists of two tunnels of 1,790 m and 475 m.“During winters, the road is closed and it becomes very difficult for residents of Tawang. Only vehicles with 4x4 drive facility and with chains on tyres are allowed,” Col Mehra added.“Once the tunnel is open, the need for round-the-clock snow clearance and vehicles with chains will not be needed because the tunnel and its approach roads on both sides are under the snow line,” he added. The tunnel has a clearance of 5.5 m allowing all kinds military load to pass through, Col Mehra said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sela-tunnel-launch-advanced-to-june-327656

You may have a right to agitate in any manner but roads should not be blocked like this. People have the right to go on roads but it cannot be blocked,” an apex court Bench of justices SK Kaul and MM Sundresh said.The Bench made the observation while hearing a public interest lawsuit by a Noida resident Monicca Agarwal complaining of delays in daily commute due to the protesting farmers blocking roads.The court has asked farmer unions to respond to the PIL within three weeks.Hundreds of farmers are encamping on the Delhi borders at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 2020, demanding the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee to retain minimum support price for crops.Key roads connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have remained impacted ever since the protests began amid the continued stalemate between the Centre and protesting farmers over the central laws.“We respect the Supreme Court’s directive. We would also like to make it clear that it was the Delhi Police which had set up barricades at the protest site. We also demand that the Delhi Police should remove them now for public welfare,” Saurabh Upadhyay, a BKU spokesperson, told PTI.“Whether Delhi or Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, nowhere have farmers barricaded any roads. Farmers do not have the power to barricade road but police do,” Upadhyay said.On purported images and videos of social media claiming removal of tents at the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (NH-9) in Ghazipur, the BKU office-bearer said such reports were false rumours.“There is nothing like that. We have just removed one tent which was located on a service lane towards Delhi on the flyover on NH 9 above the UP Gate. The barricading put up by Delhi Police still exists on the lane,” he said.“Farmers are going nowhere from the border until the demands are met. The onus of removing barricades is on the police,” he added.Asked if farmers would continue to sit on the expressway, Upadhyay said even the Supreme Court has observed that peaceful protest is a right of citizens. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/barricades-put-up-by-delhi-police-not-farmers-bku-after-sc-order-to-unblock-roads-327596

22-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Farmers have right to protest but they can’t block roads indefinitely: Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 21The Supreme Court on Thursday gave three weeks to farmer bodies to respond to a petition seeking directions to the authorities to end blockades of roads connecting NCR regions to the national capital by farmers protesting against farm laws.A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul - which had on September 30 wondered how highways can be blocked perpetually - posted the matter for December 7.“I am not averse to their right to protest even when a legal challenge is pending. But roads can’t be blocked…Ultimately some solution has to be found,” Justice Kaul noted.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7 last year ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.On Thursday, it clarified it was not concerned with any of the larger issues and that the only thing it was looking into was that in view of its earlier orders roads should not be continuously occupied.On behalf of some of the farmer bodies, senior advocate Dushyant Dave said the blockades had been caused due to the manner in which police arranged security. Dave demanded that the matter should be sent to a three-judge Bench as the earlier case on the issue had been dealt with by a three-judge Bench. I'm asking that the issue should be sent to a three-judge Bench.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta objected to Dave’s submission, terming it an attempt to browbeat the Bench.The Bench said after the parties filed their replies, it would decide whether to pass orders or to club it with other matters pending before a different Bench.It was hearing a petition filed by Monicca Agarwal, a resident of Noida, on the issue. Agarwal, a single parent with some medical issues, alleged that due to blockade of roads by the agitating farmers, travelling between Noida and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes and that it had become a nightmare to commute.Another Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar is dealing with a plea by the Kisan Mahapanchayat seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow it to stage ‘satyagraha’ at Jantar Mantar in the national capital."You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city and start protesting again here…The residents around..are they happy with the protest? This business should stop. You are obstructing security and defence personnel. This was in the media. All this should stop…There has to be a balanced approach,” Justice Khanwilkar had told the counsel for the Kisan Mahapanchayat on October 1.“There is no point in protest once you come to the court challenging the laws,” it had told the farmers’ body.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-have-right-to-protest-but-they-cant-block-roads-indefinitely-supreme-court-327558
