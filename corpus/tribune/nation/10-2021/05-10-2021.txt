India approached the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.After hearing both sides, the Hague-based ICJ issued a verdict in July 2019, asking Pakistan to give India consular access to Jadhav and also ensure review of his conviction.On Tuesday, a three-judge bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, heard the case by the law ministry regarding designating a lawyer for Jadhav.Attorney General for Pakistan Khalid Javed Khan reminded the court that it had passed an order on May 5 asking the authorities to make one more effort to contact India for the appointment of a counsel.He informed the court that the message was conveyed to India but there has been no response so far.Khan also told the court that India wanted consular access to Jadhav in a separate room, but the authorities cannot take the risk of leaving him alone with Indian representatives. “They can cause harm to him even by just shaking hands with him,” he said.He claimed Pakistan was making efforts for a complete implementation on the decision of review and reconsideration of the ICJ, but India was creating hurdles.Khan said due to Indian intransigence, the government had requested the court for the appointment of a counsel. “India wants to appoint a counsel from outside but our law disallows this, and so does India’s in its own territory,” he said.Chief Justice Minallah said that Pakistan wanted to implement the ICJ decision. “Would it not be better to give them another opportunity so they could put forth their reservations before the court,” he observed.The judge asked Khan to convey the message to the Indian government and Jadhav. “Send another reminder to Kulbhushan and the Indian government. If India has any reservations, it may convey them here, or someone from the Indian embassy in Pakistan may convey them. That might bring forth a solution,” the judge said.Later, the court adjourned the hearing of the case for an indefinite period.No progress was made on the review issue as India refused to appoint a local lawyer while demanding Pakistan to let an Indian lawyer represent Jadhav in the court.India has asked Pakistan to address the “shortcomings” in a bill brought out to facilitate reviewing the case of Jadhav, saying the proposed law does not create a mechanism to reconsider it as mandated by the ICJ.India has said the Review and Reconsideration Bill 2020 does not create a mechanism to facilitate effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ and the municipal courts cannot be the arbiter of whether a state has fulfilled its obligations in international law.

Despite that the cases don’t come up for consideration. We are not clear how much time is taken for such bail matters to be listed,” it noted.“In order to facilitate further examination of this problem, a separate suo motu case can be registered before the court for further directions. We direct the Registry to register suo motu proceedings in this regard and place it before the court on November 16. The other petitions listed before us for bail shall be transferred to HC,” the Bench said.There must be a mechanism that if an accused approaches high court, then the bail applications are listed promptly for hearing, it noted.Noting that there may be convicts in custody in life sentence cases, it said in such cases when 50 per cent of sentence was undergone it can be the basis of grant of bail.Giving four weeks to the High Court to place before it a policy in this regard, the Bench said, “We would not like to retain consideration of all matters pending before us.” The current bail applications pending before it should promptly placed before the high court for hearing, it added.Noting that there may be convicts who may not have requisite access to legal advice for moving bail applications, the Bench said the high court thus must explore all such cases where convicts having undergone a sentence of eight years can be considered for grant of bail. It also asked the HC to place before it how such cases would be taken up for consideration of grant of bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-83-lakh-criminal-appeals-pending-in-allahabad-high-court-sc-to-lay-down-guidelines-to-deal-with-it-320550

05-10-2021||New Delhi||Regulation of medical education has become business, tragedy of nation: SC||The medical profession and education have become a business and now the regulation of medical education has also gone that way which is the nation's tragedy, an anguished Supreme Court said on Tuesday, giving one chance to the Centre to put its “house in order” and take a call on reversing the changes made to the NEET Super Speciality Examination 2021 syllabus.The apex court was not satisfied with the justification given by the Centre, National Board of Examination (NBE) and National Medical Commission (NMC) on making the last minute changes after the notification for examination was issued in July.“This is how botched up our education system has become,” it said.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna in an over two hour hearing gave time to the Centre, NBE and NMC to come up with a solution by Wednesday morning and said it will continue hearing the matter to avoid any prejudice to the young doctors.“This matter is part heard and you can still put your house in order, we will give you time until tomorrow. We will not adjourn the part heard matter now as this will only cause prejudice to the students but we hope better sense prevails. If there is a sense of obduracy, then we are armed with law and they are long enough to reach out to the obduracy. We are giving you one opportunity to reform,” the bench said.The top court was hearing a batch of pleas of 41 Post Graduate doctors and others who have challenged the last minute changes made to the syllabus after the notification for examination was issued on July 23 for the test to be held on November 13 and 14.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, said the court should not get the impression that the last minute change in syllabus was done to fill vacant seats in private colleges and they will try to persuade the court to dispel this notion.“We are getting a strong impression that the medical profession has become a business, medical education has become a business and the regulation of medical education has also become a business. That's the tragedy of the nation,” the bench said.The authorities should show some concern for the students, as these are the students who do not start preparation for these course two or three months in advance but right from the time they join a Postgraduate course, they aspire for a super speciality, which requires years of commitment, it said.The government has to balance out the investment made by the private sector in these medical colleges but it should equally think in the interest of the medical profession and the interest of students, the top court said.“The interest of students must weigh far higher because they are the people who are going to be a torch bearer of providing medical care and it seems perhaps we have forgotten them in the whole process,” it said.The top court said that prior to 2018, 100 per cent questions came from the feeder courses; from 2018 to 2020 there was major modification under which 60 per cent marks were from super specialisation and 40 per cent from the feeder super specialisation courses.“Now what is sought to be done is one hundred per cent questions will be from primary feeder speciality which is general medicines. It is completely overlooking the facts that you are fundamentally changing the examination pattern and you are doing it for an examination announced to be held in November 2021,” it said.The bench added that NBE and NMC are not doing any favour in asking the court to push back the examination by another two months.It told Bhati, “It does not matter as these doctors will join the Super Speciality courses two months later, so long the seats are filled up it does not matter. This shows us the length to which your clients are willing to go to ensure that seats are filled up. Nothing should go vacant”.Bhati said that seats going vacant is not the only consideration that has weighed on experts but it is the comparative opportunity and comparative ease which will be in the larger public interest of the students that has weighed with the experts.The bench said, “So what really happened is this for all specialisation of super speciality, starting from critical care medicines, cardiology, clinical haematology and other courses the specialisation is only going to be and the examination will be on general medicines."The idea is that general medicine has the largest pool, the largest group in PG, so tap and fill up the vacant seats. That seems to be the logic behind this, nothing more and nothing less”.The top court said, “You may have a rationale; we are not saying you may not have a rationale. The question is that all changes, which you have brought has caused serious prejudice to the students. Problem is that you didn't plan for the future. You did not have a vision and all that you do is that just because you have a certain degree of authority you will exercise it in whatever time you want”.The bench asked Bhati and senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for NBE, what was the great hurry to do it for this year as heavens would not have fallen except for the fact that some 500 seats would have remained vacant in some private medical colleges.On September 27, the top court said, “Don't treat young doctors as football in the game of power,” and warned the Centre that it may pass strictures if it is not satisfied with justification for last-minute changes to the syllabus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/regulation-of-medical-education-has-become-business-tragedy-of-nation-sc-320545

They took out the march in solidarity with her and the farmers protesting in Lakhimpur this evening.

05-10-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: BJP wins Gandhinagar and 2 other civic bodies; Cong bags Bhanvad municipality||The ruling BJP on Tuesday retained the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) and won in two other civic bodies in Gujarat, while the Congress took away Bhanvad municipality in Devbhumi-Dwarka district from the saffron party.In the GMC, the BJP established its lead since the beginning of counting at 9 am, and eventually trumped its rivals Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by a huge margin.The GMC poll was being seen as a litmus test for the BJP in the backdrop of its sudden and surprising decision to change the state’s chief minister and the entire cabinet recently, ahead of the state Assembly polls due next year. The party had registered a thumping win in the local bodies polls held in February this year.As per the final tally released by the State Election Commission (SEC), out of total 44 seats in the GMC, the BJP won 41 seats, the Congress-two and the AAP bagged one seat.Counting of votes was also held for three other municipalities - Okha and Bhanvad in Devbhumi-Dwarka district, and Thara municipality of Banaskantha district.As per the final figures released by the SEC after counting of votes, the BJP won 20 out of 24 seats in Thara, while the Congress got only four seats.The BJP retained Okha municipality by winning 34 out of 36 seats, while two seats went to the Congress.However, in a setback to the BJP, the Congress emerged victorious in Bhanvad by winning 16 out of 24 seats. The BJP, which managed to win only eight seats this time, was in power in Bhanvad since 1995.Voting for elections to the GMC and the three other municipalities took place on Sunday. Besides, bypolls to elect representatives on 104 vacant seats of various other local bodies were also held the same day.Of the total 2.8 lakh registered voters in Gandhinagar, 56.24 per cent had exercised their franchise.The voter turnout in Okha and Bhanvad was 55.07 and 62.27 per cent, respectively, while Thara had recorded an impressive 73.55 per cent turnout.In Gandhinagar, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had put in a concerted effort apart from traditional rivals BJP and Congress.A total of 161 candidates contested the GMC poll, with the BJP and Congress fighting in all 44 seats and the AAP in 40 seats.In the 2016 GMC elections, both the Congress and BJP won 16 seats each out of the total 32 seats existing at that time.Both the parties then had equal chances of forming the board through a draw of lots. However, at the last moment, Congress corporator Pravin Patel switched sides and helped the BJP come to power in the civic body.The latest election was originally supposed to be held in April this year, but it was postponed in view of the high number of Covid-19 cases emerging every day at that time. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-bjp-wins-gandhinagar-and-2-other-civic-bodies-cong-bags-bhanvad-municipality-320503

It shows a person bleating in the woods. Hearing the man's call, a goat emerges from the woods and runs towards him. Surprisingly, a baby monkey is clinging to its neck. As they come closer to the man, he offers them berries, which he holds out in his palm.The goat starts eating them one by one.

On being asked a timeline on meeting the need for a mandated 42 squadrons, he said, “We will not be able to do so in the next 10-15 years.”He said the IAF is looking to take up the case of 114 fighter jets. The responses of the Request for Information had been received from foreign original manufacturers for making 114 fighter jets. “We are moving the case further,” he said.“In this project, we are looking at technologies that in future can integrate fifth and sixth generation technologies,” the IAF chief said, adding that it would be a ‘Make in India’ model and Defence Acquisition will decide its manufacturing process.On being asked about the MiG 21, he said, “We have four squadrons of the jet and these will be phased out within four years. We will ensure that the aircraft is serviceable as long as it’s in service.”The IAF plans new inductions over the next few years for some 200 jets – 114 to be made in India for a foreign maker and 83 mark 1A Tejas made by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Deliveries of the Tejas Mark 1A are expected to start by 2024.The IAF chief said the force is committed to the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft or the AMCA. The AMCA is a twin-engine jet being developed by the DRDO.The IAF phaseout plan for the next decade will include phasing out of the fleets of Jaguar, Mirage and the MiG 29.On being asked about the new  air bases of China, the IAF chief said the infrastructure developments on the Chinese side did not impact the IAF operations.He said the S400 air defence missile to be imported from Russia would be inducted this year. The missile can target and bring down multiple air-borne threats directed by the enemy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-two-finger-test-was-conducted-in-alleged-rape-case-in-coimbatore-says-air-chief-marshal-chaudhari-320482

It forms the lower jaw and acts as a receptacle for the lower teeth. It also articulates on either side with the temporal bone, forming the temporo-mandibular joint that comes into play when the jaw is moved for speaking or eating.A 26-year-old patient had lost one half of his mandible due to the most dreaded odontogenic tumour of the jaws called ameloblastoma which had extensively destroyed his lower jaw and was surgically removed a year back. Ameloblastoma is a rare, benign or cancerous tumour. The rehabilitation process also involved implant analogues for subsequent teeth replacement.Colonel Vivek Saxena, head of the maxillofacial surgery unit at Army Dental Centre, who was part of the surgical team and has been associated with the case for the past one year, said that till now the only available options for treating such severe post resection deformities required taking a part of the patient's hip bone (ileum) or the leg (femur) for jaw reconstruction but this caused significant morbidity.“The present treatment modality obviates the need for any additional surgical procedure. Now these patients have a more predictable treatment option available to them with lesser post-operative morbidities," he said. Armed Forces Medical Services in general and the Army Dental Centre in particular have been at the forefront of introducing the latest technology for patient care and with use of CAD and CAM computer-based tools and treatment planning on state-of-the-art software, it has taken a giant leap ahead.According to Lt Gen Sahoo, this facility involves meticulous planning on a high-end virtual platform followed by precision surgery and is being extended to all serving personnel of the armed forces as well as their dependents. He said many similar cases which had lost all hopes of returning to normalcy, both functionally and cosmetically, due to disfiguring surgeries in post-Covid mucormycosis (black fungus) are already in an advanced stage of planning and awaiting rehabilitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rare-surgery-by-army-dentists-gives-hope-to-patients-who-suffered-disfigurement-due-to-black-fungus-during-covid-pandemic-320476

These do not merit a response, as they pertain to matters internal to India,” Amarnath said.India exercised its Right of Reply after Pakistan's envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during the meeting of the General Assembly's First Committee that deals with disarmament and international security issues.Amarnath reiterated that the entire union territory of Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India.“This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” he said in the Right of Reply.“Given its established state practice of hosting, aiding, and actively supporting terrorists, how could one expect any constructive contribution from Pakistan to the First Committee, that deals with important matters of international peace and security,” Amarnath said.With the Pakistani envoy also referring to India's defence arsenal, New Delhi hit back saying that as a “responsible state, India strictly abides by its obligations under international treaties and needs no advice from a country, which has a proven track record of illicit export of nuclear material and technology”.“India's security concerns are not confined to a region and, therefore, India has always approached these issues in a global context,” he said.He said that in contrast to India's constructive approach on disarmament matters, Pakistan has only been “disruptive”.

SC to examine||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 4A day after eight persons, including four farmers, were killed in Lakhimpur, Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court on Monday questioned the rationale behind farmers’ protest against the three farm laws, saying it had already stayed the laws in question.The court asked why the farmers were protesting when the legislations were “not in force at all”. “We have stayed the farm laws. There is nothing to be implemented. What are the farmers protesting about?” said a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar.“No one other than the court can decide the validity of the farm laws. When that is so, and when farmers are in court challenging the laws, why protest on the street? Either choose the court or the road,” it told farmer unions while hearing the Kisan Mahapanchayat’s plea seeking directions to the Centre and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow it to stage “satyagraha” at Jantar Mantar in the Capital.Ordering transfer of petitions against farm laws pending in the Rajasthan High Court to the top court, the Bench asked the Centre to respond to it and posted the matter for further hearing on October 21. It also decided to examine “whether the right to protest is an absolute right and, more so, the writ petitioner having already invoked the legal remedy before the Constitutional Court by filing writ petition can be permitted to urge, much less assert, that they can still resort to protest in respect of the same subject matter which is already sub judice before the court.”As Attorney General KK Venugopal mentioned that an “unfortunate incident” happened at Lakhimpur, Justice Khanwilkar said, “Nobody takes responsibility when such events happen.” This is the third time in less than a week that the top court has pulled up agitating farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/is-protest-allowed-when-matter-is-sub-judice-sc-to-examine-320245

Indications are that over 300 Indians are on the list. The “Pandora Papers” revealed the names of hundreds of top entertainers, sportspersons, serving and retired politicians and businesspersons across the world. Many of those named have either rejected the allegations of misdoings or maintained that their accounts were bonafide. They include Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw who said her husband’s offshore trust was legitimate.The government, nevertheless, will investigate all names appearing in the series of expose and the probe will be monitored by a multi-agency group drawn from the CBDT, ED, RBI and FIU. It will be headed by the CBDT chairman.The government will also proactively engage with foreign jurisdictions to get information about those named. It will also engage with an inter-governmental group that ensures experience sharing to effectively address tax risks associated with such leaks.The government has already enacted the Black Money and Imposition of Tax Act after undisclosed income of over Rs 20,000 crore was detected in the investigations carried out in the Panama and Paradise Papers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/offshore-havens-300-indians-on-pandora-list-320251

PTI“It is very important for consumer protection because builders try to put any number of clauses in the agreement which common people may not be aware of. There should be some uniformity in the agreement. It’s important that this (uniform model builder-buyer agreement) is achieved,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.The Bench issued the notice after senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay, submitted that some states have such model agreement, while some others don’t. To ensure uniformity in such agreements, the Centre should prepare a model builder-buyer agreement, he submitted.Complaining that builders tried to influence the conditions to be incorporated in the agreement, Singh demanded that the Centre should frame the model agreement and direct all states and union territories to implement it.On behalf of a homebuyers’ group, senior advocate Maneka Guruswamy supported the petitioner and sought a model builder-buyer agreement to safeguard consumers’ interests.In his petition filed last year, Upadhyay, an advocate and Delhi BJP leader, sought a direction to all states and UTs to enforce “model builder-buyer agreement” and “model agent-buyer agreement” and to take steps to avoid “mental, physical and financial injury” to homebuyers.He urged the top court to issue necessary directions to compensate homebuyers for losses incurred due to inordinate delays on the part of promoters-builders and to recover their money. Due to deliberate excessive delays in possession, real estate customers are not only suffering mental and financial injury, but also a brazen violation of their right to life and livelihood, Upadhyay submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-for-uniform-builder-buyer-pact-320259

Video clip shows SUV mowing down farmers, Priyanka Gandhi tells PM Punjabi MPs from Canada, UK condemn Lakhimpur Kheri violenceUP cops detain Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder RandhawaMishra has denied that his son Ashish Mishra was present at the time of the incident. “There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. If my son would’ve been there, he wouldn’t have come out alive,” the BJP’s prominent Brahmin face was quoted as saying. However, a purported video of him warning farmers that he would discipline them in “two minutes” is something that the leadership may find difficult to explain.While Mishra’s influence in Kheri earned him a BJP LS ticket in the 2014 elections, ground reports are now suggesting growing anger against him and his party despite a “settlement” between the Uttar Pradesh Government and farmers over Kheri violence. Observers say unless the BJP takes some “visible action” against him, the Lakhimpur deaths have the potential to impact its fortunes in the UP elections, quite like Mandsaur deaths in the 2018 Madhya Pradesh polls.“Even if the BJP takes steps to cool down sentiments, the opposition will do its best to keep the heat on. Farmers constitute a sizable number of UP’s rural population. The saving grace for the BJP and Adityanath is that there is still some time to recover,” says a political observer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-violence-problems-mount-for-yogi-govt-320260
05-10-2021||Mumbai||Drugs case: Whatsapp chats, code names to be probed, NCB to court as Aryan Khan's custody extended||A local court on Monday extended till October 7 the NCB remand of Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, and two others in connection with the seizure of banned drugs from a cruise ship off the city coast, observing their further interrogation was required for investigation which is of prime importance. The trio was produced before the court after the end of their one-day custody given to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday. The NCB had arrested them after raiding the Goa-bound ship. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate RM Nerlikar also remanded to NCB custody till October 7, the six other accused who were arrested in the case late Sunday night and produced in the court on Monday.The court, in its order, noted that the investigation in the case was of prime importance and considering this aspect, the further presence of the accused before the NCB was necessary.“The fact is that the co-accused in the case were found in possession of intermediate drugs and these three accused (Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha) were accompanying them.""Investigation is of prime importance and presence of the accused is needed for detailed investigation. It is useful for both the prosecution and the accused to prove their innocence,” the court said.Aryan Khan (23) and the two others—Munmun Dhamecha and Arbaaz Merchant—were arrested on Sunday evening and produced before a special holiday court on Sunday that remanded them to NCB custody till Monday. Six others—Nupur Satija, Ishmeet Chadha, Mohak Jaiswal, Gomit Chopra, Vikrant Chhokar, and a drug supplier from suburban Juhu (name not disclosed)—were arrested later. The court, while remanding them to NCB custody, noted that prima facie, a case has been made out against them and hence their interrogation is required. The NCB on Monday sought further custody of Aryan Khan, Merchant, and Dhamecha till October 11 on the ground the central agency had to unearth the nexus between drug consumers and suppliers, and confront all the arrested accused with each other and apprehend other suppliers of narcotics substances.However, the court extended their custody only till October 7.Opposing extension of custody sought by the NCB, Aryan Khan's advocate Satish Maneshinde argued that his client had no criminal antecedents.Aryan Khan had shown good conduct by not running away from NCB officers when the raid was being conducted and allowed them to search him, the advocate argued.Maneshinde claimed no drugs were recovered from Aryan Khan's possession.Aryan Khan and the other accused were detained late on Saturday night by NCB sleuths after they raided the cruise ship which was on its way to Goa from Mumbai.The magistrate on Monday sought to know from the NCB how much drug seizure was made from each of the accused.To this, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the NCB, said six grams of charas was seized from Merchant, while five grams of the cannabis was recovered from Dhamecha.All these are considered "small quantity" under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).“From the other accused, we recovered five grams of MDMA (a stimulant drug). Ten grams of cocaine were recovered from Vikrant Chhokar, 14 MDMA pills from Ishmeet Singh, four pills of MDMA, and 3 grams of cocaine from Gomit Chopra, and four MDMA pills from Nupur Satija. No recovery was made from Mohak Jaiswal, but he had provided the MDMA pills to Nupur Satija,” Singh told the court.Singh told the court that incriminating material was found through WhatsApp chats of the arrested accused, including Aryan Khan, with drug peddlers and suppliers.“Raids are going on now. Shocking and incriminating material recovered in WhatsApp chats of the accused shows international drug trafficking,” the NCB counsel argued.“Accused Aryan Khan, in the WhatsApp chats, is discussing modes of payment to be done for procurement (of drugs). Several code names are being used. All the accused persons have to be confronted with each other. The international transactions need to be investigated,” he said.Singh said the NCB has arrested a supplier from suburban Juhu and found a commercial quantity of drugs from him.Singh said while the sections under which the accused have been booked are bailable, the court has to consider the purpose of the NDPS Act, which is to remove the drug menace from the society, while hearing remand applications or granting bail.“One cannot say that just because he or she is found with a small quantity, they are entitled to bail. Consuming drugs has nowadays become very common with even college-going kids consuming them. The accused here are high profile persons who are considered as role models by regular persons,” the NCB counsel argued.Maneshinde argued his client Aryan Khan was invited to the cruise along with his friend Merchant and that he had not paid any money to get on the ship.“Nothing incriminating was recovered from Aryan Khan except his mobile phone. His friend (Merchant) was arrested because he had six grams of charas, but that has nothing to do with my client (Aryan Khan),” Maneshinde argued.He refuted the NCB claims that Aryan Khan had consumed drugs even when he was abroad. “During the entire period of his (Aryan) stay abroad, he has not been involved in any trafficking, supply or distribution of drugs,” Maneshinde said.Aryan Khan, Dhamecha, and Merchant have been booked under sections 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell or purchase of drugs), 20(b) (punishment for contravention of cannabis), 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotics or drugs) read with 35 of the NDPS.Under the Act, possession of up to one kg is termed "small quantity" of cannabis, while a seizure of over 20 kg is considered a "commercial quantity". For charas/hashish, the Act says small quantity is up to 100 gm while commercial quantity is one kg or more.As per the arrest memo of the NCB, a seizure of 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of MD, 21 grams of charas, and 22 pills of ecstasy, and Rs 1.33 lakh in cash was made after the raid on the ship.Advocate Taraq Sayed, appearing for accused Merchant, argued that there is no clarity of how much quantity of drugs was allegedly recovered from each of the accused and that the NCB was seeking custody only on the basis of some chats recovered from WhatsApp.“The remand note of the NCB is misleading. If only six grams of charas was recovered from Merchant, why is he being charged for the other drugs seized? The two boys (Aryan Khan and Merchant) have been arrested only because they are high-profile persons,” Sayed argued.The NCB, in its remand note against the five others arrested on Sunday night, said it had seized 2.5 grams of ecstasy, 54.3 grams of mephedrone (MD) and two grams of charas from them.The court was informed that five of the arrested accused—Ishmeet Chadha, Mohak Jaiswal, Gomit Chopra, and Vikrant Chhokar—have also been booked under section 27A of the NDPS Act. This section pertains to punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drugs-case-whatsapp-chats-code-names-to-be-probed-ncb-to-court-as-aryan-khans-custody-extended-320071

05-10-2021||---||Don't see 3rd Covid-19 wave coming: BMC tells Bombay HC||Mumbai, October 4The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation told the Bombay High Court on Monday that it does not apprehend a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city as the vaccination drive is going on smoothly, with over 42 lakh people fully vaccinated and over 82 lakh people having received the first dose.BMC counsel Anil Sakhare also told the high court that 2,586 bed-ridden people have so far been administered both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine while 3,942 such people have got the first jab.“The work is on. It is going on smoothly. Now, there is no shortage of vaccines too. Mumbai is safe. We do not see a third wave (of the Covid-19) coming,” Sakhare said.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari earlier this year, seeking a direction to both the Union and Maharashtra governments to start door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens aged 75 and above, specially-abled people and those who are bed-ridden. The plea said such people would not be in a position to step out of their houses to go to the vaccination centres and inoculated. The Union government had earlier said it would not be able to start a door-to-door vaccination programme, but last month gave a go ahead to it. The Maharashtra government in August said it would initiate the drive and had started door-to-door vaccination of bed-ridden people as a pilot project. On Monday, Kapadia told the HC that the purpose of filing the PIL was served as now even the Centre has framed a policy to vaccinate such people at their homes. The court then disposed of the PIL and said, “We are happy now that even these persons are not deprived of the Covid-19 vaccine”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-see-3rd-covid-19-wave-coming-bmc-tells-bombay-hc-320047
05-10-2021||Lucknow||Purported video of MoS Ajay Kumar Mishra surfaced on social media ahead of Lakhimpur violence||A purported video of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra in which he is heard warning agitating farmers that he would discipline them in “two minutes” appears to have angered farmers even before Sunday’s violent clashes in Lakhimpur Kheri. “Face me, it will take just two minutes to discipline you fellows,” the two-time BJP MP from Kheri is heard allegedly saying in the video.“I am not only a minister or a MP and MLA...People who know me even before I became a Parliamentarian know that I never run away from taking a challenge. The day I accept the challenge you all have to leave not only Palia (a place) but Lakhimpur itself,” he is heard saying in the video.Source said Mishra’s speech came in the backdrop of some farmers showing him black flags in Palia locality in his Kheri Parliamentary constituency where he had gone to address a public meeting there late last month.Since then farmers have been up in arms against him and on Sunday while protesting against the visit of Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in Mishra’s native village Banbirpur violence erupted resulting in eight deaths, the sources said.Local farmer leader Gurmit Singh told a TV channel that on September 25, members of Krantikari Kisan union and Bhartiya Kisan Union had shown Mishra black flags following which the minister had allegedly threatened to deal with them.He said upon coming to know about Maurya’s programme, the farmers sat on a dharna peacefully near the helipad where he was scheduled to arrive. When the farmers came to know that Maurya was coming by road, the farmers stood in protest at a three km stretch on his travel route in the course of which the dastardly incident happened the previous day.Singh alleged that Mishra’s son and his supporters “trampled farmers to death under wheels of their SUVs”.Farmer leaders had claimed that  the minister’s son Ashish Mishra was in one of the cars which allegedly knocked down some protesters who were opposing the deputy CM’s visit.However, Ajay Mishra said he and his son were not present at the spot as alleged by some farmer leaders and he has photo and video evidence to prove it.Ajay Mishra had also claimed that extremist organisations like the Babbar Khalsa have infiltrated into the farmers’ protest An FIR has been registered against Ashish Mishra and others in connection with the incident.Some criminal cases including that of murder were lodged against 61-year-old Ajay Mishra in the past but he was cleared by the court in those related to murder allegations.Starting his political innings as a panchayat member, Ajay Mishra was elected as BJP MLA from Vidhasan assembly seat in Lakhimpur Kheri district in 2012.The party nominated him for the 2014 Lok Sabha poll from Kheri seat which he won then and also in the last Parliamentary election in 2019.He was inducted in Prime Minister Narendra Modi cabinet in July last and given a key berth as Minister of State for Home.The saffron party projected him as a prominent Brahmin leader and organised several public meetings for him to drum up support in the upcoming state election. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/purported-video-of-mos-ajay-kumar-mishra-surfaced-on-social-media-ahead-of-lakhimpur-violence-320038
05-10-2021||Satya Prakash||'Why protest when matter is in court', Supreme Court asks farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 4A day after eight people were killed in Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court on Monday questioned the rationale behind farmers' protest against the three farm laws, saying it had already stayed the laws in question."We have stayed the farm laws. There is nothing to be implemented. What are the farmers' protesting about? No one other than the court can decide the validity of the farm laws. When that is so, and when farmers are in court challenging the laws, why protest on street?" a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar wondered."When you have already filed a petition before a court challenging the Acts or action of the Executive, how can you then protest? Who are you protesting against? How can the Executive allow these protests? What is the validity of these protests?" the top court asked the farmer unions.The Bench was hearing a petition filed by Kisan Mahapanchayat seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt. Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow it to stage ‘satyagraha’ at Jantar Mantar in the national capital. "We are on principle, once you go to court and challenge an Executive action, how can the same party say that matter is before court, nevertheless I will still protest?" noted the Bench which had on October 1 pulled up farmers' unions for blocking of roads even after approaching the top court and had reminded them that citizens had equal rights to move freely without fear.While ordering transfer of petitions against farm laws pending in Rajasthan High Court, the Bench asked the Centre to respond to it and posted the matter for further hearing on October 21.The top court will also examine whether right to protest is an absolute right and whether farmers can continue to exercise their right to protest when the petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws are already pending before it.As Attorney General KK Venugopal mentioned that an unfortunate incident" happened at Lakhimpur on Sunday, Justice Khanwilkar said, "Nobody takes responsibility when such events happen."``Once matter is subjudice how will protest go on on same issue?" the Bench noted after Venugopal said that a large other petitions had also been filed. "Once matter is before highest constitutional court, no one should be on roads," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said. The counsel for petitioner Kisan Mahapanchayat said the farmers' body has challenged the farm laws on constitutional grounds."It's still intriguing, there’s no Act in place... at moment the Act is stayed by court... The government has assured they won’t give effect to it. The protest is for what? We will transfer your petition here itself and hear it. You’ve asserted you’ve challenged validity of Acts... we will decide the validity first, where’s question of protest?... What’s the point in protesting at Jantar Mantar?" it wondered.As the farmers' body counsel said they have challenged the farm laws, the Bench said, " Then you come to law. You can’t do both -- challenge a law and then go on to protest. Either you come to court or go to Parliament or go to roads...."Amid protests against the three farm laws by farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Western UP, the top court had on January 12 this year stayed the implementation of the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act.It had constituted a four-member panel comprising Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director South Asia international Food Policy), Shetkari Sanghatana President Anil Ghanwat and agriculture-economist and former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) Ashok Gulati to hear the various stakeholders’ views on and report back to it. The fourth panel member Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself. The panel submitted its report to the court in March.At the outset of the hearing on Monday, Kisan Mahapanchayat counsel Ajay Choudhary said the petitioner has filed an affidavit to the effect that the farmers' body wasn't involved in blockades and that they had parted ways from other farmer unions after the January 26 violence.During the hearing, the Bench repeatedly said once a party approached the court challenging validity of an Act, there was no question of holding protest."Your Lordships is right. You can’t go to two houses at same time. He has chosen his forum (top court)," the Attorney General said. The farmers protesting against farm laws had received a rap on the knuckles on October 1 from the Supreme Court which questioned the rationale behind blocking of roads even after approaching the judiciary and reminded them that citizens have equal rights to move freely without fear. "You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city and start protesting again here… The residents around.. are they happy with the protest? This business should stop. You are obstructing security and defence personnel. This was in the media. All this should stop…There has to be a balanced approach,” it had told the counsel for ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’.“There is no point in protest once you come to the court challenging the laws", the told the farmers’ body during hearing on its petition seeking permission to stage ‘satyagraha’ at Jantar Mantar in the national capital. “Are you protesting against the judicial system? Once you have approached the judicial system, have faith in the court. You pursue that matter for urgent hearing instead of protesting again,” the Bench had told the counsel for Kisan Mahapanchayat who said the farmers’ body did have faith in the court.The petitioner had denied blocking roads and had sought to shift the blame on the police. On September 30, another Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had wondered how highways can be blocked perpetually. “The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” it had asked and said it’s the duty of the executive to implement the law laid down by it. Maintaining that farmers had the right to protest, the top court had emphasised that citizens also enjoyed equal right to move freely and without fear. “Their (citizens’) properties are being damaged. Do you take permission from the residents around whether they are happy with your protest… This coaxing business should stop,” it said. Citing media reports, the Bench had pointed out that even security personnel were obstructed, stopped and heckled during the protests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-protest-when-matter-is-in-court-supreme-court-asks-farmers-320013

The incident will be probed by a retired high court judge and perpetrators caught within eight days,” said Kumar.The state government may just have averted a major crisis in the area with the Additional DG reiterating that no politicians would be allowed to enter Lakhimpur Kheri as Section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed to maintain law and order.The Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which Samyukta Kisan Morcha has demanded the dismissal of MoS Home Ajay Mishra alleging that his son had run the protesting farmers over.The entire opposition has thrown its weight behind the farmers with leaders of all hues lining up to reach the violence-hit village.The state police have not allowed entry to anyone.AICC general secretary Priyanka Vadra has been detained at Sitapur guesthouse near the epicentre of violence, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Punjab CM Charanjit Channi have not been allowed to land in Lucknow, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav hasn’t been allowed to move out of his Lucknow home, BSP and TMC leaders have also been stopped.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, meanwhile, has appealed to people to await the results of the investigation and not reach any conclusion or get misled.Yogi Adityanath has promised strict action against the accused.For the ruling BJP, calling a truce with the farmers is of paramount importance to prevent the ongoing farmers’ movement against agriculture laws to spread beyond western UP.Lakhimpur Kheri in central UP could become a hotbed of farmers’ dissent against the BJP going forward, something the opposition would try ahead of the 2022 state elections.Lakhimpur Kheri would remain a test case for whether the farmers’ movement can be revived, especially at a time when the Supreme Court has also started questioning the protesters over the reason behind their angst considering the farm laws are already suspended and the apex court is seized of the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-up-govt-farm-leaders-reach-agreement-45-lakh-ex-gratia-for-kin-of-each-deceased-10-lakh-each-for-injured-320011
