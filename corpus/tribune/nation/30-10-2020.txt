How come you are friends with the same man? Unravel the mystery. Don’t hide it or people will unravel it themselves,” he told reporters in reply to a question.Sharma had allegedly carried out a sting operation on Harish Rawat in 2016 in which he was purportedly shown negotiating a deal to buy the support of rebel MLAs to save his government.The high court’s order has prompted Congress leaders in the state, including Harish Rawat, to demand the chief minister’s resignation on moral grounds.    The chief minister said his resolve to fight corruption remains as strong as ever and will remain so till the end of his five-year tenure.“All mafia and corrupt elements are trying to attack the government together but our resolve to fight corruption remains intact. We won’t budge on our policy on corruption till the end of the five-year tenure,” he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/corruption-allegations-ukhand-cm-asks-harish-rawat-to-reveal-mystery-of-friendship-with-blackmailer-163449

30-10-2020||New Delhi||First phase of Malabar exercise from November 3-6 in Bay of Bengal||In the midst of its bitter border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, India will hold the first phase of the Malabar naval exercise with navies of the US, Japan, and Australia from November 3 to 6 in the Bay of Bengal off Visakhapatnam coast, officials said on Friday.The second phase of the mega exercise is scheduled to be held from November 17-20 in the Arabian sea, they said.Last week, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively makes it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the ‘Quad’ member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region where China has been expanding its military influence.“The exercise will showcase the high-levels of synergy and coordination between the friendly navies in reflection of their shared values and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” said a military official.The officials said the first phase of the drill would witness complex and advanced naval exercises, including surface, anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations, besides cross-deck flying, seamanship evolutions and weapon firing exercises.The exercise will be conducted as a “non-contact and at sea only” drill in view of COVID-19 pandemic, they said.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015.The annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.The Indian Navy will deploy a number of key platforms in the exercise which will include destroyer Ranvijay, frigate Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel Sukanya, fleet support ship Shakti and submarine Sindhuraj.In addition, advanced jet trainer Hawk, long-range maritime patrol aircraft P-8I, Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, and a number of helicopters will also be participating in the exercise, the officials said.US Navy ship USS John S McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, Australian Navy’s long-range frigate HMAS Ballarat with integral MH-60 helicopter and Japan Maritime Self Defence Force’s JS Onami, a destroyer, will be among key platforms to be part of the first phase of the Malabar exercise, they said.During the recent Indo-US 2+2 talks, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper welcomed India’s invitation to Australia to join the Malabar exercise.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.India and China are locked in an over five-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their ties. Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.After the invitation to the drill, Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds CSC said the Malabar exercise marked a “milestone opportunity” for the Australian defence force and that it will showcase the “deep trust” between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their shared will to work together on common security interests.For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the exercise.Defence and security ties between India and Australia have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison.The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other’s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-phase-of-malabar-exercise-from-november-3-6-in-bay-of-bengal-163446

Each member of the Parliament of the IPU is represented by three parliamentarians in the Governing Council and accordingly has three votes, provided the delegation has both men and women.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-bid-to-prevent-pakistan-from-taking-ipu-post-163443

The latest is the US spanner in the election  of Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the new Director-General of World Trade Organisation (WTO).What would have been the first woman and the first African to lead WTO has been stymied by the US although India along with the EU, Japan and China had opted for the Nigerian over her South Korean rival.However, this will not be the first time the WTO election has become politicised. In 1999, a similar stalemate led to the two candidates sharing three-year terms.The job is tough and will require perseverance and outstanding negotiating skills after the previous DG Robert Azevêdo quit the post prematurely because of the stalemate in talks to reform the WTO, said sources.Sources said Washington's objection to her selection has led the WTO to postpone the election to November 9, after the US elections, in the hope that a Joe Biden dispensation might not look at multilateral trade talks with a jaundiced eye.Okonjo-Iweala has advocated open access in the distribution of Covid vaccines which has not been seen as a good portent by the current US administration towards her attitude in running the WTO in case she’s elected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-spanner-in-election-of-new-wto-dg-163442

30-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farmers union terms air pollution Ordinance ‘another undemocratic, anti-farmer’ order to ‘punish farmers’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 30The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) has “strongly opposed” the Centre’s decision to bring in an Ordinance for setting up a Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Area, terming it “yet another undemocratic and anti-farmer ordinance.”Through this Ordinance “the Centre once again overrides the states and arrogates to itself the power to punish farmers”, they said.Calling it a “means for the Central government to absolve itself of responsibility”, the AIKSCC called the Commission “a supra-authority whose orders prevail over the democratically elected state governments of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, and the Central and State Pollution Control Boards”.“It is empowered to direct the actions of the state governments but cannot compel the Centre to provide resources to implement the solutions. The Centre did not want a Supreme Court-appointed committee which would have made the Centre answerable too,” it added. On whether states, including Punjab, may have issues given its jurisdiction, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had on Thursday said the issue of paddy stubble, which contributed anywhere between 4 to 40 per cent to air pollution, “will not remain a problem in next three-four years with the kind of research, innovations and solutions in the pipeline”.Officials added that the aim is to replace "inadequate, haphazard and temporary commissions, authorities, etc. appointed either judicially or administratively. For the first time a regulatory mechanism for stubble burning is put in place".The CPCB, SPCBS will continue to deal with the subject, they added. However in the case of conflict the orders of the commission will prevail.Though according to the AIKSCC the Commission has wide-ranging powers to issue orders to any person, officer or authority who will then be bound to comply with the orders, and this includes prohibition or regulation of any process or operation, and stoppage of the supply of electricity, water or any other service.In addition, any non-compliance of the directions of the Commission shall be punishable with a term up to five years, and a fine extending up to Rs 1 crore."AIKSCC sees this Ordinance in the context of the inordinate focus on the paddy stubble burning as the source of Delhi’s air pollution and the farmers being designated the culprits,” said Punjab members.“This Ordinance further reinforces the fears of farmers that the Central Government is more interested in adopting coercive measures instead of finding real solutions,” they said.“In the past couple of years, thousands of cases have been registered against farmers for stubble-burning, resulting in a lot of harassment instead of providing them support to address the real issues.“The fact is that government policies and laws have pushed the farmers of Punjab and Haryana into this cycle of paddy and wheat with barely three weeks in between, leaving farmers with little practical choice except burning the stubble,” they added.Stating that there is no representative of farmers’ associations in the Commission, the AIKSCC also asked the Centre to withdraw the “hastily promulgated Ordinance and hold extensive consultations with farmer organisations and state governments so that a better, more participatory and effective framework is put in place to address the issue of air pollution”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-union-terms-air-pollution-ordinance-another-undemocratic-anti-farmer-order-to-punish-farmers-163433
30-10-2020||Chandigarh||SAD chief urges PM Narendra Modi to direct Lands Port Authority to reopen Kartarpur Corridor||Ahead of the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to direct the Lands Port Authority of India (LPAI) to reopen the Kartarpur Corridor.The corridor—which allows Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free travel to the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara—was closed on March 16 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Badal, in the letter, said easy access should be given to the pilgrims while enforcing health protocols keeping in view of the 551st birth anniversary of the Sikhism founder on November 30.The four-km long corridor links Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur in India to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan - the final resting place of Sikh faith's founder Guru Nanak Dev.India has said that a decision to reopen the Kartarpur corridor will be taken in accordance with the protocols relating to COVID-19 and easing of restrictions. Badal, in his letter, said that there was an overwhelming sentiment in the Sikh community that the Kartarpur Corridor should be reopened at the earliest so that devotees could pay obeisance."The Pakistan government had opened the corridor for travel and permission for the same was only awaited from the Indian government," he said.The SAD president said prominent pilgrimage sites across the world, which were partially or fully closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been reopened. Badal said history was made last year when the Indian government decided to open the corridor and it was inaugurated by the prime minister on November 9 on the eve of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev."Thousands of devotees visited the final resting place of Guru Sahib in the months following this before the corridor was closed temporarily on March 16 this year. I will be grateful if you could intervene in this matter considering that restrictions on paying obeisance at places of worship have been relaxed across the country. This will also be in keeping with the wishes of the Sikh community," the letter added.

It is ddressed to Pathak and signed by Puneet Krishna, one of the creators and the writer of the series.The letter reads:"Dear Surender Mohan Pathak"It has been brought to my notice by you that there is a scene in the recently released series—Mirzapur Season 2—which depicts a character named Satyanand Tripathi, reading a book named 'Dhabba' which has been written by you and this depiction is supplemented with an unrelated voiceover (VO) which has hurt your sentiments and the sentiments of your fans and well-wishers.""We sincerely apologise for the same and would like to convey to you that this was not done with any malicious intent or to tarnish/damage your reputation. We are aware that you are a writer of repute and your work is held in high regard in the world of Hindi crime fiction.""We would like to assure you that to rectify this situation, as discussed with you and as per your wishes, we will blur the book cover in the scene or remove the VO within a reasonable time of 3 weeks.""Once again, please accept our sincerest apologies for inadvertently hurting your sentiments."The letter came in response to a statement issued by Pathak earlier this week on Twitter where he had accused the makers of the web series of "mischievous misrepresentation" of his novel in the second season of the show.The statement Pathak posted on his unverified Twitter account had said: "What the character has been depicted reading from 'Dhabba' has absolutely no bearing with any part of the original text of 'Dhabba' and also there is no character bearing the name Baldev Raj in the novel in the said context. On the contrary, what is being read is sheer porno, the undersigned cannot even dream of writing, supposedly to titillate the viewers. But in the process, the whole sequence is shown as an excerpt from my novel 'Dhabba' which amounts to mischievous misrepresentation. The object appears to be an attempt to tarnish my image as a celebrated writer of Hindi crime fiction who is ruling the roost since the last several decades. The sequence defames me as an author and puts me in bad light as a well-known mystery writer which I am since more than last five decades."On Friday evening, Pathak accepted the letter of apology and asked them to make the necessary rectification.He tweeted: "We thank you for considering our letter and for your reply. We accept your apology and expect that the rectification will take place within the 3 weeks' time as requested by you."

30-10-2020||Begusarai (Bihar)||‘Mind lock’: Nadda chides Tejashwi over his persistent landlocked Bihar jibe on Nitish||BJP president JP Nadda on Friday threw “mind lock” jibe at RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, chastising him over his constant “landlocked Bihar” swipe at NDA ally and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.Addressing a poll rally here, Nadda also assailed the Lalu Prasad-led RJD, saying the party has a history of conducting “Tail Piyawan, Danda Bhanjan” rally, underlining its reputation of preferring muscle power to education.“These days even Tejashwi Yadav has started saying we will do this, we will do that. But who can trust you in an election?” he asked.“Those who have done something good in the past will do so in the future. They (RJD) had in the past held ‘Tel Piyawan, Danda Bhanjan’ rally and in future too they will only wield lathis and do nothing else,” Nadda wryly said.Nadda’s reference to ‘Tel Piyawan, Danda Bhanjan’ (dipping lathis in oil and wielding them to assert power) was a throwback to an RJD rally in 2003, two years before the party was ousted from power in Bihar.“They have done such things. Now the time has come when the finger only can serve the purpose (to press the lotus button). We don’t need lathis,” the BJP president said.He also responded to Tejashwi Yadav’s persistent attack on Chief Minister Kumar over his remark that Bihar could not be industrialised as it was “landlocked”.“I was just listening...Tejashwi. He said ‘it's landlocked’. It’s not landlocked, your mind is locked. This is not a story of ‘landlocked’. Your mind is locked,” he mockingly said.Nadda also said that the Rs 1.25 lakh crore package that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced for Bihar in 2015 has been delivered. He also gave a rough break-up of the amount.“Rs 3,094 crore for farmers, Rs 1,000 crore for education, Rs 1,550 crore for skill development, Rs 600 crore for health, Rs 13,850 for roads, Rs 54,700 crore for highways, Rs 8,870 crore for railways, Rs 2,700 crore for airports, Rs 21,000 crore for petroleum and gas, and Rs 600 crore for tourism. Narendra Modi has given Rs 40,000 crore more than the promised Rs 1.25 lakh crore. That’s our report card,” he said.Praising the government over its handling of the coronavirus crisis, he said advanced countries including the US had been shaken by the pandemic but PM Modi saved Indians from the deadly virus.“Today Donald Trump is contesting the presidential elections and his rival Joe Biden is cornering him that he (Trump) could not handle coronavirus. European countries whose health infrastructure is better than us, they were finding themselves helpless. And Modi ji, in a country of 130 crore people, imposed the lockdown in time and saved 130 crore people from coronavirus,” he said.“That’s the difference a leadership can make,” he said and went on to detail the government’s effort in scaling up facilities and infrastructure to fight coronavirus. “And similarly, our Nitishji has cooperated and worked to save people from coronavirus,” he said.He said under PM Modi and Chief Minister Kumar a lot development works had been completed in Bihar and several are under way.“This is a news story of development. This Bihar is an emerging Bihar,” he said. He said a world class, state-of-art medical college is coming up in Begusarai.“Could you ever imagine a medical college in Begusarai! Engineering college! Even operating colleges were shut down,” he said.Attacking the RJD over its record on law and order, he appealed to people to vote for NDA candidates.“Do you want to light a lantern or an LED bulb? A ‘loot raj’ or a ‘kanoon raj’? Bahubal (strongmanship) or vikasbal (development)?” he asked the crowd.He also emphasised that the NDA in Bihar only means four parties: the BJP, the JDU), the VIP and the HAM.“Some people are trying to spread confusion by praising PM Modi and criticizing Nitishji. I want to state in clear words the BJP, the JD(U), the HAM and the VIP, only they are NDA.,” he stressed, making it clear the LJP was on its own in the state.Later he also addressed a rally in Siwan and repeated the charges on the RJD and also criticized the Congress over its stand on the Ram temple issue and Article 370.

30-10-2020|| Hyderabad||Telangana Chief Minister KCR’s’s daughter K Kavitha back in active politics||After losing the last Parliamentary elections from Nizamabad, Telangana Chief Minister’s daughter Kalvakuntla Kavitha is back in active politics.She too took oath as the member of Telangana Legislative Council after winning a by-poll in Nizamabad recently.  She was administered the oath of office and secrecy by G Sukhender Reddy, Legislative Council Chairman at Hyderabad, making her a member of Upper House of the state legislature. Later she tweeted: "Took oath as Kamareddy and Nizamabad districts local bodies MLC. I humbly thank my party for the opportunity and the local body representatives who have elected me to this position".She is now expected to play an active role in the state legislature and it is being speculated that her father Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) supremo K Chandershekhar Rao (KCR) may induct her in his cabinet. Her brother K T Rama Rao (KTR) is a minister and working president of TRS. KCR's nephew and well-known face in TRS, T Harish Rao is the finance minister.  Kavitha was elected to the Legislative Council on October 12, winning the by-election from Nizamabad Local Authorities Constituency. She secured 728 out of 823 votes and both her rivals from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress forfeited their deposit. The 42-year-old had received a shocking defeat at the hands of BJP's Dharmapuri Arvind in the Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency last year. It was a big blow for the CM's daughter who was elected from the same constituency in 2014. Kavitha, who did her B Tech in 1999, joined the movement for statehood to Telangana in 2008 after returning from the United States and floated Telangana Jagruthi to give a cultural thrust to the movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-chief-minister-kcrss-daughter-k-kavitha-back-in-active-politics-163415

There is an increase of 44 per cent in the number of Lok Sabha MPs with declared criminal cases against themselves since 2009, and the root cause of this bizarre situation is the use of political party symbols on ballot paper and EVM,” the petitioner submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-moves-sc-seeks-removal-of-party-symbols-from-ballots-evms-163406

Councillor Manish Shukla gunned down in Titagarh. TMC seeks to intimidate and murder opponents, even as the ground is slipping from under its feet. Nearly 110 BJP workers murdered,” Dasgupta had tweeted after a close associate of Arjun Singh, the BJP Lok Sabha member from Barrackpore, was shot.In July, the BJP gave out the names of 93 slain party workers. A booklet released by BJP state president Dilip Ghosh listed 93 BJP workers, including five women, who fell victim to political violence in the state during last seven years.The first name in the list was that of Bapi Ghosh, BJP worker of Nadia, Krishnanagar, who was murdered on July 15, 2020. The last name was of Nripen Mandal, killed in Malda district on June 16, 2013.According to the booklet, during the seven years (June 16, 2013, to July 17, 2020), the maximum number of killings of the BJP workers (33 total) took place in 2018. Most of these killings were on account of the violence that was unleashed in the wake of the panchayat elections held in the state in 2018.“It is a real killing field out here,” West Bengal BJP vice-president Joy Prokash Majumdar said. Majumdar himself was physically assaulted last year during an Assembly bypoll in which he was the BJP candidate.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had to cancel her plan to attend the oath ceremony of Narendra Modi’s second term as the Prime Minister as the event was also attended by family members of BJP workers murdered in Bengal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/list-of-slain-bjp-workers-gets-bigger-and-bigger-in-bengal-163401

Thereafter, the final trial of electric train on this 4.8 km long track would be conducted while the track would be ready for operation by December 5.Local residents have been eagerly waiting for completion of the work since the first trial run of goods train with diesel engine on the track was successfully conducted on August 19. The authorities were satisfied with the safety parameters and movement of the train on the track.The foundation stone of the Rs 350-crore ambitious project was laid by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar in March 2018 and a deadline of 18 months was fixed to complete it.The project missed the first deadline in November 2019 due to encroachment on the one side of the track. The work could not also be completed before the second deadline on April 30 and third on June 30. The deadline was extended twice thereafter.“We wanted that the work to complete by November 1 but it did not happen due to some unavoidable reasons. A meeting of officials of civil and electric wings of the Railways along with nodal agency of the project was convened some days ago wherein the officers assured me of completing the entire work by December 5,” said Deputy Commissioner Manoj Kumar.Pradeep Ranjan, Technical Advisor of the project, said the work pertaining to the structure had been completed and pillars of the track were being coloured. The electrification work was in progress.“The safety parameters will be examined again after the completion of electrification to give clearance for starting the operation over the track. The track will do away with five level crossings in the city, reducing traffic jams,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nations-first-elevated-rail-track-to-be-operational-by-december-5-163398

It said no permission will be granted by authorities to Kamal Nath as a star campaigner."However, if any campaign is done by Kamal Nath from now onwards, the entire expenditure related to travel, stay and visit will be completely borne by the candidate in whose constituency he carries out campaigning," he said.The EC’s action comes days before the state is scheduled to hold by-elections for its 28 vacant assembly seats.Former chief minister Kamal Nath had previously sparked outrage when he referred to a Dalit woman candidate from Gwalior’s Dabra as an “item”. The remark drew outrage not only from the woman candidate Imarti Devi---Kamal Nath’s former cabinet colleague and a former member of the Congress---and her party the Bharatiya Janata Party but also caused the EC to send a notice to him asking for an explanation.The outrage caused Nath to apologise for the remark and prompted him to say he did not “mean to offend anybody”.Twenty-four of the 28 assembly seats that Madhya Pradesh will vote on November 3 fell vacant after former Congress MLAs resigned earlier this year, leading to a fall of Kamal Nath’s government.Votes for the by-elections will be counted on November 10. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-revokes-kamal-naths-star-campaigner-status-for-repeated-poll-code-violations-163390

30-10-2020||New Delhi||FinMin notifies extended deadline for 2019-20 ITR filing||The Finance Ministry has notified the extended due date for filing income tax returns (ITR) for 2019-20 fiscal.While the deadline for filing ITR by individual taxpayers has been extended by a month till December 31, the due date for those taxpayers whose accounts need to be audited has been extended to January 31, 2021.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala said although the government had announced the extension of ITR and audit report filing due dates last week but there was an ambiguity if such extension is available for corporates to whom tax audit and transfer pricing reporting was not applicable, for instance, foreign companies having no associated enterprise in India and yet earning income from Indian sources.“Today’s notification has cleared the air by extending the due dates for such entities as well. Consequently, all Indian and foreign companies, who are not liable to obtain a tax audit or do not maintain transfer pricing documents, can now file ITR by January 31, 2021, whereas individuals not liable to tax audit will have to file their tax returns by December 31, 2020,” Jhunjhunwala said.The government had earlier in May extended various due dates for filing ITRs for 2019-20 fiscal from July 31 to November 30, to give compliance relief to taxpayers due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

30-10-2020||Patna||In BJP bastion Bankipur, 'Shotgun' Shatrughan Sinha's son Luv brings in an element of curiosity||An element of curiosity has been introduced in the Bankipur assembly segment where a strongly placed young BJP MLAs attempt at a hat-trick has been challenged by, a still younger, Congress candidate with a formidable pedigree.The candidature of 37 years old Luv Sinha, whose father Shatrughan Sinha had lost Patna Sahib in the Lok Sabha polls last year when he fought on a Congress ticket, came as a surprise to residents of the Bihar capital, a major part of which is covered under the constituency named after a locality in the city.The father had won the Lok Sabha seat on the trot in 2009 and 2014, when he contested on a BJP ticket, but he burnt his bridges with the party after repeated jibes at the Modi-Shah duo which he mockingly called "one man show and two man army".Last year, the "Bihari babu" who took pride in having registered the biggest margin of victory in the state in 2014 when all credit was going to the "Modi wave", lost by an even greater number of votes (2,84,657) to former cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad who was contesting an election for the first time.Not much has been known so far about his childrens political aptitude, though it is common knowledge that unlike twin brother Kush, Luv did evince interest in acting but failed to make it big like "Shotgun" or, to some extent, younger sister Sonakshi.Besides being born to a famous actor whose crowd-pulling abilities in his home town remain undiminished, Luv Sinha also has caste factor on his side in Bankipur where the winner and the runner-up have been, invariably, Kayasthas.However, defeating the incumbent Nitin Nabin remains a tall order as the city has, in reaction to the Mandal wave and the lawlessness that prevailed during the rule of Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, turned into a saffron bastion.This explains why the 40 years old MLA, who made his debut from the now abolished Patna West seat in 2006 in a by- election necessitated by his father Nabin Kishore Sinhas death, has always been winning by astounding margins.Even in 2015, when the Congress had fielded another Kayastha candidate Kumar Ashish who enjoyed the backing of Lalu Prasads RJD as well as Nitish Kumars JD(U), Bankipur remained a cakewalk for Nitin Nabin even as the BJP struggled to hold its own in much of the state, failing to win even a quarter of seats in the 243-strong assembly.Nitish Kumar is back in the NDA this time which the BJP sees as a bonus.Moreover,Nabins own standing has since grown.He headed the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha till recently and has now been appointed as the partys in charge for Sikkim.The opposition Grand Alliance, of which the Congress is the second largest partner after RJD, however, hopes of cashing in on the anti incumbency factor which has become palpable with the Chief Minister having been in power for about a decade and a half.The Congress also hopes to make inroads among disgruntled BJP cadre who do not have much of a space in the state capital to vent their frustrations, with even the rebellious LJP chief Chirag Paswan shying away from fielding candidates against the saffron party candidates in any of the four assembly segments which cover the entire city.This was evident when Sushma Sahu,a former state president of BJP Mahila Morcha who recently quit the party and had sought to contest as an Independent candidate, turned up at public meetings where she canvassed for Luv Sinha, calling him "chhota bhai" (younger brother).Sahu has been alleging that her nomination papers were rejected at the behest of the ruling coalition and accusing the BJP of, "insulting the Vaishya community" by ignoring and humiliating her.How much ice this cuts with the voters will be known on November 03, when Bankipur, which has a 3.91 lakh strong electorate, goes to polls in the second phase of elections.Altogether 22 candidates are in the fray here and, besides the main contenders, one being talked about is Pushpam Priya Chaudhary, who calls herself "Chief Ministerial candidate" of her newly-floated outfit Plurals Party.However, the politically conscious residents of the city look with bemusement at the self-styled political reformer, who claims to be an alumnus of London School of Economics and happens to be daughter of a JD(U) leader from north Bihar.The NDA leaders are describing Luv Sinha as a "parachute candidate". But, his father, Shatrughan Sinha says he is "Bihar putra" (son of Bihar) and has been working for the people since he (Sinha himself) contested Lok Sabha elections from native Patna for the first time in 2009.Confident of the BJP's victory on the seat, some saffron party leaders brag that "even if US president Donald Trump comes to contest against the BJP from Patna, he will be defeated."Priti Sinha of Sri Krishna Nagar says though not much development work has been done in the area, we would love to have a BJP-JD(U) government for the sake of control of crime.Sapalta Singh of Khajpura locality says "we are firmly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. To make the country strong we need to have him in power everywhere".

30-10-2020||New Delhi||Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party's relationship becomes adversarial||Deterioration in the relationship between Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party after becoming allies in the last Lok Sabha election in Uttar Pradesh, is likely to have ramifications in national politics.The two parties have fallen back to their old fierce, and adversarial position against each other—which had once defined the politics of Uttar Pradesh, and affected the politics at the Centre.Announcing the suspension of seven of the BSP MLAs on Thursday for the rebellion at the instance of SP head, Akhilesh Yadav, with regard to the party (BSP) nominee for Rajya Sabha election in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati said, that she would even support BJP in the coming Legislative Council election to defeat the SP.She has also recommended the cancellation of membership of the MLAs from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.This would be good news for the BJP as it manifests disarray in the opposition camp.Mayawati also expressed regret at having withdrawn the 1995 criminal case against the SP leaders regarding the alleged assault on her in guest House in Uttar Pradesh.She had withdrawn the case as a goodwill gesture towards the SP leadership to strengthen the alliance of these parties before the last Lok Sabha election.Their coming together had raised hopes among anti-BJP camp on account of formidable caste and communal arithmetic of numbers they conjure.Even, though, BJP decimated all its rivals in the Lok Sabha election, hopes from the combined strength of BSP-SP was high in the anti-saffron camp on account of the formidable arithmetic caste, and communal numbers their relationship conjure.The hopes flowed in spite of the fact, that their relationship had become cold after the Lok Sabha election.Political pundits see the rupture in BSP-SP relationship as one which would impinge on national politics.It will certainly play the bear on efforts for unity among the Opposition parties.The relationship between BSP and SP has become outright antagonistic right in the middle of the Bihar Assembly election, which would be used by the BJP to take potshot on the opposition parties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bahujan-samaj-party-and-samajwadi-partys-relationship-becomes-adversarial-163365

We have proved that we can ensure quality food for people at this humble rate even during the time of lockdown," he told P T I."And we are proud that we can ensure a steady income for over 3,000 Kudumbashree volunteers (all women) through these hotels," he said.Even when many places were declared containment zones due to the pandemic, the volunteers could deliver food packets without fail."We have proved that our hotels can act as nodal points to deliver food packets even when a place is declared as a containment zone," the official added.Sixty-six-year old Padmavathy, a housemaid working in several houses in the capital city, said the hotel was a huge relief for her on many days during the pandemic."At a time when the infection had started spreading on a larger scale, many families were not keen to allow housemaids in their premises due to the risk of the disease spread.It was a big blow to people like me, who depend on daily earnings. At that time, the Janakeeya hotels was a huge relief as we get good meals at just Rs 20," she told P T I.Not just her, several neighbours in her colony also depended on these budget hotels for many days.The Janakeeya hotels have been set up as part of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government's ambitious "Hunger-Free Kerala" project.While presenting the 2020-21 state budget, state Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac had announced that the government would open 1,000 common man's hotels, serving subsidised meals, across the state.Currently, a total of 767 such budget hotels--both in urban and village areas-are operating in the state, Nishanth, programme co-ordinator, Kudumbashree said, adding that it was implemented with the support of the Local Self Government and Civil Supplies departments.Detailing the working mechanism of Janakeeya hotels, he said the subsidised meals are served at these hotels between 12.30 PM and 3 PM."Before and after that, the Kudumbashree members, who run the hotels, are free to sell other food articles according to their choice. But, it is not under the subsidy rate," he told P T I.The budget hotels had begun delivery of meal packets at the doorstep of the needy during the lockdown.For that, they charge Rs 5 extra for each packet, taking the total amount to Rs 25, he added.Besides the subsidy of Rs 10 provided by the Kudumbashree for each meal, Rs 30,000 would be provided by the Corporation as a grant for hotels set up in urban areas, and Rs 20,000 by the block panchayat for hotels in village areas.The land/ rent amount, electricity and water for the hotels are provided free of cost by the respective local self-government institutions, official sources added.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-budget-hotel-chain-feeds-70-000-people-daily-at-rs-20-per-meal-163355

30-10-2020||Washington||India-US bond will send a strong message to 'adversaries' like China, Russia: US Senator||An influential Republican Senator has praised the Trump administration's efforts to strengthen strategic ties with India during the recently concluded 2+2 ministerial dialogue, saying that bolstering the bond between the two countries will send a clear message to "adversaries" like China and Russia.During the third edition of the Indo-US 2+2 dialogue in New Delhi on Tuesday, the two countries vowed to ramp up their overall security ties and inked a total of five pacts, including the strategic Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information.The other pacts will facilitate cooperation in areas of nuclear energy, earth sciences and Ayurveda.The talks were led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar from the Indian side and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper from the US side.“Bolstering the bond between the United States and India makes both of our countries safer and sends a clear message to adversaries like China and Russia. I am encouraged by the progress President (Donald) Trump's foreign policy team is making to strengthen this strategic partnership,” said Senator Kevin Cramer.The relations between China and the US have in recent months worsened over a range of issues like the coronavirus pandemic, trade, Beijing's increasing grip on Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses against minorities in the Xinjiang province.India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May that has significantly strained the bilateral ties.“A stronger relationship with India also opens the door for further economic opportunities,” Cramer said.Cramer had met high-ranking Indian officials last year to discuss strengthening ties between the two countries and the issues that impact North Dakota, like agriculture, energy, and immigration, the senator's office said.“Your personal commitment towards strong India-USA ties is deeply admirable,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said of Senator Cramer.In a joint statement released this week, the US and India highlighted the elevation of this relationship under President Trump and reiterated their commitment to further strengthening the partnership, anchored in mutual trust, shared commitment to democracy, and strategic interests.The two countries also welcomed the inclusion of the Australian Navy in the Malabar exercise, which Senator Cramer recently applauded as well.India on October 19 announced Australia's participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the US and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four-member nation grouping -- the Quad.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.

30-10-2020||Bengaluru/New Delhi||Bineesh Kodiyeri remitted huge unaccounted funds into drug peddler's account: ED||A day after it arrested Bineesh Kodiyeri, the son of Kerala CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, the ED said on Friday that he allegedly credited "huge amount of unaccounted funds" into the bank accounts of a drug peddler.Bineesh was arrested by the central probe agency under the anti-money laundering law in Bengaluru on Thursday following which a local court sent him to Enforcement Directorate custody till November 2.The ED alleged that the "drug peddler" in this case, Mohammed Anoop, was a "benamidar" of Bineesh.Benamidar is a person in whose name the benami property is held or transferred, and a beneficial owner of the person for whose benefit the property is being held by the benamidar.Anoop was also arrested by the ED on October 17 in this case.  The ED probe stems from a Narcotics Control Bureau investigation that claimed to have busted an ecstasy pills drug trafficking racket in Karnataka in August along with the arrest of Anoop and two others.The ED issued a statement and claimed that Anoop, during his custodial interrogation, "admitted that he was indulging in sale and purchase of narcotics drugs and was closely associated with Bineesh Kodiyeri." "It is also revealed that he (Anoop) held various bank accounts and indulged in transferring/layering of huge proceeds of crime into various accounts," the ED claimed."Fund trail investigation also established that a huge amount of unaccounted funds were being regularly credited in his (Anoop's) accounts by Bineesh Kodiyeri." "These were preceded by large cash deposits in Kerala into the accounts of Bineesh Kodiyeri," the ED alleged.The agency claimed, "Anoop is a benamidar of Bineesh Kodiyeri and all his financial dealings were done on the instructions of Bineesh who had paid huge amounts of money to him."  "He could not explain these cash and fund transactions and was completely evasive in his replies," the ED said.The NCB had claimed in the past that "prominent musicians and actors" in Karnataka are under its scanner after this operation.The three arrested in this case are accused of supplying drugs to Kannada film actors and singers.Bineesh has maintained that he knew Anoop and his family and the latter had borrowed money from him and some others for setting up the restaurant business in Bengaluru a few years ago.

30-10-2020||New Delhi||40 per cent of total calls received by Childline since 2018 were 'silent calls'||Forty per cent of calls received by CHILDLINE helpline number '1098' since 2018 were "silent calls", an official said, indicating that in many cases these may have been "muted" cries for help from people who could not muster the courage to report abuse or violence at that time.In a "silent call" the receiver can hear background noise, but the caller, who remains on the line, does not speak, the official, who is with the service, said.CHILDLINE '1098' is a round-the-clock helpline number that covers 595 districts and 135 Railway child help desks to help children in distress.Of the 2.15 crore calls received by CHILDLINE between January 2018 and September this year, as many as 86 lakh were "silent calls", according to data shared by the service."Mostly these calls mean that somebody is actually trying to call or wants to seek help, but doesn't have the courage at that point in time to speak up, we do not disconnect such calls," the official said.On many occasions a person speaks after counselling by staff members, he said.Sometimes calls are made from the same number several times, but the caller does not speak, "but finally after 100 calls they spoke up in the 101st call", the official said.However, the number of silent calls have reduced in the past three years, he said.In 2018, 42 lakh or 42 per cent out of 1.01 crore calls were silent calls, while in 2019, 27 lakh or 39 per cent of 69 lakh total calls were silent calls, according to the data.In 2020, till September, 16 lakh or 36 per cent of 43 lakh calls were silent calls, it stated.The reason behind the drop in the number of silent calls could be attributed to people becoming more aware of CHILDLINE's services and actions, the official said, adding that with more awareness people are "gathering the courage to speak up"."The number of silent calls has been reducing in the past three years and through that, we assume that as awareness grows and through our actions, more and more people are able to speak up as they know they will get help through the number and not land in trouble," he said.The official said that in several instances, a child who is in a "vulnerable environment" tries to "test the waters" by calling the helpline number and know "what happens when I call"."Now many of them are able to speak up," he added.The official said that even during the COVID-19-induced lockdown period, a drop in the number of "silent calls" was observed."Even during the lockdown period if you see the percentage of silent calls, it was much lesser because awareness was there and people were calling for the right reasons and speaking up," he said.

30-10-2020||United Nations||India stresses Security Council to list terror entities involved in violence against women||India has underscored the need for the UN Security Council to effectively integrate women, peace and security considerations into the sanctions regimes, including by listing terrorist entities involved in violence against women in armed conflicts.“Violence against women and girls perpetrated by terrorists deserves our strong condemnation. Such women-targeted violence distorts the very basis on which civilised societies rest,” India said in a statement to the Security Council open debate on Women, Peace and Security on Thursday.India said advancing democratic structures and rule of law in post-conflict situations is instrumental in addressing the inequalities faced by women and to ensure their full and meaningful participation for peaceful and inclusive development.“It is also important that the Council strives to effectively integrate WPS (Women, Peace and Security) considerations into sanctions regimes, including by listing terrorist entities involved in violence against women in armed conflicts,” India said.India noted that conflict and humanitarian crises already hold women and girls back from progress.“The further burdening of the health care and the economic fall-out of COVID-19 threatens to put women and girls in war-torn, fragile and humanitarian contexts at even higher risk,” the country said.India said that through the Action for Peacekeeping initiative, the Member States are committed to implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda by increasing the number of civilian and uniformed women in peacekeeping.However, despite UN efforts, women form only 5.4 per cent of the military and 15.1 per cent of police in peacekeeping operations.India reiterated its commitment to work for meaningful participation of women in peace and security issues, saying its experience of mainstreaming women's leadership and political participation will continue to inspire its actions.Noting that while the Women, Peace and Security agenda has a transformative potential, India stressed that patriarchy, inequalities and discriminatory power structures inhibit effective conflict prevention, inclusive peace, women's rights and participation.Realising a transformative potential of the Women, Peace and Security agenda will require moving from verbal commitments to action and governments, the UN, civil society and other actors must implement relevant commitments across all thematic areas.“States must identify and address barriers to women’s meaningful participation in the prevention and resolution of conflict, and in post-conflict peace-building efforts and programs,” India said.In 2007, India provided United Nations Mission in Liberia's first all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU), which provided critical policing support deterring sexual and gender-based violence and helped rebuild safety and confidence among the population.The FPU proved to be strong and visible role model to the Liberian women, gaining world-wide attention.India underlined that it attaches utmost importance to representation of women in decision-making positions. More than 1.3 million elected women representatives in the country lead in formulation and implementation of public policies at grassroots level.
