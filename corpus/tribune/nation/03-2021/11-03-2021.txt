If we look at the list of candidates in Cachar district, we can see candidates who will help in smuggling of illegal drugs, various weapons, etc,” he was quoted as saying after senior leader Himanta Biswa Sarma failed to convince rebel leaders of the Barak Valley to not contest as independents. They include Paul, former union minister Kabindra Purkayastha’s son Kanad Purkayastha and two sitting MLAs.  BJP leaders, who call such rumblings “an expected feature of any election”, denied any trouble in the state leadership. Aiming to strike the right notes, they said the decision over its chief minister candidate will be taken by the Parliamentary Board at the time of formation of the government.Observers, however, say it is clear the party does not want to rock the boat and upset different factions, including supporters of Sonowal and more influential Sarma, who is also the convenor of the all-important North East Democratic Front (NEDA). In these elections, Sonowal and Sarma are contesting from Majuli and Jalukbari, respectively—the constituencies they currently represent.Sarma had been dropping hints that he is not interested in contesting Assembly elections and sending signals to the central leadership that either he should be the charge of the state or be inducted into the central government. Amid the buzz around election campaign song centered around him, sources said Sarma will never agree to be a minister in the state government now. With the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) snapping ties with the saffron party and formally joining the Congress-led ‘Grand Alliance’ (with Left and parties like perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal-led All India United Democratic Front adding interesting angles) the fight for Assam is closer than the BJP will like to project, say observers calling “Assam tougher than West Bengal” even though the latter is hogging most of the attention and limelight.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-bjps-hesitancy-in-naming-its-cm-face-in-assam-hints-at-tensions-in-state-leadership-223783
11-03-2021||New Delhi||With first-ever Quad summit to be held on Friday; time for it to spread its wings||The first-ever Quad summit to be held on Friday is as much a consequence of China’s 360 degree attempt to simultaneously settle its boundaries as it is of video-conferencing getting acceptance in the interplay of diplomacy.China has accepted the inevitability of the Quad as was clear from its toned down reaction to the meeting of the US president with prime ministers of Japan, Australia and India.The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson merely “hoped” that the Quad will only do things that are conducive to regional peace, stability and prosperity rather than the opposite.This is a far cry from the frenzied demarches it had served on the very same participants in a joint naval exercise over a decade back.Before the COVID-19 outbreak, video-conferencing was frowned upon in diplomatic circles which preferred their well-honed style of circling the issue in face-to-face conversations with their counterparts.Quad’s interactions by video conferencing accelerated a process that would have taken a couple of years, given the scheduling difficulties of some of the world’s busiest leaders.China too decided to escalate its border dispute with India around April last year and the Rubicon was crossed in Galwan Valley on June 15 that led to the deaths of Indian and Chinese soldiers.So far, the Quad has not done anything substantial beyond adding a couple of Indian naval boats to what military allies Japan, Australia and the US were already doing.The group sail of naval boats through contentious maritime territory has been going on since Beijing entered the game of occupying and militarising islands in South China Sea and East China Sea that had been conducted till the 90s by mostly US allies.The Quad summit, even though virtual, needs to set a framework or action plan that sets the ball rolling for line ministries to get into action on a large number of issues.After all, though Quad started life as the “Quad Security Dialogue”, the new US administration has clearly stated that it is for more purposes than one if it is to be an effective instrument to balance China.The Quad is a continuation of the change in US foreign policy outlook after 2001 when the Pentagon had to look beyond its traditional military allies in Asia.NATO countries assisted the US in the Asian theatre, from Afghanistan to Iraq. But their weak military footprint in East and South Asia led the US to reach out to India after its credibility in Pakistan military began souring. The deaths of Indian soldiers in Galwan Valley puts a premium on the defence side, but as previous Quad ministerial meetings have noted, the balancing with China needs to be multi vector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-first-ever-quad-summit-to-be-held-on-friday-time-for-it-to-spread-its-wings-223779

Subsequently, the state withdrew its consent through November 16, 2018 notification, it added.However, the CBI contended that said withdrawal had no bearing on its power to register FIRs in relation to offences in railway areas’ and take consequential steps in pursuance to such investigation’. It is submitted that the respondent (CBI) was well within the powers conferred to it, while initiating and continuing to conduct the instant investigation, it said, adding the probe was being carried out in more than one state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-powers-to-investigate-offences-in-railway-areas-even-without-states-consent-cbi-223775

11-03-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks to restrain govt from deporting Rohingyas from Jammu||Days after authorities in Jammu detained Rohingya immigrants as part of the process to deport them, a plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions for their immediate release and to restrain the Centre from deporting them.Filed by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee, the plea is in the form of an intervention application in a matter already pending before the court.The total estimated number of Rohingyas in Jammu is estimated to be more than 6,500.There are several petitions in SC demanding deportation of over 40,000 Rohingyas, who fled to India after violence in the Western Rakhine State of Myanmar and are settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan.Registered as refugees under the United Nations High Commission of Refugees (UNHCR), Salimullah had moved the top court in 2017 challenging the Centre’s move to deport Rohingya immigrants on the ground that the decision violated international human right conventions and right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.Citing the MHA’s August 8, 2017 letter to all the chief secretaries of all the state governments/UT administrations, raising a concern regarding the increased ‘illegal immigrants’ in India and their purported ‘grave security challenge’, the plea stated that the petitioner faced an imminent danger of being deported.Salimullah wanted the top court to direct the MHA to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) for the Rohingyas in the informal camps.He also sought a direction to the UNHCR to intervene and determine the protection needs of the Rohingya refugees not just in Jammu but also in camps across India and complete the process of granting them refugee cards.They accused the Centre of failing to carry out its obligations to ensure protection to the Rohingya community, by proposing to deport them to Myanmar, where they faced serious violence and persecution.“Release the detained Rohingya refugees immediately and direct the Union Territory government and the Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the FRRO for the Rohingyas in the informal camps,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeks-to-restrain-govt-from-deporting-rohingyas-from-jammu-223771
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||IAF to induct second squadron of Rafale fighter jets in April in West Bengal||After having operationalised its first squadron of Rafale fighter jets at Ambala last year, the IAF will be raising the second squadron of this aircraft in the eastern sector next month.“The second Rafale Squadron being raised at the next Main Operating Base (MOB) Hasimara in mid-April this year,” a senior officer at Air Headquarters said on Thursday. The aircraft will be inducted into No.101 Squadron.Also known as the Falcons Of Chhamb, No. 101 Squadron was created as a photo reconnaissance flight at Palam in May 1949 with four Harvards, two Spitfires, eight pilots and fifty-five airmen. After operating the Vampire and Su-7, it last flew the MiG-21 M fighter in the western theatre.The IAF has already received 11 French-made Rafale fighters so far, which form No,17 Squadrons, the Golden Arrows, based at Ambala airbase in the western sector.More aircraft are expected to arrive in batches over the next few months.The first batch of five Rafales had arrived in India from France on July 29, 2020, after making an overnight halt in the UAE. They were formally inducted into the IAF in September.The next batch of three aircraft had arrived in November after flying non-stop from France in about eight hours.Since their induction, the Rafales have been fully operational and are undertaking various missions, including flying in Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese armies have been engaged in a close confrontation along the Line of Actual Control for the past about 10 months.The IAF is procuring a total of 36 Rafale multi-role aircraft, equipping two squadrons, with the second one to be based in the east. Recently, the IAF said Rafale could be a contender for the IAF’s planned acquisition of 114 fighter aircraft.While Ambala is the country’s oldest airbase that began its tryst with aviation in 1919, Hasimara came up after the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict. Located in Alipurduar district of north-eastern West Bengal, it lies near the Indo-Bhutan border and is the closest Indian airbase to the strategic Chumbi Valley – the tri-junction between Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet.The squadron at Ambala is being commanded by Group Captain Harkirat Singh, who is among the three Group Captains who trained on the Rafales in France. According to sources, he is being given the responsibility of raising the new squadron at Hasimara so that his expertise and experience can be utilized optimally.The last aircraft to operate out of Hasimara were the Soviet origin MiG-27 ground attack aircraft.The Ministry of Defence had allocated a budget of Rs 400 crore for both airbases to create infrastructure, construct hangers and blast pens and develop maintenance and technical facilities to house the Rafale jets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-to-induct-second-squadron-of-rafale-fighter-jets-in-april-in-west-bengal-223770

I understand he wants to make a political statement but should that be done at the cost of women? This is irrespective of our politics. Can women in political organisations, especially the scene we saw in this protest by the Congress, be treated as bonded labourers. It is shocking no male member of the Congress even intervened to stop that." Hooda had earlier defended this, saying it was women who were feeling the pinch of the rising prices of cooking gas and other essentials.Taking a swipe at Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Irani, who is the women and child development minister, said her silence also speaks volumes about how the women in her party are reduced to tasks that even men refuse to do.Noting that Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar expressed his anguish at the protest on the floor of the Assembly, Irani said it was ironical that on the one hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for celebrating female potential and enterprise on International Women's Day and on the other, Hooda reduced their stature and compelled them to pull a tractor atop which he sat for a "political stunt".He did this for a "family enterprise" called the Congress, she said, noting that the incident had happened on International Women's Day on March 8.Echoing Khattar's view, she asked couldn't Hooda have extended the courtesy of allowing the women to ride the tractor, that too on International Women's Day.Asked if she had any demand, Irani quipped, "Should not they (Congress) have been conscientious enough to act on their own." Describing Hooda's conduct as "shocking and deeply distressing", Srinivasan said "such cruel, irresponsible behaviour does not befit someone who has held positions of great influence and power for considerable amount of time." She said Modi has introduced and implemented several programmes in Haryana state in which woman empowerment has been given top priority.Khattar has also done commendable work towards woman empowerment but, sadly, Hooda's behaviour negates the positive impact.The Haryana chief minister had turned emotional while criticising the protest, saying he could not sleep all night due to the visuals."This treatment to women MLAs was worse than bonded labour,” he had said in the state Assembly on Tuesday.Htting back, Hooda had said it was women who were feeling the pinch of the rising prices of cooking gas and other essentials.However, Khattar said if he had to protest, he should have pulled the tractor.On this, Hooda said, "The government has turned a blind eye to the pain of women who are sitting with farmers protesting on borders against farm laws. Power connections were cut at the protest site, you cannot see their pain." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/smriti-irani-attacks-cong-over-hooda-riding-tractor-pulled-by-women-bjps-women-wing-seeks-his-apology-223757

11-03-2021||New Delhi||Wrongful prosecution: Plea in SC seeks framing, implementation of guidelines||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre, all states and Union territories (UTs) to frame and implement guidelines to compensate victims of “wrongful prosecution” through government machineries. The PIL has been filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay in the backdrop of a sensational case in which the Allahabad High Court, on January 28, declared rape convict Vishnu Tiwari innocent, observing that the motive behind the FIR was related to a land dispute.Vishnu was arrested on September 16, 2000 after being booked for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and was in jail for 20 years.Using the shocking ordeal of the rape accused, the plea, filed through lawyer Ashwani Kumar Dubey, has alternatively urged the apex court to “use its plenary constitutional power to frame the guidelines for compensation to victims of wrongful prosecutions and direct the Centre and states to implement them till the recommendations of the Law Commission on miscarriage of justice are implemented religiously”.The PIL has made the Union ministries of Home Affairs, Law and Justice and the Law Commission as parties, besides all the states and UTs.“Direct the Centre to frame guidelines for compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No-277 on miscarriage of justice,” the plea says.It says due to cases of malicious prosecution, the injury caused to the citizens is extremely large and “because of the Centre’s inaction, citizens’ right to life, liberty and dignity, guaranteed under Article 21, is being brazenly offended”.Referring to a judgment, the plea says the Delhi High Court, while dealing with a plea on awarding sentences without reasoning, had expressed concerns about the wrongful implication of innocent persons who are acquitted after long years of incarceration and the lack of a legislative framework to provide relief to those who are wrongfully prosecuted.“The High Court, on 30.11.2017, directed the Law Commission of India to undertake a comprehensive examination of the issue of relief and rehabilitation to victims of wrongful prosecution and incarceration and the Law Commission submitted its Report No.277 on 30.8.2018 but the Centre has not taken appropriate steps to implement the recommendations,” it says.The plea says there has been a spurt in the number of false cases and wrongful prosecution and the incarceration of innocent persons with no effective statutory and legal mechanism available to them to address the same is causing “miscarriage of justice” and has created a black hole in the criminal jurisprudence in the country.“There are many startling cases which show the gross abuse of power and authority by the State and vexatious complainant, which caused absolute ‘miscarriage of justice’ by irreparable damage to right to life, liberty and dignity of innocent citizens in the justice dispensation with no relief given by the courts,” it says. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wrongful-prosecution-plea-in-sc-seeks-framing-implementation-of-guidelines-223734

They vary only in degrees,” Mayawati stated on Wednesday following conclusion of the meetings.She said the BJP governments at the Centre and in UP were trying to crush its opponents, and urged party workers to be cautious of those of compromising characters in the Dalit community.She held Congress’ alleged anti-people and corrupt policies squarely responsible for BJP’s political ascendancy. She asked cadre to intensify efforts to strengthen Bahujan movement, which was started by BSP founder late Kanshi Ram in line with the vision of Dr BR Ambedkar.“Efforts must be made to make BSP a viable alternative to form government in the state.”Mayawati had commenced the review meetings on February 5 to take stock of the party’s affairs in all the 75 districts and the 18 “Mandals” in UP.It has been decided to roll out BSP’s enrolment drive in the state in view of the forthcoming elections to Panchayat and Urban Bodies.The proposed enrolment drive was aimed to reclaim the party’s social and political base which reportedly eroded since 2014 General Election, especially after the BJP formed government on its own in UP.Also, the party has decided to celebrate Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary across UP on March 15.Party cadres have been directed to organise conferences on the anniversary day to highlight the Bahujan movement.Besides, the party will organise public meetings to highlight alleged failure of the Union and the UP governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-says-both-bjp-and-congress-dangerous-223731

The four citizen-centric areas for reforms identified by the Department of Expenditure were — implementation of One Nation-One Ration Card system; ease of doing business reform; urban local body and utility reforms; and power sector reforms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/17-states-operationalise-one-nation-one-ration-card-system-223730

11-03-2021||Mumbai||Strict lockdown will be enforced in parts of Maharashtra: CM Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said strict lockdown measures will be enforced in some parts of the state to contain the spread of COVID-19.Thackeray, 60, was speaking after receiving the first dose of the vaccine against COVID-19 at the government-run J J Hospital here.Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 13,659 new coronavirus cases, the highest one-day spike this year, which took the state’s caseload to 22,52,057.The state has so far reported 52,610 deaths due to the disease, as per official data.“Some areas of Maharashtra will witness strict lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus infection. The government is going to hold a special meeting with officials before coming out with the lockdown measures,” Thackeray said.He said the government has been requesting people to wear mask, maintain physical distance and avoid moving out unnecessarily.Earlier in the day, Minister Nitin Raut announced a “strict lockdown” in the Nagpur Police Commissionerate limits from March 15 to 21.Raut is the guardian minister of Nagpur.Last month, lockdown was enforced in Amravati, while certain restrictions were imposed in some other districts of the Amravati division.Meanwhile, the chief minister took the first shot of ‘Covaxin’ vaccine at the J J Hospital here on Thursday, state Director of Medical Education and Research Dr T P Lahane said.His wife Rashmi Thackeray and mother-in-law also received the vaccine doses.The CM was accompanied by his son and state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray.Asked about more COVID-19 cases being found in apartments and multi-storey buildings than in slums in Mumbai, Lahane said though the number of cases is going up, it has still not reached an alarming level.“If people still continue to take advantage of the relaxation in curbs, then the state will have to revert to strict lockdown measures, including restrictions on movement,” he said, and appealed to people to follow all precautions. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strict-lockdown-will-be-enforced-in-parts-of-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-223716

Say for example, with information security or logistics arrangements to where we can share more information with India so we can build a common strategic understanding of the types of threats that we face together,” Helvey said.“Look at how we can use our forces and Indian forces in the Indian Ocean region and beyond to be able to work together, whether it’s in maritime domain awareness or maritime security or humanitarian assistance and disaster response,” Helvey said.Admiral Phil Davidson, Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, responding to the same question said that over the course of his tenure at INDOPACOM there has been some opportunity to cooperate in the maritime and to assist a little bit in information sharing, some cold-weather gear, and things like that with India’s challenges along the Line of Actual Control with China.“I think it’s gone a long way to deepening our relationship and really presents a key strategic opportunity I think, for the United States,” he said.In his prepared testimony, Helvey said that in South Asia, America’s Major Defense Partnership with India continues to deepen as the two nations build interoperability through increasingly complex exercises and growing defence trade, and through expanded information sharing and secure communications to address issues of shared concern.“With the completion of all foundational agreements, the partnership is now poised to accelerate. We also are pursuing emerging partnerships with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Maldives to work cooperatively to ensure the region remains free and open,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-aims-at-helping-india-develop-its-own-defence-industrial-base-top-pentagon-official-223712

11-03-2021||New Delhi||HC sets aside order granting divorce to husband due to non-appearance of wife during COVID pandemic||The Delhi High Court has set aside an order granting divorce to a husband on the ground of non-appearance of wife before the family court during the COVID-19 pandemic.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said the family court's September 24, 2020 judgement cannot sustain as it has been passed without granting due opportunity to the woman to contest the divorce petition in which she had already filed her written statement. “On March 16, 2020, when the matter was fixed before the family court, the pandemic had already set-in and the functioning of the courts was also severely restricted. In fact, the courts subordinate to this court were specifically instructed not to pass any adverse orders against those who did not appear either physically or in proceedings through video conferencing due to the pandemic,” the bench said.The high court also said no doubt the woman's counsel did not appear before the family court on March 16, 2020 but “we are of the view that in the light of the then prevailing circumstances, the family court should have waited for the woman to appear and contest the proceedings, rather than hurriedly proceeding ex-parte against her”.It set aside the trial court's judgement granting divorce and remanded the case to the family court for re-adjudication from the stage the woman, represented through advocate Preeti Singh, was proceeded ex-parte.It also made clear that while setting aside the judgement, it has not gone into the merits of the case and it shall not influence the mind of the family court in deciding the divorce petition.The couple got married in February 2013 and were living separately since March 2013. One son was born out of marital wedlock and the husband had filed divorce petition before the Patiala House family court here on the ground of cruelty.Since the woman or her counsel did not appear before the family court on March 16, last year, she was proceeded ex-parte. Thereafter, the family court fixed the matter for hearing through video conferencing as physical hearings were not being held on account of the pandemic.As the woman did not appear in those proceedings, the court passed an ex-parte judgement and allowed the divorce petition filed by the husband.Challenging the family court's order, advocate Singh submitted that the wife had been regularly appearing before the court since filing of the petition but she could not appear on one day, that is, March 16, 2020 and the family court hurriedly proceeded against her ex-parte.The counsel also referred to the high court's March 13, 2020 notification in which it had asked the lawyers to advise their clients not to visit the court unless directed by the court. It was also directed that no adverse orders would be passed due to non-appearance of parties during the pandemic.

11-03-2021|| Parbhani||5 years after return to India from Pakistan, Geeta may have found her family||No DNA test has been conducted yet but for 29-year-old Geeta, who returned to India from Pakistan in 2015 after going there when she was nine, the search for her biological mother may have ended, an NGO says.Geeta, who returned to India on October 26, 2015, after intervention by then External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, was initially lodged at a facility of a hearing and speech impaired institute run by an Indore-based NGO.The over five-year-long search to find Geeta’s family led to Parbhani in Maharashtra, where she is now being trained in sign language by Pahal, an NGO working for the hearing and speech impaired.Speaking to PTI, Dr Anand Selgaokar of Pahal said Geeta was handed over to Anand Services Society, another Indore-based NGO, on July 20, 2020, and Gyanendra Purohit of that NGO first came to Parbhani in December last year.The search in the last five years involved the screening process of at least a dozen families from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana and Rajasthan after claims that they were Geetas blood relations.Purohit said the search led the NGO to Meena Waghmare (71) who lived in Jintur in Parbhani district, when her daughter Radha (Geeta) went missing.“Meena told us that her daughter has a burn mark on her stomach and when we checked, it turned out to be true,” Purohit said.Geeta’s father and Meena’s first husband Sudhakar Waghmare died some years ago and she now lives near Aurangabad with her second husband, Purohit said.Tears rolled down Meena’s eyes as she met Geeta for the first time, he said. Geeta did not understand a word of what Meena said as being speech and hearing impaired, she communicates only through sign language.It is likely that Geeta reached Parbhani and boarded the Sachkhand Express to Amritsar and later boarded the Delhi-Lahore Samjhauta Express, Selgaonkar said.Geeta has now spent around a month-and-a-half in Parbhani and often meets with Meena and the latter’s married daughter, who also lives in the Marathwada region.“It is for the government authorities to decide on when to conduct a DNA test. Till then Geeta will continue to receive training at Pahal,” Selgaonkar said.Pakistani media reported that Geeta, who was rescued by a social welfare organisation in Pakistan after she mistakenly ended up in that country before being sent back to India in 2015, has been reunited with her real mother in Maharashtra.Bilquees Edhi the wife of late Abdul Sattar Edhi, who now runs the world-famous Edhi Welfare Trust and who developed a close bond with Geeta said the Indian girl had finally been reunited with her real mother in Maharashtra state, Dawn newspaper reported.“She has been in touch with me and this weekend she finally told me the good news about meeting her real mother,” Bilquees said.Bilquees said they had found Geeta when she was around 11-12 years old at a railway station and gave her shelter at their centre in Karachi.“Somehow she strayed into Pakistan and was shelterless when we found her in Karachi,” she said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-years-after-return-to-india-from-pakistan-geeta-may-have-found-her-family-223675

US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the first summit in a virtual format along with Australia PM Scott Morrison and Japan PM Yoshihide Suga.During the summit, the Quad leaders will discuss regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. — PTIHope quad is conducive to peace: ChinaBeijing: A wary China on Wednesday hoped that India, US, Japan and Australia will do things in the Quad summit that are “conducive” to regional peace and stability instead of the “opposite”.

Although the ministers are hoping for proceedings to resume from Monday, the Congress appeared adamant on fuel cost discussions in which it sees political gains with elections due in four states and Puducherry.Congress deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma today said the government had a duty to answer and the Opposition a right to ask.“In both Houses, the Opposition must be given space and voice.

There are only two groups – one led by Oomen Chandy and the other by Ramesh Chennithala. The state unit functions like a coordination committee of the two groups,” said Chacko alleging that state leaders were not being consulted on candidatures.Concerns should have been addressed in timeCongress spokesperson Pawan Khera reflected Rahul’s sentiment while reacting to Chacko’s charge of groupism in the party.Sources said Chacko’s concerns should have been addressed in time.“There is no internal democracy left in the party,” he said adding that when he messaged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi about grievances, the latter replied: “is this absolutely urgent.”“I’ve sent my resignation to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The party can’t be run by one central character. There’s no democracy left. I don’t think my resignation will matter to anyone. I am a small worker,” said Chacko who was trusted enough by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to be appointed chairman of the joint parliamentary committee on 2G spectrum allocations during UPA 2. Chacko hasn’t revealed future plans but indications are he’s in touch with the NCP. He is the second Kerala Congress leader to quit after Tom Vadakkan, who joined the BJP.Chacko’s resignation comes close after Rahul Gandhi told an Indian Youth Congress conference that leaders were free to leave. The Congress is banking heavily on a win in Kerala to redeem the political reputation of Rahul Gandhi, a Lok Sabha MP from state’s Wayanad.No groups in Cong: AnandThere are no two groups in the Congress.

I will fulfil my duties with complete responsibility”.Observers Raman Singh and Dushyant Gautam, who were sent by the state leadership to gauge the mood, had flagged the MLAs’ resentment over Trivendra Singh’s “style of functioning and lack of control over the bureaucrats”.Some in the party even said that Trivendra Singh’s “uninspiring” leadership had the potential to damage the BJP’s prospects in 2022.Prime Minister Modi, Shah and Nadda congratulated Tirath Singh on taking oath as the new CM of Uttarakhand. “He brings with him vast administrative and organisational experience. I am confident under his leadership the state will continue to scale new heights of progress,” the PM said.

The peaceful bandh will remain effective from morning till evening,” he told reporters at the Singhu border.On March 19, the farmers will observe “Mandi Bachao-Kheti Bachao” day, he said.The farmer unions have also decided to celebrate ‘Shaheedi divas’ of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, Burjgill added.Farmers’ leaders also said that copies of the new farm laws will be burnt during ‘Holika Dahan’ on March 28.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points—Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—for over four months, demanding the repeal of farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-call-for-bharat-bandh-on-march-26-as-protests-complete-4-months-223326
11-03-2021||Nandigram/Kolkata||Mamata injured after being ‘manhandled’ during poll campaign in Nandigram, taken to hospital||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee alleged on Wednesday that she was attacked by “four-five men” who manhandled her during the election campaign in Nandigram, because of which she was injured in the left leg.The incident happened around 6.15 pm when Banerjee was about to leave Birulia area near Reyapara after praying at a local temple.“I was standing outside my car with the door open. I was praying from there on seeing a temple. Few people came around my car and pushed the door. The door hit my leg,” she said.Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has sought a report from the state police on the alleged attack on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.“We have sought a report from the state police administration. The report must be sent quickly,” the official of the state CEO’s office said.Banerjee alleged that she was pushed by four-five men while she was trying to get into the car, following which fell flat on her face.The chief minister said that her leg got swollen because of the injury and she was feeling feverish, besides having chest pain.Pointing to her leg, she told reporters, “See how it has swollen.”“Some people deliberately did it. Of course, it is a conspiracy. There were no local policemen around me, neither the district police superintendent was present at the spot,” she alleged.The chief minister also has severe pain in the waist, TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, who is at present in Nandigram, said.Banerjee was seen being carried by her security personnel to the backseat of her SUV from the front seat, which she usually occupies during travel, as she was in pain.A white cloth was also wrapped around her injured leg.The incident triggered a security scare as the chief minister gets Z-plus protection.Banerjee, who was supposed to stay the night in Nandigram in the Purba Medinipur district, was rushed back to Kolkata, around 130 km away, through a green corridor.She was taken to the state-run SSKM Hospital for treatment.The state government constituted a team of five senior doctors to treat Banerjee, Health Department sources said.In the team were a cardiologist, an endocrinologist, a general surgery doctor, an orthopedist and a medicine doctor, they said.Banerjee was taken to the 12.5 special cabin in the Woodburn Block of the hospital on a stretcher as her convoy reached the hospital, amid a huge presence of her supporters who raised slogans against the BJP.“We will stabilise her first. An X-ray will be conducted on her leg. We need to find out the degree of her injury and then the course of our treatment will be decided,” a doctor at the hospital told PTI.The chief minister’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, a TMC MP, and state ministers Partha Chatterjee, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee were present at the hospital.State Health Secretary NS Nigam was also present.Banerjee was in Nandigram over the last two days to campaign for the upcoming elections. Earlier in the day, she filed her nominations in Haldia.Banerjee is pitted from the seat against her former aide Suvendu Adhikari, who switched over to the BJP a few months back.The TMC leadership claimed that the attack was a well-planned conspiracy to “remove her” from the poll campaign.“Many people don’t want her to campaign for the elections. They want her to be removed from their path. That is why she has been attacked by goons. People will give a befitting reply,” state minister and senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee said.The BJP alleged that Banerjee was trying to turn a “simple accident” into a “pre-planned conspiracy”, and demanded a CBI investigation.“It can happen that she met with an accident but to claim that she was deliberately pushed is not acceptable. She has a lot of security personnel guarding her round the clock,” BJP’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said.“Such tactics to gain sympathy are unacceptable. I think the matter should be handed over to the CBI for an investigation,” he added.State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury said such “tactics to gain sympathy” would not work this time.“Mamata Banerjee is the police minister of the state and if she is not safe then she should immediately resign from the post,” he said.CPI(M) candidate from Nandigram Minakshi Mukherjee wished her a speedy recovery, but asserted that “people would not be fooled this time”.

11-03-2021||Washington||US provided some info, equipment to India during its border crisis with China: Pentagon Commander||The US provided some information, cold-weather clothing and some other equipment to India during its recent border crisis with China, which has adopted an increasingly assertive military posture to exert pressure and expand its influence across the region, a top Pentagon commander has told American lawmakers.Admiral Philips Davidson, Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, also told the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that China’s recent activities along the Line of Actual Control have opened India’s eyes to what cooperative effort with others might mean for their own defensive needs as he observed that New Delhi, in the very near term, will deepen its engagement with the Quad.“India has long had an approach called strategic autonomy, you know, a nonaligned approach with others, but I think certainly the activities along the Line of Actual Control with China has opened their eyes to what cooperative effort with others might mean for their own defensive needs,” Admiral Davidson told lawmakers during the Congressional hearing.“We have provided some information to India in that crisis, cold-weather closing, clothing, some other equipment, some things like that, and over the last several years, we have been deepening our maritime cooperation,” he said.China moved over 60,000 well-armed troops who were mobilised for annual exercises, to contentious areas like Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh in May last year, prompting India to match the PLA’s mobilisation which led to an over eight-month long standoff.After lengthy rounds of talks, the two sides simultaneously withdrew troops from Pangong Lake area last month while talks are on for the withdrawal of soldiers from the rest of the areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“I think you will see India in the very near term, you know, remain committed to their non-aligned approach, but I think they will deepen their engagement with the Quad, and I think that’s a key strategic opportunity for us, Australia, and Japan,” Davidson said, ahead of the maiden Quad Leaders’ Summit involving the top leaders from Australia, India, Japan and the United States on Friday.US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the first Leaders’ Summit of Quad in a virtual format on Friday along with Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison and Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga.During the summit, the Quad leaders will discuss regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.The Admiral was responding to a question from Senator Angus King. “That would be a geopolitical major development if India more closely aligned with those other countries,” King said responding to the answer from the admiral.“India has always been a neutral country, if you will. Are we developing a stronger alliance with them? You mentioned them as part of the Quad. Do they consider themselves a member of something of that nature?” King asked.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.‘Historic opportunity to deepen ties’Admiral Davidson also said the current state of US-India relations presents a historic opportunity to deepen bilateral defence ties and solidify what he described as the ‘defining partnership of the 21st century’.The US and Indian navies are now securely sharing information, and India has substantially increased its acquisition of US defence equipment, he said.The United States strongly supports India’s establishment of an information fusion centre focusing on maritime domain awareness, which will improve maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region and Bay of Bengal, he said.The two countries, he said, concluded several agreements, including the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018, which has greatly enhanced information sharing and interoperability.The Industrial Security Annex (ISA), signed in December 2019 allows for the transfer of technologies in support of defence production while the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) allows sharing of unclassified geospatial information. The two countries also signed in October 2020 an agreement on Navy-to-Navy Information Sharing.“Defence sales are at an all-time high with India operating US-sourced platforms such as P-8s, C-130Js, C-17s, AH-64s, CH-47s, Precision Guided-Excalibur Munitions, and M777 howitzers,” he told lawmakers adding that in February, India agreed to acquire Apache and MH-60R multi-mission helicopters worth USD3.1 billion and is considering other US systems.USINDOPACOM defines the security relationship with India as a strategic imperative, Davidson said.“We expect substantial progress on interoperability and information sharing, service-level and joint military-to-military cooperation and exercises like TIGER TRIUMPH and MALABAR, and an increase in quadrilateral collaboration between India, Australia, Japan, and the United States as the relationship continues to mature,” he said.

The party can’t be run on one central pole or force anymore. There’s no democracy in Congress,” said Chacko who was trusted enough by Sonia Gandhi to be appointed the chairman of the joint parliamentary committee to probe 2G spectrum allocation in UPA 2.Chacko has not yet revealed his future plans but is expected to join the NCP, said sources.He’s the second senior Kerala Congress leader to quit after Tom Vadakkan who went on to join the BJP.Meanwhile, Chacko’s resignation comes close after Rahul Gandhi told an Indian Youth Congress conference that leaders were free to leave and the party would continue opposing the BJP and RSS.The exit of Chacko, however, indicates fragility of the Congress in Kerala from where Rahul Gandhi is an MP.The development doesn’t augur well for the Congress which continues to face questions on the leadership of the Gandhis and also continues to face defections.Inaccessibility of leaders to Sonia Gandhi, concentration of power in the office of Rahul Gandhi and a weakening political narrative are matters of growing concern to Congress leaders within and several are waiting for the results of upcoming state elections to take their respective decisions on which way to go.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pc-chacko-resigns-from-congress-alleges-groupism-in-kerala-unit-223263

11-03-2021||New Delhi||BJP 'chooses' Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat as next Uttarakhand CM||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday “chose” Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat as the successor for Trivendra Singh Rawat, who resigned as the Chief Minister on Tuesday.Rawat’s name was announced by the outgoing CM during the meeting of the Uttarakhand BJP party. Later, the 56-year-old was sworn-in by Governor Baby Rani Maurya. Read also | Tirath Singh Rawat: Unassuming, down-to-earth leaderSince names of at least half a dozen state ministers and MPs—which included Dhan Singh Rawat, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Satpal Maharaj, Ajay Bhat, Anil Baluni—were doing the rounds, the selection of the low-profile Rawat came as surprise for many party leaders.Meanwhile, the task ahead for Rawat—who has served in various capacities in the state organisation, also as the BJP president, and also as the first Education Minister of the newly-formed Uttarakhand— is cut out, and even challenging.Currently, Rawat come from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), background, and has the definitive challenge to return his party to power in the Assembly elections next year.Sources revealed that he was “chosen by the central leadership” over other candidates with “great care”, bearing in mind the prevailing political situation, the caste, and regional play, and his own “uncontroversial, clean and committed image”.Interestingly, in the last Assembly elections in 2017, state cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj was given the ticket from Chaubattakhal instead of Rawat.“He accepted the decision quietly as a true soldier of the party,” said sources. Then in 2019, he was fielded from the Garhwal Lok Sabha constituency in place of former CM BS Khanduri.  Today, Rawat thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and, party president JP Nadda for entrusting him this important assignment.“As someone coming from a small village, I never imagined that someday I will be given such a huge responsibility. I am just a small ‘karyakarta’ (party worker) of the BJP. I will make all efforts to meet the party’s and people’s expectations and take forward work done in past four years,” he said. Talking about the challenges before him—including, steering the BJP back to victory in the next elections—he said: “Challenges are always there in life. I will fulfill my duties with complete responsibility”. Observers—Raman Singh and Dushyant Gautam—who were sent by the state leadership to gauge the mood had pointed MLAs’ resentment with Trivendra Singh’s “style of functioning and lack of control over the bureaucrats”.Apparently, some also said that Trivendra Singh’s “uninspiring” leadership had the potential to damage BJP’s prospects in 2022.  This, and some other reasons—including rumours and allegations of corruption—led the central leadership to affect the sudden change in the state it won with a huge majority in 2017.Modi, Shah, and Nadda congratulated Tirath Singh on taking oath as the new CM of Uttarakhand.“He brings with him vast administrative and organisational experience. I am confident under his leadership the state will continue to scale new heights of progress", said The Prime Minister.State president Bansidhar Bhagat described him as someone connected with the grassroots, and one who understands the organisation well.Incidentally, Rawat is the fifth CM from the Pauri region. His appointment is being seen with importance, and influence of the region in state politics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-chooses-garhwal-mp-tirath-singh-rawat-as-next-uttarakhand-cm-223224
