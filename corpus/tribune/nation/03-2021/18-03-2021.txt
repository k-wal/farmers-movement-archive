The hot fire test of the core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will simulate a launch by firing the engines while anchored to a tower.NASA aims to return US astronauts to the moon by 2024 but the SLS programme is three years behind schedule and nearly $3 billion over budget. The last astronaut to walk on the moon was Eugene Cernan in December 1972.NASA previously tested all four engines of its behemoth core stage in January, but the test lasted for about a minute—well short of the roughly four minutes engineers needed.For Thursday’s test, engineers are aiming to fire the rocket’s four RS-25 engines at the same time for eight minutes.If successful, the Space Launch System will then go to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for integration with Lockheed Martin Corp’s Orion spacecraft.The hot fire is the eighth and final test of the Green Run series to ensure the core stage of the SLS rocket is ready to launch Artemis missions to the moon. Artemis I is scheduled in November to orbit the moon with an uncrewed spacecraft but that date is likely to change.Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin are racing to send their own crewed missions to space for the first time. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nasa-to-test-rocket-engines-that-could-eventually-send-humans-to-the-moon-227123

18-03-2021||New Delhi||Talking ‘unofficially' to both sides for early solution: Governor Malik on govt-farmers stalemate||Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik has said he was talking "unofficially" to the agitating farmers and the government to press for an early solution to the stalemate over the contentious agri laws, adding there was a growing understanding within the two sides that a resolution needs to be found at the earliest.Malik, who hails from Baghpat in western Uttar Pradesh, asserted the issue of farmers needs to be resolved soon else it will damage the BJP in Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. He also expressed regret that "no one has uttered even a single word" at the death of agitating farmers during the over 100-day protest by them.Referring to the deadlock persisting between the protesting farmers and the government despite several rounds of talk Malik said no one is being unreasonable in the government and only those who want to damage the party are opposing an early solution."I am of the opinion that there should be a solution to the problem at the earliest, and I am hopeful now of an early solution because there seems to be not much distance between the viewpoints of the two sides."I am talking unofficially to both the sides pressing for an early solution. There is a growing understanding within the farmer community that a solution needs to be found at the earliest as well as the government," Malik told NDTV.Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri on Delhi borders since November with a demand the Centre repeal the three contentious farm laws and make a new one that would ensure a legal guarantee on the MSP. The protest is also going on in several parts of the country on the issue. The government, however, has held that the laws were pro-farmer."No one is unreasonable in the government—neither the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) nor other people. Only those people will oppose an early solution to the problem, who want to damage the party. I am hopeful of an early solution to this, as otherwise, the issue will damage the party in Western UP, Haryana and Rajasthan," he added."I have been asked by the media why I am talking about the issues despite being on a Constitutional post, and I explained that even if a dog is killed, there are condolence messages pouring in from everywhere and here 250 farmers are dead the border, no one has uttered even a single word," he added."By not talking about it, we have left the entire turf for opponents who are talking and taking political mileage from it," he said.Malik said he was born and brought up among the farming community and that is why he was pained about the situation. He said he is not worried as to what his former party members in the BJP will think of him for his statements on the issue."I was born and brought up with this community and that is why I am pained about the situation of farmers today. No, I am not scared because whenever leaders of my party feel that I am creating problems for them and the same is conveyed to me, I will immediately leave and raise the same voice as an individual," he said.The government has held several rounds of talks with farmer leaders, but they have been inconclusive so far."And if you cast aspersions on the agitation, then let me tell you that the anger and alienation level is too high among the farming community. The solution will be found soon as reasonability within the farming community as well as the government is growing. Now the government should call them and start a dialogue," he said. Earlier, siding with farmers, Malik had on Sunday urged Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah not to "offend" them.Speaking at an event in his home district Baghpat, he had said if the Centre gives the legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, farmers will relent. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talking-unofficially-to-both-sides-for-early-solution-governor-malik-on-govt-farmers-stalemate-227094

18-03-2021||Mumbai||Ambani security scare: Two cars allegedly used by Vaze seized||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday seized two more luxury cars allegedly used by suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, sources said.A Toyota Land Cruiser Prado was found parked outside Vaze’s residence in Saket area of adjoining Thane, an agency official said. A Mercedes car was also seized but it was not clear from where it was picked up.The total number of vehicles seized has gone up to five, including another Mercedes, a Scorpio and an Innova.The vehicles were brought to the NIA office at Cumballa Hill on Pedder Road here.The NIA on Thursday called two policemen, including an aide of Vaze and a senior police inspector, for questioning, sources said.The NIA arrested Vaze on Saturday night in connection with the security scare outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani.Under fire over handling of the bomb scare outside Ambani’s house, Maharashtra Government on Wednesday shifted Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh to the Home Guard.Senior IPS officer Hemant Nagrale has replaced Singh as Mumbai police commissioner.The NIA on Tuesday seized a black Mercedes from the Crawford market area in Mumbai and recovered from it the original number place of the explosive-laden SUV that was placed outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence ‘Antilia’ on February 25.A 27-year-old travel operator said on Wednesday he sold the Mercedes-Benz car in February to a website that deals in used vehicles. He said he did not know Vaze.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said Singh was transferred after some of his colleagues committed “serious and unforgivable mistakes”.In his first public comments after Singh’s transfer, Deshmukh said he was shifted to ensure that the probe into police officer Sachin Vaze episode is conducted “properly and without hindrance”.Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the NIA are conducting the probe into the episode “professionally”.He said that action will be taken against whoever is found guilty in the respective probes by the NIA and ATS.“This is not an administrative transfer (of Singh).Some things have come to light through the probes conducted by the NIA and the ATS,” Deshmukh said.“Some of the colleagues of the (former) Mumbai police chief (Singh) committed some serious mistakes. Those are unforgivable mistakes. Hence, he was transferred. Further action will be taken based on the probe report,” he added.Asked about the BJP and the MNS’s allegation that political bosses of the officials are not being acted against, Deshmukh said, “The NIA and ATS are conducting the probe professionally. They will definitely find out whoever is guilty.”Vaze was arrested by the NIA on March 13 in the probe into recovery of explosives from the SUV. He was later suspended.Vaze, an “encounter specialist”, has also been facing heat in the murder case of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of that SUV. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane district on March 5.The ATS is investigating the Hiran murder case. It had registered an FIR against unidentified people days after Hiran’s body was found.Hiran’s wife accused Vaze of involvement in her husband’s suspicious death. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ambani-security-scare-two-cars-allegedly-used-by-vaze-seized-227090

The NHAI has broadly identified the spots, and procedure for appointment of a consultant to carry out a detailed study, and to prepare a technical proposal for improving the efficacy of the corridor has been started,” added Gadkari.The Ludhiana MP "wanted to know whether the government was aware of the problems faced by the commuters due to regular heavy traffic congestion at several places on the National Highway, connecting Delhi and Punjab, mainly due to non-completion, and delay in construction of flyovers, bridges etc".Despite this, he also needed to know about the steps taken by the government to ensure the timely completion of all scheduled projects on the highway, which could enable smooth travelling for the commuters. Gadkari answered that for road construction, the work was being executed by different agencies of the ministry, and the e-tendering process is followed. “Moreover, MoRTH has devised Model Request for Proposal /Concession Agreements for a different type of modes of execution in which provisions of imposing a penalty for non-adherence to project deadlines have also been prescribed,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commuters-face-problems-between-delhi-punjab-nitin-gadkari-blames-113-day-long-farmers-protest-227089

18-03-2021||London||UK vaccine timetable disruption linked to supply delays from India||As the UK's National Health Service warned of a “significant reduction in weekly supply” of vaccines to protect against COVID-19 by the end of this month, the focus on Thursday turned to 5 million doses that are expected to be delivered from India.The Serum Institute of India (SII), which is producing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines under the label of Covishield as part of a tie-up, was contracted to supply a total of 10 million doses to the UK.While five million of these have been received, the remaining batch is now held up with some reports indicating that the Indian government may be weighing up domestic needs before clearing exports.“A number of global manufacturers are experiencing issues,” UK Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told BBC when asked if the delay had an Indian connection.“We have learned from some of our manufacturers that there are going to be some supply issues in the last few days,” he said.Jenrick stressed that the government remains on track to meet its July-end target to vaccinate all adults in the UK."But the main thing is we're still very much on course, we've still got line of sight to deliver the vaccines and to meet our targets," he said.An SII spokesperson told BBC: "Five million doses had been delivered a few weeks ago to the UK, and we will try to supply more later, based on the current situation and the requirement for the government immunisation programme in India." Under UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap for easing England's lockdown, more restrictions will be lifted at the end of this month before non-essential shops, hairdressers and gyms reopen on April 12.Jenrick insisted there was "no reason to believe the roadmap is affected by this temporary shortage in supply".The concerns emerged this week when in a letter to local health authorities, NHS England's vaccine programme in-charge had issued a letter to local authorities to warn that they currently predict the shortage of doses will continue for a four-week period, as a result of reductions in inbound vaccines supply and therefore called for a strict delivery schedule only for the most vulnerable groups over-50.Vaccination centres were told to close unfilled bookings from March 29 onwards and to ensure no further appointments are scheduled for the whole of April.‘The Telegraph' quoted SII CEO Adar Poonawalla as saying that the supply system is “solely dependent on India, and it has nothing to do with the SII”.“It is to do with the Indian government allowing more doses to the UK," he was quoted as saying, as he confirmed that 5 million doses of Covishield had already been delivered to the UK in early March.According to the UK media reports, although the aim had been for SII to deliver the remaining 5 million doses in March, there is no set time schedule for the delivery of the remaining contracted doses.The rest of the UK's AstraZeneca doses are being produced domestically and the company says there are no supply issues.Pfizer, which produces its BioNTech collaborated vaccine in Belgium, says its deliveries to the NHS are also on track.“We will do all we can, and do everything necessary, to secure the supplies that are contractually committed to protecting people in this country,” UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said at a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday evening.“I'm 42, and I'm as eager as anyone to get the jab. But before we forge ahead, I want us to be confident that we've done everything we can to protect those most in need of protection,” he said.He was speaking as the NHS marked its 100th day since the first vaccination in December 2020 and confirmed that over 25 million people have now been vaccinated against coronavirus across the UK.“This latest milestone is an incredible achievement – representing 25 million reasons to be confident for the future as we cautiously reopen society,” said Johnson.The latest Public Health England (PHE) data shows that around 90 per cent of people aged around 70 and above have anti-Covid antibodies. It is being seen as a reason behind deaths from COVID-19 falling fast, down by more than a third last week.On Wednesday, the UK recorded another 141 deaths, taking the country's death toll from the COVID-19 to 125,831.However, the number of positive cases still remains high, as it jumped by another 5,758 to hit 4,274,579. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-vaccine-timetable-disruption-linked-to-supply-delays-from-india-227083

18-03-2021||New Delhi||Sachin Vaze case: Speculations fly high about ‘real reasons and real masterminds’||Amid reports about suspended Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze “planning” it all—that is, planting explosives outside Antilia—to prove he is “still good in solving cases” and that he did it all to “be in the limelight”, social media is rife about the presence of “real reasons and masterminds”.In fact, the conclusion has raised quite a few eyebrows with social media users alleging a “cover-up to protect real culprits behind the conspiracy”.Mumbai top cop transferred due to serious mistakes by some of his colleagues: MinisterApart from the regular extortion and betting angles, which former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also alleged on Wednesday pointing the needle of suspicion towards Shiv Sena, BJP’s rivals are claiming that the situation was “created” to “help” billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani get the permission to land helicopters at his residence and, also “some sympathy” amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation.Political sources agree that Sachin Vaze “cannot be the real mastermind”.“He may have been receiving orders from someone else, perhaps the real masterminds,” they add.Ambani security scare: Another luxury car used by Vaze seized“The NIA has ruled out a terror angle. Param Bir Singh was transferred after the NIA discovered the Mercedes car (allegedly) belonging to Vaze,” they say. Reports suggest that Vaze has told the NIA that he “hatched the conspiracy at the behest of someone else and, also to gain some publicity”.The NIA is expected to call Param Bir Singh for questioning, it is being said. Terming Param Bir and Vaze “small players”, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday those “operating Vaze are still sitting in the government”.“Who will investigate them,” he questioned.  “This is not a failure of police but the government,” said Fadnavis, claiming “deeper links” between Vaze and Shiv Sena.Fadnavis also related how “Uddhav and many other Sena leaders” approached him to get the suspended high-profile cop reinstated.  He also alleged that Vaze, who also served as a “spokesperson” of the party, had “business relations” with “active members of the party".The issue became murkier after the National Investigation Agency seized a Mercedes car, which it claims belongs to the suspended Mumbai Police officer. The car contained the original number plate of the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Rs 5,75,000 in cash, a note counting machine, a set of clothes and kerosene concealed in its boot, it is being said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sachin-vaze-case-speculations-fly-high-about-real-reasons-and-real-masterminds-227081

However, Gilber and Rudnick note that further long-term studies are needed to quantify the antibody response in babies born to vaccinated mothers."Protective efficacy in newborns and ideal timing of maternal vaccination remains unknown," the paediatricians wrote in the study."We urge other investigators to create pregnancy and breastfeeding registries as well as conduct efficacy and safety studies of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant and breastfeeding woman and their offspring," they added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-gives-birth-to-first-known-baby-with-antibodies-against-coronavirus-doctors-say-227061

18-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP scam: Probe agencies must act reasonably, do objective assessment, says Bombay HC||Referring to the ongoing probe into the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) scam, the Bombay High Court on Thursday said all state and central agencies must be objective and reasonable while carrying out an investigation.A Bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said a probe into a case cannot go on forever, and the “investigating machinery must stop at some stage”.“The ED, CBI, state police, all should be should act with reasonableness, objective assessment. They should not appear to be another form of trouble,” the court said.The Bench made the observations while hearing final arguments on the pleas filed by journalist Arnab Goswami, and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, the company that runs Republic TV channels, seeking several reliefs in the TRP scam case.The counsel for the petitioners, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, told the HC that the Mumbai police were prolonging their probe into the case without naming Goswami and other employees of the ARG Outlier Media as accused, but merely naming them as suspects in the charge sheet.To this, the Bench said the state must make a statement before the court on how long were the police likely to take to complete their probe into the case.“At which point will your officer say there is reason to believe that there is reason to arrest?” the bench asked.“If the state is really reasonable, the state should say we will complete our investigation within say 30 days.That is how reasonableness is shown,” it said.The Bench said that economic offences were not like probing cases of murder, where probe agencies had reasons to take longer time to complete investigations.“You cannot have it both ways. You cannot not make them an accused and then say you have evidence. If you have evidence, make them an accused so that they know what kind of relief can be granted against them,” HC said.The HC will continue hearing the arguments in the case on Monday.The ARG Outlier Media and Goswami approached the HC last year, filing a bunch of petitions seeking several reliefs in the TRP scam.They alleged that the whole case was malafide and they had been targeted for Republic TV’s reportage in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and Palghar lynching case last year.The Mumbai police in January this year filed two affidavits in the case, saying they had not targeted the Republic TV or its employees.The police had said their probe was not a result of any political vendetta and there was evidence to show that Goswami had connived with senior officials of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) to rig the TRP of Republic TV.The Republic TV has denied any wrongdoing.

Private vehicles will be de-registered after 20 years if found unfit or in case of a failure to renew registration certificates, the Minister said.The policy is in the interest of a clean environment and rider and pedestrian safety and creating an eco-system for phasing out of unfit and polluting vehicles, Gadkari said.“The objectives of the policy are to reduce the population of old and defective vehicles, achieve a reduction in vehicular air pollutants to fulfil India’s climate commitments, improve road and vehicular safety, achieve better fuel efficiency, formalise the currently informal vehicle scrapping industry, and boost the availability of low-cost raw materials for automotive, steel and electronics industry,” Gadkari added.The criteria of fitness will be through Automated Fitness Centres (AFCs) in case of commercial vehicles and non-renewal of registration in case of private vehicles.The Ministry will promote the setting up of AFCs on a PPP model by the state government, private sector, automobile companies, etc., Gadkari said.All vehicles of the central government, state government, municipal corporations, Panchayats, State Transport Undertakings, Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and autonomous bodies with the Union and state governments may be de-registered and scrapped after 15 years from the date of registration.The tentative date for scrappage of government and PSUs vehicles above 15 years of age is April 1, 2022.The new scrappage policy was proposed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech last month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vehicle-scrapping-policy-to-offer-about-5-pc-rebate-on-new-cars-gadkari-227039

18-03-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear on March 24 plea against opening of window for sale of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear on March 24 a fresh plea seeking a direction to the Centre and others to not open any further window for sale of electoral bonds during pendency of a PIL pertaining to funding of political parties and alleged lack of transparency in their accounts.A Bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian took note of the submission of an NGO that its plea be heard urgently.The hearing assume significance as it would take place ahead of Assembly polls in several states, including West Bengal.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, appearing for NGO Association for Democratic Reforms, said for the last two years, the PIL has not been listed for hearing.The Reserve Bank of India and the Election Commission have said that illicit monies are being transacted which is also detrimental to the economy, the lawyer said, adding that on April 1, the bonds will be issued and hence, the case needed an urgent hearing.The Bench asked Bhushan whether the plea for stay on the electoral bond scheme has been rejected earlier by the court.It has not been rejected “in clear terms” as the apex court had earlier asked the political parties to submit their account statements to the poll panel in sealed covers, Bhushan replied.Since then several developments have taken place and it has been said that the electoral bonds allow transactions of illicit money, he said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that Attorney General K K Venugopal would appear in the case.The bench fixed the fresh plea, filed in the pending PIL, for hearing on next Wednesday.The NGO, in its fresh plea, has claimed that there is a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming assembly elections, including in West Bengal and Assam, would further “increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies”.On January 20 last year, the apex court had refused to grant interim stay on the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme and sought responses of the Centre and the Election Commission on an interim application by the NGO seeking stay on the scheme.

18-03-2021||New Delhi||HC asks MEA official to coordinate with Saudi Embassy to facilitate repatriation of buried body||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) officials to coordinate with the Deputy Chief of Missions of Saudi Embassy here to facilitate the exhumation and repatriation of the remains of a Hindu man, an Indian citizen, who was wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim rites.The high court also requested the Deputy Chief of Mission to obtain some timeline within which the process of exhumation and repatriation of the body would be completed. Justice Prathiba M Singh said, "You can say it is a request from the court. Considering the sensitivity... you can put it to them.""In view of the fact that the timelines are not able to be given by MEA official appearing today, in order to emphasis on the sensitivity of the issue, the MEA official shall also coordinate/communicate with Deputy Chief of Missions, Saudi Arabia located in New Delhi and inform the fact that this court also seeks the same," the judge said and listed the matter for further hearing on March 24.The court was hearing a case in which the mortal remains of the Hindu man were wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim rites due to incorrect translation of his religion on the death certificate purportedly by Indian Consulate officials in Jeddah.The deceased's wife, who had been running from pillar to post to get the mortal remains, approached the high court seeking direction to the MEA to take steps to urgently exhume the remains and repatriate them to India in a time bound manner.Pursuant to the March 16 order, Director of Consulate Passport Visa, MEA appeared before the court and said there was no clarity on the timeline within which the body could be brought back to India and also assured the court that the matter was being followed up by them.Also read: Hindu man hailing from Himachal wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia; CM to take up matter with Centre The officer said that as per the existing protocol in Saudi Arabia, an Indian citizen's body cannot be disposed of without obtaining an NOC from the Indian Consulate. However, in this case, the procedure was not followed, he said.He said it could have happened because of COVID-19 and that the body was buried in a "non-Muslim cemetery". The court noted that the victim's employer in Saudi Arabia has sent the compensation cheque of Rs 4.68 lakh and it may be collected by the family from District Collector, Una in Himachal Pradesh. It also said the Indian Consulate may assist the petitioner woman with regard to any monetary benefits that she may get from the employer.The man, Sanjeev Kumar, died on January 24 in Saudi Arabia, where he was working, due to cardiac arrest and his mortal remains were kept at a hospital there.Petitioner Anju Sharma said in the plea that on getting the news of her husband's death, the family requested the authorities to repatriate the mortal remains."Shockingly, on February 18, the petitioner was informed that the body of her husband has been buried in Saudi Arabia while the family members of the deceased were waiting for the mortal remains in India."The officials in Indian Consulate explained that it was due to a mistake committed by the official translator of Indian Consulate, Jeddah, who wrongly mentioned his religion as 'Muslim' in the death certificate. They also shared a letter of apology tendered by the official translating agency of Indian Consulate in Jeddah with the petitioner herein," said the petition, filed through advocate Subhash Chandran K R and Yogamaya M G.It also said that neither the woman, nor any of the family members gave consent to bury Kumar's body in Saudi Arabia.Thereafter, the woman requested the officials of Indian Consulate in Jeddah to ask the local authorities there to exhume the mortal remains of her husband so that they can be transported to India for performing last rites as per the faith of the family."Unfortunately, even after seven weeks of the death of the husband of petitioner, the authorities have failed to do necessary formalities to repatriate the mortal remains of Sanjeev Kumar to India for performing last rites," the plea said.It also sought direction to the Centre to take appropriate departmental actions against concerned officials of Indian Consulate at Jeddah for their willful negligence and also direct the authorities to do appropriate actions for obtaining a corrected death certificate of the deceased and supply the document to his wife. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-mea-official-to-coordinate-with-saudi-embassy-to-facilitate-repatriation-of-buried-body-227032
18-03-2021||Purulia (WB)||Mamata’s appeasement politics behind infiltration: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attacked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for pursuing “appeasement and vote bank politics” which were responsible for infiltration.Addressing an election rally here in the tribal Jangalmahal region of the state, he alleged the ruling TMC never considered Dalits, backwards and adivasis its own, and these sections were the worst victims of cut money culture and ‘Tolabaji’ (extortion) by the state’s ruling party.Also read: BJP leaders lure voters with bagful of cash during polls, they are absent during crisis: MamataHe also accused the Banerjee government of patronising underground Maoist rebels.“The single-most important reason for infiltration is appeasement and vote bank politics being pursued by didi’s government,” he said.He said on May 2, the day the votes for assembly elections will be counted, Banerjee’s “khela” (game) will be “shesh” (over) and development will start.Repeatedly accusing the TMC supremo of trying to appease a section of people for vote bank politics, Modi said, “People of Bengal have a strong memory. Bengal remembers who accused the army of plotting a coup, whose side you took during the Pulwama attack and the Batla House encounter.”      The prime minister hit out at the TMC government on the issue of corruption even during the COVID-induced lockdown.Referring to a slew of central schemes which the TMC government is yet to implement, Modi said, “We believe in Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) while TMC believes in Transfer My Commission.”“The TMC has created a new breed of Maoists in Bengal who loot public money. The money meant for poor people. Didi’s government has patronised Maoist violence,” he alleged.The prime minister said Purulia’s industrialisation was neglected during the erstwhile Left rule and the current TMC dispensation.“The TMC government has given Purulia only water crisis, forced migration and administration that discriminates,” he alleged.

So it is with a sense of deep regret and profound sadness that I am writing to submit my resignation from the university which will take effect from the end of this academic year.”Subramanian had joined the university last year as professor in the department of economics with the aim of building a centre for economic policy to enhance national capacity for high-quality research, analysis and communication.His resignation came two days after Mehta resigned. Mehta is known for his criticism of the incumbent BJP government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-resignations-of-arvind-subramanian-pratap-bhanu-mehta-ashoka-university-faculty-students-demand-meeting-with-vc-227011

Women also follow such trends.Joining the #RippedJeans trend on social media, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted an old photograph of Union minister Nitin Gadkari and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, wearing trademark RSS shorts apparently at a Sangh event.

18-03-2021||Singapore||Mumbai composer embroiled in copyright dispute over Singapore’s national song||Mumbai-based composer Joseph Mendoza has been accused of copying one of Singapore's most iconic National Day songs, ‘Count on me Singapore’.‘Count on me Singapore’ was composed by Canadian Hugh Harrison, arranged by Jeremy Monteiro and performed by Clement Chow, both Singaporeans, in 1986.The Straits Times reported on Thursday that Mendonza has claimed that he wrote his version ‘We can achieve’ in 1983.He said that he only found out about ‘Count on me Singapore’ a few days ago.The two songs are virtually identical, except for small changes to the lyrics where ‘Singapore’ was changed to ‘India’ or ‘Mother India’, according to the Singapore daily report.In a statement to the media on Tuesday, Mendoza claimed that 250 orphans had performed the song in 1983 after he had written it while teaching music at the Bal Bhavan orphanage in Mumbai, where he is based.He claimed that the original tapes of his composition were swept away in the 2005 Mumbai floods."The only living proof I can offer you are the 250 orphans who first learnt it in 1983 and all the orphans at Bal Bhavan in the successive years too," said the 58-year-old, who claimed he was a graduate of the Musicians Institute in Hollywood, California.He sold the rights to the song to a Christian book and record store, Pauline India, and recorded the song in 1999.Although Mendonza acknowledged similarities between the two songs, he insisted that there was no way he could have known about ‘Count on me Singapore’ as there was no Internet in those days.‘Count on me Singapore’ composer Harrison responded on Wednesday in the YouTube comments of the song: "The fact that he (Mendoza) is claiming now in 2021 that he is the original creator of the song, implying I copied the song from him, is a direct attack on my integrity and professionalism and for that he could be sued for slander and/or libel."As it stands now, I have written him and given him the opportunity to rescind his claim and am awaiting his response," The Straits Times quoted Harrison as saying.The Facebook page of Singapore's Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth has also weighed in: "This is one of our most beloved and recognised national songs, we are happy that it seems to have struck a chord with people in India as well."We thank Singaporeans for coming forward to express your sense of pride in our national song. It may be a copy of our song, but sometimes, imitation is the best form of flattery," the ministry said.

18-03-2021||United Nations||India expected to register largest increase in child and maternal deaths in South Asia in 2020 amid Covid disruptions: UN||India is projected to register the greatest increase in the number of deaths among children under five in South Asia in 2020 as well as the highest number of maternal deaths as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts the country's health services, a UN report has said.The report noted that India could spend nearly USD 10 billion on COVID-19 testing and health-care utilisation by September 2021, the biggest share of the overall costs in the region.The report ‘Direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in South Asia' by UNICEF, World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), said that as of February 2021, South Asia reported more than 12 million COVID-19 cases, with the vast majority being in India, which has reported over 10.9 million cases.The report focuses on six most populous South Asian countries - Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and provides a grim assessment of the pandemic's impact on the child and maternal health, economy, jobs and education in these countries.The report said that till date COVID-19 is estimated to have cost the South Asian region more than USD 2.4 billion, including the cost of testing (USD 1.9 billion) and health-care utilisation for COVID-19 deaths (USD 581 million).“If the current status quo in terms of testing, and infection control and prevention, is maintained, the region is expected to spend an additional USD 8.1 billion on COVID-19 diagnostic tests, and between USD 520 million and USD 2.4 billion on health-care utilisation by September 2021, depending on the level of mitigation response instituted,” it said.India is expected to "bear the largest share of these costs” with the country having to spend more than USD 7.8 billion on testing and USD 1.7 billion on health-care utilisations due to COVID-19 infections leading to death by September 2021.The report said based on the results of an epidemiological model, and a potential status quo in infection control and prevention measures, an additional half a million deaths due to COVID-19 are possible in South Asia between October 2020 and September 2021.“This is the number of individuals expected to die of COVID-19, and who likely would not have died in the absence of the pandemic, ie, additional deaths.”   The report added that the highest number of deaths is expected to occur in India, with more than 490,000 deaths projected to occur in the country during this period.“Not surprisingly, the expected number of hospitalisations and ICU admission are also expected to be highest in India, with the numbers expected to rise to their highest level in February 2021,” the report said.However, it notes that since the observed number of COVID-19 cases and deaths are rising most rapidly in India, compared to other South Asian countries, the impact of modelling the increased coverage and effectiveness of mitigation strategies is also highest in the country.

18-03-2021||Washington||Biden called upon to support India, South Africa at WTO on Covid vaccines||A group of American lawmakers has urged President Joe Biden to support the move by India and South Africa before the World Trade Organisation for an emergency temporary waiver of some Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules to enable greater production and supply of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests.The move comes after India and South Africa, along with several other countries, urgently went to the WTO seeking a time-limited waiver of the TRIPS agreement. The previous Trump administration had opposed such a move.At a news conference here on Wednesday, the lawmakers—Rosa DeLauro, Jan Schakowsky, Earl Blumenauer, Lloyd Doggett, Adriano Espaillat, and Andy Levin—urged President Biden to support the emergency temporary waiver at the WTO as requested by countries led by India and South Africa.The lawmakers said more than 60 US representatives would collectively write to Biden to announce support for the TRIPS waiver proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO.The temporary TRIPS waiver would allow countries and manufacturers to directly access and share technologies to produce vaccines and therapeutics without causing trade sanctions or international disputes, they said.“The Biden administration has an obligation to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration and re-establish our nation’s global reputation as a public health leader,” said DeLauro.“As we see every day, the COVID-19 pandemic knows no borders. Our globalised systems cannot recover if only parts of the world are vaccinated and have protection against the virus. We must make vaccines available everywhere if we are going to crush the virus anywhere, and we need to make public policy choices, both in the US and at the WTO, that put people first,” DeLauro said.“Congress has appropriated billions of dollars of emergency relief for the travel, tourism, and hospitality industries and is planning billions more. The faster we can bring this emergency to an end, the faster these industries can recover. President Biden’s support for the TRIPS waiver is key to the end of the pandemic and the beginning of a strong global recovery.”      Schakowsky said big pharma companies are adamantly opposed, claiming in their letter to President Biden that “intellectual property is the foundation for both the development and sharing of new technologies”, not mentioning their own profits or the billions of dollars that taxpayers have contributed to their research and development.“As a global community, we must come together and use every tool at our disposal to stop this pandemic. We have seen that WTO intellectual property rules and corporate greed have disastrous impacts for public health during past epidemics, and we need to ensure that this doesn’t happen again,” said Blumenauer.“The Biden administration has already shown that we are in this together with our allies. They understand that a deadly pandemic does not stop at any one border. Working to ensure that trade rules do not stunt the developing world’s access to vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests is the next step,” he said.“Mindful of COVID variants from Brazil and South Africa to stop this deadly virus, we need widespread immunisation everywhere around the globe, not just in the wealthiest countries,” said Doggett.“While we have lacked sufficient vaccines in America, immunisation has been almost non-existent in poorer countries,” he said.“America has an obligation to support the global community with the tools and vaccine resources we developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Espaillat, adding that a global conundrum exists with countries having to wait months or even years to vaccinate their citizens – a delay that will only allow the virus to continue to mutate, spread, and kill more people.“We simply cannot allow this to happen. During this time of crisis, rather than protecting wealthy pharmaceutical companies’ bottom lines or intellectual property derived from our collective investments, we must remove all impediments to vaccine distribution, including maximising capacity worldwide to ensure every person who wants this vaccine has access as soon as possible regardless of economic background, race, or nationality,” Espaillat said.“The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has the ability to accomplish this task, and I encourage the Biden administration to urge the WTO and partner member-nations to use the tools at its disposal to do so,” he said.“I desperately want a return to normalcy,” said Levin. “But I want that normalcy to be sustainable! I want to be sure that this virus isn’t going to keep spreading, keep mutating - potentially in a way that’s resistant to the vaccines we’re getting right now. I don’t say this to fearmonger,” he added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-called-upon-to-support-india-south-africa-at-wto-on-covid-vaccines-226990
18-03-2021||Washington||US senator urges Defence Secretary to discuss human rights issues, Russian S-400 sale during India visit||An American Senator on Wednesday urged US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin to take up the issue of sale of Russian S-400 missile system during his visit to India later this week along with their concerns on human rights issues.“Getting the US-India partnership right is critical to addressing 21st century challenges, and that includes urging the Indian government to uphold democratic values and human rights,” Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Austin.Austin, the first ever US defence secretary to include India on his maiden foreign trip, is scheduled to meet his counterpart Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, along with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit K Doval, during his New Delhi visit from March 19 to 21.“In meetings with Indian counterparts during your upcoming visit, I strongly encourage you to make clear that in all areas, including security cooperation, the US-India partnership must rest on adherence to democratic values,” Menendez said in his letter, a copy of which was released to the press on Wednesday.In his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez plays a key role in influencing the country's foreign policy and national security. Among his predecessors include President Joe Biden, who occupied this position during former president George Bush's administration and former secretary of state John Kerry.On India's reported plan to purchase the Russian S-400 missile system, Menendez said that if India chose to go forward with its purchase, that act would clearly constitute a sanctionable transaction with the Russian defence sector under provisions of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act or CAATSA.“I recognise that India is not a US treaty ally and has historical ties with the Soviet and Russian militaries. However, if India chooses to go forward with its purchase of the S-400, that act will clearly constitute a significant, and, therefore, sanctionable, transaction with the Russian defense sector under Section 231 of CAATSA,” Menendez wrote.“It will also limit India's ability to work with the US on development and procurement of sensitive military technology. I expect you to make all of these challenges clear in conversations with your Indian counterparts,” he said.While democracy and human rights issues do not come under the domain of the Pentagon, Menendez urged Austin to raise these concerns with Indian leaders.

I am delighted to see so many fathers claiming success. They really want to praise Vaccine Maitri, but are going about in roundabout way…it is a great affirmation of the made-in-India programme which India pursued so strongly,” he said.Jaishankar, however, overlooked Jairam Ramesh’s suggestion to acknowledge the continuity in the policies of the past decades that “led to a situation we take legitimate pride in”.Ramesh pointed out India’s unique Patents Act of 1970, the dilution of equity stake of MNCs due to FERA and huge public investments in science and technology that led to the emergence of Indian companies such as Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-maitri-raised-indias-standing-says-s-jaishankar-in-rajya-sabha-226722

If we don’t stem the surge now, we can face a national outbreak,” cautioned the PM, urging states to ensure at least 70 per cent share of RT-PCR tests in the overall process and stop depending on rapid antigen tests.Modi said India had succeeded in its fight against the pandemic because it kept the villages safe. “Now we see infections rising in tier 2 and 3 cities, which means the disease can reach our villages. We must take proactive steps to stop that and ensure people’s participation going forward,” the PM, said urging zero tolerance on vaccine wastage.Meanwhile, the daily new cases soared to 28,903 after the lowest point of 9,121 on February 9.

On Monday, CM Uddhav Thackeray met NCP chief Sharad Pawar amid reports that arrested cop Sachin Waze stage-managed it on instructions from Param Bir SinghThe developments came after a massive tug-of-war between the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi allies (Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress) in the past over two weeks after an SUV with explosives was found abandoned outside Antilia, Ambani’s home.The situation turned grim with the subsequent death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, the owner of the SUV, and the arrest and suspension of controversial cop Sachin Waze.Terming Waze and Param Bir Singh “small players”, former CM Devendra Fadnavis alleged those “issuing directions” to Waze are still sitting in the government. “Who will investigate them?

18-03-2021||---||‘Too serious,’ says SC on 3 crore ‘cancelled’ ration cards; issues notice to Centre, states||New Delhi, March 17Terming the cancellation of around three crore ration cards due to their non-linking with the holders’ Aadhaar numbers as “too serious”, the Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Centre and states asking them to spell out their respective stand.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said the matter should not be treated as adversarial as it was too serious a matter after senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing petitioner Koili Devi, raised the issue.  “We are asking you (Centre) to respond because of the Aadhaar issue. This is not an adversarial litigation. We will hear it finally. Issue notice returnable in four weeks,” the Bench said. Even as Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi pointed out that notice had already been issued in the matter and the Centre’s response was there on record.However, Gonsalves said notice had not been issued on the main plea but alternative grievance redressal. “Principle issue is the cancellation of three crore ration cards and starvation deaths,” he said. The PIL has been filed by Devi, a poor Dalit woman whose 11-year-old daughter Santoshi of Simdega district in Jharkhand died of starvation on September 28, 2018. Santoshi’s sister Gudiya Devi is the joint petitioner in the case. The petition contended that Santoshi died as the local authorities had cancelled the ration card of her family since they failed to link it with Aadhaar.  It said subsequently, the family stopped receiving ration from March 2017 and as a result, the entire family had been starving.  Even on the day Santoshi died, her mother could only serve her some tea with salt - the only thing the family had in its kitchen, the plea said, adding that Santoshi succumbed to hunger later that night.But the Centre had said reports suggested that the deaths were not due to starvation. No one was denied food because of lack of valid Aadhaar card, it added.As Gonsalves alleged that the Centre cancelled around three crore ration cards, Lekhi countered him, terming his statement as “wrong”.On December 9, 2019, the court had sought responses from all the states over allegations of starvation deaths of people who were deprived of their ration supplies for not having valid Aadhaar cards and asked them to list the steps taken for implementation of the grievance redressal mechanism contained in the National Food Security Act, 2013.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/too-serious-says-sc-on-3-crore-cancelled-ration-cards-issues-notice-to-centre-states-226571

Shri Hemant Nagrale will be the new Mumbai Police Commissioner. Shri Rajnish Seth will have the additional charge of the post of Director General of Police, Maharashtra.”“Shri Sanjay Pandey will have the responsibility of Maharashtra State Security Corporation. Shri Param Bir Singh will have the responsibility of the Home Guard,” Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted following day-long meetings with Thackeray and other senior leaders of the Aghadi on damage control. However, terming Param Bir and Vaze “small players”, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said those “operating Vaze are still sitting in the government”.READ: Number plate of SUV near Ambani home found hidden in Sachin Vaze’s Mercedes: NIA“Who will investigate them,” he questioned.“This is not a failure of Police but the government,” said Fadnavis, claiming “deeper links” between Vaze and Shiv Sena.Fadnavis said “Uddhav and many other Sena leaders” approached him to get the suspended high-profile cop reinstated. He also alleged that Vaze, who also served as a “spokesperson” of the party, had “business relations” with “active members of the party”.“Why was Sachin Vaze taken back? When I was the CM there was pressure on me from Uddhav Thackeray that he should be reinstated. Looking at his record I decided to consult the Accountant General who told me that the High Court had suspended him, and a serious inquiry is going on against him which is when I decided not to reinstate him,” said Fadnavis. READ: While NIA zeroes on Vaze, 'trouble' in Maharashtra's Aghadi governmentGiving the sequence of events that led to Vaze “killing Mansukh Hiren and throwing his body in the creek,” he claimed ATS, and NIA had audiotapes of Mansukh and Vaze. All cases are handed over to the NIA as “required actions are not being taken by ATS,” he said. “Investigating agencies should not come under any pressure now, howsoever important are the people with whom Vaze’s connections are established. Vaze was running extortion net, he had links with those running betting racket in Mumbai. The biggest link Mansukh has been murdered. Never in recent history, Mumbai and Maharashtra witnessed such criminalisation of politics. It was in the nineties we saw criminalisation of politics in the way,” said Fadnavis.BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has alleged that Vaze had six businesses and two Shiv Sena leaders were his business partners. Another party leader, Nitesh Rane, accused him and “a cousin of Aaditya Thackeray of running an IPL extortion racket”. Though Sena leaders claim Vaze, who is said to have carried out “63 encounters in his career”, was never an active member of the party.Vaze was suspended from the police force in 2004 in connection with the murder and destruction of evidence in the case related to the custodial death of Khwaja Yunus, a bomb blast accused arrested in 2002. Though he made several attempts to get reinstated before he resigned and joined Sena in 2008, Vaze was reinstated last year “due to staff shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic”. Yesterday, the NIA seized a Mercedes car containing the original number plate of explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned outside Ambani’s residence and cash worth more than Rs 5 lakh apart from other items.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/antilia-scare-mumbai-cp-param-bir-singh-transferred-out-in-maharashtra-govts-damage-control-exercise-bjp-unimpressed-226568

The UK is proud to be its co-chair and I am delighted that since its launch, the coalition has made such a great start with 28 countries and organisations now signed up,” he said.He highlighted how the UK embarked on its journey to make its infrastructure more disaster-resilient over 10 years ago and is investing 5.2 billion pounds in bolstering flood defences and has a “wealth of expertise to share”.“If our battle with COVID-19 has taught us anything over the past year, it’s that we must be ready for whatever challenges may be coming next.“And, as the world’s climate changes, we must not only do everything in power to strive for Global Net Zero, an ambitious 2030 emissions reductions target, but we must also adapt to its damaging effects and build more resilience to disasters – our roads, our bridges, powerlines, our schools and hospitals – all the infrastructure that we rely on to keep our economies moving and our communities safe. They must be made ready,” Johnson said.“As we look forward to COP26 in Glasgow this November, we are working hard to help countries adapt to the effects of climate change. Let’s take action now so that as we build back better from the pandemic, we do so cleaner and greener, making all our communities stronger and more resilient,” he added, in reference to the United Nations climate conference being hosted by the UK later this year.India and the UK are co-chairs of the CDRI and are presently working together to create a new multi-country facility to support Small Island Developing States in creating climate and disaster-resilient infrastructure.“In our quest for resilience, we are all in the same boat. The pandemic has reminded us that no one is safe until everyone is safe,” Modi said in his inaugural address.The virtual event, hosted by India from Wednesday to Friday, brings together stakeholders from partner countries and organisations to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems against climate and disaster risks in support of sustainable development.

We do not have adequate capacities to address that kind of spread and we must remember we were able to win the war against COVID because we managed to keep our villages virus free,” the PM told the CMs asking them to aim at zero wastage of the vaccine and also ensure that vaccines with early expiry dates are exhausted before newly made batches.Read also: Centre says COVID vaccine wastage in India is 6.5 pc, calls for optimal utilisation of shotsNo signal of concern regarding use of Covishield vaccine in India: Govt70 districts registered over 150 pc increase in active COVID cases from Mar 1-15: Health ministry“Maharashtra and Punjab have seen a surge. We are also seeing that in Maharashtra and MP, case positivity rate is very high and cases are rising phenomenally. Many unaffected districts are witnessing cases and some districts have seen a 150 per cent rise in cases. If we do not stop this pandemic surge we can face a national outbreak,” the PM said in plain speak to states with Maharashtra, Punjab and Kerala leading the national surge.The PM said India’s fight against COVID had been cited as an example in the world with over 96 per cent cases having recovered and case fatality rates being the lowest in the world.“Most COVID-affected nations have had to suffer several waves. We also have to stop the second emerging wave of COVID. Local administrations are not paying too much attention to masks. COVID-appropriate behaviours must be reinforced,” said the PM.His suggestion to contain the pandemic surge was – ‘Dawai bhi, kadhai bhi’; enhanced RTPCR tests to catch new cases fast; micro containment zones to prevent transmission; expansion of vaccine centres; zero vaccine wastage and social and personal hygiene.The PM hailed people for their cooperation in COVID response saying people’s participation and awareness was key to stemming the ongoing surge.He advised states not to let self-confidence in the fight against COVID to convert into over-confidence and not to let success deplete into laxity.Modi said it is time to be proactive and to go back to the thumb rule of test, track and treat.The PM also urged states to expand vaccinations, an effective weapon against the virus.CMs of West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and UP did not attend due to prior engagements as the meeting was called at a short notice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-stem-covid-surge-to-prevent-national-outbreak-modi-tells-states-226548
18-03-2021||Islamabad||Peace with Pakistan will give India direct access to Central Asia: Imran Khan||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said India will be benefitted economically by having peace with his country as it will enable New Delhi to directly access the resource-rich Central Asia region through Pakistani territory.Delivering the inaugural address at the launch of the two-day Islamabad Security Dialogue, Khan also said that his government after coming to power in 2018 did everything for better ties with India and it was for India to reciprocate.“India will have to take the first step. Unless they do so, we cannot do much,” he said.India last month said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.India has also told Pakistan that “talks and terror” cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.Khan discussed Pakistan’s vision of comprehensive national security, built on the pillars of traditional and non-traditional security, including his vision for economic prosperity and human welfare.Khan dwelt at length on the issue of peace in the region, including peace between Pakistan and India, saying “the unresolved Kashmir issue was the biggest hurdle between the two countries.”                  “If India gives the Kashmiris their right under the UN (resolutions), it will be greatly beneficial for Pakistan as well as for India,” he said and added, “India can access Central Asia after peace.”     Khan said that having a direct route to the Central Asian region will economically benefit India. Central Asia is rich in oil and gas.Central Asia, in the modern context, generally includes five resource-rich countries—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcating it into two Union territories in August, 2019.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution was its internal matter. The Ministry of External Affairs has also underlined that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India.India and Pakistan had announced on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country.Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories.Talking about non-traditional threats to Pakistan, Khan said that climate change, food security and a weak economy were among the biggest challenges in the quest to realise the full concept of security.He acknowledged that improving the national economy was the biggest challenge but his government was trying to reduce trade deficit and control inflation so that the financial condition of common people could improve.“We cannot become a secure nation when a small rich minority is surrounded by the sea of poor people…National security is achieved when a nation stands up to secure itself,” he said at the dialogue organised by the National Security Division and think-tanks comprising the Advisory Board of National Security Committee.Khan also praised all-weather ally China for its “successful” handling of poverty and lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty in the last three decades. “It is their big achievement whether you like China or not,” he said.Khan said that Pakistan’s 25 per cent population was suffering from extreme poverty and another 25 per cent was just slightly better.He said the government already launched Ehsaas programme to give cash to the poor people and another programme of giving targeted subsidies to the poor was being launched.Khan also talked about peace in Afghanistan and reiterated support for the ongoing peace process by saying that Pakistan would be the greatest beneficiary of a stable Afghanistan.The Islamabad Security Dialogue is envisioned as an annual flagship security forum based on the model of major dialogues on security and international policy.The National Security Division, in collaboration with leading think-tanks that are part of its advisory board, has taken this initiative to provide a platform for critical thinking and robust intellectual discourse on some of the most pressing challenges and opportunities being faced by Pakistan and the wider region, according to an official statement.The two-day event is being attended virtually by international thinkers and scholars, members from the Federal Cabinet, diplomatic corps, former government officials, academia, think-tanks and civil society members.

During the ensuing argument between the two, the son slapped his mother on her face, a senior police officer said.The CCTV footage showed that after the dispute over parking of vehicles was sorted, another argument broke out between the deceased, her son Ranbir and his wife.The woman was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was declared "brought dead" by the doctors, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.A case has been registered and Ranbir, who is unemployed, has been arrested, the officer added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/76-year-old-woman-dies-after-being-slapped-by-son-in-delhis-dwarka-incident-caught-on-cctv-226491
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Number plate of SUV near Ambani home found hidden in Sachin Vaze’s Mercedes: NIA||The NIA has seized a Mercedes car that was used by arrested police officer Sachin Vaze and recovered Rs 5 lakh from the vehicle after searching his office from where "incriminating" documents were recovered, an official has said.Vaze is at the focus of a probe by the National Investigating Agency (NIA) into a case related to the recovery of an SUV with explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in south Mumbai on February 25.His plea contending that the manner of his arrest by the agency was illegal was also rejected by a court here on Tuesday.Vaze, arrested for his alleged role in the case on March 13, was attached to the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of Mumbai police's crime branch till recently.The office is located in the police commissioner's office compound in south Mumbai.The NIA team recovered some "incriminating" documents and electronic evidence such as laptop, iPad and mobile phones from Waze's office there, an official of the probe agency said on Tuesday.A black Mercedes car, which was being used by Vaze, was also seized from a parking lot near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), and Rs 5 lakh in cash, a note-counting machine, two number plates and some clothes were recovered from it, NIA's Inspector General Anil Shukla said.The searches started around 8 pm on Monday and continued on Tuesday, he said.The NIA has so far recorded the statements of seven officials of the crime branch, including an assistant commissioner of police.The agency also questioned the CIU's Assistant Police Inspector (API) Riyazuddin Kazi for the third consecutive day, Shukla said.Kazi had on February 27 collected the Digital Video Record (DVR) of CCTVs from the housing society in Thane's Saket area where Waze lived, two days after the explosives- laden Mahindra Scorpio car was found on Carmichael Road near Ambani's house.The probe agency suspects that it was collected to destroy evidence which could implicate Waze himself, the official said. During the search, the DVR was seized.The wife of businessman Mansukh Hiran, who had claimed that the Scorpio was stolen from his possession and who died mysteriously, has alleged that the SUV was being used by Waze for some time.Kazi had also allegedly procured the fake number plates found in the SUV, the police official claimed.The SUV case was taken over by the NIA following Hiran's death.A special court on Sunday remanded Waze in the custody of the central agency till March 25. On Tuesday, the court rejected Waze's plea claiming that his arrest was illegal.His lawyers Sajal Yadav and Sunny Punamiya argued that Waze was not produced before the court within 24 hours of his arrest, as is required.No sanction was taken from the state government under section 45(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the lawyers contended.Under section 45(1), the sanction from the government is necessary if an official is to be arrested for anything done in his or her official capacity.Special Public Prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves denied the allegations.Vaze was arrested at 11.50 pm on Saturday and produced before the court at about 2.45 pm the next day, he said.Vaze was called in the morning for some clarification about the probe, but he arrived late at night, the prosecutor claimed.Vaze's lawyers had alleged that he was detained since 11 am on Saturday.Sanction was not needed as Vaze had not acted in discharge of his official duty, the NIA's lawyer said.Judge P R Sitre, while rejecting Vaze's plea, observed that he was a policeman and knew his rights."The entry in the station diary clearly reflects that intimation was provided to the accused and the police station concerned and also information about his arrest, which means grounds of arrest, were provided," the judge said.Whether he had acted "in the course of performance of duty" can be examined during the trial, the court held.It allowed Vaze's lawyer to watch his interrogation from behind a glass partition, but not within the hearing distance.Earlier, speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, BJP leader Pravin Darekar said the more the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra defended Waze, the more suspicion there will be about the state government's intentions.The Sena had on Monday said the takeover of the case by the NIA was an "insult" to the Maharashtra police. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/number-plate-of-suv-near-ambani-home-found-hidden-in-sachin-vazes-mercedes-nia-226485
18-03-2021||Shimla||Hindu man hailing from Himachal wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia; CM to take up matter with Centre||A Himachal Pradesh Congress MLA on Tuesday raised the issue of the mortal remains of a Hindu man hailing from the state being wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim custom, following which Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said in the Assembly that he would take up the matter with the Ministry of External Affairs.Thakur extended condolences to the man's family and regretted his burial which is against his religious custom.The chief minister also said the state government would explore options to bring back his mortal remains.Una MLA Satpal Singh Raizada alleged the family of the man took up the matter at various levels but to no avail, and demanded a probe into it.According to the Congress legislator, Una-resident Sanjeev Kumar died due to cardiac arrest on January 24 in Saudi Arabia where he had been working for three years.After his family was informed about his death by a co-worker on January 25, they sought help from the Una Deputy Commissioner and Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur, the MLA said.Subsequently, the family also approached the Indian Embassy for bringing his body back to India but didn't get any response, he added.However, on February 17, his family got to know that his body has been buried in Saudi Arabia.The man's wife has also approached the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to take steps to urgently exhume the remains and repatriate them to India in a time-bound manner.According to the petition, officials in Indian Consulate explained to the family that the burial was conducted "due to a mistake committed by the official translator of Indian Consulate, Jeddah, who wrongly mentioned his religion as ‘Muslim' in the death certificate".The court said the case was "unfortunate" and directed the MEA officer concerned to appear before it on the next date of hearing on March 18 to apprise it about the update on steps taken and status on transportation of mortal remains of the deceased. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindu-man-hailing-from-himachal-wrongly-buried-in-saudi-arabia-cm-to-take-up-matter-with-centre-226481
