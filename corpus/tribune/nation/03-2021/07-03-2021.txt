07-03-2021||Puducherry||Congress, DMK hold seat-sharing talks for Puducherry polls; AINRC’s silence||Leaders of the Congress and its ally DMK here held first round of seat-sharing talks on Sunday for the April 6 elections to the Puducherry assembly but there was no outcome and they decided to continue the parleys soon.In the opposition front, there was no official word yet on the shape of alliance with former chief minister and All-India NR Congress founder leader N Rangasamy’s “silence”.Prospective ally BJP’s reluctance to call him the chief minister candidate of a possible coalition appears to have been the reason behind his guessing game, according to sources.The Congress, whose government in the UT fell toward the fag end of its term last month, held talks with DMK at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office here.Former chief minister V Narayanasamy, state unit party president AV Subramanian, lone Lok Sabha member from the union territory V Vaithilingam and former Welfare Minister M Kandasamy represented the national party. On the DMK side, party convenors SP Sivakumar and R Siva took part.A Congress source said they did not reach any decision and the talks for sharing the 30 assembly seats were ‘inconclusive’.In the 2016 polls, the Congress had contested 21 seats and won 15 while the DMK bagged two of the nine seats it was allotted by the alliance leader.“We exchanged our views. We will have the next round of talks soon and will inform our respective high commands for final decision,” Narayanasamy told reporters here.The parleys between the two parties took place close on the heels of DMK allotting 25 seats to Congress in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, where too the assembly polls are scheduled on April 6.Besides the Congress and DMK, the alliance comprised Left parties, VCK, Indian Union Muslim League and Manidha Neya Makkal Katchi, Narayanasamy said.The former chief minister, whose government collapsed last month after a series of desertions by MLAs, claimed the alliance was strong and people will teach a lesson to the BJP-led NDA for its “undemocratic style of functioning”.Narayanasamy reiterated his allegation that the BJP in collusion with the AINRC and AIADMK had “toppled his democratically elected government.”However, in the NDA camp there was no word on the alliance partners so far.It was widely expected that AINRC would be part of a front including the BJP and the AIADMK as the three had stood together on several issues in Puducherry in the past.The projection of new BJP entrant A Namassivayam, PWD Minister in the Narayanasamy cabinet as CM candidate, has come to upset the expectations of the majority of the rank and file of the AINRC, floated by Rangasamy after breaking away from the Congress in 2011.The AINRC workers are awaiting a firm word from the BJP that Rangasamy would be the chief ministerial candidate of a possible NDA coalition.Rangasamy, who captured power in 2011 within months of forming his party, has been maintaining silence on the strategy his party would adopt to face the April 6 assembly polls and talks with BJP leaders including UT in-charge Nirmal Kumar Surana have not yielded any outcome so far.But since there has been no concrete announcement from the BJP over Rangasamay as the CM face, speculations are abuzz that AINRC might face the elections on its own.In the 2016 elections in Puducherry, the AINRC, BJP and AIADMK had contested on their own. The AINRC won eight seats and the AIADMK four while the BJP drew a blank.The three parties, however, contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in alliance, but lost again.BJP has asserted it would capture power in the union territory this time. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-dmk-hold-seat-sharing-talks-for-puducherry-polls-ainrcs-silence-221991

07-03-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand: Trouble for Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat as discontent brews in BJP state unit||In what appears to be trouble for Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, the BJP leadership is expected to take a call on his continuing in that capacity on the basis of party vice-president Raman Singh’s feedback from his sudden and unscheduled core committee meeting in Dehradun on Saturday.Raman Singh is believed to have conveyed the “seriousness of the situation” to the leadership.Sources said the BJP leadership is “worried about continuing discontent” against Rawat, which can be gauged over the way Raman Singh, general secretary in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam and others were dispatched to talk to MLAs and state leaders over the state-of-affairs there. Apparently, there were apprehensions about all of it “spilling out in the open” amid the ongoing Assembly elections, a reason why observers were sent in such a hurry to “handle” the situation.Apart from the “general discontent” about Rawat’s way of functioning, it seems members of the Sangh parivaar too are upset over some decisions of his government. Meanwhile, a few Congress party’s imports in the BJP are also threatening to jump ship ahead of Assembly polls next year, spelling trouble for the ruling BJP in the face of the “growing influence” of Aam Aadmi Party in the state.Though officially BJP leaders downplayed the hurriedly convened meeting while the Budget session was on in Gairsain (the third administrative division of the state which is another reason for discontent), speculations are rife about “major change” in the government. Amid speculations over the next chief minister—names of union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Member Party Anil Baluni, state cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj, Uttarakhand BJP general secretary Suresh Bhatt, and Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar MP Ajay Bhatt are doing the rounds as being contenders for the position—senior leaders here say that “all options are open”.  A point of view also is that since the state is due for Assembly elections next year, the leadership should try to “calm down the situation” through “other ways, including the expansion of the cabinet”.There are also speculations about a legislative party meeting being called.  Sources said Raman Singh talked separately to each member of the core group, visited chief minister’s official residence and also the RSS office after the meeting. While several MPs, MLAs, and ministers are believed to have spoken against the chief minister, a few also supported him.Though state BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat said the core group meeting discussed celebrations to be held in 70 assembly constituencies in the state on March 18 to mark the completion of the BJP government’s four years in office, sources said members of the Sangh Parivar are equally unhappy with Rawat over his government’s move to “take-over temples”. They had also expressed displeasure over the opening of a liquor-bottling plant and slaughterhouse in the religious city of Haridwar. Though the government later withdrew the order to open the abattoir, the Sangh is upset over the arrangements for the Kumbh Mela.Meanwhile, sources said that the leadership had planned a review of states soon after the Lok Sabha elections when vote share in states like Haryana, Jharkhand, Delhi, Maharashtra dropped by eight to 22 per cent compared to the Lok Sabha elections. However, the state-wise review strategy got delayed due to corona-pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-trouble-for-uttarakhand-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-as-discontent-brews-in-bjp-state-unit-221973

By that time, a body was found at Mumbra and it was later confirmed that the deceased was Mansukh," he had said, adding that Hiren's mobile phone is yet to be recovered.Officials on Saturday said the autopsy report of Hiren reserved the opinion on the cause of his death and added that no visible external injuries were found on his body.The viscera of Hiren was already sent for forensic analysis, they said.

07-03-2021||New Delhi||Gujarat Cong didn’t give me any work in local body polls; even opinion not sought: Hardik Patel||Gujarat Congress working president Hardik Patel on Sunday slammed the functioning of the state unit after the party’s humiliating defeat in the local body elections, claiming that no work was given to him in the polls and his opinion was also not sought for ticket distribution.He, however, also dismissed speculation about leaving the Congress in the future and said he would remain in the party and carry out whatever responsibility he is given.In an interview with PTI, Patel also raised questions over the understanding of the party’s central leadership of Gujarat and said the Congress has failed to struggle as an opposition in the state.In order to strengthen the party, the high command has to understand Gujarat, he said.Patel also argued that the legislators have to be kept away from the work of the organisation.The comments by Patel, who was the face of the Patidar quota agitation in 2015, came days after the BJP won all 31 district panchayats, 74 out of 81 municipalities and also trounced its main rival Congress in 231 taluka panchayats.The success followed the BJP’s clean sweep in elections for six municipal corporations in the first phase last month. The Congress could not even open its account in the Surat Municipal Corporation.Following the party’s debacle, Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda and leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani sent their resignations to the party leadership.When asked about the reasons for the party’s defeat, Patel said, “We have failed to win the public’s trust. The struggle which we should have undertaken as an opposition, we have failed in that. The public feels that the Congress did not do its job as an opposition and that is why the Aam Aadmi Party got votes in many places.”      “In Surat, people from our movement had asked for only two tickets. The party did not even give that. Just because of those two seats we lost all the 36 seats there,” he said.It is worth noting that in the last civic elections, the Congress had won more than 30 seats in the Patidar-dominated areas of Surat.Without naming any leader, Patel claimed, “I am the working president and I had no role in ticket distribution. I was told that the working president has no role in it. Nevertheless, I held several meetings on my own. I was not given any programme or work by the Pradesh Congress Committee.”               “Preparations for the local body elections had been going on for three months. Not even once in three months have I been told that you have to do this work. Tickets were distributed in more than 5,000 seats, but not even for one seat, I was asked to give my opinion. Even in Patidar-dominated areas, my opinion was not taken,” he said.Asked about the resignation of Amit Chavda from the post of state president and Paresh Dhanani from the post of the leader of opposition, Patel said, “If I were also the president, I would have taken responsibility. They have resigned, but the responsibility lies with everyone.”      “Now everyone has to work hard,” he added.Asked if the Congress high command did not take necessary steps in time, Patel said they have to understand Gujarat, and give importance to it. “We have not been in power in the state for 30 years.  If we do not understand Gujarat, young workers like us will be left disappointed.  The party is slumping day by day and no one is paying attention,” Patel said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-cong-didnt-give-me-any-work-in-local-body-polls-even-opinion-not-sought-hardik-patel-221959
07-03-2021||New Delhi||Women to take centre stage at farmers’ protest sites at Delhi’s borders||From managing the stage, food and security to sharing tales of their struggles, and significance of taking part in the farmers’ agitation, thousands of women farmers, students and activists will take over key roles at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur protest sites at Delhi’s borders on International Women’s Day on Monday.Noting that women contribute significantly to the country’s farming sector, the organisers have laid out elaborate plans to let women farmers take centre stage and all the space under the sky to acknowledge the “big but unrecognised” part of the farming community.Thousands of women farmers especially from Punjab and Haryana will congregate at Delhi’s borders on Monday and the day will be entirely dedicated to women farmers, activists and students, farmer leaders said.Marked annually on March 8, International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity.“To celebrate women’s day, the stage will be managed by women, and the speakers too will be women. And there will be a small march at Singhu border, the details for which will be shared later. We are expecting more women to join at different protest sites,” senior farmer leader Kavita Kurugranthy, who is also a member of the Samkyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), told PTI.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur --- for over three months, demanding the repeal of farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.On the occasion of International Women’s Day, around 15,000 women farmers along with college principals, teachers and social workers will join the protest sites at Singhu and Tikri borders, the organisers said.“Women are a big part of the farming community but they don’t get recognised. In fact, they work more than the men. Approximately 10,000 women from different parts of Punjab and Haryana will come to the borders to be part of the women’s day program,” farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu said.Sandhu said they have also asked women farmers to join the different protest sites in Punjab and Haryana on the occasion.Women protesters will talk about their rights, struggles and significance of participation in the movement at the two stages at Tikri border, one of the organisers said.“...Women will be taking over security roles at Singhu border. Hundreds of women from different parts of Punjab are coming in vehicles and will join us at the borders tomorrow. We are expecting a gathering of around 15,000 people at Tikri and 4,000 people at Singhu to mark International Women’s Day,” said Jagmohan Singh of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), Punjab.Farmer leader of Krantikari Kisan Union Avtar Singh Mehma also said that stage management at all borders will be done by women on the occasion of International Women’s Day.“Those delivering speeches on the stage will also be women, whether they are from a student organisation, a farmer organisation or simply an organisation doing social work,” Mehma said.

07-03-2021||New Delhi||We are in the endgame of COVID-19 pandemic in India: Vardhan||“We are in the end game of the COVID-19 pandemic in India” and to succeed at this stage, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said, politics should be kept out the COVID-19 vaccination drive.He said people should trust the science behind vaccines and ensure that their near and dear ones get vaccinated on time.Speaking at the Delhi Medical Association’s (DMA’s) 62nd Annual Delhi State Medical Conference (MEDICON 2021) in collaboration with Dharamshila Narayana Hospital on Sunday, Vardhan said over 2 crore COVID-19 vaccine shots have been administered so far and the vaccination rate has been increased to 15 lakhs per day.“Unlike most other countries, we have a steady supply of COVID-19 vaccines that are safe with proven immunogenicity and efficacy. Based on the initial results, these Made in India vaccines have shown some of the lowest adverse events following immunization (AEFI) anywhere in the world,” he said.Vardhan asserted that today children in the entire world need to be vaccinated against poliomyelitis only because Pakistan and Afghanistan failed to eradicate this disease from their respective countries, the statement said.“Similarly, India cannot be safe from coronavirus and COVID19 if rest of the world continues to be unsafe, which is why it is essential to curb COVID-19 vaccine nationalism.“If poor and underdeveloped countries continue to harbour the novel coronavirus, we shall not be able to ensure safety for all. A fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine is the biggest need of the hour,” he said.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India, has emerged as the world’s pharmacy, and it supplied 5.51 crore COVID-19 vaccines to 62 different countries, he said.“At a time of global crisis, under the leadership of Modi Ji, India has emerged as an example to the world in international cooperation,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.“It was Modi ji’s insistence that COVID-19 vaccines should be provided with no strings attached, and the countries without the vaccine supply should not be taken advantage of at the time of a global humanitarian crisis,” he said.Looking at the possibility of eradication of COVID-19 in India, Vardhan said, “We are in the end game of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, and to succeed at this stage, we need to follow 3 steps: Keep politics out of the COVID-19 vaccination drive, trust the science behind COVID-19 vaccines, and ensure our near and dear ones get vaccinated on time.”The government has already involved private players in COVID-19 vaccination, and if hospitals want, they can conduct vaccination 24x7, the minister said.“My request to everyone is that just like people embraced ‘Jan Andolan for COVID-19 appropriate behaviour’, they should embrace Jan Andolan for COVID-19 vaccination and get all COVID-19 vaccine shots whenever they are eligible,” he said. Delhi Medical Association (DMA) honoured Vardhan for his contribution to the medical fraternity and outstanding service and exemplary work during the COVID-19 pandemic, the health Ministry said in a statement.Healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers, not just in this room, but across India, rose to the occasion and sacrificed not only their time with family, but also their own mental, physical and emotional health for this beloved nation, Vardhan said.

07-03-2021||---||Fuel hike issue can be discussed in GST council if states willing: Anurag Thakur||Solan, March 7Union Minister for State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur on Saturday evening said the issue of fuel hike can be discussed in the ensuing meeting of the GST council, if all states are willing to do so.Interacting with media persons at Solan, where he made a brief halt last evening, Thakur said, “The Government of India was ready to talk on the issue of fuel hike in the GST council but it depends on the state governments who are also a part of this council. Representatives of various political parties are also a part of the GST council, and if all are willing to bring the fuel prices under the purview of the GST, a decision can be taken in the council.”In response of the unsavoury Vidhan Sabha episode where Congress MLAs misbehaved with the Governor, Thakur said: “Their behaviour has besmirched the image of the state, as well as of the Congress, before the nation.

The commune is currently closed due to COVID-19 pandemic.In its application, the OIF submitted that “looking at the present situation in India and around the world and the uncertainty about the continuation of COVID-19 effect, it would not be possible to restart the meditation activities in the near future. This has severely affected the cash flow of the trust, leading it into the dire need of funds to meet its financial obligations”.The application further stated that the situation caused on the account of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a situation whereby the applicant Trust will not have any income for a long period of time but there will be fixed costs for maintaining the premises and the properties of the Trust.“Considering this financial crisis, the applicant Trust is left with no resort but to alienate its rights in the said property,” it stated.The OIF also said that it will face a “heavy monetary crisis” in the event of its application getting rejected.“On the contrary, if the applicant Trust alienates the said property, it shall have an adequate cash flow to maintain its properties, upkeep of various premises, staff salaries and it shall be able to achieve its aims and objects,” the OIF said.As per the application, the OIF received bids from Atul Choradia, A2Z Online Services Pvt Ltd and Rajivnayan Rahulkumar Bajaj and Rishabh Family Trust.“Since Bajaj was the highest bidder with Rs 107 crore, the decision was taken to alienate the Trust’s rights in the said property in favour of Bajaj,” it said.Objecting to the decision, Swami Premgeet, one of the petitioners and a member of the Osho Friends Foundation (OFF), said their application filed before the charity commissioner, Mumbai, has been allowed.“We will file our objections against the application filed by the OIF,” he told PTI, adding that the matter is kept for hearing on March 15.Swami Premgeet said the major objection was publishing the tender notice advertisement to invite offers for the said property in Mumbai when the property is located in Pune.“Why the tender notice did not have the name of the owner of the property, and name of the trustees. How will people know which property is for sale and who are the trustees or the owners,” Premgeet said, alleging that the tender notice was a complete violation of rules laid by the charity commissioner.“The Trust’s application states that from April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 (during lockdown), the trust spent Rs 3.65 crore on the objects of the Trust. Now when the entire country was under lockdown and Ashram doors are closed till date, where these Rs 3.65 crore were spent,” he questioned.When contacted, Maa Amrit Sadhana, spokesperson and one of the trustees of the OIF, said the matter was “sub judice”.In a statement, Maa Sadhana said the decision to sell off the property has been taken to ensure the survival and continued care of the meditation resort in the face of a “very cloudy and unknown future due to COVID-19”.She added that there are many unknowns going forwards, including the major economic disruption caused by the pandemic with protracted limitations on international travel, border controls and compulsory quarantines on top of significant concerns about safety. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-cash-crunch-by-pandemic-osho-trust-starts-process-to-sell-two-plots-in-pune-221953
07-03-2021||  Bengaluru||Social activist to withdraw complaint of sexual harassment against Ex-Karnataka Minister||In a twist to the alleged sex-for-job scandal in Karnataka, social activist Dinesh Kallahalli on Sunday said he would withdraw his police complaint against BJP MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi, which had led to his resignation.Dinesh Kallahalli said he will withdraw the complaint as he was hurt by allegations of a Rs 5 crore deal levelled by JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy. However, the activist’s lawyer said there were some technical problems due to which the decision was taken.Meanwhile, Balachandra Jarkiholi, brother of Ramesh Jarkiholi, alleged that there was a big conspiracy in the state in which four teams have been working to ‘malign’ Jarkiholi and target the BJP ahead of assembly elections in five states.Seeking a CBI probe into the episode, he told reporters here that the video allegedly featuring his brother and a woman was “doctored.”The activist has accused Jarkiholi of sexually exploiting a woman under the pretext of offering her a job in the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).As the matter snowballed into a major controversy, Jarikiholi tendered his resignation to Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, which was forwarded to Governor Vajubhai Vala, who accepted it immediately.Speaking to reporters, Kallahalli said, “I am deeply pained by Kumaraswamy’s charge that I struck a deal for Rs 5 crore. Hence, I decided to withdraw my complaint.”      Kumaraswamy had on Friday alleged that the entire expose was a deal worth Rs 5 crore and demanded that those claiming to have the objectionable video clips should be arrested immediately as it was a "blackmail tactic".     Kumar Patil, Kallahalli’s lawyer, told the press on Sunday that there were some technical problems due to which his client decided to withdraw the complaint.To a query, Patil said his client was not the one to succumb to any political pressure.“My client is not the one to give up his struggle. His objective was to grant justice to the victim,” the lawyer said.Amid apprehensions of a ‘political conspiracy’ being hatched to defame them, six ministers of the Yediyurappa-led cabinet have secured a court injunction restraining media from airing or publishing any defamatory content against them. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/social-activist-to-withdraw-complaint-of-sexual-harassment-against-ex-karnataka-minister-221951

07-03-2021||New Delhi||Ban or no ban? Huawei bags Airtel contract||Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei has bagged a new contract from Bharti Airtel at a time when Chinese companies are under the government scanner.Huawei and ZTE are among the Chinese companies to whom the government has given indications should be kept out telecom gear including the 5G trials.There are already concerns in India about cyber-related threats from Chinese companies and this threat is now a spreading global concern.Huawei is already running Airtel’s long distance network and the current deal is related to that.Reports suggest the deal is a big respite for the Chinese gear maker since it has been losing out on contracts from Indian telcos for a considerable time now.A committee headed by the Deputy National Security Advisor (Dy NSA) will clear all equipment and gadgets, including 5G mobile networks and supply chains, with an aim to protect India’s essential national security interests.The security action plan aims to classify telecom products/equipment and their suppliers under the trusted and non-trusted categories.Companies or suppliers not trusted by the experts committee would not be allowed to do business with Indian telecom service providers.Once implemented, the action plan would make it difficult for Chinese telecom equipment suppliers like Huawei or ZTE to procure supply orders from the Indian telecom players such as Jio, Airtel or Vodafone Idea.Huawei and ZTE have been under global scrutiny for allegedly installing “backdoor” vulnerabilities in a desperate bid to do spying for the Chinese government.In the wake of the India-China border tensions, the government’s action plan on telecom front seems much appreciated and awaited by the Central security and intelligence agencies. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ban-or-no-ban-huawei-bags-airtel-contract-221945

07-03-2021||Bengaluru||Satellite set for March 28 launch will help India keep an eye on borders near real-time||India plans to launch on March 28 an earth observation satellite that will provide it near real-time images of its borders and also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters.GISAT-1 is slated to be lofted into space by GSLV-F10 rocket from Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh’s Nellore district, about 100 km north of Chennai.“We are looking to launch this Geo imaging satellite on March 28, subject to weather conditions,” an official of the Bengaluru-headquartered Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told PTI on Sunday.The rocket will place the spacecraft in a geosynchronous orbit. It will be subsequently positioned in geostationary orbit, about 36,000 km above earth’s equator, using its onboard propulsion system.The launch of GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 rocket was originally planned for March 5 last year but postponed a day before the blast-off due to technical reasons.Experts said positioning the state-of-the-art agile earth observation satellite in geostationary orbit has key advantages.“It’s going to be a game-changer in some sense for India”, a Department of Space official said.“With onboard high resolution cameras, the satellite will allow the country to monitor the Indian land mass and the oceans, particularly its borders continuously”.Listing the objectives of the mission, ISRO has earlier said the satellite would provide near real-time imaging of the large area region of interest at frequent intervals.It would help in quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic and any short-term events.The third objective is to obtain spectral signatures of agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow and glacier and oceanography.GISAT-1 will facilitate near real-time observation of the Indian sub-continent, under cloud-free condition, at frequent intervals, ISRO said.The planned launch of GISAT-1, weighing about 2,268 kg, comes close on the heels of the successful February 28 PSLV- C51 mission that orbited Brazil’s earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and 18 co-passengers, including five built by students.Secretary in the Department of Space and ISRO Chairman K Sivan told PTI last week that the technical issues that led to postponement of GISAT-1 mission have been resolved and the further delay in the launch was due to COVID-19-induced lockdown which affected normal work.According to sources, GISAT-1 will be followed by the maiden flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, ISRO’s compact launcher, likely in April.SSLV has been designed to meet “launch on demand” requirements in a cost-effective manner for small satellites in a dedicated and ride-share mode.It is a three-stage all solid vehicle with a capability to launch up to 500 kg satellite mass into 500 km low earth orbit (LEO) and 300 kg into Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO).By comparison, PSLV—the workhorse launch vehicle of ISRO—can take up to 1,750 kg payload into SSO of 600 km altitude.With lower per kg launch cost, the mini launcher will have multiple satellite mounting options for nano, micro and small satellites.Sivan had earlier termed the SSLV an innovative vehicle which can be assembled in just 72 hours.“Instead of 60 days (for building a PSLV), it (SSLV) will be assembled in three days; instead of 600 people (needed to build a PSLV), it (SSLV) will be done by six people”, he had said.

Expressing concern over the increasing burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) in India, Naidu cited the data from this year’s Economic Survey, which attributes about 65 percent of deaths in the country to them. He suggested to ESIC to consider setting up exclusive NCD clinics in urban areas.He referred to several other health challenges including low doctor-patient ratio, shortage of medical colleges, inadequate infrastructure in rural areas, and low adoption of health insurances.He praised ESIC for running India’s largest social security program covering roughly 10% of the country’s population.Naidu also expressed satisfaction over India emerging as an attractive medical tourism hub in the region due to its state-of-the-art facilities and highly skilled professionals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vice-president-venkaiah-naidu-lauds-countrys-covid-resilience-221933

07-03-2021||Muzaffarnagar (UP)||From farms to mills, it’s a long wait for western UP farmers just to get sugarcane weighed||As thousands of farmers lay siege to Delhi borders for over 100 days demanding the repeal of three contentious farm laws, those staying back in western Uttar Pradesh have to endure a different kind of long wait — at times for multiple days just to get weighed quintals of sugarcane lying in tractor-trollies on their way from farms to mills.Some pass their time chit-chatting about the ongoing protests, while others smoking bidis or cigarettes, but all of them sound worried about loads of sugarcane drying under the scorching sun, while Punjabi and Haryanvi songs continue to blare out loudly, either from their mobiles or small speakers fitted in their vehicles.Also, problems for them are much more beyond the three laws that have been in limelight due to the protests at the national capital borders.Almost a hundred tractor-trollies, each loaded with 300 quintals of sugarcane on an average, can be seen parked in a barren field near the Bhopada weighing scale in Budhana tehsil here, barely two kilometres from the Dhampur sugar mill — the final destination of the load and their carriers after days-long ‘weighing’ halt.Some drivers, many of them farmers with small landholdings, even have arrangements made for sleeping on cots fitted under their ‘trollas’ (customised and bigger trolleys used to transport sugarcane).“It has been two days since I am waiting at this weighing scale and looks like it will take me another two days for my work to be done so that I can take my stock to the sugar mill,” Rohit Balyan, who hails from Kutba village, told PTI.“The exhausting long wait at weighing scales hurts farmers because the sugarcane load starts drying up under the sun and by the time one’s turn comes for measurement, the weight comes down a bit,” the 21-year-old Balyan said while lighting up a cigarette borrowed from a friend waiting next in the queue.A sugar mill official in Muzaffarnagar, which is widely known as the ‘sugar bowl’ of India and also has Asia’s largest gur mandi (jaggery market), told PTI that the weight loss during the waiting time was only a few kilogrammes but farmers argue this loss means a lot to them because their earnings go down by thousands of rupees.However, mill owners put the blame for the delay in weighing the crop on farmers growing sugarcane way beyond the daily intake capacity of the mills and also on lack of weighing facilities in the region. They also claim that sugar production from the region is often in surplus vis-a-vis the market demand and therefore they do not have enough incentives to further enhance their processing facilities.Farmers also claim that sugar mills are procuring sugarcane at Rs 325 per quintal, lower than the government-fixed Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 385.“We are not getting the MSP and then we have to wait here for days at the weighing scale. The sugarcane starts drying up after a couple of days and this means a reduction in weight and money for us,” said Anuj Tomar, who hails from Kakda village.Tomar (25) said he had been standing in the queue for days with sugarcane produced in his family’s 27-bigha land.Among those waiting at the weighing scale are also people who do not own land but are engaged in transporting sugarcane from farms to sugar mills after getting the yield measures at weighing scales.For them also, the loss of time during a peak work season means loss of money.Harsoli village resident Mukeem, 35, said he used his tractor-trolla for the transport work like many others in the region, who are typically paid nearly Rs 12 per quintal of sugarcane from the mills.“It has been three days since I am standing here. I have got more than 300 quintals of sugarcane loaded on my trolla. If we get it measured quickly, then I can do more rounds and make more money,” Mukeem said.He is also upset over an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that calls for phasing out old tractors in the National Capital Region (NCR). Muzaffarnagar, which thrives on sugarcane production, is among the areas affected by this order.“How are we supposed to phase out our tractors just because they are 15 or 20-years old. They are working fine for us. The price of diesel has gone up sharply in the last 10 years. The rate we get for transportation is still the same but nobody is bothered about these issues,” he said.Also waiting for two days at the weighing scale are Raju Tyagi (23) from Osika village and 23-year-old Saleem from Kethal village, both of whom strongly support protesting farmers’ demand for a legal guarantee on the MSP and repeal of the three contentious agriculture laws.Transporting sugarcane is a seasonal work both Tyagi and Saleem take up and are mightily upset over the long delays at weighing scales.“I hope that one day the government will consider our issues also,” Saleem said.According to the Muzaffarnagar administration estimates, more than 40 per cent of the district’s population is engaged in agriculture with sugarcane farming topping the chart.Sugar mill officials say much of the problem related to sugarcane farming in the region is due to the surplus yield of sugarcane and the limited production capacity of the mills.“There are eight sugar mills in Muzaffarnagar alone. The one in Khatauli is the biggest in Western Uttar Pradesh and has a purchasing capacity of 1,30,000 quintals a day,” a sugar mill official said requesting anonymity.“Farmers in the region mostly grow sugarcane and wheat. While wheat is mostly grown for personal consumption, they sell sugarcane to mills because of the MSP on it. That leads to sugar being in surplus, which in turn results in various problems related to it,” the official said.A measure to check these problems can only be policy-driven by the government, the official suggested, adding there should be an upper limit for farming of sugarcane.“Farmers here are growing sugarcane on 90 per cent of their lands. If that is reduced to say, 60 per cent, and farmers are asked to grow other crops also, then a solution could be in sight,” he told PTI.

The country is one of the world’s biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring coronavirus vaccines.Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston during a webinar this week said that the two mRNA vaccines may not impact the world’s low and middle income countries, but India’s vaccines, made in collaboration with universities across the world such as BCM and Oxford University, have “rescued the world” and its contributions must not to be underestimated.During the webinar, “COVID-19: Vaccination and Potential Return to Normalcy - If and When”, Dr Hotez, an internationally-recognised physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development, said that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is “India’s gift’ to the world in combating the virus.India’s drugs regulator gave emergency use authorisation to Covishield, produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India after securing licence from British pharma company AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, indigenously developed jointly by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research scientists.The webinar was organised by Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston (IACCGH). “This is something very special and I see it myself because I’m on weekly teleconferences with our colleagues in India, you make a recommendation, and within days it’s done and not only done, but it’s done well and with incredible rigor and thought and creativity,” Dr Hotez said, stressing that he felt compelled to make this statement because “India’s huge efforts in combating global pandemic is a story that’s not really getting out in the world.”   Dr Hotez, considered as the authority on vaccinations, is working on an affordable coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with Indian pharmaceutical companies.There is increasing evidence that vaccines not only “interrupt symptomatic illness and keep you out of the hospital” but halts asymptomatic transmission as well.However, the troubling news is that the vaccines work well against the UK B.1.1.7 variant, which is now accelerating across the US, but doesn’t work quite as well against the variant coming out of South Africa.It is likely that all the vaccines will require a booster for two reasons: the durability of protection for the vaccines is unknown and to create an added immune response that’s better tailored towards the South African variant.Consul General of India in Houston, Aseem Mahajan, along with a distinguished panel of doctors participated in this webinar that tracked the possibilities of a return to some semblance of normality due to the accelerated roll out of vaccines across the country.Appreciating Dr. Hotez for commending India’s efforts in getting vaccines to the world, Consul General Mahajan, said, “in keeping with “our tradition of sharing with the world,” India has exported vaccines to many countries across the world.India has provided 56 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines under grants assistance to a number of countries. The vaccines were sent to Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles.There has also been a boost in the collaborative medical partnerships emerging between the US and India during this pandemic. In addition, India is one of the fourth largest destinations in Asia for medical devices manufacturing and many US companies have expressed interest in collaborating on this front,” Mahajan said.IACCGH Founding Secretary/Executive Director Jagdip Ahluwalia said that “India’s response to the COVID crisis, as acknowledged by Dr Hotez, falls in line with Chamber’s vision. Since its inception, 21 years ago, that India would be a future global player in key areas like technology, medicine, manufacturing and international trade. This belief has been proved time and again particularly in the last decade.”  Chamber President Tarush Anand expressed pride that India has risen to this global challenge by leveraging the brilliance of its scientific community and extensive manufacturing capabilities in the most efficient manner to help the world recover from a deadly pandemic.Describing vaccines as “one of the highest expressions of science in pursuit of humanitarian goals,” Chief Radiation Oncology Officer and moderator Dr Vivek Kavadi noted that over 28 million people had contracted the virus in the US and more than half a million Americans had tragically died.Lives and businesses had been upended but the breakthrough on the vaccine front has been one reason for cautious optimism.More than 73 million vaccine doses have been administered to date, 15 per cent of the population has received 1 dose while 7 per cent have received both doses, Dr Kavadi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-indias-gift-to-world-in-combating-pandemic-scientist-221901
07-03-2021||New Delhi||ISF nominee to contest against Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram||The leadership of the Left Front have decided to allot the Nandigram seat, against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee (TMC), to ally Indian Secular Front (ISF) in the upcoming West Bengal election.BJP's Suvendu Adhikari will also contest the seat.The Left is in alliance with the Congress and the ISF, which is headed by a Muslim cleric and influential leader of the community, Abbas Siddiqui.Top Left sources said on Sunday the CPI, which traditionally contests from Nandigram, has agreed to leave the seat to the ISF. The seat has a high concentration of Muslim voters, who have been traditionally supporting the TMC.A CPI central leader confirmed the development to TNS.Sources said the Left leaders were waiting for the BJP to announce its nominee against Banerjee in Nandigram. With the saffron party announcing Adhikari's name as its calling card for the battle royale in the constituency, the Left has firmed up its strategy.The sources said that even though the seat has been allotted to the ISF, it will be decided on the name of its nominee for the important battle following a discussion with allies.They further said that the nominee's name will be either announced on Sunday or at the most by Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isf-nominee-to-contest-against-mamata-banerjee-in-nandigram-221899
07-03-2021||Chennai||DMK gives 25 Assembly seats, Kanyakumari LS seat to Congress||After tough negotiations that stretched for days, the DMK on Sunday allotted 25 assembly seats and the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha constituency to its key ally, the Congress.A formal pact for the April 6 Assembly election was signed by DMK president M K Stalin and Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief K S Alagiri at the Dravidian party’s headquarters ‘Anna Arivalayam’ here.After days of deliberations, a point of conclusion was reached late Saturday night and Congress leader and Tamil Nadu in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao told reporters that the agreement was signed in “a spirit of cooperation” when the country was facing a ‘threat’ from the BJP.Rao and Alagiri called on Stalin at his residence here last night and said the pact would be signed on Sunday, but declined to indicate the number of seats that would be allotted.Asked if his party was satisfied with the number of seats allotted by its ally, Rao said the only aim was to ensure the victory of the secular front led by DMK.“Once we sign an agreement, we have to be satisfied because this has been done after a lot of deliberations. Our only aim is now to see that the secular front wins.The time for being satisfied or dissatisfied is over. Now we are in the battlefield. We have to take on our opponents,” Rao said.The decision on accepting the DMK’s offer was taken only after consulting all senior leaders and the high command and “there is no difference of opinion within our party on this issue,” he added.TNCC chief Alagiri, however, pitched in, saying, “we are fully satisfied.”Rao said the battle against the saffron party was not confined to ideology alone, but extended to “saving democracy” from its clutches.The country was being run like a “dictatorship” and elected governments of opposition parties were toppled, he alleged.Recently, the Congress government in neighbouring Puducherry lost majority after its MLAs resigned and Chief Minister V Narayanasamy Cabinet resigned.Rao alleged that the BJP was using “money and government” power to destabilise and finish off the opposition parties.“Their agenda in Tamil Nadu is also the same,” he claimed, adding that by aligning with the AIADMK, the BJP intended to “finish off” that party too.“This is a very dangerous situation the country is facing,” he said.The secular front of DMK, Congress, Left and regional outfits in Tamil Nadu would send a message across the country that “fascist forces” shall be prevented from gaining ground when like-minded parties joined hands, he said.Congress always stood for democratic principles, Rao said and expressed confidence that the secular alliance would sweep the elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The bypoll to Kanyakumari Lok Sabha constituency was necessitated following the death of H Vasanthakumar, who was elected from that segment in 2019.Kumar passed away last year due to COVID-19 and the seat fell vacant.The Tamil Nadu Assembly has 234 seats.The DMK has so far allotted 48 seats to allies. While Congress has got 25, MDMK, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and CPI have got six each, the IUML three and Manithaneya Makkal Katchi two.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dmk-gives-25-assembly-seats-kanyakumari-ls-seat-to-congress-221894

Police had said the vehicle was stolen from Airoli-Mulund Bridge on February 18.Hiren (46) was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on Friday morning.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has taken over the probe into the entire matter.A letter dated March 2, purportedly written by Hiren and addressed to CM Uddhav Thackeray, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and police commissioners of Thane and Mumbai, surfaced on Saturday. The letter had the receiving stamp of the “Commissioner of police, Brihanmumbai” dated March 3.In the letter, Hiren claimed he was being harassed despite not having any knowledge about the culprits, who not only “stole his vehicle but also misused it”. “I have already given my explanation and statements about how the vehicle was stolen, and I am being victimised and suffering harassment by police and news reporters,” Hiren said in the letter.He sought protection and intervention of the authorities to whom the letter was addressed.In the letter, Hiren said he had lodged an FIR with Vikhroli police on February 18 about his missing vehicle.“On February 25, policemen from the ATS told me that the vehicle was found near Ambani’s house with explosives. I was interrogated, and they left,” he said in the letter.Officials from Ghatkopar police questioned him again on February 26, he said.Later, officials from Vikhroli police questioned him and detained him at the police station till the next day early morning, after which he was dropped at his houseon February 27, he said in the letter.Hiren mentioned that he also got calls from Vikhroli and Ghatkopar police stations the same day.On March 1, he was called by the Nagpada ATS, he said.Hiren also said he was interrogated by (Mumbai police officer) Sachin Vaze at the Crime Intelligence Unit’s (CIU) office and asked the same questions.He also claimed that he was questioned by “NIA officers and by Joint CP Bhamre”. “The interrogation by various agencies disturbed my peace of mind. Inspite of being a victim, I am treated as an accused. I have also been receiving calls from media houses who have been harassing me and my family,” he said.Hiren in the letter also requested for necessary legal action into the matter.The viscera of Hiren has also been sent for forensic analysis, police said on Saturday.The autopsy report of Hiren reserved the opinion on the cause of death, officials earlier said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ambani-bomb-case-hiren-wrote-to-maharashtra-cm-alleging-harassment-by-cops-media-221884
07-03-2021||Hyderabad||Stepping up vaccine coverage by May end will help check covid spread, says expert||The spread of COVID-19 in the country would remain at low levels if the vaccination coverage is expanded substantially, possibly by inoculating those above 30 years of age and without comorbidities, by end of May, an expert has said.Though there has been a spike in the number of cases in some states, overall they have remained much on the lower side despite elections being held in some states, G V S Murthy, Director of Indian Institute of Public Health here, set up under the aegis of Public Health Foundation of India, said."A sudden spike in cases has not been seen through civic polls were held in Hyderabad and local body elections took place in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh," he said.The infection is spreading, most probably after those who were leading protected lives got exposed as they moved out of their homes and mingled with others, he said.Citing the seroprevalence reports recently announced in Hyderabad, he said 54 per cent of the city's population is estimated to have antibodies against COVID-19 (up to 70 per cent in some wards), meaning that many people got infected during the last six months without realising it.Observing that protection stays on for around five to six months if a person is already infected, Murthy said it is a good sign that spikes are not being witnessed.If the vaccination drive gathers pace even among those aged above 30 without comorbidities, it would help check the spread of the virus, he said."If we can push vaccine coverage to a high level by May, based upon the volume of vaccines available in the country, the situation in India will remain at low levels," Murthy told PTI.After the nationwide vaccination drive covering health professionals and other frontline workers was launched in January, the country had from March 1 started inoculating people aged above 60 and those over 45 with comorbidities, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the first jab that day.Murthy said that while the pandemic might not come to an end immediately, the situation would be under control as there has been an increase in vaccination coverage.As per available information, antibodies (in the infected) existed for about seven months and there is a possibility of them getting it again if the antibodies decline, he said.Since the highest caseload in the country was witnessed during August-September last year, those infected then may face the risk of getting it again by April-May, he opined.Therefore, those above 30 or 40 years of age can be covered if the vaccination drive is stepped up by about the end of May, he said.This can be achieved by allowing the private sector a bigger role in promoting vaccination, he said.The increased vaccine coverage would provide protection to more people and it would also be difficult to infect others, he added.Murthy said medical management of COVID-19 cases has improved since the beginning of the pandemic with deaths being reduced effectively and that the combination of vaccination and improved medical management would be very beneficial in handling the virus.However, COVID-19 precautions like wearing masks should be continued till the vaccination drive reaches the next stage and also because the efficacy of vaccines would be around 70- 75 per cent, he said."It is still not time to give up protection like masks.Such a situation may not come this year," he added.The practice of wearing masks would have other benefits like the decline in tuberculosis, pneumonia and infections."We have to see what is the benefit to society on a bigger scale," Murthy added.

07-03-2021||New Delhi||Working to build one medical college for every 3 Lok Sabha segments: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the government was working to build one medical college for every three Lok Sabha segments after accomplishing the task of expanding undergraduate and postgraduate medical seats to boost the national health human resource pool.Addressing the Jan Aushadhi Divas event in virtual mode, the Prime Minister said India was stressing generic medicines for affordable and quality healthcare and the network of Jan Aushadhi centres which provide low-cost quality generic drugs had been expanded to 7500 stores. The latest store has been opened in Shillong.After interacting with the beneficiaries of the government's generic medicine push, the PM noted that the Jan Aushadhi Centres had helped the poor save Rs 3,600 crore so far, on account of providing low-cost drugs.“Money saved can be spent by families on better things of life,” he said after beneficiaries — Krishna from Himachal’s Theog; Rubina from Bhopal; and people related to the stores shared their experiences about saving money due to low-cost medicine supply through the stores many said were now known as “Modi ki dukaan.”The PM stressed how the Jan Aushadhi Kendra network had expanded from 100 stores six years ago to 7,500 stores now.He also said that past governments saw health from the prison of illness and treatment but the BJP government had adopted a holistic approach on health.The PM lauded how Indian medicines including traditional medicines had acquired a worldwide reputation with whole grains regaining their pride of place in the food chain.“There was a time when people though millets and whole grains are foods for the poor but that’s changing now. The UN has decided to declare 2023 the Year of the Millets. The world will celebrate the nutrition value of millets in 2023 and this will benefit the Indian small farmers the most because these farmers produce millets,” said the PM, asking people to get vaccinated with COVID jabs at the earliest opportunity.The PM also said that the government would keep stressing generic medicines for quality and affordable health.He also said the government had decided to add 75 Ayush drugs to the list of medicines being provided at Jan Aushadhi Kendras.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/working-to-build-one-medical-college-for-every-3-lok-sabha-segments-pm-221875

Beat them up with sticks: Giriraj Singh to Begusarai residents||Union minister Giriraj Singh has advised the people of his Begusarai Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar to “beat up with bamboo sticks” those officials who appeared insensitive to their concerns.The firebrand BJP leader, who has a reputation of shooting from the hip, made the remark on Saturday while addressing a function organised by an agriculture institute in Khodawandpur near here.The minister, who holds fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy farming portfolios, rued that he frequently receives complaints from common citizens that officials concerned often paid little heed to their complaints.“I say to them, why do you come to me for such small things. MPs, MLAs, village mukhiyas, DMs, SDMs, BDOs... these are all under obligation to serve the people.

07-03-2021||Washington||US President urged not to accept Indian proposal on vax patent||Four top Republican senators have urged US President Joe Biden not to accept a proposal by India and South Africa to the WTO to waive anti-Covid vaccine patents, saying that waiving all rights to intellectual property would end the innovation pipeline and stop the development of new vaccines or boosters to address variants in the virus.Quality control issueMike Lee, Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst and Todd Young, in a letter to President Biden, urged him to reject the upcoming proposal at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).“The proponents of this scheme argue that if we just destroy the intellectual property developed by American companies, we will suddenly have more manufacturers producing Covid vaccines,” they said.“But the opposite is true. By destroying the intellectual property of every American company that has worked on Covid vaccines and treatments, we would be ending the progress — started under Operation Warp Speed — that led to the fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history,” the senators wrote.They alleged that some countries believe that they would benefit from seizing America’s intellectual property, but this is a mistake. The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires countries to provide lengthy monopoly protections for medicines, tests and technologies used to produce them.“Waiving all rights to intellectual property would end the innovation pipeline and stop the development of new vaccines. It also wouldn’t increase the supply of vaccines because of the tremendous time and resources needed to build new manufacturing plants. Even if the waiver may temporarily result in a few copycats attempting to produce what American companies developed, it would introduce major quality control problems,” the senators said. — PTICivil society groups against blockadeRecently, hundreds of American civil society organisations and three Congressmen urged Biden not to block the waiver to vaccines at the WTO, a move they said would boost the treatment of Covid patients worldwide. The need for vaccine development and dissemination across the globe is critically important, feels Congressman Rosa DeLauro.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-president-urged-not-to-accept-indian-proposal-on-vax-patent-221805

It was a pyrrhic victory as the Opposition 10-party Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) opted not to contest the vote on the floor of House by staying away from the proceedings.Pyrrhic victoryNevertheless, the vote will be a relief for Khan, who was in the cross-hairs of a combined Opposition that had held massively attended congregations in Pakistan’s major cities.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had made gains in elections for 48 of 100 seats for the Upper House of Parliament. But the Opposition was galvinated by the defeat of Federal Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh to former PM Yusuf Raza Gilani in one of the Senate races.The next day on Thursday, Khan, in an address to the nation, alleged the Opposition had “bought” the votes of some PTI members to win Gilani’s Senate seat. “This was to show that somehow Imran Khan has lost majority. The next step was to bring a vote of no-confidence … the real reason was to use a vote of confidence as a sword over my head to blackmail me into giving them (amnesty),” he had said while seeking a vote of confidence. Sources said Khan’s win meant that his partnership with the army remained intact as they jointly pursued foreign policy goals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-pm-wins-confidence-vote-amid-boycott-by-opposition-221638

The rockslide brought along with it mounds of earth and snow which could have triggered the flashfloods. With a straight slide line of 1.6 km (5,500 to 3,900 masl), the kinetic energy during the fall generated enough heat to melt the ice. As the debris moved downstream in the Rishi Ganga, it pushed running riverwater ahead of it, including water from small structures along the river path.
