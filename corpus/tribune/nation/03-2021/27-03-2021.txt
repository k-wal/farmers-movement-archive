India is currently a non-permanent member of the UNSC.“Prime Minister Modi expressed appreciation at the generosity of Bangladesh in sheltering and providing humanitarian assistance to the 1.1 million forcibly displaced persons from the Rakhine state of Myanmar,” the joint statement said.According to Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim, Prime Minister Hasina said the return of these people in the quickest possible time was needed since the lingering of the crisis could create grounds for their involvement in terrorist activities and drug trading.“Sooner is the better,” Karim quoted her as saying.In response, Prime Minister Modi told Hasina that his country wants a sustainable return of the refugees in a sustainable manner.Nearly one million Rohingya Muslims fled a crackdown by the Myanmarese military in 2017 in Rakhine state and are living in camps in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh.Myanmar has faced international pressure to allow Rohingyas to return to Rakhine and grant them citizenship rights.

27-03-2021||New Delhi||Increase testing, ensure COVID-appropriate behaviour: Centre to states, UTs reporting surge in cases||The Centre on Saturday strongly advised 12 states and Union Territories reporting a surge in coronavirus cases to significantly increase testing and ensure people follow COVID-appropriate behaviour, noting that one infected person could spread infection to an average of 406 individuals in a 30-day window without restrictions.Highlighting that the country has seen the sharpest rise in weekly COVID-19 cases and fatalities since May 2020, the government said the focus was on 46 districts that have contributed 71 per cent of the cases and 69 per cent of the deaths this month.“Of total 36 districts in Maharashtra, 25 are most affected that account for 59.8 per cent of the cases reported in the country during the past one week,” the Health Ministry said.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level review meeting with additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries (Health and Family Welfare) of 12 states and municipal commissioners and district collectors of 46 districts that are the most affected by rising cases and deaths because of COVID-19.These 12 states and Union Territories are Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Punjab and Bihar.A granular analysis of affected districts in these states and UTs along with some key statistics was presented in the meeting, according to a statement.Almost 90 per cent of the COVID-19 deaths continue to be in the category of those aged above 45 years. Findings of studies were highlighted which depicted that while 90 per cent people are aware, only 44 per cent actually wear face masks. “One infected person could spread COVID-19 to an average of 406 other individuals in a 30-day window without restrictions which could be reduced to just 15 by decreasing physical exposure to 50 per cent and to a further 2.5 (average) by decreasing physical exposure to 75 per cent,” the ministry said.It was also highlighted that the concept of ‘second wave’ reflected more the laxity among everyone regarding COVID-appropriate behaviour and virus containment and management strategy at the ground level.Hence, stringent action, including effective containment and contact tracing, for at least 14 days in the 46 districts was strongly recommended for breaking the chain of transmission and “not frittering away” the gains of collaborative efforts of last year, the Centre told the states.It laid out a five-fold strategy for adoption by the states and UTs for effective containment and management of the COVID pandemic.The states and UTs were asked to exponentially increase testing of COVID-19.“The states were strongly advised for a significant increase of testing in all districts in line with their positivity rate, with increased share of RT-PCR tests, to a ratio of more than 70 per cent of total. Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) to be mostly deployed as a screening tool in flushing out cluster cases from densely populated areas,” the ministry said.They were also asked to carry out effective isolation and contact tracing of those infected.“Testing leading to detection of positive cases is to be followed with prompt tracing of the close contacts and swift isolation. It was advised that an average of 30 close contacts are to be traced, tested and isolated in the first 72 hours,” the Health Ministry said.Health Secretary Bhushan highlighted the need for strict means to be employed for effective containment, with focus on micro-containment zone approach.The ministry re-emphasised on the need to strengthen public and private hospital infrastructure and re-energise the healthcare workers for removal of complacency and fatigue.“Targeted approach to reduce mortality rate and number of deaths to be implemented. In this regard, states strictly follow the Standard National Treatment Protocol for effective clinical management of the severe cases in ICUs. In this regard, it was pointed out that Punjab and Chhattisgarh despite being smaller in population size than Karnataka and Kerala, are reporting higher fatalities,” the ministry said.The Centre also asked states and UTs to give renewed attention to ensuring ‘COVID-appropriate behaviour’ in crowded places like markets, inter-state bus stands, schools, colleges, railway stations, etc.States also advised enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour through penal measures like heavy fines which sends a strong exemplary message among the people.“States were informed that 70 per cent of the cases can be controlled by adherence to CAB alone,” the ministry said.The states were also asked to focus on universalisation of vaccination in the specified priority population age groups as an aid to containment strategy in districts where maximum cases are being reported.“It was reiterated that there is no shortage of vaccines. States to optimally utilise all vaccination capacities within the public and private sectors in all districts, and make full use of the available vaccine stocks without keeping a buffer stock in anticipation of a shortage,” the ministry said.The four depots at Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and Karnal have the requisite buffer stocks and all requirements of states, based on their daily consumption and available stocks, are being met, it said.“States were also asked to make advance planning of logistics and infrastructure management for 1-1.5 months as any unchecked spread of infection among the community may overwhelm the local administration. Re-appropriation of unused vaccine stocks in a district to focus on the high burden districts was also suggested,” the ministry added.

It was a strategically vital area for both sides as it comprised road links to Jammu from Punjab, which could be cut off by the enemy. Pakistan Army generally regards this as their most humbling defeat despite numerical superiority, next only to the Battle of Laungewala in Rajasthan.Born in 1924 at Poona (now Pune), he was commissioned into the 13th Frontier Force Rifles in 1943. The unit moved to Burma during the Second World War, where then Second Lieutenant Pinto commanded a Medium Machine Gun Platoon.Post Independence, he assigned to the 2nd battalion of Assam Regiment and when the Brigade of Guards was raised, he was transferred to 3 Guards.

He also served as Director, Military Training where he also headed the Joint Training Committee, Services Sports Control Board, Army Mountaineering Federation and Army Rifle Association. He was also vice president of Indian Hockey Federation and Indian Olympic Association.On promotion to Lieutenant General, he took over as General Officer Commanding 33 Corps in Sukhna and then moved as the Commandant, National Defence College. In July 1980, he was elevated as Army Commander and took over the Central Command in Lucknow from where he retired after a two year tenure. After hanging up his boots, he had settled in Pune.Maj Gen Pinto’s father, Alexander Pinto, worked in the military accounts department. His elder brother Sydney Alexander was a Major General in the Corps of Engineers, while his elder sister, Phyllis Mary, served in the Women’s Auxiliary Corps in India and later in Burma.

The e-filing and data which can be contained is going to take away the need for many storage rooms and many rooms which are necessary for storing papers. The SC has done its bit on issues of court infrastructure. It has devised benchmarks and frameworks for minimum standards,” he said in his speech.The CJI said that the discussion on infrastructure has largely been on the quantitative part, that is on building more courtrooms.“Though building more courtrooms is necessary and important, there was very little emphasis on modernising the existing courtrooms. Though the pandemic has posed a lot of problems to access to justice, it has paved the way for modernising the courtroom,” he said.The CJI also stressed the need to have a new building for the Bombay High Court in Mumbai.“Bombay (High Court) also needs a new building. The Bombay building was constructed for seven judges. It is now housing more than 40. It is impossible,” he said.On the judiciary in Goa, an erstwhile Portuguese colony, the CJI said that the legacy of justice in Goa spans more than four-and-a-half centuries.“I am including the period before the liberation contrary to many other areas. Even though it was not part of Indian union, there was well-established system of administration or justice,” the CJP said.The CJI had also presided over as a judge on the Goa bench of the high court before being promoted to the apex court.“I am the only judge or one of the few judges who sat so often at Goa. I heard remarks that Justice Bobde is a Goa judge. I am happy when I am described like this because that’s when I admired Goa, its culture, natural habitat, its music and even football,” he said.

27-03-2021||Kolkata||Mamata’s purported audio clip seeking help from BJP leader to win Nandigram stirs row in Bengal||A huge controversy erupted on Saturday amid the polling for 30 assembly seats in West Bengal, with the BJP releasing an audio clip where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is purportedly heard cajoling a BJP leader from Nandigram to re-join the TMC and help her win the seat.Banerjee is pitted against her former protege and now the BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram, the spring board that propelled her to power in 2011, dislodging the Left Front from power after a 34-year unbroken rule.A BJP delegation, led by party general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya, met the state’s chief electoral officer and handed over the tape, claiming Banerjee was using her official position to influence the outcome of the bitterly contested assembly poll.The ruling TMC questioned the genuineness of the audio tape, but asserted that since Pralay Pal was a former TMC leader who switched over to the BJP, there was nothing wrong with Banerjee trying to woo him back.Pal, who pledged his allegiance to the Adhikari family, whose two members are still TMC Lok Sabha members, claimed Banerjee personally called him up and asked him to help her win the Nandigram seat.“You should help us win Nandigram. Look, I know you have some grievances, but that’s due mostly to the Adhikaris who never allowed me to get into Nandigram or East Midnapore. I will take care of everything henceforth,” Banerjee purportedly told Pal, a BJP official in East Midnapore, the district where the Adhikari family holds sway.Pal, however, was not game.“Didi, you called me and I am honoured. But I can’t betray the Adhikaris as they have stood by me through thick and thin,” he was heard saying in the audio clip.He later told TV news channels that Banerjee called him up and requested him to return to the TMC, a proposal he declined. “I am now working for the BJP and can’t betray them,” said Pal.PTI could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio tape.Sharing the clip of the purported conversation, BJP’s social media head Amit Malviya tweeted, “Massive! Mamata Banerjee calls Proloy Pal, BJP’s district Vice President in Nandigram and pleads for help! Proloy tells her that he was humiliated in TMC, and he, along with this family, cannot betray the BJP. Pishi is definitely losing Nandigram and TMC Bengal.”“Only a candidate who has accepted defeat can speak the way Mamata Banerjee has spoken,” Vijayvargiya told journalists.When asked about whether the tape was authentic, the BJP leader retorted: “I am saying what I am saying with full responsibility (jawabdari).”“She’s imploring (yachna) for help. It shows she has accepted defeat,” he said.The TMC said the tape was not verified but found nothing wrong in Banerjee approaching a former party man.“First of all, the clip is not verified. We don’t know whether it is true or false. But we don’t see anything wrong in a politician calling her former leaders or aides. This is quite natural in politics,” TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said.The high-profile Nandigram seat will go to poll on April 1 in the second phase.

27-03-2021||Washington||Biden invites 40 world leaders, including Modi, Jinping, to virtual summit on climate||President Joe Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to a US-hosted virtual summit on climate next month to underscore the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action, the White House said.Biden will host a two-day climate summit of world leaders starting on Earth Day, April 22, in which he will outline the US goal for reductions of carbon emissions by 2030 -- known as the nationally determined contribution under the historic Paris accord.The White House on Friday said a total of 40 world leaders, including Prime Minister Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, were invited to the conference, which will be live streamed to the public.“It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow,” it said.Other leaders invited for the summit include Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Bhutanese Prime Minister Lotay Tshering are the other two leaders from South Asia to be invited for the mega conference.The White House said a key objective of both the Leaders’ Summit and the COP26 will be to catalyse efforts to keep limiting warming 1.5 degree Celsius’ goal within reach. The summit will also highlight examples of how enhanced climate ambition will create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts, it added.By the time of the summit, the United States will announce an ambitious 2030 emissions target as its new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement, the White House said.In his invitation, Biden urged leaders to use the summit as an opportunity to outline how their countries also will contribute to stronger climate ambition, it said.The summit will reconvene the US-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, which brings together 17 countries responsible for approximately 80 per cent of global emissions and global GDP.Biden also invited the heads of other countries that are demonstrating strong climate leadership, are especially vulnerable to climate impacts, or are charting innovative pathways to a net-zero economy. A small number of business and civil society leaders will also participate in the summit, the White House said.On the campaign trail, Biden made climate change a central issue, setting a goal of ensuring that the US achieves net-zero emissions by 2050.         He has signed several executive actions his first week in office related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the Interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters.Key themes of the summit will include galvanising efforts by the world’s major economies to reduce emissions during this critical decade to keep a limit to warming of 1.5 degree Celsius within reach and mobilising public and private sector finance to drive the net-zero transition and to help vulnerable countries cope with climate impacts, it said.The summit will also look into the economic benefits of climate action, with a strong emphasis on job creation, and the importance of ensuring all communities and workers benefit from the transition to a new clean energy economy.It will also look for ways to spurring transformational technologies that can help reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, while also creating enormous new economic opportunities and building the industries of the future, the White House said.Among other key issues include showcasing sub-national and non-state actors that are committed to green recovery and an equitable vision for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and are working closely with national governments to advance ambition and resilience, it said.The summit will also discuss opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change, address the global security challenges posed by climate change and the impact on readiness, and address the role of nature-based solutions in achieving net-zero by 2050 goals, the White House said.

27-03-2021||Bengaluru||Sex scandal: Have not met woman in the purported video, says D K Shivakumar||Karnataka Congress President D K Shivakumar on Saturday said he has never met the woman in the purported sex video allegedly involving former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, as the row took a new twist with the surfacing of an audio clip in which she can be heard taking his name.This even as the woman, who believed to be in the video, has released a fourth video statement seeking protection to her family members and stated that she was feeling tortured to the level that she wanted to kill herself.Hours after the city police registered an FIR against Jarkiholi for sexual abuse based on the woman's complaint on Friday, a purported unauthenticated recording of a telephonic conversation between her and family members had surfaced in which she can be heard talking about going to Shivakumar's house to meet him.The audio clip had triggered sharp reactions, with Karnataka BJP attacking Shivakumar and demanding that the Congress should seek his resignation as the party's state unit chief."We are in public life, you (media) work as a bridge between people, we politicians too try to help people who are in distress.That woman has said that she has tried to meet me," Shivakumar told reporters.Noting that daily at least 10 people meet him with personal problems and seeking help, he said, so in that way she might have come, but has never met him."If she comes even today, I will know details and verify things," he said.The conversation in the purported audio clip is said to have taken place on the night (March 2) the sex CD was leaked to television channels.In the conversation with her family members including brother and mother, Shivakumar's name has been referred a couple of times as the woman tries to repeatedly convince family members that she was safe and the video and audio clips aired on television were fake, morphed and voice modulated.Observing that it was true that he was "tracking" Jarkiholi when some senior Congress leaders were defecting from the party (during 2019 political turmoil leading to collapse of Congress-JD(S) govt), to know about their movements, Shivakumar said, "but this (alleged sex CD) is his (Jarkiholi) personal matter.""We don't want personal issues.... I had got to know about things from those in the media about what all was happening, but it is their personal issues. I don't need it," he said.In her fourth video statement released today, the woman too has authenticated the conversation in the audio clip and said she had gone to meet Shivakumar, but could not.The woman said she got scared when the video was aired by news channels and got in touch with a person named Naresh, who works in the media for help.The man then advised her to seek state Congress President D K Shivakumar's help, using the contacts he has."... as I was getting repeated calls from family members who were frightened and my parents were crying.I tried convincing my mother and told that I was going to Shivakumar's house to talk to him," she said, adding that she had gone to the Congress leader's residence along with Naresh but was unable to meet him, and had to return as things were developing fast.To a question, whether he knew Naresh, whose name has been linked with the CD row, Shivakumar said, "Yes, he is someone known to me, he is from the media, I have been to his house also.He had met me several times and informed me about things."Asked about BJP demanding for his resignation, Shivakumar merely said, he was really happy to hear it.On the woman seeking protection for her family, he said the government has to provide it, we have good police officers who will take care.The woman in her latest video statement expressed fear about the safety of her family and wondered whether to live or die.She requested the SIT not to provide security to her family at their current location, but to bring them to Bengaluru."I don't know where my parents, my brothers and grandmother are, I want them to be in Bengaluru. This is my request to SIT.I want them to be in front of me if I have to give my statement," she said, adding that she was safe and no one has kidnapped her.The woman said that she was going through torture for the last 24 days."I don't know what to do... I want to mention Ramesh Jarkiholi's name and kill myself over the torture."     "Ramesh Jarkiholi is saying that he can make the government collapse in one day and is ready to spend any amount to put everyone behind bars. What does this mean?" she asked."People should understand it. They are ready to do anything, they can harm my parents or kill me," she said.Commenting on the development, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said the series of audio and videos are coming like a television serial, and the SIT will investigate the CD, audio and video in detail and examine it scientifically also."As I have already said, the SIT will not buckle under any kind of pressure or influence or attempts to mislead.It is working systematically as per law without favouring any one to find out the truth and will continue to do so," he added.Meanwhile, the woman's family members appeared before the SIT and officials are gathering information from them, sources said.Her father and two brothers have appeared before SIT which is investigating the sex scandal, they said.A day after news channels aired videos of the alleged sex scandal, Jarkiholi, who was Water Resources Minister in Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa-led cabinet, had resigned on March 3.Jarkiholi has repeatedly claimed that he was innocent and that the video was "fake".

The Indian High Commission in a statement said the bilateral mechanisms were being utilised to see an expeditious settlement of the issue.Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other’s waters. The fishermen issue has become a major irritant in bilateral ties.In January, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka, he met with Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda and raised the fishermen issue and reviewed bilateral cooperation in fisheries.“We look forward to the early return of our fishermen from Sri Lanka,” Jaishankar had said.Later, a three-member committee was appointed by the Sri Lankan government which will make recommendations on measures to stop poaching by Indian fishermen inside the country’s waters after four people were killed when an Indian trawler capsized after colliding with a Sri Lankan Navy vessel.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sri-lanka-releases-all-54-indian-fishermen-arrested-this-week-231315

27-03-2021||New Delhi||No possibility of lockdown in Delhi: Jain||Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday dismissed any possibility of imposing another lockdown in Delhi, saying it was not a solution to check the spread of the coronavirus that is again surging rapidly.Jain said there was a logic behind the lockdown enforced earlier as nobody knew then how the virus propagates."It follows a 14-day cycle—between a person catching the infection and recovering from it. Experts said the virus will die if a lockdown is imposed for 21 days," Jain told reporters."Authorities kept on extending the lockdown, but the virus did not die. I don't think lockdown is a solution," he said.There is "no possibility" of imposing another lockdown in the city, Jain said.The minister added that there were enough hospital beds available for coronavirus patients, and it could be increased if the need arises.Delhi reported over 1,500 coronavirus cases for the second day on the trot on Friday, while nine more people, highest in around two months, succumbed to the pathogen,  the Health Department said.The 1,534 new infections pushed the tally to 6,54,276, while over 6.36 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. This is the highest number of cases since December 16 when 1,547 people tested positive, according to official data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-possibility-of-lockdown-in-delhi-jain-231310
27-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Anxiety, boredom, panic attacks are a few impacts of lockdown||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 25COVID-19 induced lockdown and restrictions may have changed personalities like never before or so believe researchers across the world and at home.As a growing mass of people present with varied consequences of the lockdown – ranging from acute anxiety to neurological disorders -- specialists at Bengaluru-based National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences note that influenza viruses are historically known to cause long term disorders.The range of impact is vast – from anxiety, boredom, panic attacks reported by people trapped with estranged partners through long periods of the lockdown and residual restrictions to a sense of personality alteration experienced by people housed with loving companions.“The lockdown had multiple effects. Feelings of stress and a sense of loss of control over the circumstances was pervasive. Life habits changed, masks became a mandate. Movements were hampered. What we also saw in a growing number of people was severe mental health issues like depression, anxiety disorders, hypochondriasis, post-traumatic stress disorder, complicated grief and substance abuse,” NIMHANS review of the post COVID lockdown scenario reveals.Experts say that social readjustment rating scales they use to measure personality disorders and changes do not yet have COVID-19 like pandemics or lockdown as factors.“One could consider compiling an entirely new measure of life events related to this pandemic and its aftermath. These life events would perhaps have similar impacts on mental health and illnesses, like any other life event, unless it turns out to be something different, which only time will tell,” NIMHANS researchers say.Significant mental health consequences of COVID-19 pandemic globally are however well established by now. “Stress and other mental health concerns have stemmed initially from fears of infection, restriction of movement because of lockdown and later from the direct consequences of infection. Close on the heels of the pandemic was the enormous socio-economic impact, the effects of which are slowly unfurling,” the experts say.The pandemic and consequential lockdown has also brought to the fore factors that are commonly recognised to precipitate suicide.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anxiety-boredom-panic-attacks-are-a-few-impacts-of-lockdown-231309
27-03-2021||Dhaka||India and Bangladesh want stability, love and peace in world: PM Modi||India and Bangladesh want stability, love and peace instead of instability, terror and unrest in the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday as he underlined that the two friendly neighbours want to see the world progressing through their own development.Prime Minister Modi made the remarks while speaking to the Matua community members after offering prayers at their temple in Gopalganj’s Orakandi - the birthplace of Hindu mystic figure and community’s spiritual guru Harichand Thakur.“Both India and Bangladesh want to see the world progressing through their own development. Both the countries want to see stability, love, and peace instead of instability, terror, and unrest in the world,” Modi said.Modi said he was waiting for this opportunity for many years and during his visit to Bangladesh in 2015, he had expressed desire to visit Orakandi, which has come true now.This place is a pilgrimage site for the spiritual relationship between India and Bangladesh, he said.“I was speaking to some people here. They were saying who could have thought that India’s Prime Minister would visit Orakandi,” Modi said, adding that he was feeling the same emotions as felt by the Matua community members in India after coming to Orakandi, from where Harichand Thakur disseminated his pious message.Orakandi is the abode of Hindu Matua community, a large number of whom are residents of neighbouring West Bengal.Prime Minister Modi announced that India will upgrade one girls’ middle school and set up a primary school in Orakandi.Analysts said Modi’s planned temple visits carry a political significance at the time of the ongoing assembly elections in West Bengal. The Prime Minister was accompanied by BJP MP from West Bengal Shantanu Thakur during his visit to Orakandi.The Matua community’s vote may determine the winner in some seats in the elections to the West Bengal state assembly, the first phase of which began on Saturday.Modi said the Matua community celebrates ‘Baroni Shanan Utshab’ every year on the auspicious occasion of the birth anniversary of Harichand Thakur and a large number of devotees from India come to Orakandi to participate in this festival.“To make this pilgrimage easier for citizens of India, efforts will be made on behalf of the Government of India,” he said.“We are also committed to grand events and various works reflecting the glorious history of the Matua community in Thakurnagar (West Bengal),” Modi said.“I have always been very close to the family members of the Thakurbari,” he added.                    “The way India and Bangladesh governments are working towards strengthening their ties, Harichand Thakur and Thakurbari have been doing this for ages. This place symbolises the spiritual tryst of India and Bangladesh,” he said.In his address, Modi said that it was important for both India and Bangladesh to come together and fight common challenges.He said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, India and Bangladesh proved their capabilities.“Both nations are facing this pandemic strongly and fighting it together. India is working by considering that it is its duty that the ‘Made in India’ vaccine reaches the citizens of Bangladesh,” Modi added.He said India is moving forward with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas’, and Bangladesh is its co-passenger in it.“Bangladesh is presenting a strong example of development and change in front of the world and India is your co-passenger in these efforts,” he added.Last time when Prime Minister Modi visited Bangladesh in 2015, he offered puja at Dhakeshwari temple in the national capital.Bangladesh has taken extra security measures for the Indian premier’s visit in the wake of protests by few leftist and Islamist groups.In 2016, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) said their latest vital sample statistics report found the country’s total population to be 15.89 crore by the end of 2015 with the number of Hindus at 1.70 crore in the Muslim-majority nation.

The slept on rail tracks near Karmad, around 30 km from Aurangabad, due to exhaustion, when they were run over by the train early morning on May 8 last year.The district administration of Shahdol said it has recently sent a letter to the authorities in Maharashtra's Aurangabad, requesting them to give the death certificates of the deceased to their families, an official said.The family members of the deceased here said that they had applied for the death certificate before the then Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Jaisingh Nagar."However, the official said that the death certificate will be issued by the authorities where the mishap occurred," said Sunita Singh, wife of one of the deceased Rajbahor.She said that in the absence of her husband's death certificate, she is unable to get the widow pension of the state government.Chandrawati, wife of another deceased Deepak Singh, said the death certificate is required to avail the benefits of all the government-run schemes.Parvati Singh, wife of another deceased Brajesh, said she was not able to get the works related to banks done in absence of a certificate.Gajraj Singh, who lost his two sons in the incident, said the bank officials have been asking him to bring death certificates to operate the accounts of the deceased.However, Jaisingh Nagar's SDM Dileep Pandey said the death certificates will be issued by the authorities under whose jurisdiction the accident took place."We recently wrote two letters to the Aurangabad administration in this regard," he said.According to him, the district collector of Shahdol also recently talked to his Aurangabad counterpart in this regard. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-months-on-kin-of-mp-men-run-over-by-train-in-maharashtra-await-death-certificates-231305
27-03-2021||New Delhi||Is the 'double mutant' variant found in India more dangerous?||Amid the surge of Covid-19 cases along with other mutated variants, India has reported the presence of a 'double mutant' coronavirus variant, triggering fear among many.However, health experts on Friday said that the double mutant variant may be less dangerous than expected as the most vulnerable patients are having only mild illnesses.The experts emphasised that as per the current evidence, new variants are observed from few states. But, details about its epidemiology are yet to be known."There is no need to panic about the strains and mutation as it's a completely natural and unavoidable process. Covid appropriate behaviour and accepting vaccines remains the solution for any strain," Harshal R Salve, Associate Professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), New Delhi, told IANS.Also, they are hopeful that the present vaccines available may help us protect against the recently reported variant too."There is a strong possibility that the vaccine may be effective in protecting against a new variant," said Neha Gupta, Infectious Diseases Specialist at Medanta - The Medicity Gurgaon.This week, the Union Health Ministry said that a total of 771 variants of concerns (VOCs) have been detected in a total of 10,787 positive samples shared by the states and union territories, including  a new double mutant variant.These include 736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage, 34 samples of the South African (B.1.351) lineage and one sample of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage."Though VOCs and a new double mutant variant have been found in India, these have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish or direct relationship or explain the rapid increase in  cases in some states," the Health Ministry said.The government said that an analysis of the samples collected from Maharashtra showed "an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations" compared with December last year."Such (double) mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity," the health ministry said in a statement.These mutations have been found in about 15-20 per cent of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs.These have been categorised as VOCs but require the same epidemiological and public health response of 'increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases  and contacts as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol" by the states and Union Territories, according to the Health Ministry.According to Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport in the US, the E484Q is similar to E484K—a mutation seen in the B.1.351 (South Africa) and  P.1 (Brazil) variants, the BBC reported on Thursday.India reported 59,118 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day spike since October, 2020, taking the total tally to 1,18,46,652 on Friday. Cases have been increasing by leaps  and bounds for the past two weeks.With the death of 257 people in the last 24 hours, the fatality toll has reached 1,60,949 in India.

27-03-2021||Washington/New Delhi||Digital tax: USTR proposes retaliatory trade actions against India, 5 other countries||The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has proposed retaliatory trade actions against India and certain other countries that have imposed or are considering equalisation levy/digital services tax on e-commerce companies.It has issued notices seeking public comments on proposed trade actions against six countries, including India.The USTR, in a statement, said it "is proceeding with the public notice and comment process on possible trade actions to preserve procedural options before the conclusion of the statutory one-year time period for completing the investigations".According to a USTR document pertaining to India, it has requested "written comments regarding a potential trade action in connection with the Section 301 investigation of India's Digital Services Tax."On this, sources in the government on Saturday said India would examine the proposed action with the stakeholders concerned and would take suitable measures, keeping in mind the trade and commercial interest of the country and overall interest of its people.In June 2020, the US initiated an investigation under Section 301 of the US Trade Act, 1974 against the taxation on digital services adopted or under consideration by India, Italy, Turkey, the UK, Spain and Austria.The report of this investigation in January this year concluded that India's equalisation levy, by its structure and operation, discriminates against US digital companies.It was strongly opposed by India.The US had requested for bilateral consultations in this matter, and India had submitted its comments to the USTR on July 15, 2020. It had also participated in a bilateral consultation held on November 5, 2020."Consequent to the determination and findings, now USTR has proposed a retaliatory action under Section 301 against India's equalisation levy, along with other countries," a source said.USTR Katherine Tai has stated that the US is committed to working with its trading partners to resolve its concerns with digital services taxes and address broader issues of international taxation."The US remains committed to reaching an international consensus through the OECD process on international tax issues. However, until such a consensus is reached, we will maintain our options under the Section 301 process, including, if necessary, the imposition of tariffs," Tai has said.According to the USTR document, the proposed action includes imposition of additional ad valorem tariffs on certain products from India, such as sea food, bamboo products, semi-precious and precious stones, furniture, cork and cigarette papers.

People have seen the performance of our government in the last five years,” he said after casting his vote.State Congress chief Ripun Bora cast his vote at Gohpur, from where he contested, and claimed that there is an anti-incumbency wave against the ruling BJP.“The BJP’s misrule, corruption, syndicate, price rise—we have taken these issues to the people and they will vote accordingly. The Congress will emerge as the winner in this election and will form the government,” he said.Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami is in the fray to retain his Jorhat seat on basis of “huge developmental works” done by him, while Raijor Dal chief Akhil Gogoi is trying his luck for the first time from the Sivasagar constituency.Fates of a host of ministers such as Ranjit Dutta (Behali), Naba Kumar Doley (Dhakuakha), Jogen Mohan (Mahmora), Sanjoy Kishan (Tinsukia), Atul Bora (Bokakhat) and Keshab Mahanta (Kaliabor) were also sealed in this phase.Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia (Nazira) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) president Lurinjyoti Gogoi (Duliajan and Naharkatiya) were also in the fray in this phase.Voting began at 7 am in the 47 seats in the Northeastern state and most of them witnessed a triangular contest among the ruling BJP-AGP alliance, the Congress-led Grand Alliance and the newly formed regional grouping Asom Jatiya Parishad-Raijor Dal.A number of polling stations reported malfunctioning and technical glitches of the Electronic Voting Machines and those were replaced immediately, the EC official said without sharing the number of EVMs replaced.Long queues were seen outside polling booths since morning with voters and election officials adhering to COVID- 19 protocols in some booths. However, the majority of the electorate did not follow the guidelines and were seen huddling in groups.Voters who came without masks were provided with one at the polling stations that had facilities like sanitiser, thermal scanners and soap as part of COVID-19 protocol.Each voter was also given a disposable plastic glove to wear on their right hand for touching the EVM.First-time voters in many polling stations were greeted with saplings and ‘Gamosa’, a traditional hand-woven Assamese scarf.Voting took place across 13,454 polling stations.Women officials exclusively conducted the exercise in 479 polling stations.Webcasting facility was also arranged in 5,772 booths identified as vulnerable, critical and sensitive polling stations along with those with a large number of voters.A total of 300 companies of security forces were deployed in the first phase across 12 districts of upper Assam and the northern bank of Brahmaputra.

Various parties make tall promises during elections and seldom meet the people once they get elected," Saravanan, who is fighting the poll on garbage bin symbol, claims.He is from Anupanadi in Madurai and his aim is to make the people elect a genuine candidate who can serve them but not offer cash or freebies to get elected.Archrivals AIADMK and DMK, engaged in a tough battle for power, have promised a slew of freebies including gadgets, doles and assistance to various groups of population.While the AIADMK has promised washing machines to all households, DMK said it would give away tablets to students, and have sought to woo the womenfolk with promises of monthly assistance.Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam has also promised cash assistance to the elderly and women among others.The proponents of such largesse have described their promises as those "free of cost" and the list ever since 2006 include free colour TV sets, gold for thali (Mangal sutra), laptops and milch cows.

Lack of global cooperation and disparity in the accessibility of vaccines will affect the poorest nations the most,” Naidu said.India has been at the forefront of the global fight against COVID-19. Naidu told the General Assembly that India would not only be vaccinating 300 million of its own frontline workers over the next six months but in the process had also supplied vaccines to over 70 nations."In fact, as of today we have supplied more vaccines globally than have vaccinated our own people,” Naidu said.Two of India's vaccines, including the indigenously developed Covaxin, have already been granted emergency authorisation, Naidu said, adding that 30 more vaccine candidates are at various phases of clinical trials.The vaccine Covishield is the version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenously developed vaccine by pharma company Bharat Biotech.

Polling was largely peaceful, though some stray incidents of violence were reported from some areas.Meanwhile, a BJP delegation met the EC officials here protesting against an attack on BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari's brother Soumendu Adhikari. Soumendu has accused the Trinamool Congress of causing trouble at Contai and said that he was attacked when he tried to stop the Trinamool supporters, who were allegedly driving away the voters."Elections should be free and fair. The state's ruling Trinamool Congress is scared. We have given some names to the EC to take necessary action," Soumendu said."This is the most peaceful elections I have seen in Bengal in the last four decades. Yes, there have been a few sporadic incidents but those were due to some anti-social elements. If that section of anti-social elements can be arrested, there will be no more problem for the voters in the rest of the phases of polling," BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargi said, as he congratulated the poll panel for conducting a free and peaceful elections in the first phase.Earlier, a Trinamool Congress delegation led by the party's Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Mala Roy met the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) in Kolkata and raised concerns over the difference in the figures provided by the EC. The delegation demanded that from the next phase, the polling agent must be a local of the concerned polling booth so that it becomes easy for all to track them.The Trinamool Congress also questioned the EC on how the voting percentage reduced drastically to half within five minutes. "What is happening @ECISVEEP?! Could you explain how voting percentage drastically reduced to half within a gap of just 5 minutes?! Shocking!," it tweeted."Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is under pressure and complaining about EVMs because they know they are losing...that is why they are saying such things," BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh told mediapersons.

27-03-2021||Chandigarh||‘Gentleman Judge’ Nijjar passes away||A gentleman never judges is one idiom that didn’t fit Justice Surinder Singh Nijjar at all. For, he was a gentleman and a Judge too. The former SC Judge, who passed away at PGIMER here this morning following cardiac arrest at the age of 71, would always be remembered not just for his judgments, but also his etiquettes—both inside and outside the courtroom.There was something different about the way the extremely fair and handsome Justice Nijjar would carry himself. The English penchant for manners and socially appropriate behaviour was constantly visible in his working and interactions. It, perhaps, had something to do with his pre-practice days.Available information suggests Justice Nijjar studied in London since childhood and obtained his LLB degree from the University of London in 1972. He practised in Britain from 1977-79 before shifting to India. He practised before the Punjab and Haryana HC from 1979 till his elevation as an Additional Judge in 1996. He went on to become the Acting Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana HC before his elevation as the Chief Justice of the Calcutta HC.“When you appeared before Justice Nijjar, you judged him by his demeanour and his judgment. When you left, you also judged him by his heart,” says a senior Punjab and Haryana HC advocate. Those who bid adieu to Justice Nijjar include ex-SC Judge Justice Kuldip Singh and former Chief Justices SS Sodhi and Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan. Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh also mourned his death.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gentleman-judge-nijjar-passes-away-231100

In Dhaka, a clash took place near a large mosque while PM Modi was meeting opposition leaders.Addressing the main golden jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh’s Independence and the birth centenary of its founder, Modi said while the efforts of then PM Indira Gandhi in Bangladesh’s freedom war were well known, a distinguished role was played by several Indian Army officials and personnel such as Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw, Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora, Gen. J F R Jacob, Lance Naik Albert Ekka, Group Captain Chandan Singh, Captain Mohan Narayan Rao Samant and several others.At a time when both countries are set to negotiate an FTA, PM Modi invited 50 Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to India to get associated with its innovation ecosystem and meet venture capitalists.Received at the airport by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, PM Modi’s engagements today were imbued with deep symbolic significance for it was the Indian Army along with the Mukti Bahini that had played a pivotal role in helping Bangladesh attain Independence.The valour of the 1971 war’s Muktijodhas (liberation fighters) will “continue to inspire future generations to fight injustice and defend the cause of righteousness”, wrote the PM in the visitor’s book at the martyrs’ memorial.March 26 commemorates the country’s declaration of independence from Pakistan. This is the Golden Jubilee of the liberation war as also the birth centenary of its founder Sheikh Mujibur Rehman. At the main function of the day, PM Modi donned the “Mujib coat” which was the signature garment worn by Mujibur Rahman, much like India’s first PM’s “Nehru jacket”. PM Modi revealed at the gathering that he had also protested, as a show of solidarity, for the liberation of Bangladesh. “I must have been 20-22 years old when I and many of my colleagues had done satyagraha for the freedom of the people of Bangladesh,” he said.The PM handed over the Gandhi Peace Prize Award, conferred posthumously on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to his daughters — Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana.Ties in large measure due to Indira: SoniaCongress president Sonia Gandhi sent a congratulatory video message to Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, recalling the role that Indira Gandhi played in the liberation of Bangladesh. She said the special bond between the people of the two nations was largely due to Indira’s role in 1971. “Most of all, both Bangladesh and India, are being called upon today to protect and strengthen their composite heritage,” she added.

27-03-2021||---||Phase-1: West Bengal, Assam vote today, 455 in fray||Kolkata, March 26Tight security arrangements have been put in place in 30 of the 294 Assembly constituencies in West Bengal and 47 of the 126 in neighbouring Assam that go to the polls in the first phase of voting tomorrow.A total of 732 companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) had been deployed in West Bengal for the first phase, said Vivek Dubey, Special Police Observer. Over 73 lakh voters will decide the fate of 191 candidates.SC relief for Didi’s poll agent, order stayedThe SC has stayed the operation of a Calcutta HC order that led to reinstitution of several criminal cases against CM Mamata Banerjee’s poll agent, SK Supian, in connection with Nandigram protests against acquisition.The seats in West Bengal where elections are to be held in the first phase include all constituencies in Purulia and Jhargram and some segments in Bankura, Purba Medinipur and Paschim Medinipur districts. In Jhargram, 11 paramilitary personnel would be deployed per booth, the highest for any election held in the state so far, officials said.Taking into account the possibility of violence, the polling in West Bengal is being held over eight phases. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the state had reported nearly 700 cases of violence.The ruling TMC and the Opposition BJP, the two main contenders in the fray, have often accused each other of violence. The BJP alleged TMC goons were behind the murder of its over 130 party workers since 2016.Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and Deputy Election Commissioner Sudip Jain had recently reviewed poll preparedness ahead of the first phase.The first phase of polling will decide the electoral fate of 191 candidates, including 21 women. The TMC had won 27 of these 30 seats in 2016 when the BJP was yet to become a major player in West Bengal. In Assam, the first phase is crucial for the saffron party to retain power in the state and achieve its ‘Mission 100-plus’. In 2016, the BJP and its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had bagged 35 (BJP 27, AGP 8) out these 47 constituencies.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-AGP alliance had again led in 40 of the 47 seats. The saffron party is, however, expected to face challenges in upper Assam from Assamese-speaking people’s opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act and the formation of two new anti-CAA political parties, Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal. The EC had announced three-phase polling in Assam.The constituencies going to polls in the first phase include Majuli (ST) from where Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal is seeking re-election, and Nazira, pocket borough of Leader of Opposition and Congress candidate Debabrata Saikia. As many as 81,09,815 voters, including 4,032,481 women, will cast their votes across 11,537 polling stations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/phase-1-west-bengal-assam-vote-today-455-in-fray-231082

27-03-2021||---||Political slugfest over PM Modi’s ‘Satyagraha for Bangladesh’ remarks||New Delhi, March 26Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on Friday that he was part of a Satyagraha held to back the liberation of Bangladesh led to a political slugfest back home, with the Congress countering the claim and the BJP presenting a citation Bangladesh awarded to late Atal Behari Vajpayee for organising a Satyagraha outside Parliament to demand the liberation of Bangladesh.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh questioned the Satyagraha claim after historian Srinath Raghavan said on Twitter, “The claim that ANYONE did satyagraha for the freedom of Bangladesh and were arrested is too ridiculous to require refutation.”BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, however, refuted the Congress and a section of historians questioning the Satyagraha and said on Twitter, “Was Prime Minister Modi part of satyagrah organised by Jana Sangha for recognition of Bangladesh?“Yes, he was. A citation awarded by Bangladesh to Vajpayee ji speaks of the rally. PM Modi, in a book authored in 1978, also wrote about going to Tihar during Bangladesh satyagrah!”The citation, which Malviya shared on Twitter, is titled, “Bangladesh Liberation War Honour for Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.”It reads, “A highly respected political leader and a former Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, played an active role in support of the Liberation War of Bangladesh. As President of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and a Member of the Lok Sabha, he took various steps towards that end. In an editorial column of the 'Organiser’, Shri Vajpayee welcomed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's historic declaration of Bangladesh's independence and called upon the Government of India to recognise the Government of Bangladesh and provide necessary assistance to the freedom fighters. To press the demand for Indian Government's expedited support to Bangladesh's Liberation War, Jana Sangh held a Gana Satyagraha during 1-11 August and their volunteers organised a huge rally in front of the Indian Parliament House on 12 August 1971. Shri Vajpayee took a firm stand at national and international levels for the cause of Bangladesh and its striving people.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-slugfest-over-pm-modis-satyagraha-for-bangladesh-remarks-230844
27-03-2021||New Delhi||Indo-Bangladesh bonds ‘in large measure’ due to Indira Gandhi’s role: Sonia’s message to Sheikh Hasina||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday sent a congratulatory video message to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recalling the role late Indira Gandhi played in the liberation of Bangladesh and citing the challenges being faced by the two countries.Gandhi said the special bond between the people of the two nations was largely due to the role Indira Gandhi played in 1971.The Congress chief while noting the “economic, political and environmental challenges being faced by both the nations” added, “Most of all both Bangladesh and India which have been beacons for the celebrations of diversities are being called upon today to protect and strengthen their composite heritage and their glorious traditions of liberal pluralism.”Gandhi’s message to BangladeshPresident Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina who had invited her to be part of the birth centenary celebrations of the father of the nation ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and of the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s independence also noted how 50 years ago the courageous people of Bangladesh scripted a whole new destiny for themselves transforming both the history and the geography of the subcontinent.“Over the past five decades, Bangladesh’s remarkable achievements in social development, community participation, economic growth and other areas have been very impressive and have received global recognition. We in India have always had a special relationship with the people of Bangladesh. This has been in very large measure because of the role Indira Gandhi played in the historic events of 1971 and the deep bonds of mutual respect, admiration and deep friendship that Banga Bandhu and she established,” said Sonia Gandhi who could not visit Bangladesh due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.Gandhi said 1971 was as much a transformative year for India as it was for Bangladesh.“It was a year that saw Indira Gandhi in all her magnificence as a political leader and statesman. Soon thereafter Sheikh Mujibur Rahman himself emerged on the world stage as the leader of his people,” Sonia recalled.She said both India and Bangladesh face many challenges, economic, political and environmental, and mentioned how she personally “lived through the transformative hours, days, weeks and months of 1971 by Indira Gandhi’s side in her home along with late Rajiv Gandhi.”“I am personally delighted to share the pride of Sheikh Hasina and millions of her countrymen and women,” said the Congress chief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-bangladesh-bonds-in-large-measure-due-to-indira-gandhis-role-sonias-message-to-sheikh-hasina-230841

27-03-2021||Kolkata/Guwahati||Amid tight security, West Bengal, Assam set for first phase polling||Over 1.54 crore voters in the eastern states of West Bengal and Assam will exercise their franchise on Saturday in the first phase of polling to decide the fate of key candidates and whether the former Naxal-affected ‘Junglemahal’ area of Bengal will transfer its loyalty to the BJP.Polling in the 30 Assembly segments in West Bengal, most of which are in Junglemahal region, will be almost a straight fight between the BJP and ruling TMC. The Bharatiya Janata Party feels it has the upper hand in the area as it had managed to win most of the Parliamentary seats in the region in the 2019 general elections.The elections will be held amid tight security with the Election Commission deploying around 684 companies of central forces that would guard 10,288 polling booths housed in 7,061 premises, officials said.Besides, the state police will also be deployed at strategic locations, they added.In the first phase, polling will take place amid strict COVID-19 guidelines in all nine seats in Purulia, four in Bankura, four in Jhargram and six in Paschim Medinipur, besides the seven seats in high-stakes Purba Medinipur - the home ground of BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari.The TMC and BJP have fielded candidates in 29 seats each, while the Left-Congress-ISF alliance has put up candidates in all 30 seats, even as there are “friendly fights” in some.In Jhargram, 11 paramilitary personnel will be deployed per booth, the highest for any election held in the state so far, officials said. In the other districts, an average of six paramilitary personnel will be deployed per booth, officials said.“Declaring all 1,307 booths in 1,010 premises as Left Wing Extremist (LWE) areas in Jhargram, we have decided to deploy 127 companies of the central forces only for booth management,” an Election Commission official told PTI.Another 14 companies of central forces will be used as Quick Response Teams (QRTs), one company for the maintenance of strong room and another two companies will be kept reserved as district and sub-divisional striking force, he said.Altogether, 144 companies of central forces will be deployed in Jhargram for the election, he added.“The central forces will be mainly deployed in and around the booths and the state force will be used for the maintenance of law and order. The constables will be used for queue management,” the official said.With the first phase, polling will be over in two districts—Purulia and Jhargram.The Trinamool Congress is fighting in 29 of the 30 seats, while supporting an Independent in the Joypur assembly segment in Purulia as the nomination of its official candidate Ujjwal Kumar was rejected by the EC due to a discrepancy.The BJP is also contesting the polls in 29 seats, while its ally AJSU Party of Jharkhand fielding a candidate in Baghmundi.Congress heavyweight Nepal Mahato is the alliance candidate from the seat, even as the Forward Bloc fielded Debranjan Mahato. AJSU Party has nominated Ashutosh Mahato, while the TMC fielded Sushanta Mahato.As per the official seat-sharing arrangements of the opposition alliance, the Left is fighting in 18 seats, Congress in 10 and ISF two. However, ‘friendly fights’ between the Left parties and Congress are on the anvil in some seats, including Baghmundi and Joypur, as negotiations could not be concluded.Among the other notable seats going to the polls in the first phase are Salboni, where the CPI(M) has fielded former minister Susanta Ghosh against BJP’s Rajib Kundu and TMC’s Srikanta Mahata. Ghosh, the MLA of Garbeta from 1987 to 2016, was in jail in the skeleton recovery case and is at present out on bail.The TMC has fielded actor June Malia, a known face on the Bengali silver screen, from the Medinipur seat against BJP’s Samit Kumar Dash. The Left-led alliance candidate is Tarun Kumar Ghosh of the CPI.In another significant contest, Santhali actor Birbaha Hansda is fighting on a TMC ticket from Jhargram against BJP’s Sukhamay Satpathy and CPI(M)’s youth leader Madhuja Sen Roy.The seven seats in Purba Medinipur—Patashpur, Kanthi Uttar, Bhagabanpur, Khejuri, Kanthi Dakshin, Ramnagar and Egra—will also be closely watched in a prestige fight between the influential Adhikari family which has gone over to the BJP and the TMC.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee campaigned in a majority of the seats going to the polls in the first phase with her nephew and TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee touring the rest, asserting that they would not let Bengal to be ruled from Delhi or Gujarat, in an apparent reference to the BJP and the prime minister.The BJP’s charge was led by PM Narendra Modi who took part in multiple rallies over the last few weeks. Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP’s national president JP Nadda also canvassed the areas, which are marked by the forests and because of that the region is identified as Jungle Mahal.The BJP has promised a “Sonar Bangla” if it forms government in the state, while the TMC has been campaigning on the works done by the Mamata Banerjee government in the last ten years.In Assam, among others, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Speaker Hitendranath Goswami, and Assam state Congress chief Ripun Borah besides several cabinet ministers from the ruling BJP and Asom Gana Parishad, will be in the fray in 47 of the state’s 126 assembly seats.Most of these seats will likely witness triangular contest between the ruling BJP-AGP alliance, the Congress-led opposition grand alliance and the newly formed Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP).The state will have three-phase Assembly elections on March 27, April 1 and 6.Altogether 264 candidates, including 23 women, are in the fray.Polling will begin at 7 a.m and conclude at 6 p.m, with the timing extended by an hour to ensure COVID protocols are followed, officials said.Central forces will assist the state police in maintaining law and order during the polling, a senior police officer said without divulging their numbers. The official said there will be enough security personnel to cover all polling stations.Patrolling has been intensified and strict vigil is being kept in all vulnerable areas. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-tight-security-west-bengal-assam-set-for-first-phase-polling-230818
27-03-2021||Dhaka||PM Modi hails Bangabandhu’s leadership, Indian Army’s contribution in Bangladesh’s Independence war||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday hailed ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s leadership and the contributions of the Indian Army in Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War as he joined his counterpart Sheikh Hasina and President Abdul Hamid in celebrating the golden jubilee of the country’s independence and the birth centenary of its founder.Addressing Bangladesh’s 50th Independence anniversary at the National Parade Square, Modi recalled the role played by the Indian Army in the freedom war and said the blood of those who fought for their liberation and the blood of Indian soldiers are flowing together and this blood will form such a relationship that will not break down under any type of pressure.Also read: Bangladesh Liberation War martyrs devoted their lives ‘resisting injustice’, says Modi paying homage“I salute the brave soldiers of the Indian Army who stood with the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh in Muktijuddo. Those who gave their blood in Muktijuddo, sacrificed themselves, and played a very big role in realising the dream of independent Bangladesh,” said Modi, who is visiting Bangladesh on his first trip to a foreign country since the outbreak of the coronavirus.Modi, who was wearing a ‘Mujib Jacket’ as tribute to Bangladesh’s Father of the Nation, said that Bangabandhu’s leadership and bravery had ensured that no power could enslave Bangladesh.Under Bangabandhu’s leadership, common people of Bangladesh across the social spectrum came together and became ‘Muktibahini’, Modi said, adding Bangladesh’s Liberation War had support from all corners of India, from all parties, every section of the society.“This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with Gandhi Peace Prize,” he said.The Gandhi Peace Prize 2020 was conferred on Bangabandhu early this week. It was for the first time that the award was given away posthumously.At the beginning of the programme, Modi handed over the Gandhi Peace Prize to Bangabandhu’s daughters – Prime Minister Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana.Recalling the 1971 war of independence, Modi said the pictures of atrocities that the Pakistan Army inflicted on the people in then-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) used to distract people in India. “I must have been 20-22 years old when I and my colleagues did Satyagraha for Bangladesh’s freedom,” he told the gathering.The war broke out after the sudden crackdown at midnight past on March 25, 1971 in the erstwhile East Pakistan by the Pakistani troops and ended on December 16. The same year Pakistan conceded defeat and unconditionally surrendered in Dhaka to the allied forces comprising the freedom fighters and the Indian soldiers. Officially three million people were killed during the nine-month long war.Modi said the next 25 years are crucial for both India and Bangladesh. “Our heritage is shared, our growth is shared, our targets and opportunities are also shared,” he said.He said both India and Bangladesh have the power of democracy and vision for the future, and it is necessary for the region the two countries progress together. “That is why Indian and Bangladeshi governments are making meaningful efforts in this direction,” he said.“We must remember that we’ve similar opportunities in fields of trade and commerce, but at the same time, we’ve similar threats like terrorism. The ideas and powers behind such types of inhumane acts are still active. We must remain vigilant and united to counter them,” he added.On the occasion of the 50th year of Indo-Bangla ties, Modi invited 50 Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to India. “They should get associated with our innovation ecosystem and meet venture capitalists. We will learn from them and they will learn from us as well,” he said.Earlier, the programme began with the religious leaders from Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity reciting prayers from their holy books, projecting a secular image of Muslim-majority Bangladesh.Bangladesh was founded as a secular state, but Islam was made the state religion in the 1980s. In 2010, the High Court held up the secular principles of the 1972 constitution.Modi was the guest of honour while Bangladesh President Hamid was the chief guest at the function chaired by Prime Minister Hasina.Meanwhile, at least four persons were killed and dozens injured when some Islamist organisations protesting Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Bangladesh clashed with police on Friday afternoon.In Chittagong’s Hathazari upazila, at least four persons, including two students, were killed and dozens injured when police tried to disperse the protesters by first firing tear shells followed by rubber bullets and shotguns, the Dhaka Tribune reported.“The Hathazari police station suddenly came under attack. We are trying to bring the situation under control,” the paper quoted Additional Superintendent of Police Shahadat Hossain as saying.In Dhaka, at least 50 people, including two journalists, were injured when clashes broke out between a group of protesters and police in the Baitul Mukarram area on Friday afternoon.The protesters, members of various Islamist groups, launched a fresh demonstration after Friday prayers, protesting the visit of Modi.

27-03-2021||Satya Prakash||SC orders shifting of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari from Punjab to UP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 26The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the shifting of BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar Jail in Punjab to a jail in Uttar Pradesh where he was wanted in several criminal cases.Allowing the State of Uttar Pradesh government’s petition seeking transfer of the alleged gangster, a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan directed that Ansari’s custody should be handed over Uttar Pradesh authorities in two weeks.While dismissing Ansari’s plea to transfer the cases pending against him in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, the top court said he shall be lodged in Banda Jail where the Jail Superintendent will extend him medical facilities.A BSP MLA from Mau Sadar assembly constituency in Banda district of UP, he seat was lodged in a jail in UP as undertrial when the Punjab Police obtained a production warrant against him on a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation took him to Punjab where he has been lodged in Ropar jail.The Supreme Court had on March 4 reserved its order on the Uttar Pradesh Government’s plea seeking a direction to the Punjab Government to immediately hand over Ansari’s custody.The Punjab government had contended that the UP government didn’t have a fundamental right to seek transfer of the gangster-turned politician to district jail, Banda.On behalf of the UP Government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had accused the Punjab Government of defending the gangster-turned politician.Though the state didn’t have fundamental rights, it can espouse the cause and the fundamental rights of the victims and can always assume the role of the victim and the society at large, Mehta had submitted.The Solicitor General had said that Ansari flouted the jail manual rules and right of the victim and the State at large cannot be overlooked and the accused cannot be allowed to jettison the fair trial.“Mukhtar Ansari is being vociferously defended by Punjab. He is enjoying (life) in Punjab jail. Serious cases of murder and other offences are being held up (in Uttar Pradesh). The state (of Punjab) is supporting a gangster,” Mehta had told the Bench.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Ansari, had alleged that he was being targeted for political reasons.“My co-accused was encountered. Uttar Pradesh has an axe to grind against Punjab and the Court should not allow the shoulders of the Supreme Court to be used to fire a gun. This should not be allowed”, Rohatgi had said, seeking transfer of cases outside Uttar Pradesh.On behalf of Punjab Government, senior advocate Dushyant Dave contended that criminal proceedings against Ansari had been going on in UP for past 14-15 years and the Yogi Government’s plea wasn’t maintainable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-orders-shifting-of-bsp-mla-mukhtar-ansari-from-punjab-to-up-230783
