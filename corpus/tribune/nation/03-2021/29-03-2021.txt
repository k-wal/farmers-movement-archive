29-03-2021||Nandigram||Why was Amit Shah mum when Hathras took place: Mamata on death of elderly woman||Amid the furore over  the death of an 82-year-old “mother of a BJP worker” in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Monday said she does not support violence against women and is not aware of the real reason behind the death and wondered why Union Home Minister Amit Shah remains silent when women are “tortured to death” in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The BJP claimed that the elderly woman, a party worker’s mother, succumbed to her injuries sustained during an attack by Trinamool Congress supporters in Nimta area of West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district last month.“I don’t know how the sister has died. We don’t support violence against women. We have never supported violence against my sisters and mothers.“But the BJP is now politicising the issue. Amit Shah is tweeting and saying Bengal Ka Kya Haal hain. Why does he remain mum when women are attacked and brutalised in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh?” Banerjee said while addressing a rally in Nandigram.Highlighting that Model Code of Conduct is in place, law and order is now under the jurisdiction of the ECI, Banerjee said, “Three Trinamool Congress workers have been killed in the last few days.”The Union Home Minister tweeted in the morning, “Anguished over the demise of Bengals daughter Shova Majumdar ji, who was brutally beaten by TMC goons.“The pain & wounds of her family will haunt Mamata didi for long. Bengal will fight for a violence-free tomorrow, Bengal will fight for a safer state for our sisters & mothers”.

29-03-2021||Mumbai||Had warned that Sachin Vaze could create problems for MVA govt: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on   Monday claimed he had warned some party leaders that Sachin Vaze, the suspended Mumbai police officer who is currently in the NIA’s custody, could create problems for the Maharashtra government.Raut also said the Sachin Vaze episode taught some lessons to the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra.The Sena, NCP and Congress share power in the state.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) earlier this month arrested Vaze over his alleged role in planting an explosive-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai on February 25.He was earlier also suspended in 2004 over the custodial death of Ghatkopar bomb blasts accused Khwaja Yunus, and was reinstated into the police force last year.“When there was plan to reinstate Sachin Vaze into the Maharashtra police force, I had informed some leaders that he could create problems for us. His behaviour and style of working could lead to some troubles for the government,” Raut told a TV channel.The Rajya Sabha member further said he cannot reveal names of those leaders, but “they are well aware of my conversation with them”.Raut said he has been a journalist for some decades and hence, knows about Vaze.A person is not bad, but sometimes a particular situation makes him so, he said.“This whole incident of Vaze’s activities and controversies thereafter taught a lesson to the MVA government. It was good in a way that it happened and taught us some lessons,” the Sena’s chief spokesperson said.On Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray backing the suspended police officer, Raut said they did not have enough information about Vaze and his activities.“The chief minister supported him, but with his (Vaze’s) activities having surfaced, there is no reason to shield the officer,” he said.On the speculation in political circles that Union Home Minister Amit Shah met NCP leader Sharad Pawar in Ahmedabad on Saturday, Raut said Shah is known for holding several meetings in the Gujarat city with various leaders.“There is nothing to raise eyebrows over the rumoured meeting between Sharad Pawar and BJP leader Amit Shah. In fact, a dialogue between leaders of opposition (rival) parties is good. I am saying this provided they actually met each other in Ahmedabad,” he said.Raut further said even if Pawar and Shah had met, there was nothing to read too much into it.“If it was really a secret meeting, how come it (news about it) came out,” he said.Raut also said the three-party alliance in Maharashtra will not be affected by the outcome of the Assembly polls in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu or other states.On his remark in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ where he called Maharashtra NCP leader Anil Deshmukh an accidental home minister, Raut said Deshmukh is a gentleman.“He must have gone through a lot of trouble and hardship while handling a crucial portfolio like the home ministry. I had even spoken to him and told him that he would face lot of criticism,” the Sena leader said.

The former party president added that no incidence of violence on the day of polling was another “shubh sanket” that the BJP would be “sweeping” the elections in the two states.Citing the feedback received from party workers on the ground, he said the BJP would win 26 of the 30 seats in West Bengal and 37 of the 47 seats in Assam —- the elections to which were held in the first phase on Saturday.Speaking to mediapersons here, Shah claimed that the BJP was on course to achieve its target of winning over 200 seats in the 294-member West Bengal Assembly and improving its alliance tally of  86 seats in the 126-member Assam Assembly. He asserted that people had voted for the “positive” agenda espoused by the party.He also appealed to the people of Nandigram —- the seat from which Bengal CM and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee is contesting polls —- to vote for change and a better future.Shah also rejected Mamata’s charge that PM Narendra Modi’s visit to a temple of the Matua community — which is in sizeable number in the state — during his trip to Bangladesh violated the poll code.He said the visit had nothing to do with the elections and was aimed at fostering deeper ties between the two countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/200-seats-for-sure-in-bengal-claims-shah-after-first-phase-231884

The fire was subsequently doused and the patients were shifted to another building. All patients are safe,” Dr Vinay Krishna, Director of the hospital, said.About the deaths of the two patients, Krishna said, “Tek Chand died around 6.30 am, even before the fire broke out. Rasoolan Bi died later. The bodies have been sent for postmortem. Prima facie, the high-risk patients had normal deaths and the fatalities were not caused by the fire. The postmortem will reveal the exact cause of the deaths.”Smoke filled the centrally air-conditioned building, he asserted. Krishna said the cause of the fire was “probably a short-circuit”.“We used the fire extinguishers kept on the floor to douse the flames. Two fire-tenders were also pressed into service,” he said. The fire broke out near the intensive care unit (ICU) on the ground floor of the hospital.“The fire broke out in a storeroom. Over 140 patients were evacuated,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said.Kanpur’s Additional Commissioner of Police Akash Kulhari said a couple of fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames.According to Swaroop Nagar Station House Officer (SHO) Ashwani Pandey, about 175 patients were evacuated from the ICU and other neighbouring wards and shifted to other wards.“A short-circuit is suspected to have led to the fire, but the exact reason will be ascertained only after an investigation,” the SHO said.

Shortfalls require immediate attention. Both at Central and state levels, the exercise of formulating policy documents in context of SDGs is still underway.

Has he left four for the CPM and the Congress?”While Mamata said counting of votes would take place on May 2, the Congress in a memorandum to the Election Commission cited the front page newspaper advertisement by the BJP in Assam, claiming victory in the first phase of polls held yesterday and demanded FIRs against BJP chief JP Nadda, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and state unit president of the BJP Ranjeet Dass for violating the EC orders, Model Code of Conduct and the Representation of People’s Act-1951.“In a pre-planned conspiracy and to defraud the voters of Assam, Sonowal, Nadda, Dass and other BJP members willfully and knowingly issued advertisements camouflaged as political predictions as headlines on the front page of various newspapers throughout Assam. We urge the EC to take action as may be necessary and required in law, including direction for registration of offences against Sonowal, Nadda and Dass for the blatant violation of Model Code of Conduct and the RPA 1951,” Congress leaders Randeep Surjewala, Mukul Wasnik and Ajay Maken said to the EC.The Congress alleged that the BJP sensing its inevitable defeat “had resorted to desperate illegal and unconstitutional methods to influence the voters across the state”. Surjewala later alleged that the BJP’s attempt was to influence the minds of voters.In Bengal, Banerjee said high voter turnout was a sign that the people had voted for the TMC.Trinamool Congress leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien tweeted after Shah’s press conference, saying mind games won’t work, Mo-Sha (PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah).“Try your seat prediction stunts at the Gujarat Gymkhana.

Banerjee, who is contesting from Nandigram, returned to the constituency on Sunday after having visited the place last on March 10 when she had left for Kolkata abruptly after sustaining an injury on her left feet.On Sunday, Mamata announced that she would be staying in Nandigram in a hired accommodation till the day of polling on April 1.Notably, crowd presence in the ground, given the fact that it was Mamata’s first engagement with public on her return to Nandigram, was not up to the mark.Organisers, however, explained the empty patches in Nandigram’s Reyapara Siva Temple ground saying, “Didi will be addressing another meeting in the constituency shortly after this one and many of her supporters will be listening to her in the other meeting at Birulia Bazaar.”Mamata said the event being held at the Siva Temple Ground was not a political meeting. It was “Basanta Utsav” (Spring Festival) celebration, being held on the occasion of “Dol Yatra”.

29-03-2021||New Delhi||India, US begin two-day naval exercise in eastern Indian Ocean region||India and the US on Sunday kicked off a two-day naval exercise in the eastern Indian Ocean Region, reflecting the growing congruence in their defence and military partnership.The Indian Navy deployed its warship Shivalik and long-range maritime patrol aircraft P8I in the ‘PASSEX’ exercise while the US Navy was represented by the USS Theodore Rosevelt carrier strike group, officials said.A carrier battle group or carrier strike group is a mega naval fleet comprising an aircraft carrier, accompanied by a large number of destroyers, frigates and other ships.“In a first, enhancing jointmanship, Indian Air Force fighters were also included in the exercise affording the IAF an opportunity to practice air interception and air defence with the US Navy,” a spokesperson of the Indian Navy said.The exercise came over a week after US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin flew into India as part of his three-nation first overseas tour that signalled the Joe Biden administration’s strong commitment to its relations with its close allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.During the visit, both sides resolved to further consolidate their robust defence cooperation through deeper military-to-military engagement with Austin describing the partnership as a “stronghold” of a free and open Indo-Pacific.The officials said the exercise began on Sunday and will conclude on Monday.The spokesperson said the exercise is aimed at consolidating the synergy and interoperability achieved during the Malabar exercise that took place in November last.Besides the Indian Navy, the Malabar naval exercise was participated by the navies of the US, Australia and Japan. The four countries are part of the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.In July last, the Indian Navy carried out a military exercise with a US Navy carrier strike group led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the coast of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

She has been harassed by the petitioner and she is being further harassed in the proceedings initiated against the petitioner.”Justice Subramonium Prasad warned the man not to repeat such actions in the future and also imposed costs of Rs 1 lakh on him, to be paid within three weeks.“Looking at the facts and the conduct of the petitioner (man), this court is inclined to direct the petitioner to do some social service to atone for his sins. He is also warned not to repeat such actions in the future,” the court said in its order passed on March 26.“The petitioner is directed to do one-month community service at the de-addiction Centre run by the Society for Promotion of Youth & Masses Centre…Darya Ganj… from April 1 to April 30,” it said.In case of any absenteeism or default or misbehaviour on the man’s part, it shall be conveyed immediately by the centre to the SHO concerned and the matter should be brought to the notice of the court for recall of the quashing order, it said.The court said out of the costs of Rs 1 lakh, Rs 25,000 each should be given in the DHCBA Lawyers Social Security and Welfare Fund and Nirmal Chhaya Foundation and Rs 50,000 to the Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties.A criminal case was lodged against the man for the alleged offences of molestation and criminal intimidation on July 15, last year at Vikas Puri Police Station on the complaint of a woman that while she along with her colleagues was sitting at the PVR complex, the accused came to her and told her that he was a millionaire.When he was rebuked and asked to go away, he left but after a few minutes, he returned and tried to speak to her, the complainant alleged, adding that, thereafter, the man held the woman’s hand and twisted it.It alleged that the man had hit the woman on her face and her spectacles fell. He also hit her with his bag, after which she raised an alarm and passersby gathered there and the man ran away.On the basis of the woman’s complaint, a case was registered and the man was arrested on July 21 last year and later released on bail.The petition for quashing of FIR was filed in the high court by the man who stated that the two sides have reached a compromise and the woman too informed the court that she was not inclined to pursue the matter.The court noted that a perusal of the complaint showed that the man acted in a very high-handed manner. It said there were CCTV footage that showed that he committed the offences of molestation and criminal intimidation and eye-witnesses to the incident.The court said that after completion of one month of community service, a certificate should be filed by the de-addiction centre to show compliance of the order.

However, on March 27 this year, the state reported 35,726 new cases in a day.

According to reports, “two NCP leaders” visited Ahmedabad for a hush-hush meeting with “some businessman” at a venue where Shah also reached. The buzz is that Pawar and Praful Patel were the two NCP leaders who met Shah “at a farmhouse in Ahmedabad on Saturday”.Interestingly, while Shah declined to confirm he also did not deny the purported meeting. At a time when Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government is struggling to survive, the meeting opens up space for a whole lot of speculations, possibilities, permutations and combinations especially with Shiv Sena now openly gunning for Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut today pointed “loopholes” in the state governance, stating that the MVA government does not have any adequate mechanism for “damage control”.Criticising Deshmukh, Raut also claimed that he got the post of Home Minister after other senior NCP leaders such as Dilip Walse Patil and Jayat Patil refused to take the offer. “That is why Sharad Pawar selected Anil Deshmukh for the post,” Raut wrote in Sena mouthpiece ‘Samana’.Raut said no one came forward from the government side to respond to the allegations made by former commissioner of Mumbai Police Param Bir Singh who in his letter to the CM accused Deshmukh of asking API Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month. “If a junior officer like Sachin Vaze was running a (money) collection racket from the Mumbai police commissioner's office, why was the Home Minister not aware of it,” Raut questioned. Sanjay Raut’s attack and Shah's reported meeting with Pawar has raised questions on the future of the Maharashtra government. The controversy has left the ruling coalition red-faced.Meanwhile, the Congress (one of the three angles of the Aghadi) in also in a piquant situation, fearing “collateral damage” as allegations are mostly against Sena and NCP. Ousted following revelations involving the security scare outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani's home in Mumbai, Singh accused the Congress leader of drafting cops to run an extortion racket worth Rs 100 crore a month as well as interfering in investigations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/everything-need-not-be-made-public-says-shah-on-meeting-pawar-amid-maharashtra-govt-crisis-231729

Whatever is the truth will come out," he said.Deshmukh was replying to a query on Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut's claim that he was made the state home minister accidentally.In his weekly column Rokhthok in the party mouthpiece 'Saamana', Raut on Sunday called Deshmukh an accidental home minister, claiming he got the post after senior NCP leaders like Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil refused the responsibility.Raut also said the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra did not have damage control machinery as was seen after Param Bir Singh claimed that Deshmukh asked cops to collect Rs 100 crore a month.

29-03-2021||New Delhi||Mann Ki Baat: PM Modi bats for diversification, modernisation of farming||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday pitched for modernisation in the country's agriculture sector and cited the deepening trend of bee farming in this context.He stressed keeping up the caution against the Covid-19 pandemic and paid tributes to health workers and other Corona warriors for their contributions to the country's push back against the pandemic.In his 75th edition of "Mann Ki Baat" monthly radio programme, Modi said modernisation and innovation in farming is the need of the present times to boost farmers' income and make the vocation prosperous.He noted that the modernisation of agriculture is imperative to increase farmers' income, expand the agriculture sector, and increase the avenues of employment."Modernisation and innovation are important in all dimension of life," Modi said, and added expansion of bee farming has led to growth in production of honey and its export, calling it a "Sweet Revolution".The quantum production of honey has contributed to "Aatm Nirbhar Bharat"(self-reliance), too, he said.Modi said by adding bee farming to their inventories, the farmers have started earning handsomely due to income generated from bee-wax too.With the increasing trend of herbal and natural products, bee-wax is in demand in the pharma, cosmetic and industrial sector in a big way.He referred to farmers of Yamunanagar district in Haryana, among others, of taking to bee farming.Referring to turbulence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, he said it all started in March, last year. The "Janata Curfew", which was a novelty, demonstrated to the world the level of self-discipline by Indians."The clanging of Thaalis and lighting up of diyas gave imponderable moral strength and inspiration to Corona warriors to keep up the fight against the pandemic for one year," Modi said."Dawaai bhi, Kadai bhi" ( Medicine also, self-regulated regimentation of protocols, too), Modi said while invoking the self-discipline theme against Corona in his peroration.Concerning culture, he said there should be modernisation in it while keeping intact the quintessence of its tradition. It should be passed over to the new generation.In this context he noted the work done by an individual in Assam who collated and compiled the scattered works in the local Karbi dialect, leading to the language's revival.He stressed keeping alive local cultures that form the rich tapestry and mosaic of India's diversified social picture.He dwelt on the importance of the "waste to wealth" campaign, and on saving Sparrow-a bird species- which is becoming extinct.He lauded women for making their mark on various aspects of the country's life and hailed national cricketer Mithali Raj on her achieving the milestone of 10,000 runs.

29-03-2021||Kanpur||Around 140 patients evacuated as fire breaks out at LPS Institute of Cardiology in UP's Kanpur||Over 140 patients were rescued after a fire broke out at the state-run LPS Institute of Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in Swaroop Nagar here on Sunday morning, the Uttar Pradesh government said.According to hospital officials, two high-risk patients died in the morning but the deaths were “not caused by the fire”.“At around 7.30 am, smoke was seen coming out from a storeroom on the ground floor. The fire was subsequently doused and the patients were shifted to another building. All the patients are safe,” Dr Vinay Krishna, Director of the hospital, told PTI.The deceased patients were Rasoolan Bi (80), a resident of Ghatampur who was suffering from acute respiratory problems, and Tek Chand of Hamirpur, who was put on ventilator support.Asked to comment on the deaths of the two patients, Krishna said, “Tek Chand died at around 6.30 am, even before the fire broke out. Rasoolan Bi died later. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem. Prima facie, it seems the high-risk patients had normal deaths and the fatalities were not caused by the fire. The post-mortem examination will reveal the exact cause of the deaths.”        Smoke filled the centrally air-conditioned building but the fire did not cause any casualty, he asserted.Krishna said the cause of the fire was “probably a short-circuit”.“We used the fire extinguishers kept on the floor to douse the flames. Two fire-tenders were also pressed into service,” he said.The fire broke out near the intensive care unit (ICU) on the ground floor of the hospital.“The fire broke out in a storeroom. Things are under control now and officers are on the ground. There are no casualties. Over 140 patients were evacuated,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told PTI.Kanpur’s Additional Commissioner of Police Akash Kulhari said a couple of fire-tenders were pressed into service to douse the fire.Window panes on the first floor of the hospital were broken to let the smoke out, an official said.According to Swaroop Nagar Station House Officer (SHO) Ashwani Pandey, about 175 patients were evacuated from the ICU and other neighbouring wards and shifted to other wards.“A short-circuit is suspected to have led to the fire, but the exact reason will be ascertained only after an investigation,” the SHO said.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took cognizance of the incident and directed that the evacuated patients be provided immediate care. He also sought a report from the district administration, the Uttar Pradesh government said in a statement issued in Lucknow.The chief minister has directed a high-level team, headed by the principal secretary, health education and also comprising the director general of fire services and the Kanpur divisional commissioner, to visit the site and give its report immediately, the statement said.The chief minister has said a campaign should be launched at the earliest to test the fire-fighting arrangements at all hospitals of the state, in accordance with the directives issued earlier to strengthen such measures.The hospital was established in 1975. The JK Charitable Trust had donated the building for the institute and it was named as Laxmipat Singhania Institute of Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

29-03-2021||Sonepat||Farmers leave for harvesting, crowds at Singhu thinning; mahapanchayats off||The crowds gathered at Singhu, the epicentre of the farmers’ protest against the central farm laws, have been thinning over the past several days. Subsequently, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leaders have decided to call off mahapanchayats in other states and re-focus on the Delhi borders.Intelligence sources said three to five protesters were putting up in each tractor-trailer compared to 10-15 earlier.“The decline in numbers could be due to senior leaders holding ‘kisan mahapanchayats’ across Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, MP, UP and other states and farmers returning for harvesting,” explained Gurmukh Singh of Hoshiarpur.SKM leader Harinder Singh Lakhowal claimed the crowds were thinning temporarily as farmers had been maintaining a “protest roster” at village level. “If some farmers have moved their tractor-trailers back, ‘pucca’ huts have come up as a replacement,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-leave-for-harvesting-crowds-at-singhu-thinning-mahapanchayats-off-231491
