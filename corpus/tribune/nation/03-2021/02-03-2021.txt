02-03-2021||Hooghly (WB)||TMC MLA Jitendra Tiwari joins BJP||Amid an ongoing exodus from the ruling Trinamool Congress ahead of the West Bengal Assembly elections, two-time party MLA from Pandabeswar in Paschim Barddhaman district and former Asansol mayor, Jitendra Tiwari joined the BJP on Tuesday.Reacting to the development, the TMC said it is a “good riddance”.Tiwari, who had rebelled against the TMC leadership but had mellowed down after the BJP declined to induct him into the party in December last year, joined the saffron camp in the presence of party state chief Dilip Ghosh at a programme in Sreerampur in Hooghly district.“I have joined the BJP as I want to work for the development of the state. In TMC, it was no longer possible to work for the party,” he said after joining the saffron party.Welcoming Tiwari into the party, Ghosh said senior TMC leaders joining the BJP reflect that the days of the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal are numbered.“Earlier, we hardly had any presence in West Bengal.But now, we have grown by leaps and bounds,” he said.Union minister and Asansol MP Babul Supriyo, who had opposed Tiwari’s entry into the party in December last year, said he couldn’t oppose if someone is willing to work under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Yes, it is true that we had fought hard in Asansol. When Jitendra was the TMC district chief, our main fight was against him in Asansol. But now, if he is willing to join our party, I can’t oppose it. We will work together,” he told reporters.Supriyo and several other BJP leaders including state general secretary Sayantan Basu and state Mahila Morcha chief Agnimitra Paul had earlier openly opposed Tiwari’s possible induction into the party.Basu and Paul were issued show-cause notices by the party for openly speaking on the issue.Tiwari had resigned from the post of the chairman of the Board of Administrators of the Asansol Municipal Corporation and the TMC district chief in December last year.He had also held a meeting with Suvendu Adhikari, just two days ahead of the former state minister’s switch to the saffron party in December.But the BJP leadership had to shelve the plans of inducting Tiwari into the party after Supriyo and the local BJP leadership openly opposed it.Tiwari had then made a U-turn, apologised to the TMC leadership, and returned to the party fold.Although the TMC took him back, it clipped his wings and never gave him any important assignments.“It’s good riddance that he (Tiwari) has left. But let me say one thing: Those who have switched over will regret their decision after the elections,” TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.Elections to the 294-member state assembly will be held in eight phases from March 27 to April 29. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-mla-jitendra-tiwari-joins-bjp-219579

It is highly irresponsible to accuse a particular party when there is no evidence. China is firmly opposed to such irresponsible and ill-intentioned practice," said the spokesperson.Like the US, India has rarely instinctively blamed specific external actors for cyber attacks. One Western media outlet quoted a Goldman Sachs-backed cyber security firm headed by a former MI-6 officer as stating that a Chinese hacking group APT10 tried to hack the IT infrastructure and supply chain software of Covid vaccine makers Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII).Another media outlet picked up a report by another cyber security firm “Recorded Future” that reported a steep rise in attempts to target a dozen utilities such as two ports and 10 power sector bodies, including four of the five Regional Load Despatch Centres.It said the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) resembled that of previously detected Chinese state-sponsored groups. Recorded Future does not currently believe there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity to an existing public group and, therefore, continues to track it as a closely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.But that did not stop a US Congressman Frank Pallone from calling on US President Joe Biden to “stand by our strategic partner and condemn China’s dangerous cyber-attack” on India’s grid, which forced hospitals to go on generators in the midst of a pandemic.The US State Department, when asked by PTI after the media briefing, wanted the question referred to the company that conducted the study.“In general, we continue to have concerns about states’ dangerous and coercive actions, including in cyberspace, and we reaffirm the importance of joint action on cybersecurity, critical infrastructure, and supply chain security,” said the spokesperson Nick Price.The Chinese embassy specifically denied speculation about theft of other countries’ vaccines through hacker attacks, saying “we don’t need to and will not rely on stealing to obtain vaccines” and claimed that both China and India have fallen victims to disinformation.China is a staunch defender of cyber security and also a major victim of hacking and cyber attacks. China firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and crimes. In accordance with law, we’ve been cracking down on such attacks launched inside China or using China’s cyber infrastructure. This position is consistent and clear.Recorded Future said the hackers used a tool that has been used by China-linked groups since 2017. “We assess that sharing is prevalent across groups affiliated with both Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) and groups affiliated with the PLA,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-denies-reports-of-more-cyber-attacks-against-indian-utilities-219574
02-03-2021||London||India appeals to extradite terror accused Kuldeep Singh from UK||The Indian authorities have moved the High Court in London to seek permission to appeal against a magistrates’ court order turning down the extradition on human rights grounds of Kuldeep Singh, wanted in India as an alleged member of the banned terrorist organisation Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF).Singh, also known as Keepa Sidhu, is charged with conspiring with others to commit terror activities in Punjab dating back to 2015-16, including a plot to assassinate the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.The 44-year-old is also accused of recruiting youths in Punjab to the banned organisation by offering them money and organising a meeting of separatists in a gurdwara.District Judge Gareth Branston, presiding over the extradition case at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, ruled in January that as the offences carry maximum sentences and “no possibility of a review of such a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or conditional release” it would be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.“There is no dispute that these offences carry maximum sentences of life imprisonment. There is no dispute that Singh faces a real risk that he will receive such a sentence of life imprisonment,” reads the judgment, dated January 25.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing on behalf of the Indian government in the legal proceedings, confirmed that the grounds of appeal against Singh’s discharge were lodged on February 19, with his lawyers scheduled to file a response this Friday.“We have appealed the decision to discharge Singh. We haven’t had the permission decision yet,” a CPS spokesperson said.Singh faces a total of four charges in India, under Sections 17, 18 and 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 related to raising funds for terrorism, conspiracy and being a member of a terror outfit, and Section 25 of the Arms Act 1959, related to firearms offences.The court documents note that he is accused of being a point of contact in Punjab and liaising with the head of the KZF, who was residing in Pakistan, and other co-accused members of the banned organisation, who lived in Belgium and England.Singh, who entered the UK illegally in 2005, was on immigration bail when he was arrested at Loughborough Immigration Reporting Centre in eastern England in October 2019.In September 2020, the Indian authorities were successful in revoking bail granted to him at the magistrates’ court level.“I do place significant weight on the fact that Singh entered the United Kingdom illegally and remained at large and undetected for a period of some eight years. That suggests that he is a resourceful man and is a man who is capable of going to ground for an extended period when he chooses,” noted Justice Swift, presiding over that appeal at the High Court last year.Singh – who used a Punjabi interpreter in court – then remained remanded in judicial custody for the duration of the extradition hearings before District Judge Branston, which concluded in December last year.In his judgment in January, Judge Branston accepted the Indian government assurances regarding prison conditions under which Singh would be kept as “clear, binding and sufficient”.“There is no evidence that Singh has previously been ill-treated in India. This country has considered and accepted previous assurances by the Indian government. There is no cogent evidence to suggest that they will not be complied with,” he said.He also noted that it is undisputed that there is evidence of a conspiracy to commit criminal offences in India but questioned the proportionality of a life term without parole.The judge said: “In my judgment, if such a sentence were imposed upon Singh in the context of this case, then such a sentence would plainly be grossly disproportionate to the offending alleged.“Whilst clearly very serious allegations, Singh is alleged to have been involved in the funding and recruitment of terrorist activity. As is observed, there is no evidence that anyone was actually killed as a result of his alleged activities. He is accused of acts preparatory to terrorist offences."On prison conditions and the sentencing provisions in India, he relied on evidence and reports presented by Dr V. Suresh and D. Nagasalia, advocates of the Madras High Court, and Arjun Sheoran, advocate of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.Besides the human rights issue relating to a life sentence without parole, the court also found that there is “insufficient evidence to make a case requiring an answer by Kuldeep Singh”.If permission to appeal against the magistrates’ court order is granted, either on paper or through oral submissions, the case would then proceed for a High Court hearing. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-appeals-to-extradite-terror-accused-kuldeep-singh-from-uk-219572

In addition, the Union of India is also directed to install CCTV cameras and recording equipment in the offices of CBI, NIA, ED, NCB, DRI, SFIO and any other agency which carries out interrogations and has the power of arrest," it had said.On Tuesday, Mehta sought adjournment of the case as the issue may have ramifications.“We are not concerned about the ramifications…This concerns the rights of citizens…We are not accepting the excuses,” the top court told the Solicitor General and sought to know about allocation of funds for installation of CCTVs in the offices of the central probe agencies.After perusing a report placed before it by senior advocate and amicus curiae Siddharth Dave on the timeline of different states to comply with its direction, the court gave three weeks to the Centre to file an affidavit on the issue.The December 2, 2020 order had come in a case relating to CCTV installation in police stations and examination of witnesses by police. The CCTV installation was revived by the top court following a case of custodial torture in Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-pulls-up-centre-for-delay-in-installation-of-cctv-cameras-in-offices-of-cbi-nia-ed-219564

The Grand Old Party could win only a few taluka panchayat bodies.“The election results are totally opposite to what our expectations were. We had received good responses from people during our campaigning but results do not reflect it. People have raised doubts on EVMs and all these things should be probed,” Chavda said.Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi confirmed that Dhanani has also sent his resignation to the party leadership in Delhi.“The party leadership has received both the resignations. Now it is up to the party brass to decide on the replacement of these leaders,” Doshi said.He said the Central leadership of the Congress has asked Chavda and Dhanani to continue on their posts till the time their replacements are announced.In the first phase of civic polls held last month in Gujarat, the BJP had won all the six municipal corporations.

While ‘Made In India’ vaccines are being immensely appreciated by many countries, some vested interest groups are spreading false information about the vaccines.As several social media users questioned his decision to take the vaccine at home, Sudhakar said the protocol is to get it in the hospital.When reporters sought Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa’s reaction, he said getting vaccinated was more important than the place where the inoculation happened.Patil defended himself, saying he has not committed any crime and wanted to avoid trouble for the public.“Have I done any theft or robbery? I have only taken the vaccine at home, which is not a crime,” the minister told reporters.He said it was good that his inoculation became public which would inspire others to take the shot.Patil added that had he gone to the hospital, it would have caused trouble to people waiting there.However, Sudhakar expressed his dissatisfaction over the conduct of Patil and said the medical team should have persuaded him to come to the hospital.“Unless there is a prior permission, no one is allowed to go home to vaccinate. It is wrong to go home to administer a vaccine,” he said.He would issue a circular to the doctors not to administer vaccines at home, the minister added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several others had taken the vaccine shots in designated hospitals on Monday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-minister-takes-covid-19-vaccine-at-home-triggers-controversy-219560

In Assam, it has allied with Badruddin Ajmal-led All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF).”“All the alliances that Congress had formed have not been done for any good performance, good reforms or good governance. These alliances were done only to somehow retain the Gandhi family's political relevance. The Congress party has no ideology and is forming alliance wherever and with whoever they can,” he said.Amid a vocal dissidence within the Opposition party, he also took a swipe saying its ideology is all about fulfilling the Gandhi family’s “ambition”, and "anyone speaking against it or standing with the rightful agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is castigated".Patra said the Congress will “castigate” anyone who wants democracy in the party, wants its president to be elected, speaks in favour of politics of development or stands with Modi’s rightful agenda.Calling the "G-23", a reference to the group of 23 Congress leaders who have called for an organisational overhaul in the party, an internal matter of party, Patra said it is “saddening” to see senior leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad and others being targeted. The Congress is now all about four leaders, he claimed, referring to party president Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Priyanka’s husband Robert Vadra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-congress-takes-potshots-amid-open-rift-in-the-opposition-party-219554

Under the NIA Act, the Centre can take over probes from any state in a terror case.The NIA, however, has not yet invoked any terror charge, but if during the investigation, the role of any terrorist or terror organisation surfaces, the relevant sections will be added, sources said.Earlier, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said the blast was part of a conspiracy to force Hossain to leave TMC.NIA officials said the agency would write to West Bengal to hand over the case files, evidence collected as well as custody of two persons arrested so far in connection with the attack. A team of the agency is likely to visit the blast site soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-takes-over-probe-in-murshidabad-blast-219548

02-03-2021||Colombo||Sri Lanka hopes for India's support at UNHRC session in Geneva||Sri Lanka on Tuesday hoped that India would stand by it when the UNHRC moves its latest accountability and reconciliation resolution on the island nation this month, days after a UN report called for drastic measures against those allegedly responsible for rights violations during last phase of the armed conflict with the LTTE.Government spokesman and minister Keheliya Rambukwella said the Lankan Government was hopeful of Indian support at the UN Human Rights Council sessions to defeat what is expected to be a drastic resolution on the island's accountability process.The resolution accuses the country of war crimes with threats to take those responsible to the International Courts and impose targeted sanctions against officials allegedly responsible for human rights violations.In a statement on the UN rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet's report on Sri Lanka during the 46th session of the UNHRC last week, India said the assessment of the High Commissioner regarding developments nearly 12 years from the end of the conflict raises important concerns."The Sri Lankan Government has articulated its position on these issues as well, in evaluation of these, we should be guided by a commitment to find a lasting and effective solution to this issue," read the statement.Articulating New Delhi's stand, Ambassador Indra Mani Pandey, Permanent Representative of India in Geneva, said it rests on two pillars: Support for Sri Lanka's unity and territorial integrity, and abiding commitment to aspirations of the Tamils of Sri Lanka for equality, justice, peace and dignity."These are not either-or choices. We believe that respecting the rights of the Tamil community, including through meaningful devolution, contributes directly to the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka."Therefore, we advocate that delivering on the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil community is in the best interests of Sri Lanka," he said."We call upon Sri Lanka to take necessary steps for addressing such aspirations, including through the process of reconciliation and full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka," read the statement delivered by Pandey.Referring to the Indian envoy's statement on Sri Lanka in Geneva, Rambukwella said the Indian Government had only made the point on the need to preserve the 13th Amendment which India had initiated. India had expressed its desire to see the issues of the Tamil minority addressed by using the 13A to make provincial councils more meaningful.Meanwhile, Rambukwella thanked countries like China and Russia for backing Sri Lanka at the UNHRC.“We are grateful to China, Russia and other countries for speaking on behalf of us after realising the reality. We think that our neighbouring friend India will not be a part of that injustice, because we have presented many facts about it,” said Rambukwella.China on Friday expressed support to Sri Lanka at the UNHRC as it faced a resolution expressing serious concern over the rights situation in the island nation, saying Beijing was opposed to the use of human rights issues to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.Bachelet's report had called for drastic measures such as targeted sanctions and international criminal court procedure against those allegedly responsible for rights violations during the last phase of the armed conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009.Bachelet said the report indicated that nearly 12 years after the end of the armed conflict, domestic initiatives had repeatedly failed to ensure justice for victims and promote reconciliation.Sri Lanka has already rejected the Bachelet's report presented at the ongoing sessions.“We have expressed our displeasure with the way in which the Human Rights Commissioner reported about Sri Lanka because it is completely false,” Rambukwella stressed.Rambukwella was critical of the action by the Sri Lankan government in 2015 to co-sponsor the UNHRC resolution thereby committing to investigate alleged war crimes committed by the Sri Lankan troops.“I suppose that's the worst thing that happened in international relations so far as the Human Rights Commission is concerned. So we are undoing that,” Rambukwella said.Asked if the recent fissures with India over Sri Lanka's rejection to honour an MoU on the development of the Colombo Port's East Container Terminal would influence India to act against Sri Lanka in Geneva, Rambukwella said, “we don't think that they will take up these commercial issues when it comes to international relations”.Earlier this month, India stressed the importance of Sri Lanka adhering to its international commitments relating to development of the East Container Terminal of the Colombo Port, days after the island nation cancelled a trilateral agreement for the project.India, Japan and Sri Lanka had inked an agreement in 2019 on development of the terminal project. The Sri Lankan government decided to hand over the project to a state-run company following an agitation against the venture involving India and Japan.

02-03-2021||New Delhi||India’s next phase of virus crisis likely to be localised outbreaks: Experts||Experts say that the relatively low hospitalisation and fatality rates in India suggest the coronavirus pandemic is approaching its next phase - largely manageable local outbreaks.Although a handful of states are reporting a spurt in infections, for a country of 1.35 billion people with limited health facilities and where the practice of wearing masks and social distancing is falling off, the positive trend, if it holds, will be a respite.It could also help India keep its economy open without any national lockdown.At more than 11 million, India has reported the highest number of cases in the world after the United States. A government survey suggests its actual cases may be around 300 million, as many young people showed no symptoms.The death toll stands at 157,248.Recorded cases have fallen continuously since mid-September peak, before again rising since early February.Eight of 10 recent infections have been reported by five states, mainly Maharashtra and Kerala. Since a multi-month low in cases and deaths on Feb. 9, India’s case count has gone up, but the fatality rate has fallen from 0.856% to 0.683% on Monday.The overall rate for India is 1.4% and 2.2% for the world.Rajib Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and professor of community health at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said India was witnessing a phase of “multiple epidemics within a country” where the entire population is not equally susceptible.“In this phase, the emphasis has to be a lot more local, a lot of local capacities will be put to test,” he said.“The positive thing—what’s being seen in Europe—is that as subsequent surges come, as the knowledge has improved, the management is better, both in terms of public health management as well as clinical care, and actually deaths go down.”Dasgupta said the aim now should be to try and contain the virus within local clusters, instead of measures like inter-state curbs on travellers.ENDEMIC VIRUS?Government health official Vinod Kumar Paul told a news conference on Tuesday that India was nowhere close to attaining herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination, requiring states to continue their surveillance. India has so far inoculated more than 12 million people.The health ministry, however, said 19 of India’s three dozen states and federal territories had not reported any deaths in the past 24 hours.“It’s quite possible that we will be now seeing the pandemic transforming into smaller kinds of outbreaks, or endemicity is likely to take place,” said Subhash Salunke, a former WHO official who advises Maharashtra on its COVID-19 strategy.Hospitalisation rates have come down, especially in Maharashtra and Kerala that together account for three-quarters of India’s 168,627 active cases.The number of people hospitalised in Kerala each day due to COVID-19 averaged 830 last week, while daily new cases averaged nearly 3,500.The hospitalisation figure for seven days in mid-September, after the Onam festival which saw increased public gatherings in Kerala, was 2,940, compared with new cases of 3,973 in the same period.Maharashtra’s health department told Reuters only 14% of its 77,000 active patients were in oxygen or intensive-care beds.More than 80% of such beds are now unoccupied, compared with a shortage a few months ago.Health authorities must, however, remain vigilant, especially in the big cities, the experts said: “There will likely be another wave—likely will not be as big as the first wave because a lot of people got infected in the first round itself—so I think most metros should be ready for a second wave,” said Ramanan Laxminarayan, founder of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in New Delhi. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-next-phase-of-virus-crisis-likely-to-be-localised-outbreaks-experts-219536

02-03-2021||New Delhi||Cannot use language like ‘Tom, Dick, Harry’ in petition: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court has expressed displeasure over usage of sentence like “Tom, Dick and Harry” in a petition raising grievance relating to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and said such “slang language” is not permissible in the pleadings before a court of law.The high court, which declined to entertain the petition, said it was refraining from imposing costs at this stage since the petitioner was appearing in person.Justice Prathiba M Singh said the petitioner appeared to have drafted the petition on his own and perusal of a paragraph showed that “there is slang language being used in the petition”.“The said paragraph reads as under: ‘(f) The AA / NCLT cannot permit any person - Tom, Dick, and Harry to represent and defend the respondent under section of IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), as the rules does not permit it.’ Such language is not permissible in pleadings before the court. Accordingly, this petition is liable to be dismissed,” Justice Singh said.The petitioner, in his plea, has raised a grievance against the NCLT and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) alleging that wrong procedures are being adopted by the said tribunals.The high court said if the petitioner was aggrieved by any order of the NCLT or NCLAT, he may draft a proper petition and only then file the same.“At this stage, the petitioner wishes to withdraw the present petition. The petition is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to avail of his remedies in accordance with law. Since the petitioner is appearing in person, this court is refraining from imposing costs at this stage,” the court said.

02-03-2021||New Delhi||Acceptance for free, safe COVID-19 vaccine high among Indian women||COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women and mothers is the highest in India, the Philippines and some Latin American countries, according to a survey of 16 countries that asked questions premised on a safe and free preventive with 90 per cent efficacy.The survey to assess the response of pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 18 years and their willingness to vaccinate themselves and their children was conducted by a led by a team from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.The online survey was conducted between late October and mid-November 2020. Almost 18,000 women in 16 countries responded to questions about the hypothetical safe and free COVID-19 vaccine with 90 per cent efficacy, the Harvard researchers said.Vaccines for COVID-19 are being distributed around the world, but researchers have till now had little data about global COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.The findings, published in the European Journal of Epidemiology, indicate that vaccine acceptance was highest in India, the Philippines, and all sampled countries in Latin America.It was lowest in Russia, the US, and Australia, the researchers found.“Our study confirmed that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is multi-faceted,” said Harvard Chan School’s Julia Wu, the senior author of the paper.“The perceived threat of COVID-19, level of trust in public health agencies, and existing pre-COVID 19 vaccine attitudes play key roles shaping vaccine acceptance and confidence. Vaccination campaigns should be tailored to alleviate these specific concerns,” Wu said.On Monday, India expanded its vaccination drive to include people above 60 years of age and those aged between 45 and 59 who have co-morbidities.The two vaccines that have been approved for inoculation in the country are the indigenous Covaxin developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, and Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India in Pune.While Covishield at two full doses has been shown to have 62 per cent efficacy in Phase-3 clinical trials, Bharat Biotech is yet to publish efficacy data for Covaxin from its Phase-3 trials.Fourteen countries with high cumulative incidences of COVID-19 as of October 28, 2020, were included in the survey—the US, India, Brazil, Russia, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, UK, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Italy, Chile, and the Philippines.Additionally, Australia and New Zealand were included for the reference given that they had lower incidences of COVID-19.Predictors examined included COVID-19 vaccine confidence, negative experiences with COVID-19, perception on the risk and seriousness of the disease, public trust, general vaccine attitude, demographics and socioeconomic status.This survey included women aged 18 years or older, currently pregnant or with at least one child under 18 years of age.Overall, 52 per cent of pregnant women and 73 per cent of non-pregnant women said they would receive such a vaccine, and 69 per cent of all women surveyed said they would vaccinate their children.In India, the Philippines, and Latin American countries, the acceptance was above 60 per cent among pregnant women and above 78 per cent among non-pregnant women for themselves.The survey shows over 75 per cent of mothers indicated they would vaccinate their children.Vaccine acceptance in the US and Russia was below 45 per cent among pregnant women and less than 56 per cent among non-pregnant women for themselves, and similar to countries with very few COVID-19 cases, such as Australia and New Zealand.According to the researchers, lower vaccine acceptance in the US and Russia could be due to COVID-19 denial.The research team asked the survey participants about various topics related to vaccinations and COVID-19.The strongest predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the women surveyed included confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety or effectiveness, worrying about COVID-19, and belief in the importance of vaccines to their own country.Compliance with mask guidelines, trust in public health agencies and health sciences, and attitudes towards routine vaccines were the other strong predictors of acceptance.Pregnant women who were reluctant said they had concerns about exposing their developing baby to possible harmful side effects, the vaccine being rushed for political reasons, and the lack of safety and effectiveness data in pregnant women. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/acceptance-for-free-safe-covid-19-vaccine-high-among-indian-women-219523
02-03-2021||New Delhi||About 5K Indians stalking their partners via mobile spyware||As some people try to digitally control the lives of their intimate partners, nearly 4,627 mobile users in India have been found to be the victim of stalkerware—a secret surveillance software used in the field of domestic violence, a new report revealed on Tuesday.This figure would have had been much higher in the absence of lockdowns and the pandemic that led millions to stay indoors in the country.Stalkerware apps are generally disguised under a fake app name with suspicious access to messages, call logs, location, and other personal activity.For example, an app called “Wi-Fi” that has access to your geolocation is a suspicious candidate, according to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.“We see the number of users affected by stalkerware has remained high and we detect new samples every day. It’s important to remember that there is somebody’s real life story behind all these numbers, and  sometimes there is a silent call for help,” said Victor Chebyshev, Research Development Team Lead, Kaspersky.“It is clear that we all need to share what we are finding so we can further improve detection and protection for the benefit of those affected by cyberviolence,” comments Victor Chebyshev, Research Development  Team Lead, Kaspersky.Stalkerware is a form of cyberviolence, and a global phenomenon that affects countries regardless of size, society, or culture.In 2020, a total of 53,870 mobile users were affected globally by stalkerware.In 2019, Kaspersky discovered 67,500 affected mobile users.“It is unsurprising that the yearly curve of users affected by stalkerware globally shows a decline in reports from March to June 2020, before numbers began to stabilise thereafter. This coincides with the beginning of worldwide lockdowns, and later when many countries around the world began to ease restrictions,” the report mentioned.Mobile users can check if their mobile device has stalkerware installed.“Delete apps that are no longer being used. If the app has not been opened in a month or more, it is probably safe to assume it is no longer needed; and if this changes in the future, it can always be reinstalled,” the report mentioned.Check “unknown sources” settings on Android devices.If “unknown sources” are enabled on your device, it might be a sign that unwanted software was installed from a third-party source.“To download stalkerware, the abuser will have to visit some web pages the affected user does not know about. Alternatively, there could be no history at all if the abuser wiped it,” it added.Do not rush to remove stalkerware if found on the device as the abuser may notice.“It is very important to consider that the abuser may be a potential safety risk. In some cases, the person may escalate his abusive behaviour in response”, the company suggested.In 2019, Kaspersky co-founded, along with nine other organisations, the ‘Coalition Against Stalkerware’ which now has 30 members from five continents.In November last year, the company released a free anti-stalkerware tool called TinyCheck in order to help non-profit organisations support victims of domestic violence and protect their privacy. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/about-5k-indians-stalking-their-partners-via-mobile-spyware-219521
02-03-2021||New Delhi||LSTV, RSTV merger begins to create SANSAD TV, CEO appointed||The presiding officers of both houses of Parliament have set the ball rolling for the merger of Lok Sabha TV and Rajya Sabha TV into a single entity, SANSAD TV, which will soon move to seek requisite government licence.According to a circular issued by the Lok Sabha Secretariat, retired IAS officer Ravi Capoor has been appointed the CEO of the new integrated channel for a period of one year, beginning March 1.“Consequent upon the joint declaration of the Rajya Sabha Chairman and Lok Sabha Speaker to merge RSTV and LSTV into Sansad Television (SANSAD TV), Ravi Capoor has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer, SANSAD TV, on contract basis, for a period of one year with immediate effect,” the circular reads.Sources said though the channels are being integrated into single entity, it will function on two platforms during the parliament sessions—one to telecast live proceedings of Lok Sabha and the other of Rajya Sabha.During the inter-session period, the channel will be on one single platform having enriched bilingual contents (Hindi and English), senior officials of the two secretariats said.The integration of two channels will lead to substantial savings and improved efficiency with pooling of resources and synchronisation of assets, they said.Sources said it has yet not been decided whether the new channel will come under the ambit of Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha secretariats or will be administered by both.In November 2019, after deliberations between Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, a committee headed by former Prasar Bharati Chairman Surya Prakash was formed to work out integration of the two channels.The committee had submitted its report last year.

Our party is not making empty promises but undertaking five guarantees," said the Congress leader, who sported a traditional 'gamocha' around her neck with the letters CAA crossed out on it.

There is a huge amount of scope to study the impact of vaccines, which needs to be thought-through by a very coordinated approach,” she said.As many as 30 vaccines are at different stages of development in India. Covaxin, developed indigenously by Biotech, and Covishield, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and being manufactured at Serum Institute of India, are already in use in the country.The vaccine candidates of Zydus Cadila and Russia’s Sputnik V are in phase 3 of the human clinical trials. Sputnik V, which is being manufactured by Reddy’s Laboratories in India, has initiated the process for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).India has supplied vaccines to several nations while many others have also placed orders for the same.Vinod Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, lauded the efforts of scientific community and said the speed with which the solutions during the pandemic appeared was phenomenal.“The stories of development of vaccines are amazing examples of how time can be compressed and scientific mobilisation can be initiated. The intent to have a global footprint in the manufacturing sector when it came to COVID-19 vaccine was path-breaking and something to be proud of. We have realised that we have the potential to deliver in a speedy manner, like we did for vaccine distribution,” he said.The three-day Global Bio-India 2021 was inaugurated Monday by Harsh Vardhan, the Minister of Science & Technology, and Health & Family Welfare.

02-03-2021||Kolkata||Identity politics gaining ground in West Bengal ahead of assembly polls||With the stage set for high-octane polls in West Bengal, key stakeholders here asserted that the state, in a departure from the tradition, will be witnessing a communally charged election this time, largely driven by identity politics.Bengal, where the electoral discourse has mostly steered clear of divisive agenda, has been drawn into the vortex with the TMC and the BJP accusing each other of fanning communal sentiments ahead of elections.The entry of the newly formed Indian Secular Front (ISF), led by Abbas Siddiqui, who became the first religious leader in West Bengal to take the plunge into politics, has, however, upturned several political equations, propelling the campaign of religious identity-based politics in the state.“This time, assembly elections will be different from the ones we have witnessed since independence. The BJP has long been trying to create divisions among the communities. But we will fight against it and work to unite people,” senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy said.Also read: BJP-AIADMK alliance discuss return of Sasikala to AIADMKThe saffron leadership, too, agreed that communal polarisation was on the rise in the state but blamed appeasement politics by the TMC for its upsurge.“For us, the election plank happens to be ‘development for all’. That said, appeasement politics and injustice towards the state’s majority community by the TMC government has indeed led to communal polarisation in Bengal,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said.Echoing him, BJP leader Tathagata Roy said Partition scars and the upswing of Muslim identity politics in Bengal had deepened the communal fault-lines.The opposition Congress, on its part, trained guns on both the TMC and the BJP for fomenting divisive politics — a practice almost alien to the state’s political landscape.CPI (M) politburo member Mohammed Salim, however, stressed that the narrative wouldn’t yield any result as masses were “fed up with the misrule” of the TMC and the BJP at the state and the Centre, respectively.“Had communal narrative been at play in the past (during CPI-M rule), people would have seen saffron camp and other fundamentalist forces gaining ground back then. But that was not the case. True, this time parties are playing the communal card, but issues concerning common people such as fuel price hike, corruption and unemployment will negate its influence to a large extent,” he said.Elections in Bengal, poised to be a stiff contest between the TMC and the BJP, will be held in eight phases, beginning with polling for 30 seats on March 27. Votes will be counted on May 2.Since Independence, polls in the state, which boasts of being the cradle of the Indian renaissance, have always been fought along ideological lines, with matters related to government policies, unemployment and food security taking centre stage.Sources in the BJP claimed that the TMC government’s failure to control communal riots over the last six years has angered not just a section of the minorities but also those belonging to the majority community.According to the data released by the Union Home Ministry in 2018, communal violence increased sharply since 2015 in West Bengal.Although opposition parties pinned the blame on the TMC for this surge in religious fervour in the state, which has 30 per cent Muslim electorate, a quick look at Bengal’s socio-political history will reflect how communalism has always had an impact on the state’s political culture, with hundreds of people having borne the brunt of riots in 1946-47.Both the Hindu right and fringe Muslim outfits had wielded considerable influence in violence-hit West Bengal in the aftermath of Partition, before waning considerably over the years.During the first assembly polls in 1952, the Hindu Mahasabha, along with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, had won 13 seats and garnered around eight per cent of the total votes.Later, Jana Sangh’s influence ebbed, as it ended up with only one seat in 1967 and 1971.Similarly, Muslim outfits such as the Progressive Muslim League (PML) and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) had established its presence in pockets, with the PML winning three seats in 1969 assembly polls, and the IUML bagging a single seat during 1972 and 1977 assembly polls.“Although parties such as the IUML, the PML and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh managed to bag a few seats till the 70s, poll campaigns did not bank on communal narrative. Development issues and anti-state or anti-Centre plank always took precedence,” veteran Congress leader Abdul Mannan Said.During the early 60s, however, the rise of the Left parties, who fought for the rights of refugees from Bangladesh, ended the consolidation of the right-wing forces in the state.Noted Historian Sugata Bose contended that refugees from Bangladesh felt cheated both by the Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha when the country endured Partition, and they took solace in the Left’s fold.“Refugees from Bangladesh and Bengali Muslims were more aligned to the Left. Therefore, the communal rhetoric never gained momentum in Bengal. The state never witnessed such divisive politics as is the practice now,” Bose, Gardiner Professor of oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI.Poll observers believe that the Left had been able to maintain a balance between communities, a practice that the TMC could not hold on to.“Bengal always had the ingredients fit for polarising its society. Not just the state’s high minority population, the influx of refugees from Bangladesh — both during 1947 Partition and 1971 Liberation war — have also been a major factor,” political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty said.The politically crucial Matuas and Namashudras, who had fled from Bangladesh due to religious persecution, voted for the Left for decades, before shifting lock stock and barrel to the BJP during the last Lok Sabha polls, following the promise of citizenship under a newly amended law.The TMC feels the ISF’s entry into Bengal’s poll arena will further deepen the divide and help the BJP by eating into the ruling party’s Muslim vote base.“The ISF may not win seats but will widen the communal divide further. It could cause harm to the TMC by cutting into our Muslim votes and further pushing the Hindus towards the BJP,” a senior leader of the Mamata Banerjee camp said.BJP leader Tathagatha Roy said the assertion of Muslim identity in Bengal politics, a comparatively new concept for the present generation, would consolidate Hindu votes.Siddiqui, however, denied the allegations and said he had entered politics to fight for the rights of the minorities and backward communities, a cause which the mainstream political parties have neglected so far.The BJP, apart from the development plank, has been harping on the issue of illegal immigration and the promise of citizenship to refugees, whereas the TMC has been largely focusing on the insider-outsider debate to take on the saffron camp.

Her appeal, days after returning to Tamil Nadu after serving a four-year sentence in an assets case, appeared to be a signal for a truce with the ruling AIADMK ahead of the polls.The two sides (Sasikala and EPS-OPS) have been slugging it out on Jayalalithaa’s legacy as the state gears up for the Assembly elections, the first in the absence of two political giants — Jayalalithaa and late DMK supremo M Karunanidhi.Both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam are not comfortable with the idea of Jayalalithaa’s “non-biological” sister Sasikala returning to AIADMK, which they now control. In fact, Palaniswami had made it clear that his party would not take back Sasikala.However, on Jayalalithaa’s 73rd birth anniversary, Sasikala recalled the late leader’s quote that even after her lifetime, the AIADMK would continue to work for the people for centuries to come.The BJP seems okay with the idea of “Chinnamma” by their side even though she comes with the baggage.According to some leaders, if the NDA wants to defeat rival DMK, then Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dinakaran should be brought on board.After being expelled from the AIADMK, Dinakaran floated a new party — AMMK — and is said to be holding considerable influence in many parts of central and southern Tamil Nadu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-aiadmk-alliance-discusses-return-of-sasikala-to-aiadmk-219468

02-03-2021||New Delhi||India’s working women still contend with strongest gender bias across Asia Pacific countries: Report||Gender equality might have improved over the years but India’s working women still contend with the strongest gender bias across Asia Pacific countries, says a report.According to the LinkedIn Opportunity Index 2021, more women in India have experienced the impact of gender on career development when compared to the APAC region.“In India, more than 4 in 5 working women (85 per cent) claim to have missed out on a raise, promotion, or work offer because of their gender, compared to the regional average of 60 per cent,” the report said.The report showed that even though 66 per cent of people in India feel that gender equality has improved compared to their parents’ age, more than 7 in 10 working women and working mothers feel that managing familial responsibilities often comes in their way of career development.In fact, about two-thirds of working women (63 per cent) and working mothers (69 per cent) said they have faced discrimination at work because of familial and household responsibilities.LinkedIn commissioned independent market research firm GfK to conduct a research between January 26-31, 2021.The online survey was conducted among 18 to 65 year olds.There were more than 10,000 respondents across the Asia Pacific region, from Australia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore.The survey covered 2,285 respondents in India, 1,223 of whom were males and 1,053 were females.“Gender inequality at work and added domestic responsibilities amid the pandemic have collectively made women’s jobs more vulnerable at this time,” said Ruchee Anand, Director, Talent and Learning Solutions, India at LinkedIn.According to Anand, it is the need of the hour for organisations to re-imagine their diversity practices and offer greater flexibility to caregivers in order to increase female participation in the workforce.“Reduced and flexible schedules, more sabbaticals, and new opportunities to upskill and learn are critical offerings that can help organisations attract, hire, and retain more female talent,” Anand said.More than 4 in 5 (86 per cent) Indians stated that they were negatively impacted by the pandemic while 9 in 10 said they were affected by COVID-19 in terms of job retrenchment, pay cuts, and reduced working hours.Indian professionals remain resilient towards recovery as 65 per cent of the professionals expect the economy to improve by June 2021.Learning and upskilling is seen as imperative to future-proof their careers in this current climate. About 57 per cent Indians are actively looking to learn new hard skills such as Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Business Analytics, and soft skills such as Creative Thinking, Problem Solving, and Time Management, the report said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-working-women-still-contend-with-strongest-gender-bias-across-asia-pacific-countries-report-219457

Recent Indian emphasis on import substitution through a ‘Make in India’ campaign has epitomised the challenges facing the bilateral trade relationship,” USTR said in its report to Congress on Monday.Effective June 5, 2019, the United States terminated India’s eligibility under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme, following a review of concerns related to India’s compliance with the GSP market access criterion.Subsequent to the suspension of India’s GSP benefits, the US and India resumed intensive work in the fall of 2019 aimed at producing a package of meaningful market access outcomes, and this engagement continued throughout 2020.The objectives of the US in this negotiation included resolution of various non-tariff barriers, targeted reduction of certain Indian tariffs, and other market access improvements, it said.“The United States also engaged with India on an ongoing basis throughout 2020 in response to specific concerns affecting the full range of pressing bilateral trade issues, including intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement, policy development affecting electronic commerce and digital trade, and market access for agricultural and non-agricultural goods and services,” it said.According to the report, while the United Kingdom remained the largest supplier of services, accounting for $62.3 billion of total US services imports in 2019, India was the sixth largest with $29.7 billion after Canada ($38.6 billion), Japan ($35.8 billion), Germany ($34.9 billion) and Mexico ($29.8 billion).The USTR said in July 2020, in response to outreach by it, India released US shipments of lactose and whey protein concentrate (WPC) that had been blocked since April 2020 when India began enforcing a requirement that those products be accompanied by a dairy certificate.Prior to this shift in practice, US exports of lactose and WPC to India had grown steadily for years, reaching a high of approximately $54 million in 2019 before falling to approximately $32 million in 2020.

02-03-2021||Lucknow||UP: Father of molestation victim shot dead by accused||A 50-year-old man was allegedly shot dead in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district by an accused out on bail in a case of molestation lodged in 2018 against the victim’s daughter, police said on Tuesday.“The incident took place in Nozarpur village of Sasani area in Hathras on Monday afternoon when the daughters of Ambrish Sharma (50) had gone to a temple, where the wife and aunt of accused Gaurav Sharma were present. The women had heated arguments with each other after which both Gaurav and Ambrish also reached there,” Hathras Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal said.Both Gaurav and Ambrish also had an argument after which the accused called some members of his family and shot Ambrish in a fit of rage, the SP said.Ambrish was rushed to the hospital where he was declared brought dead, the SP added.According to an FIR lodged by the victim’s daughter, however, the incident took place in their family potato field.The Hathras SP said the FIR had been registered against Gaurav Sharma, Lalit Sharma, Rahitash Sharma, Nikhil Sharma and two others. Out of them, Lalit has been arrested while the main accused Gaurav is absconding.In the FIR, it was alleged that the girl was there in her family potato field with her father Ambrish when Gaurav came in a white car with his accomplice and asked Ambrish to take back the case lodged against him.“Before my father could say anything, he opened fire on him. We rushed him to the hospital, where he died,” the girl said in the FIR.The victim had lodged a case of molestation of his daughter two and a half years ago against Gaurav, who was jailed. Gaurav, then, came out on bail after a month, and he had animosity with Ambrish since then, the SP added.Taking note of the incident, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered strict action to be taken against the accused and directed officials to invoke provisions of the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against them.Meanwhile, the Samajwadi Party reacted to the incident with its president Akhilesh Yadav alleging that women in UP have lost hope of justice from the state government.“After ‘Hathras ki  beti’, murder of a father who had complained of molestation of his daughter has taken place. UP’s women has not lost hope from the government has stopped seeking justice from it,” Akhilesh said in a tweet in Hindi.“Enough of the atrocities on women, this time BJP is out,” he added. Akhilesh also tagged a video of a girl, said to be the victim’s daughter along with his tweet.In the video, the girl is heard saying, “Please give me justice... please give me justice. First, he molested me, and now he has shot my father. He had come to our village. There were six-seven people. My father had no enmity against anyone. His name is Gaurav Sharma, he is a dog...”.The state BJP, though, has alleged that the main accused is from the SP with Gaurav Sharma running his social media pages with the name ‘Gaurav Songra’.The BJP pointed to a Facebook post on February 27 in which Gaurav asked people to attend a farmers’ meeting convened by Yadav on March 3 in Aligarh.“The accused is an SP leader and was out on bail and pressuring the victim’s family to withdraw the case. No such element will be spared in the present regime,” BJP spokesman Manish Shukla said.BJP MLA from Lambhua, Deomani Dwivedi took to Twitter on the matter and termed the Samajwadi Party as “Apradhwavi Party” (criminal party).He also put up a picture purportedly of Gaurav from the Facebook page in which he is inviting people for a kisan mahapanchyat in Aligarh.In September last year, a 20-year-old Dalit woman died after being raped by four men in an incident that had shocked the entire nation.She later died due to her injuries at a hospital in Delhi and the police came under widespread criticism over the handling of the case and a late-night funeral of the victim where the family said they were not allowed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-father-of-molestation-victim-shot-dead-by-accused-219444

02-03-2021||Washington||Biden urged to stop blocking of Covid WTO waiver suggested by India and South Africa||Coming out in support of India and South Africa, hundreds of American civil society organisations and three top lawmakers have urged US President Joe Biden not to block the waiver to Covid vaccines at the WTO, asserting that it will boost the treatment of coronavirus patients worldwide.The  World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires countries to provide lengthy monopoly protections for medicines, tests, and technologies used to produce them.While there is production capacity in every region, the WTO rules block the timely and unfettered access to the formulas and technology needed to boost manufacturing. Unless much greater volumes are made, many people in developing nations may not get Covid vaccines until 2024, a statement said.The unnecessary loss of life will be compounded by the loss of livelihoods for millions. According to an International Chamber of Commerce study, the world could face economic losses of more than USD 9 trillion under the scenario of wealthy nations being fully vaccinated by mid-2021, but poor countries largely shut out, it said."The Covid pandemic knows no borders and the need for vaccine development and dissemination across the globe is critically important. The TRIPS waiver raised by India and South Africa at the WTO would help the global community move forward in defeating the scourge of Covid by making diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines available in developing countries,” Congressman Rosa DeLauro, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said at a press conference on Monday.The vaccines must be made available everywhere to defeat this virus anywhere. The US has a moral imperative to act and support this waiver at the WTO, DeLauro said, expressing hope that the Biden administration would support this waiver to help US' allies around the globe bring an end to this pandemic."As a global community, we must come together and use every tool at our disposal to stop this pandemic. Unfortunately, we have seen intellectual property rules and corporate greed have disastrous impacts for public health during past epidemics, and we need to ensure that this doesn't happen again,” said Congressman Earl Blumenauer, Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade chair.

On October 12 last year, a grid failure in Mumbai resulted in massive power outages, stopping trains on tracks, hampering those working from home amid the pandemic. It took two hours for the power supply to resume for essential services, prompting CM Uddhav Thackeray to order an inquiry into the incident. Since early 2020, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed a large increase in suspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organisations from the Chinese state-sponsored group.The Ministry of Power on Monday said there was no impact on operations of Power System Operation Corporation due to any malware attack and that prompt actions were taken on advisories issued against such threats. However, it didn’t mention the Mumbai outage in its statement.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said it was “irresponsible and ill-intentioned” to make allegations without proof. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-hacked-india-power-grid-219223

However, the exams have been delayed this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Central board of Secondary Education (CBSE), which conducts board exams around the same time every year, has also deferred its exams to May-June this year.Last year, the CICSE had to cancel its pending exams because of the spike in COVID-19 cases and the result was declared on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme decided by the board.As per the scheme, candidates were assessed based on the best three percentage marks obtained in subjects for which board exams were conducted and the marks of their internal assessment as well as project work was taken into account. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cicse-class-10-exams-from-may-5-class-12-papers-from-april-8-219111
02-03-2021||New Delhi||Are you willing to marry her, SC asks man accused of raping girl, grants protection from arrest||“Are you willing to marry her,” was the question posed to a public servant, who is accused of repeatedly raping a minor girl but when the Supreme Court on Monday was told that he is already married he was asked to seek regular bail from the concerned court.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde was hearing a plea filed by the accused who is serving as a technician in Maharashtra State Electricity Production Company Ltd and has moved the apex court against the Bombay High Court February 5 order which had cancelled the anticipatory bail granted to him in the case.When the hearing commenced, the Bench also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked the accused “Are you willing to marry her?”               “If you are willing to marry her then we can consider it, otherwise you will go to jail,” observed the Bench adding “we are not forcing you to marry”.     After taking instructions on the query posed by the Bench, the counsel appearing for the petitioner, said the accused was initially willing to marry the girl but she had refused and now he was married to someone else.As the counsel said that the accused is a public servant, the Bench said, “You should have thought this before seducing and raping the girl. You knew that you are a government servant.”The counsel said charges in the case are yet to be framed.“You apply for regular bail. We will stay arrest,” the Bench said.The apex court granted the accused protection from arrest for four weeks.The top court was hearing a plea filed by the accused against the Bombay High Court’s February 5 order cancelling the anticipatory bail granted to him by the trial court in January last year.He has also been accused of offences punishable under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.In his plea filed in the top court, he has referred to the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules 1979 and said it pointed out that if a government servant is detained in police custody under criminal charges for a period of 48 hours, then he shall be deemed to have been placed under suspension by an order of appointing authority.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/are-you-willing-to-marry-her-sc-asks-man-accused-of-raping-girl-grants-protection-from-arrest-219079

02-03-2021||Washington/Beijing||Amidst border tension, Chinese hackers targeted India’s power through malware: US firm||Amidst the tense border situation between India and China, a Chinese government-linked group of hackers targeted India’s critical power grid system through malware, a US company has said in its latest study, raising suspicion whether last year’s massive power outage in Mumbai was a result of the online intrusion.Recorded Future, a Massachusetts-based company which studies the use of the internet by state actors, in its recent report details the campaign conducted by a China-linked threat activity group RedEcho targeting the Indian power sector.The activity was identified through a combination of large-scale automated network traffic analytics and expert analysis.Data sources include the Recorded Future Platform, SecurityTrails, Spur, Farsight and common open-source tools and techniques, the report said.In New Delhi, the Ministry of Power on Monday said there is no impact on operations of Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO) due to any malware attack and that prompt actions are taken on advisories issued against such threats.Responding on the findings of the study, the ministry said, “There is no impact on any of the functionalities carried out by POSOCO due to the referred threat. No data breach/ data loss has been detected due to these incidents.”It further said, “Prompt actions are being taken by the CISOs (chief information security officers) at all these control centres under operation by POSOCO for any incident/advisory received from various agencies like CERT-in, NCIIPC, CERT-Trans etc.”Read also: Cyber attack, sabotage behind 2020 Mumbai power outage: RautThe CERT-in (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) is the nodal agency to deal with cyber security threats like hacking and phishing.However, the ministry did not mention about the Mumbai outage in its statement.On October 12, a grid failure in Mumbai resulted in massive power outages, stopping trains on tracks, hampering those working from home amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and hitting the economic activity hard.In its report, Recorded Future notified the appropriate Indian government departments prior to publication of the suspected intrusions to support incident response and remediation investigations within the impacted organisations.Since early 2020, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group observed a large increase in suspected targeted intrusion activity against Indian organisations from the Chinese state-sponsored group.The New York Times, in a report, said the discovery raises the question about whether the Mumbai outage was meant as a message from Beijing about what might happen if India pushed its border claims too vigorously.In response to the US firm’s allegation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Monday rejected the criticism about China’s involvement in the hacking of India’s power grid, saying it is “irresponsible and ill-intentioned” practice.“As a staunch defender of cyber security, China firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyber attacks. Speculation and fabrication have no role to play on the issue of cyber attacks, as it is very difficult to trace the origin of a cyber attack.“It is highly irresponsible to accuse a particular party when there is no sufficient evidence around. China is firmly opposed to such irresponsible and ill-intentioned practice,” Wang said in Beijing.According to the Recorded Future report, from mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future’s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India’s power sector.Ten distinct Indian power sector organisations, including four of the five Regional Load Despatch Centres responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India’s critical infrastructure.Other targets identified included two Indian seaports, it said, adding the targeting of Indian critical infrastructure offers limited economic espionage opportunities.“However, we assess they pose significant concerns over potential pre-positioning of network access to support Chinese strategic objectives.“Pre-positioning on energy assets may support several potential outcomes, including geostrategic signalling during heightened bilateral tensions, supporting influence operations, or as a precursor to kinetic escalation,” it said.RedEcho has strong infrastructure and victimology overlaps with Chinese groups APT41/Barium and Tonto Team, while ShadowPad is used by at least five distinct Chinese groups, it said.Recorded Future said in the lead-up to the May 2020 border skirmishes, it observed a noticeable increase in the provisioning of PlugX malware C2 infrastructure, much of which was subsequently used in intrusion activity targeting Indian organisations.“The PlugX activity included the targeting of multiple Indian government, public sector and defence organisations from at least May 2020,” it said.While not unique to Chinese cyber espionage activity, PlugX has been heavily used by China-nexus groups for many years.“Throughout the remainder of 2020, we identified a heavy focus on the targeting of Indian government and private sector organisations by multiple Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups,” it said.Recorder Future also alleged that it also observed the suspected Indian state-sponsored group Sidewinder target Chinese military and government entities in 2020, in activity overlapping with recent Trend Micro research.The US company’s report came as the armies of the two countries began disengagement of troops locked in over eight-month-long standoff in eastern Ladakh.
