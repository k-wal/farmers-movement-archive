The bill provides for an overarching central commission with state bodies to regulate allied health services.The commission will maintain a database and register of allied and healthcare professionals who will have to register themselves just like doctors register with the National Medical Commission.The Central Commission will prescribe minimum standards of education, courses, curricula, physical and infrastructural facilities which an institution (including universities) offering such courses would have to maintain by law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-nod-to-regulation-for-dieticians-osteopaths-dental-hygienists-among-other-allied-health-providers-226146
16-03-2021||London||UK to shift foreign policy focus to Indo-Pacific in post-Brexit review||The UK must do more to adapt to major changes in the world and therefore shift its foreign policy focus to the Indo-Pacific region, with countries such as India, Japan and Australia, a year-long of the country’s post-Brexit “Global Britain” vision concluded on Tuesday.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who formally launched the ‘Global Britain in a competitive age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy’ document in the House of Commons, underlined this so-called Indo-Pacific tilt by confirming his visit to India next month, an application for partner status of the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) economic union and the Royal Navy warship Queen Elizabeth Carrier deployment to the region.“I am delighted to announce that I will visit India next month to strengthen our friendship with the world’s biggest democracy,” he said in his Commons statement.“Britain will remain unswervingly committed to NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organisation] and preserving peace and security in Europe, and from this secure basis, we will seek out friends and partners wherever they can be found, building a coalition for openness and innovation, and engaging more deeply in the Indo-Pacific,” he said, highlighting an invitation to India, Australia and South Korea to attend the UK-hosted G7 Summit as part of “deeper engagement” in the Indo-Pacific.Besides being at the “frontline of new security challenges”, the region’s shipping lanes are also seen as vital to maintain UK trade with Asia.The year-long review had been commissioned as a future policy framework for the UK as a non-member of the European Union (EU).The 100-page document also confirms the launch of two new cross-government hubs – a Counter-Terrorism Operations Centre, aimed at significantly improving the UK’s ability to “thwart terrorists”, and a White House style Situation Centre based in the Cabinet Office to improve the “use of data” to anticipate and respond to future crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.India is categorised as “an international actor of growing importance” in the review, which commits to achieving an Enhanced Trade Partnership this year as a roadmap to a potential “comprehensive trade deal”.“The UK-India relationship is already strong, but over the next 10 years we seek transformation in our cooperation across the full range of our shared interests,” the review concludes.“Our vision is for re-energised trade and investment, rooted in S&T [science and tech] and supporting levelling up in the UK and India alike; enhanced defence cooperation that brings a more secure Indian Ocean Region, building on the existing biannual Ministerial Defence Dialogues; and UK-India leadership to tackle global challenges like climate change, clean energy and global health,” it adds.It also takes note of China’s growing international stature as being “by far the most significant geopolitical factor in the world today”, with major implications for British values and interests and for the structure and shape of the international order.Categorising it as a “challenge”, the review declares a plan to pursue a positive economic relationship within a “robust diplomatic framework”.“We will not hesitate to stand up for our values and our interests where they are threatened, or when China acts in breach of existing agreements,” it notes.Russia is another challenge country, which the review finds will remain the “most acute direct threat to the UK”.“In all our endeavours, the United States will be our greatest ally and a uniquely close partner in defence, intelligence and security,” declared Johnson.The review he had commissioned also highlights how the world’s soft power landscape is changing and therefore Britain’s own soft power can no longer be taken for granted.“Those who challenge the values of open and democratic societies increasingly do so through culture: systemic competitors like Russia and China invest heavily in global cultural power projection and information operations… Our perception of other countries – and therefore their soft power – is also increasingly shaped in the digital space, driven by individuals and non-state actors, including through disinformation,” it warns.The Integrated Review establishes tackling climate change and preserving biodiversity as the UK’s number one international priority in the decade ahead.Investment in cutting-edge technology and an increase in nuclear warheads also form part of the future plans laid out in what has been termed the most comprehensive articulation of a foreign policy and national security approach published by a British government in decades and sets out government priorities until 2030.As part of the overhaul, the cap on the number of warheads will now increase to 260, having been due to drop to 180 under previous plans from 2010.While the review says the UK will not give exact figures on the size of its operational stockpile to maintain “deliberate ambiguity” for adversaries, it pledges the UK will maintain the “minimum destructive power needed to guarantee that the UK’s nuclear deterrent remains credible”.“We will better protect ourselves against threats to our economic security. Our newly independent trade policy will be an instrument for ensuring that the rules and standards in future trade agreements reflect our values,” Johnson told MPs.

It, therefore, recommends the government to assess if there is a need to amend the existing Laws or bring out a new law altogether in order to clearly define the mandate of CBI and vest more powers in it”.Eight states—Mizoram, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Jharkhand and Punjab—have withdrawn general consent to the CBI to exercise its powers under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946.Further the panel also recommended that the government should explore the feasibility of inducting officers up to the rank of DSP as well as specialists into CBI through direct recruitment besides deputation. “The Committee is of the considered view that it is important to align the human resource architecture of CBI to enhance its core competencies and improve its performance,” it said.Meanwhile, the panel said, the Lokpal has informed the committee that it received requests for reconsideration of its orders, but the same were not considered as it does not have statutory powers to review an order passed by it.“The Committee recommends the Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) to explore the feasibility of amending the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act so as to confer on Lokpal the Power to reconsider and review its orders. The Committee recommends DoPT to apprise its views on the proposed amendment in three months,” it said.A committee comprising three Lokpal members—Justice Abhilasha Kumari, D K Jain and I P Gautam—was constituted to look into the aspect of recommending a policy regarding requests for a review of an order passed by the bench. The committee, which was formed by Lokpal chairperson Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose, submitted its report on October 6, 2020 recommending that the central government may be requested to consider the inclusion of power of review in the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act.The institution of Lokpal and Lokayuktas has been established under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries.     Mukesh RanjanTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 16In view of the recent trend of withdrawal of General Consent to CBI by a number of opposition ruled states for investigation within their territorial jurisdiction, a Parliamentary panel has asked the government to assess if there is “a need to amend the existing laws or bring out a new law altogether” to clearly define “the mandate of the agency and vest more power to it”.Similarly, in the same report, the department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel & Public Grievances, chaired by BJP Rajya Sabha member Bhupender Yadav, has also asked the government to explore the feasibility of amending relevant laws so as to confer powers on the Lokpal to reconsider and review its orders. The 106th report, which was submitted in Rajya Sabha, the panel said, “It agreed agrees with the view of CBI that withdrawal of General Consent by States impedes investigation.

16-03-2021||New Delhi||PM to visit Dhaka on March 26-27||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Bangladesh on March 26 and 27, according to an official news release.The long-planned visit, the first by PM Modi abroad since the Covid epidemic, is in connection with the commemoration of three events - Mujib Borsho (the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman); 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh; and 50 years of Bangladesh’s war of liberation.PM Modi had last visited Bangladesh in 2015.Both sides have put their differences regarding CAA\NRC on the back-burner to focus on connectivity and transit projects. While the BJP is silent on CAA in Assam, it has so far soft-peddled the issue in West Bengal in view of the PM's upcoming visit to Dhaka.During the visit, he will attend the National Day programme of Bangladesh on March 26, as the guest of honour.The PM, apart from holding bilateral consultations with Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina, also includes a call on the President of Bangladesh Md. Abdul Hamid.India's close involvement with the seminal even in Bangladesh's history is seen as a move to foster trust and confidence that has led to Dhaka agreeing to transit and inter-connectivity which was opposed by the previous regime of Khalida Zia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-to-visit-dhaka-on-march-26-27-226134
16-03-2021||London||British fugitive wins appeal against extradition to India due to high suicide risk||A British fugitive wanted in India to serve a 10-year sentence after his conviction for possession of 10 kilograms of cannabis in April 2002 won a High Court appeal in London on Tuesday, as a judge ruled that it would be oppressive to extradite him to India because he posed a “very high risk of completed suicide”.Justice Martin Chamberlain noted that the assurances given by the Indian government did not “significantly reduce” the risk that the accused, Ivor Fletcher,  could try to kill himself if transferred to an Indian prison.“Certainly, the detail that is provided does nothing to allay the concerns about the extent of supervision to prevent suicide,” Justice Chamberlain notes.“For these reasons, I have concluded that the assurances given do not significantly reduce the very high risk of completed suicide. Accordingly, on the evidence before the court (which is quite different from that before the District Judge), the physical or mental condition of the Appellant (Fletcher) is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him,” his judgment reads.Fletcher had used the same prisons and mental health experts to argue his appeal as those deposed by fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi – wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering related to the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam.Dr Andrew Forrester, a forensic psychiatrist, and Dr Alan Mitchell, a medical practitioner and prisons expert as chair of the Independent Prisons Monitoring Group in Scotland, were quoted as experts in the Fletcher case during remote hearings before Justice Martin Chamberlain. “Mr Fletcher has serious and long-term mental health issues. The unchallenged psychiatric evidence from Dr Forrester is that Mr Fletcher is a very high risk of suicide and has a high chance of completed suicide if extradited. Mr Fletcher is impulsive and has also planned to take his own life,” argued Fletcher’s barrister Ben Keith.James Stansfeld, appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities, countered the arguments and stated that Indian government assurances in the case would provide adequate medical care for the accused.“The Appellant (Fletcher) is a fugitive from proceedings in India. He is sought to serve a lengthy sentence of imprisonment for serious offences. He can be, and will be, provided with appropriate care in India and in transit from the UK,” said Stansfeld.The appeal was argued on the grounds of Section 91 of the Extradition Act, which prohibits extradition from the UK if it would be “unjust or oppressive” to the person.During closing submissions in the Nirav Modi case in January, his legal team had raised similar Section 91 arguments when citing his severe depression and high risk of suicide.However, District Judge Sam Goozee went on to conclude in that case that the risk of “completed suicide” had not been established and that the assurances provided by the Indian government were sufficient to ensure his safety in Barrack 12 of Arthur Road jail in Mumbai.Modi’s case has now been sent to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has until the end of next month to order his extradition based on the District Judge’s findings.Modi, meanwhile, can carry on making representations to the minister and would have 14 days to apply for permission to appeal in the High Court following her decision. It is likely that this week’s High Court ruling in the case of Fletcher could be used as one of the grounds for appeal in the Nirav Modi case.According to court documents, Fletcher was arrested in the Kullu region of India with charas (cannabis) in biscuit-shaped packets wrapped in khaki-coloured paper in an attache case and his appeal against his arrest in the case went up to the Supreme Court in India, where it was dismissed in August 2011.India put in an extradition request in June 2018 for his return to serve his sentence after he was discovered in the UK, following which he was arrested and the UK Home Secretary ordered his extradition in March last year following a magistrates’ court ruling in India’s favour.The High Court was told that because Fletcher suffers from severe recurrent depression and a form of long-term personality disorder which puts him at a high risk of committing suicide, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown, it would be unjust and oppressive to extradite him to an Indian prison.Meanwhile, the Indian authorities argued sufficient provisions are in place to take his mental health into consideration in prison, including regular monitoring. On extradition, Fletcher was to be held at the Model Central Jail at Kanda in Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla district where he was to be confined to a “safe barrack under strict watch and vigil”. If needed, he would have received specialist psychiatric care and treatment at Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) Shimla, which is located around 20 km away.The judge found that while it was not “necessarily problematic” that the prison had no specialist psychiatric care available on-site, the lack of detail as to the frequency with which psychiatrists from IGMC Shimla visit the prison made it difficult to assess the psychiatric care which would “in practice” be available.

So being a finalist for this award makes us feel very encouraged,” said nun Jigme Konchok Lhamo.Apart from the Kung Fu Nuns, the other finalists are Loujain Alhathloul, who defied the ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia, and Julienne Lusenge, a Congolese human rights activist.Václav Havel was a dissident and well regarded novelist behind the iron curtain who became the President of Czechoslovakia and, after demerger, served as the head of Czech Republic.The prize is awarded each year by PACE (Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe), in partnership with the Václav Havel Library and the Charta 77 Foundation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kung-fu-nuns-shortlisted-for-v%C3%A1clav-havel-human-rights-prize-226128
16-03-2021||New Delhi||Shekhawat attacks Congress; says Punjab failed to spend JJM funds||Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday counterattacked the Congress for its charge that his ministry failed to spend funds, saying it was due to non-BJP governments, including Punjab government, for failure to utilise the central funds.   Replying to a discussion on working of the Jal Shakti Ministry, Shekhawat hit out at Congress member Digvijaya Singh for questioning his administrative capability, saying the latter has been exiled from Madhya Pradesh for more than 10 months now due the failure of the government led by him in providing basic infrastructural amenities such as water, electricity and roads.He made it obvious that this was his response to Digvijaya Singh on his personal attack and questioning his administrative capability.Initiating the discussion, Singh had said that the Jal Shakti Ministry failed to spend the funds and questioned the government’s water management policy.Shekhawat said under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), the Centre had provided Rs 227 crore in the financial year 2019-20 to the Punjab government which could spend only Rs 73 crore.The state was allocated Rs 363 crore for implementation of the JJM in 2020-21, but it has not been able to avail the same, he said.The norm is that before availing the succeeding cache of funds for a recurring central scheme, a state government has to furnish details of expenditure of the preceding funds taken by it.He named the poll bound state of TMC-ruled West Bengal, JMM-led Jharkhand, and Congress-ruled states of Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as conspicuous laggards in implementation of JJM, falling much behind the national average figure.Responding to protests from opposition benches, including Congress member from Punjab Pratap Singh Bajwa who wanted to know the reason for Punjab government not spending the funds, Shekhawat shot back: “It is for the Punjab government to explain.”He lauded the opposition ruled state of Telangana for 100 per cent coverage of rural households under the scheme.He said while the Congress governments provided piped drinking water to just above three crore rural households during 55 years of its rule, the present Union government has provided piped water supply to additional 3.85 crore households in 15 months under JJM.He said the government is in the process of mapping the aquifers to know the status of underground water across the country. Details of it would be shared with all the village panchayats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shekhawat-attacks-congress-says-punjab-failed-to-spend-jjm-funds-226124
16-03-2021||Beijing/New Delhi||China to permit Indians and people from 19 countries to return only if they take Chinese vaccines||China has made it mandatory for people coming from India and 19 other nations to get Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines if they want to travel to this country.“For the purpose of resuming people-to-people exchanges in an orderly manner, starting from 15 March, 2021, the Chinese Embassies and Consulates in India will provide the persons having taken Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine and holding the Certificates of Vaccination,” a notice posted on the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said.The announcement makes little difference for thousands of Indian students besides professionals working in China and their family members who are stuck in India awaiting Beijing to permit their return as there are no Chinese vaccines available in India.The Chinese Embassy notice did not specify how Indians can access the Chinese-made vaccines in India as they are not available in the country. Over 23,000 Indian students, most of them medical students, besides hundreds of professionals working in China are stuck in India since last year due to coronavirus travel restrictions.Despite repeated representations from the Indian embassy and appeals by the students, China is yet to respond positively.State-run Global Times reported that such notices were put up by Chinese embassies in 20 countries.Asked about the rationale of the regulation to have Chinese vaccines in countries like India where China made vaccines are not available, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on Tuesday that many countries have floated the idea of linking vaccination status with opening up international travels.“Our proposal to facilitate the travel of those who have been inoculated with Chinese vaccines is made after thoroughly considering the safety and efficacy of Chinese vaccines,” he said.“We believe this is a meaningful exploration of facilitating international travel once mass vaccination has been achieved. It is not linked to the recognition of Chinese vaccines,” he said.When pointed out that would it not be better if China recognised the vaccines endorsed by WHO, which is yet to approve the Chinese vaccines, Zhao said, “China’s proposal is a meaningful step. We are trying to facilitate international travel”.“This is an arrangement made by the Chinese side unilaterally. It is a different thing from vaccine recognition,” he said.The WHO has already approved Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines. AstraZeneca vaccine is being produced by Serum Institute in Pune in the name of Covishield.

16-03-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana HC says no to CBI probe in lawyer couple murder||The Telangana High Court has ruled out the option of handing over the probe into the murder of the lawyer couple to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) observing there is no need for a probe by the CBI as the state police were working on the case as per the records before it.A petition by slain lawyer Gattu Vaman Rao’s father Gattu Kishan Rao had sought a probe by the CBI expressing dissatisfaction over the manner in which the probe was progressing. It may be recalled that in February, a lawyer couple was stabbed to death by unidentified assailants in broad daylight in Peddapalli district.The victim before his death had named a Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader as being responsible for the attack.Gattu Vaman Rao and his wife Nagamani were both practising lawyers at the Telangana High Court.They were waylaid on their way home and hacked to death near Kalvacherla village of Ramagiri Mandal in Telangana.  Taking up the matter, a Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Hima Kohli observed that the court shares the petitioner’s pain but pointed out that it was directly monitoring the probe.It also felt that the investigations were going on in the right direction and if the case was entrusted to the CBI, this could lead to further delay. The Advocate General submitted a report to the court on the status of the investigations. The court was informed that the police recovered the weapons used in the murder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-hc-says-no-to-cbi-probe-in-lawyer-couple-murder-226105

A Modi government initiative to bring back balance in Indo-US ties, it last met in 2016 involving then US Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker along with their counterparts Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman.The Trade Policy Forum (TPF) too also had a neglected existence since Trump’s Presidency and as is the case with S&CD, there is no news about its possible revival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bid-to-jumpstart-indo-us-economic-ties-226101
16-03-2021||Vijay Mohan||Army phases out two artillery weapons that had been in service for over 50 years||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 16The Indian Army on Tuesday decommissioned two of the longest-serving artillery weapon systems, the 130mm M-46 Catapult self-propelled guns and the 160mm Tampella mortars.These weapon systems have been a part of the Regiment of Artillery for over half a century. The decommissioning ceremony was held at the Mahajan Field Firing Ranges in north-western Rajasthan, where the last customary salvos were fired.The Catapult was an integration of the Soviet origin M-46 towed artillery gun with the hull of the Vijayanta tank. While the Catapult was first produced in 1987, the army had started procuring the M-46 from 1986 onwards.About 1,000 guns, which had a range of 27 km, had been inducted. In 2008, about 180 of these guns were upgraded to 155 mm caliber by Israel and some more were similarly modified by the Ordnance Factory Board.Close to 100 Catapults using the 130 mm guns were built on the Vijayanta’s hull. Later, the Army carried out trials on the Arjun tank’s hull which reportedly proved to be successful and a requirement of 40 such systems had been projected.The Tampella was a heavy mortar weighing 7,300 kg that fired a projectile weighing over 40 kg to a range of 8 km. Only a limited number of these weapons had been procured and given their weight, 7-member crew strength and range, were no longer relevant in today’s operational environment. They were last used in the Kargil conflict.The K-9 Vajra 155 mm self-propelled howitzer, Dhanush 155 mm  towed artillery gun and the US made M-777 155 mm ultra-light howitzer are among recent inductions in Regiment of Artillery to replace old obsolete weapons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-phases-out-two-artillery-weapons-that-had-been-in-service-for-over-50-years-226099
16-03-2021||New Delhi||India fuel sales return to pre-COVID levels||India’s fuel demand, except ATF, has returned to pre-COVID levels and a reflating economy will help consumption grow in near future, head of the nation’s top oil firm said on Tuesday.Fuel sales had fallen by a record 45.8 per cent in April last year when a nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus infections. Demand started to recover with the easing of lockdown restrictions, with petrol returning to normal growth first and now diesel too is back at pre-COVID levels.“Except for ATF, we have touched normal demand,” Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said. “We are back on track.”      While petrol sales had reached pre-COVID levels a few months back, diesel was up 7.4 per cent year-on-year in the first half of March.LPG sales showed growth even during the lockdown.With airlines not operating all flights, ATF sales remain below normal.“ATF may take a quarters time to return to normal, maybe 3-4 months,” he said.IOC, he said, is bullish about fuel demand recovery as the economy grows.“Let’s hope for the best with the vaccine rollout,” he said.Diesel sales in the first half of March rose to 2.84 million tonnes while petrol demand was up 5.3 per cent to 1.05 million tonnes.This is the first annual rise in petrol sales since October. ATF sales, which fell by more than 80 per cent in the aftermath of the lockdown, was down 36.5 per cent in the first half of March.India’s economy returned to positive growth territory in the fourth quarter of 2020 as its real GDP expanded by 0.4 per cent year-on-year after two quarters of contraction. This was after provincial and localised lockdowns were lifted amid a fall in the daily number of new COVID-19 cases.Crude oil suppliers group OPEC’s monthly oil report last week forecast a 13.6 per cent jump in India’s oil demand in 2021 to 4.99 million barrels per day.India’s oil demand had fallen 10.54 per cent in 2020 to 4.40 million bpd from 4.91 million bpd in 2019.“The encouraging macroeconomic indicators, together with significant decreases in COVID-19 cases across the country, provided a solid foundation for the 2021 oil demand outlook in India,” the report said.The recent positive developments in industrial activities will result in industrial fuels being the backbone for oil demand growth in 2021, with a healthy rebound for transportation fuels providing further support, it said adding the aviation sector will remain under pressure throughout 2021 and will also be a major source of uncertainty.“Despite some improvements month-on-month, domestic flight operations remained more than 10 per cent lower than the levels recorded during the same period in 2020,” the OPEC report said.In 2020, India’s GDP contracted by 7 per cent, but it is forecast to grow by 9 per cent in 2021.“Following the 0.4 per cent growth registered in 4Q20, India’s was one of the few major economies to post growth in the quarter as lockdowns eased, and this rebound is expected to continue as consumption manufacturing activity rise,” the OPEC report said.

16-03-2021||---||Parliamentary panel asks government to consider reducing juvenile delinquency age to 16 under POCSO Act||New Delhi, March 16A parliamentary panel has recommended to the government to consider bringing down the juvenile delinquency age from 18 to 16 in cases under the POCSO Act, noting that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crime if left untreated and uncounselled.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, headed by Congress MP Anand Sharma, in its report submitted to Rajya Sabha on Monday, observed that there has been a large number of cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act where the age of juvenile offenders has been below the threshold age for applicability of the law.The committee said that it believed that minor sexual offenders may commit more serious and heinous crime if left untreated and uncounselled. Therefore, it is very important to re-look at these provisions “because more and more juveniles are getting involved in such crimes”, the report stated.“The committee, therefore, recommends that the MHA may take up with MoW&CD (Ministry of Women and Child Development) to review the current age limit of 18 years and see if it can be reduced to 16 years for the applicability of the POCSO Act, 2012,” the report said.The panel said it is of the considered view that due to lack of legal awareness, particularly amongst minor children and juveniles, they are getting involved in crimes like stalking, online-trolling, molesting, etc., in their schools and colleges, considering these as non-criminal activities.Therefore, it is necessary to impart knowledge of cyber security to them so that they do not get targeted by offenders.The committee, therefore, recommends that the Ministry of Home Affairs may take up with the Ministry of Education to include the basics of cyber security in the school curriculum at an early age, it said.The panel observes that it is very important to conduct a nationwide campaign to create awareness amongst all sections of society regarding the use and misuse of cyber space and also about the evolving technology which is being leveraged to commit different and new types of cyber crimes.It is also very important to protect minor children and juveniles from indulging in crimes like stalking, online-trolling, molesting, etc, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-asks-government-to-consider-reducing-juvenile-delinquency-age-to-16-under-pocso-act-226087
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Why Mumbai police held press conference over TRP scam, asks Bombay HC||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked what had prompted the Mumbai police to hold a press conference last year over the alleged Television Rating Points (TRP) scam.“Does the police have an obligation to interact with the press? Why did the commissioner (of police) have to speak to the press?” a Bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale asked.The court was hearing pleas filed by ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, the company that owns Republic TV channels, and by journalist Arnab Goswami, seeking, among other reliefs, that the Mumbai police’s probe into the TRP scam be transferred to the CBI or any other independent agency.The Bench was responding to the arguments made by the ARG Outlier Media’s counsel, senior advocate Ashok Mundargi.Mundargi told the high court that the police had malafide intentions behind holding the press conference in October last year.He also said there was no evidence against Republic TV and its Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, but the police were trying to name them as accused “by hook or by crook”.“The police were feeding the press that a particular scam took place. This points out that there was not sufficient material to say whatever was being said,” Mundargi argued.He also said the police had arrested some employees of the ARG Outlier Media and named them as accused persons in their remand applications.However, in the charge sheet, the police had named the channel and ARG Outlier Media’s employees merely as suspects, he said.Mundargi also said that Sachin Waze, who had been handling the probe into the alleged scam, and who is now suspended over his alleged involvement in another case, was a controversial officer.“The investigation has taken a peculiar angle. In the charge sheet they are suspects, they are arrested and then they are shown as wanted accused,” Mundargi said.“The officer (Waze) is also very controversial. This is the chain of events,” he said.The HC will continue hearing the final arguments in the case on Wednesday.The Maharashtra government’s statement made earlier this month to refrain from taking any coercive action against Goswami and the ARG Outlier Media’s employees will continue till then.The ARG Outlier Media and Goswami approached the HC last year filing a bunch of petitions seeking several reliefs in the TRP scam.They alleged that the whole case was mala fide and they had been targeted for Republic TV’s reportage in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the Palghar lynching case last year.The Mumbai police in January this year filed two affidavits in the TRP case through Commissioner of Police Param Bir Singh and ACP Shashank Sandbhor of the crime branch, saying they had not targeted the Republic TV or its employees.The police said their probe into the case was not a result of any political vendetta and there was evidence to show that Goswami had connived with senior officials of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) to rig the TRP of Republic TV.

16-03-2021||Bareilly (UP)||FIR registered against Waseem Rizvi for moving SC seeking removal of some verses of Quran||An FIR was registered here against former UP Shia Waqf Board chairman Waseem Rizvi for allegedly hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims with his petition in the Supreme Court seeking removal of some verses of the Quran which he claimed promoted terrorism.The FIR was registered at the Kotwali police station on Monday evening following complaints by Anjuman Khuddam-e-Rasool secretary Shan Ahmed and an organisation known as Ittehad-e-Millat Council, the police said.The case was registered under section 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Bareilly, Rohit Singh Sajwan said.Chairman of the Raja Action Committee, Maulana Afroz Raja Qadri, claimed sectarian forces were operating behind Rizvi, and that time has come to unmask them.On Sunday, members of the Muslim community held a protest in Lucknow against Rizvi. Shia cleric and senior member of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board Maulana Kalbe Jawwad and a large number of people took part in the protest at the Bara Imambara.Addressing the gathering that day, Maulana Syed Salman Hasni Nadvi laid stress on Muslim unity and described Rizvi as a “kaafir (non-believer)” and “mujrim (criminal)”.“We are believers of the Quran and Allah first, Sunni and Shia later. Hence, there are no differences among us as far as the Quran is concerned,” Nadvi had then said.Maulana Jawwad had told reporters that Waseem Rizvi was a part of the “jamaat (group)” that goes to the extent of even falsifying their own existence and betraying their own religion.“He has been indulging in anti-religious activities, but this time, he has broken all barriers by raising a finger on the Quran,” Jawwad had said, urging the government to immediately arrest Rizvi and impose a heavy fine on him.In Bareilly, Mufti Ahsan Raja Qadri of the Dargah-e-Aala Hazrat, a prominent centre of Barelvi Muslims, too had condemned Rizvi’s move and said not even an iota of change in the holy book was possible.In a statement, he had said, “Waseem Rizvi is an enemy of the Quran and Islam. He is doing this to gather cheap popularity and to save himself from the Waqf scam”.Rizvi filed the PIL in the apex court on Thursday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fir-registered-against-waseem-rizvi-for-moving-sc-seeking-removal-of-some-verses-of-quran-226073
16-03-2021||Bengaluru||Quad push: ISRO taking space ties with US, Japan & Australia to a higher orbit||As Quad takes a leap forward, India is deepening space ties with the U.S., Japan and Australia -- the other three member nations of the group.Known as the "Quadrilateral Security Dialogue", the Quad grouping held its first virtual summit last week.The four countries plan to establish a series of working groups that will focus on climate change; critical and emerging technologies, including working to set technology standards and norms and jointly developing some of the critical technologies of the future, officials said.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) last week shipped the S-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to U.S.space agency NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as the joint NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission moved forward.NISAR is a joint collaboration for a dual-frequency L and S-band SAR for earth observation."NISAR will be the first satellite mission to use two different radar frequencies (L-band and S-band) to measure changes in our planet's surface less than a centimetre across", according to NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).The mission is targeted for launch in 2022 from ISRO's Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh's Nellore district, about 100 kms north of Chennai.NASA is providing the mission's L-band SAR, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder and payload data subsystem.ISRO is providing the spacecraft bus,the S-band radar,the launch vehicle and associated launch services for the mission, whose goal is to make global measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes using advanced radar imaging.On March 11, Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) reviewed the ongoing cooperation in earth observation, lunar cooperation and satellite navigation."Both sides have agreed to explore opportunities for cooperation in space situational awareness(SSA) and professional exchange programme", according to ISRO.On the occasion, ISRO and JAXA signed an 'Implementing Arrangement' for collaborative activities on rice crop area and air quality monitoring, using satellite data".ISRO and JAXA have planned a joint mission -- Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) -- to explore the Moon's south pole in 2023.LUPEX received a boost as Japan reportedly earmarked 2.8 billion Yen (USD 26 million) for it for the fiscal 2021.In February, ISRO and Australian Space Agency (ASA) inked an Amendment of the '2012 India Australia Inter-Governmental MoU for cooperation in Civil Space Science, Technology and Education' .This Amendment makes India's Department of Space and ASA as the Executive Organisations and provides scope for other related entities to conclude implementing arrangements for specific cooperation activities.The two agencies reviewed the status of ongoing cooperation activities in earth observation, satellite navigation, space situational awareness and establishment of transportable terminal in Australia to support Indias 'Gaganyaan' programme.Australia's Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews had said the new agreement strengthens existing ties between Australia and India and allows the two countries to work closer than ever in space for the benefit of both nations.Head of the ASA, Enrico Palermo, said the signing symbolises the importance of the strong collaborative partnership between the Agency and ISRO, which will look to identify new areas of cooperation in space technology, applications, education and outreach."An ISRO built L- and S-band Airborne SAR (ASAR) was flown over the United States aboard NASAs aircraft during November - December 2019 and data acquisitions were made in 92 sites.ASAR repeat flight campaigns are being planned for spring and summer 2021", according to ISRO."Both agencies are working for an implementing arrangement to carry NASAs Laser Reflectometer Array (LRA) in Chandrayaan-3.ISRO-NASA Joint Working Group on Human Spaceflight Programme (HSP) is exploring collaboration opportunities", it said.ISRO and JAXA are specifically working on sharing earth observation data and to carry out calibration/validation experiments, and establishing ISROs NavIC reference station in Japan.NavIC refers to the space segment consisting of the IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) constellation of eight satellites.Both agencies have completed the feasibility study for the LUPEX and are currently finalising the Phase-A study report, according to ISRO.

Even the 2008 bank recession could not impact India due to nationalised banks. The government should speak to the bank employees, who are sitting in protest,” he added.Kharge also said that bank employees’ strike for the past two days has affected businesses, and the common people.“On March 17, general insurance companies are also going on strike.

16-03-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear plea of Zakia Jafri against SIT's clean chit to Modi in Gujarat riots case on April 13||The Supreme Court on Tuesday fixed for hearing on April 13 the plea of Zakia Jafri, wife of slain MP Ehsan Jafri, challenging the SIT's clean chit to then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in the 2002 riots, saying it would not entertain any request of adjournment on the next date.A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar took note of the request of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jafri, that the matter be heard sometime in April as several advocates are busy in the Maratha reservation case being heard at present by a five-judge Constitution bench.However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Gujarat government, opposed the plea for adjournment and sought hearing of the case next week.    Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the SIT (Special Investigation Team) also opposed the letter for adjournment, and said the matter should be decided.  “Put this case for hearing on April 13. No request for adjournment will be entertained,” ordered the bench which also comprised Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari.The top court, in February last year, had fixed the case for hearing on April 14, 2020 saying the matter had been adjourned many times and would have to be heard some day.Prior to this, Jafri's counsel had told the apex court that a notice needed to be issued in the plea as it related to an alleged "larger conspiracy" from February 27, 2002 to May 2002.Ehsan Jafri was among the 68 people killed at Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad on February 28, 2002, a day after the S-6 Coach of the Sabarmati Express was burnt at Godhra killing 59 people and triggering riots in Gujarat.On February 8, 2012, the SIT filed a closure report giving a clean chit to Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was "no prosecutable evidence" against them.Zakia Jafri filed a petition in the apex court in 2018 challenging the Gujarat High Court's October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the decision of the SIT.The plea also maintained that after the SIT gave a clean chit in its closure report before a trial judge, the petitioner filed a protest which was dismissed by the magistrate without considering "substantiated merits".

16-03-2021||New Delhi||India saw air quality improve in 2020: Report||All Indian cities showed air quality improvements in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 impact compared to 2018, while 63 per cent saw improvements compared to 2019, said the 2020 World Air Quality Report on Tuesday that is based on PM2.5 data from 106 countries.In 2020, around 84 per cent of all monitored countries observed air quality improvements, largely due to global measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.Air quality improvements across major cities in 2020 compared to 2019 include Beijing (minus 11 per cent) Chicago (minus 13 per cent), Delhi (minus 15 per cent), London (minus 16 per cent), Paris (minus 17 per cent) and Seoul  (minus 16 per cent).However, India continues to feature prominently at the top of the most polluted cities ranking, with 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities globally.The report by IQAir said in 2020, 86 per cent of the cities in China experienced cleaner air than the previous year.Despite this, Chinese residents are still exposed to PM2.5 levels more than three times the World Health Organization (WHO) annual guidelines. Hotan in northwestern China ranks as the world's most polluted city, largely due to sandstorms exacerbated by climate change.Only 24 out of 106 monitored countries met the WHO annual guidelines for PM2.5 in 2020.The report says climate change continues to affect air quality. The year 2020 is tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record. Wildfires and sandstorms fueled by the warming climate led to extremely high pollution levels in California, South America, Siberia and Australia.South Asia is the most polluted region of the world with Bangladesh, India and Pakistan sharing 42 of the 50 most polluted cities worldwide.In 2020, about half of all European cities exceed the WHO's target for annual PM2.5 pollution. The highest levels of PM2.5 pollution was found in Eastern and Southern Europe, with Bosnia Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Bulgaria  taking the lead."The year 2020 brought an unexpected dip in air pollution. In 2021, we will likely see an increase in air pollution due to human activity, again," said Frank Hammes, CEO of IQAir."We hope this report will highlight that urgent action is both possible and necessary to combat air pollution, which remains the world's greatest environmental health threat." "While many cities recorded temporary improvements in air quality due to lockdowns, the health impact of burning fossil fuels remained severe. Unfortunately, Delhi continued to be the most polluted capital city in the world in  2020. To see real, long-term improvements in air quality, governments must prioritize clean energy sources such as wind and solar and promote low cost, carbon-neutral and accessible transport," said Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India."Many parts of the world experienced unprecedented, but short-lived, improvements in air quality in 2020, as restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused a steep drop in fossil fuel consumption," said Lauri Myllyvirta,  lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), who also contributed to the report."This improved air quality meant tens of thousands of avoided deaths from air pollution. By transitioning to clean energy and clean transport we can realize the same improvements in a sustained way." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-saw-air-quality-improve-in-2020-report-226016

Government transactions related to the treasury as well as business transactions were also impacted. United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions, had given a strike call for March 15 and 16.Members of UFBU include All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI).Others are the Indian National Bank Employees Federation (INBEF), Indian National Bank Officers Congress (INBOC), National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO).Unions on Monday said nearly 10 lakh staffers across the country have participated in the strike, terming it a "success".Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget speech for 2021-22 said the government will privatise two more public sector banks going forward.The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019 and has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years. As per the call, on Monday, employees and officers joined the strike and the strike was a “total success”. Normal banking services were affected because of the strike, C H Venkatachalam, General Secretary, AIBEA said. “Today (Tuesday) too, as per reports received by us from our unions in various states, the strike has been successful. Overwhelming majority of the bank branches remain closed and shutters are down," he added.He said the young employees have been at the forefront in the protest demonstrations which means that they have understood the dangers of privatisation. They have joined the banks after a very tough competition. They deserve job security which will be affected if banks are privatised. He said banks are in profit and there is no need to privatise them.All the public sector banks are running well and are earning operating profits, he noted.

After a complaint, an FIR has been registered against two accused persons under section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC."Significantly, the woman had accused her boyfriend of raping her on the promise of marriage last year.She had also complained to Rampur police that her lover's elder brother had sexually assaulted her when she had gone to meet her boyfriend.An FIR for rape was registered against both the accused persons in June 2020.The woman's family has alleged that Rampur police, influenced by the political background of the accused, had said that no evidence of rape was found and a final report was filed in the case in September last year.The family had challenged the final report in district court and a hearing in the matter is due next month.The woman's father alleged, "The accused had been sexually assaulting my daughter on the promise of marriage while his elder brother had also raped her. After this, an FIR was registered under various IPC sections, including rape. Since the matter is in court and the accused feared they may land up in jail, they played a trick with my daughter. They called her saying that the younger brother will marry her once she compromises in the case. She was murdered." Police, meanwhile, maintained that no evidence of rape was found in the case."The woman's family initially said that she killed herself. They later changed their statement and said she was given poison and killed by her boyfriend," the SP (City) said.He added, "Now, we have registered FIR under IPC section 302. Three teams have been formed. The accused will soon be arrested. The woman's body has been sent for post mortem." --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-woman-ends-life-by-consuming-poison-family-alleges-murder-225999

16-03-2021||United Nations||Humanitarian crisis, worsened by COVID-19, calls for relaxation of sanctions imposed on Syria: India||India has told the UN Security Council that the humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, calls for relaxation of sanctions imposed on Syria, saying the international community must act with a “sense of urgency” to help the Syrian people.India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said this on Monday while addressing the Security Council briefing on Syria.“The 10-year long Syrian conflict has brought untold suffering to the Syrian people. The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the situation, posing serious challenges to the fragile health infrastructure. There is an urgent need to increase humanitarian assistance to all Syrians throughout the country without discrimination, politicisation, and any preconditions,” Tirumurti said.He emphasised that the humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the pandemic, “calls for relaxation of sanctions imposed on Syria. The international community must act with a sense of urgency to help the Syrian people.” He voiced conviction that all efforts towards improving the humanitarian situation in Syria will positively impact the political track as well and called upon the wider UN system, in particular the World Health Organization and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to prioritise the vaccination programme in Syria, including through the COVAX initiative.Tirumurti described as “disheartening” that the conflict in Syria marks 10 years, peace and stability unfortunately remain elusive to the country and its people.The political transition in Syria facilitated by the UN is not the only process presently underway and the five rounds of meetings of the drafting body of the Syrian constitutional committee have resulted in very little progress. “External influence is also adversely impacting the process,” he said.“The situation on the ground does not present an optimistic picture either. It will be unrealistic to expect any dramatic outcomes in the near future, unless the international community takes decisive collective steps in the right direction,” he said, adding that if there is seriousness about achieving progress, there is need to have greater convergence of views and act to strengthen the hands of the Special Envoy Geir Pedersen.Constructive international diplomacy is the need of the hour to bridge existing divides by focusing on mutual and reciprocal steps, he said.In late December last year, UN human rights expert Alena Douhan had called on the US to remove unilateral sanctions against Syria, saying the sanctions imposed under the Caesar Act may “exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Syria, especially in the course of COVID-19 pandemic, and put the Syrian people at even greater risk of human rights violations.” The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the Caesar Act, contains the most wide-ranging US sanctions ever applied against Syria, a UN Human Rights statement had said.It added that the broad sweep of the US sanctions law that went into effect in June last year could target any foreigner helping in reconstruction of the conflict-ridden country, and even employees of foreign companies and humanitarian operators helping rebuild Syria.In remarks to the press following the briefing to the Council, Pedersen said the Syrian conflict has now lasted for the same period as the First World War and the Second World War and the Syrian people must feel that they are really trapped in an endless conflict.While there is a way forward, there is a need to find a way around the “you first” syndrome that has dominated much of the diplomacy around Syria for the last decade, he said.“Right now, there are what I call ‘demands on all sides' – but little movement on any side. And this dynamic has to change,” Pedersen said, adding that what is needed at the moment is to identify with realism and precision and implement in parallel mutual and reciprocal steps from Syrian and international players.“All players – including the Syrian government and opposition, and key international players – would need to be ready to identify not only what they realistically hope to achieve, but what they can put on the table,” he said.Tirumurti reiterated that delinking humanitarian and developmental work with progress on the political track will help in creating a conducive environment of trust and confidence.He further noted that the Syrian conflict and involvement of external actors has contributed to the growth of terrorism in Syria and in its neighbouring countries, an issue that has been reiterated in the latest report of the Secretary General on the threat posed by ISIL.“We express our serious concern with the increased presence and terrorist activity of ‘Hayat Tahrir al-Sham' and other affiliated terrorist groups that pose a threat to civilians inside and outside the Idlib de-escalation area,” he said.“India firmly believes that long-term security and stability in this region can only be achieved by preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. We also remain convinced that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict and reaffirm our commitment to advancing a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned UN-facilitated political process” in line with relevant UNSC resolution.India has extended developmental assistance and human resource development support to Syria regularly, including lines of credits for developmental projects and supply of medicine and food. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/humanitarian-crisis-worsened-by-covid-19-calls-for-relaxation-of-sanctions-imposed-on-syria-india-225975

16-03-2021||London||Boris Johnson to visit India in April-end to ‘unlock’ Indo-Pacific opportunities||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will visit India at the end of April on his first major international tour following the UK’s exit from the European Union, Downing Street has announced, as Britain seeks to “unlock” the opportunities in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.The announcement of the visit, which had been postponed from a planned Republic Day tour in January due to the escalating Covid crisis in the UK, comes as Johnson launches the conclusions of the UK government’s Integrated Review of defence, security, development and foreign policy – a post-Brexit policy vision that falls within a wider Global Britain agenda.A central foreign policy shift included in the review is a definitive tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region as the “geopolitical centre of the world”, which includes the UK applying for partner status of the ASEAN economic union – of which India is a sectoral dialogue partner.“This year the Queen Elizabeth Carrier will undertake its first operational deployment to the region alongside NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) allies, the UK is applying for partner status at the Association of South East Asian (ASEAN) nations and at the end of April the Prime Minister will travel to India on his first major international visit following our departure from the European Union (EU),” Downing Street said on Monday.The India visit, which Downing Street said would “unlock the opportunities in the region”, is widely expected to finalise a much-anticipated India-UK Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP) as a precursor to a free trade agreement (FTA) in the future.Lord Tariq Ahmad, the minister for South Asia in the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, is currently in India to add further momentum behind the ETP expected to be signed by Johnson and Prime Minister Narendra Modi when they meet next month.The Integrated Review, which has been conducted over the last year, is dubbed the most comprehensive articulation of foreign policy and national security approach published by a British government in decades.The 100-page document sets out a vision for 2030 and how the UK will use its international policy to achieve it.“The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and – most importantly – our people. So, I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people,” said Johnson.

Two goods trains chugged off on the track with usual speed while the old rail line was disconnected.The track is 4.8-km long and it has done away with four-level crossings in the city, thus reducing traffic jams. The foundation stone of the Rs 350-crore project was laid by Chief Minister Monohar Lal Khattar in March 2018, and it was scheduled to be completed in 18 months. However, the project missed several dealines and it took 36 months to become operational.“A team, led by the CRS, inspected the track from the safety angle and gave its nod for starting the operations after the successful trial of a goods train on Sunday evening. The first goods train from Gohana reached Rohtak at 23:32 pm on Sunday,” said a railway officer.Pradeep Ranjan, technical advisor of the project, said the old rail line had been disconnected. The old track would be replaced with a 34-ft wide road between Sector-6 and the railway station, he added.“The state government has approved Rs 16 crore for the road project, which will benefit residents of more than 30 nearby colonies. Tenders will soon be invited,” Ranjan added.Balbir Rathi, Traffic Inspector (Railways), said all goods and passenger trains would now run on the new track. Those found roaming or sitting on the track would be penalised,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nations-1st-elevated-rail-track-now-operational-in-rohtak-225689

For 2016-2020, Russian supplies made up 49 per cent of all Indian imports, making it the biggest supplier. France and Israel followed with 18 and 13 per cent, respectively.India’s arms imports from France increased by 709 per cent. This was mainly attributed to procurement of Rafale jets and associated missiles.At the global level, the US emerged as the biggest seller, accounting for 37 per cent of all sales, while Russia stood second with 20 per cent share. India ranked 24th among arms exporters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/33-cut-india-still-second-largest-arms-importer-225824

A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Election Commission of India to respond to the petition filed by the Delhi leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.Upadhyay was represented by senior advocate Maneka Guruswamy who wanted the top court to direct the Election Commission to restrict those candidates and political parties, whose election has been nullified, from taking part in fresh polls.Right to rejectThe right to reject and elect a new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. — Petitioner“The right to reject and elect a new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. If voters are dissatisfied with the background of the contesting candidate, they will opt NOTA to reject such candidate and elect a new candidate,” the PIL contended.Alleging that political parties choose candidates in a very undemocratic manner without consulting electors, the PIL contended that was why many a time people were totally discontented with candidates presented before them. “This problem can be solved by holding a fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA. In such a situation, the contesting candidates should be considered as rejected and not be allowed in the fresh election,” Upadhyay said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-nota-wins-can-election-be-nullified-sc-asks-centre-ec-225823

At present, the family court, district or a city civil court is competent to pass the adoption order and 1,000 adoption cases remain pending at any given time.The Bill also makes DMs in charge of vetting applications to set up childcare institutions and monitor them taking the charge away from district child protection officers. It introduces the need for qualifications for members of child welfare committees.

Particularly so when it is in a country where we have such a large diaspora,” Jaishankar said.Vaishnav alleged Sawant was targeted because of her parent’s Hindu faith. But the timeline shows she resigned a month back over three social media posts—a distasteful holocaust reference, a photo caption about her Malaysia trip that offended Chinese students and another that angered the LGBT community.Resigning within five days, she apologised for the posts and stated they were not malicious but insensitive given her young age when they were posted.But the matter flared up recently leading to cyber-clashes among the Hindutva and the ultra-liberal camps that coincided with criticism of New Delhi’s handling of farmers’ protests in the UK Parliament. Twitter briefly suspended her account and Samant and her backers argued that it was because of her Hindu faith. Vaishnav also brought up Prince Harry’s wife Meghan Markle’s accusations of racism by UK royals and said the two instances were not isolated. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-raise-oxford-racial-issue-with-uk-jaishankar-225788

16-03-2021||New Delhi||India’s import of arms decreases by 33 per cent, says SIPRI||India’s import of arms decreased by 33 per cent between 2011–15 and 2016–20 and Russia was the most affected supplier, according to a report released on Monday by Stockholm-based defence think-tank SIPRI.It said the drop in Indian arms imports seemed to have been the result of the country’s complex procurement processes combined with an attempt to reduce its dependence on Russian arms.In the last few years, India has taken a series of measures to boost domestic defence industry with an aim to reduce dependence on imported military platforms and hardware.In reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik said approval (Acceptance of Necessity) was given to 112 proposals between 2018-19 and 2020-21 (till December) worth around Rs 1.99 lakh crore under various categories of capital acquisition to promote the domestic defence manufacturing.The report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said, “Arms imports by India decreased by 33 per cent between 2011–15 and 2016–20. Russia was the most affected supplier, although India’s imports of US arms also fell, by 46 per cent.”      “The drop in Indian arms imports seems to have been mainly due to its complex procurement processes, combined with an attempt to reduce its dependence on Russian arms. India is planning large-scale arms imports in the coming years from several suppliers,” it said.The government has been majorly focusing on boosting domestic defence production and set a target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore (USD 25 billion) turnover in defence manufacturing by 2025.In May, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out a number of reform measures for the defence sector including making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons which won’t be imported.The SIPRI report said Russia and China both saw their arms exports falling. Arms exports by Russia, which accounted for 20 per cent of all exports of major arms in 2016–20, dropped by 22 per cent to roughly the same level as in 2006–10.“The bulk—around 90 per cent—of this decrease was attributable to a 53 per cent fall in its arms exports to India,” it said.“Russia substantially increased its arms transfers to China, Algeria and Egypt between 2011–15 and 2016–20, but this did not offset the large drop in its arms exports to India,” said Alexandra Kuimova, a researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme.The report said exports by China, the world’s fifth largest arms exporter in 2016–20, decreased by 7.8 per cent between 2011–15 and 2016–20. Chinese arms exports accounted for 5.2 per cent of total arms exports in 2016–20. Pakistan, Bangladesh and Algeria were the largest recipients of Chinese arms, it added.The SIPRI said the US remained the largest arms exporter, increasing its global share of arms exports from 32 to 37 per cent between 2011–15 and 2016–20, adding it supplied major arms to 96 states in 2016–20, far more than any other supplier.“Almost half (47 per cent) of US arms transfers went to the Middle East. Saudi Arabia alone accounted for 24 per cent of total US arms exports. The 15 per cent increase in US arms exports between 2011–15 and 2016–20 further widened the gap between the US and second largest arms exporter Russia,” the report noted.It said France increased its exports of major arms by 44 per cent and accounted for 8.2 percent of global arms exports in 2016–20. “India, Egypt and Qatar together received 59 per cent of French arms exports,” it said.

Hence, I am referring the matter to Delhi Legal Services Authority for award of additional compensation,” the judge further said. Additional Public Prosecutor A T Ansari, appearing for the police, sought death penalty for Ariz, allegedly associated with the terror outfit Indian Mujahideen, saying it was not just any killing but a murder of a law enforcement officer who was a defender of justice.Ansari said the case attracts exemplary punishment, which is capital punishment.He further said a police officer was killed while discharging his public duty.“Ariz along with others was carrying deadly weapons which clearly suggests that they were ready to kill anybody in any eventuality. They were the first to start fire without any provocation,” the public prosecutor said. He added that widespread concerns were raised after the incident regarding the safety of police officers and it instilled fear in the minds of the common people.Advocate M S Khan, appearing for Ariz, opposed the death penalty and said the incident was not premeditated.The court had said on March 8 that it was “duly proved that Ariz Khan and his associates caused murder of police official and fired gunshot on the police official”.A trial court had sentenced Indian Mujahideen terrorist Shahzad Ahmed in July 2013 to life imprisonment in connection with the case. His appeal against the verdict has been pending in the high court.Ariz Khan had fled from the spot and was declared proclaimed offender. He was arrested on February 14, 2018, and faced the trial.

16-03-2021||New Delhi||Nationwide strike impacts banking services of PSU banks on day one||Banking services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, cheque clearing and business transactions were impacted across the country on Monday, the day one of the PSU bank union's strike, against the proposed privatisation of two more state-owned lenders.United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions, had given a strike call for March 15 and 16, and claimed that about 10 lakh bank employees and officers of the banks will participate in the strike.In the Union Budget presented last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) as part of the government's disinvestment plan.All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOC) General Secretary Sowmya Dutta said the government policies are going to have ill effects on the economy as also it will be reflected in the upcoming polls in some states.He said nearly all the bank employees have taken part in the two-day strike except for top-level employees."All banking services are impacted from cash withdrawals to deposits, business transactions, loan process, cheque clearing, account opening and business transactions," he said.He said the striking employees have taken out rallies, wherever permitted, across the country, and given a sat-in and if the government does not listen to them they will go for an even bigger, indefinite strike like the one on the lines of ongoing farmers' agitation."We are connected with crores of population through our branches, we are educating our customers about the government's ill policies and how it is going to impact them," Dutta said.Through the Department of Financial Services, the bank unions have also conveyed to the Finance Minister to withdraw her statement from the floor of Parliament about privatisation of the state-owned banks, he added.All bank employees from the scale I, II and III had a 100 per cent participation across the banking sector in Monday's strike, said a bank official who is not authorised to speak to the media."We call them assistant managers, managers and senior managers. At this level, there is 100 per cent participation in the strike and 80-90 per cent branches are headed by them," the official said.The bigger branches headed by chief managers or AGMs are about 20 per cent, so even if these senior level employees are not taking part in the strike, they alone cannot run the bank, said the official cited above.Meanwhile, branches of private sector lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank are open as they are not part of the strike.The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019, and has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years.According to All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) general secretary CH Venkatachalam, services at branch level; cheque clearance; and government transactions have been affected.Members of UFBU include All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI).Others are the Indian National Bank Employees Federation (INBEF), Indian National Bank Officers Congress (INBOC), National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nationwide-strike-impacts-banking-services-of-psu-banks-on-day-one-225506
