Out of these, Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi are in Uttar Pradesh," he said.          The Chief Minister said parochialism and constricted mentality of certain sections deprived the country of its justifiable pride in history.People who are misguiding the public for their own benefit and betraying the country will not be spared.“People who are creating false propaganda about India for money will face the heat," said Adityanath.CM Yogi urged the people to not let go of the harmonious spirit of the nation by getting involved in petty communal disputes.

06-03-2021||New Delhi||Govt ready to amend new agri laws; opposition playing politics at cost of agri-economy: Tomar||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday said the government is ready to amend three new farm laws to respect the sentiments of protesting farmers, even as he attacked opposition parties for doing politics on this issue at the cost of agriculture economy and by hurting farmers’ interest.Addressing the 5th national convention of Agrivision here, the Union Minister said the government had held 11 rounds of talks with farmer unions and has even offered to amend these laws.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at Delhi borders for over three months, seeking a repeal of these three legislations and a legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP).Eleven rounds of talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions have, so far, remained deadlocked. The government has offered concessions, including suspension of the legislations for 12 to 18 months and setting up a joint panel to find solutions, but the unions have rejected.Tomar said the government had passed these three laws to boost investment in the farm sector and give freedom to farmers to sell their produce wherever they want and at price determined by them.The laws, which were passed by Parliament in September last year, would also enable to grow those crops that can fetch more prices in the market, he added.Referring to the ongoing farmers’ agitation, Tomar wondered how this agitation was going to benefit farmers.“Main ye manta hoon, loktantra mein asahmati ka apna sthan hai, virodh ka bhi apna sthan hai, matbhed ke bhi apne mahatva hai. Lekin kya virodh is keemat par kiya jaana chahiye, jo desh ka nuksan kare (There is a place for disagreement in democracy and so is for opposition and difference of opinion, but should there be any opposition that can harm the nation),” he said.No one was ready to talk on how these protests could be in the interest of farmers, the Minister said.Tomar regretted that the farmer unions, as well as the Opposition parties, had failed to point out faults in provisions of these laws.“Loktantra hai toh rajneeti karne ki swatantra sabko hai. Lekin kya kisan ko markar rajneeti ki jayegi, kisan ka ahit karke rajneeti ki jaayegi, desh ke krishi ki arthvybastha ko tilanjali dekar apne mansoobon ko pura kiya jayega, is par nischit roop se naye phidi ko vichar karne ki zaroorat hai (Everyone is free to have any political view in democracy but the new generation must think, should there be any politics by sacrificing farmers or by hurting farmers’ interest or at the cost of the agriculture economy),” he asked.Tomar stressed that the government’s proposal to amend laws did not mean that there were any deficiencies in these reform laws.He said the government had made a proposal to amend these laws as farmers continued to be the face of this ongoing protest.Stating that the Centre, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was committed to farmers’ welfare, Tomar said the government’s priority was to upheld farmers’ respect and therefore, it was ready to make amendments in the laws.The Minister said there were always an opposition to big reforms but people did accept changes if the intention and policies were correct.The Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws for two months and asked the committee to submit a report after consulting the stakeholders.The three laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

His body was given late Friday night after a post-mortem examination by Nepalese authorities, said Pilibhit Superintendent of Police Jai Prakash Yadav.He said Nepalese officials were terming it a case of smuggling, but locals maintain the firing took place following a minor argument.Though authorities had initially said Nepalese Police had fired at three people, police said late Friday that the incident in a market in Nepal’s Kanchanpur district involved four men, all in their 20s. They were from Bhumidan Raghavpuri Tilla Chaar village in Pilibhit and were working in a field near the border. While Govinda was killed, Gurmez Singh, 29, was injured and referred to Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University for treatment. Two of them, Resham, 22, and Pappu Singh, 27, managed to escape and were questioned at Pilibhit’s Kamlapuri guest house in the presence of senior officials.Nepalese officials had alleged that the four entered Nepal for the smuggling of narcotics. They also claimed to have recovered “brown sugar”, a pistol and a machine used to print fake currency notes from Govinda Singh. According to SP Yadav, the body was handed over to Indian authorities on Friday after a post-mortem examination in Nepal and the family performed the last rites at night itself. He said several rounds of talks were held with Nepalese authorities on Friday and the administration has sent its report to the state government.The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) has also sent a detailed report of the incident to the Union government, he said.Yadav refused to comment on the smuggling charge, saying it is part of the investigation.  However, family members of the deceased termed the Nepalese Police’s version of events unfounded and far from the truth.Gurdev Singh, Govinda Singh’s uncle, told officials in Pilibhit that the four men had been working in a field between Pillar No. 38 and 39 adjacent to the Nepal border for the past 12 days. He alleged that the firing happened on the Indian side of the border and the Nepalese Police took the body with them. Nepalese Police fired at them after Govinda had an argument with them while going for work, he said.While the first shot was fired in the air, the second one hit Govinda, who fell on the spot and a third hit Gurmez Singh, according to the uncle. Resham and Pappu Singh managed to escape, Govinda’s family claimed. Bareilly zone Additional Director General of Police Avinash Chandra said the statements of the family are being examined. Nepalese officials have also assured an impartial inquiry into the incident, he said.In view of the prevailing tension, patrolling has been intensified on the border.

06-03-2021||Vibha Sharma||Game on, it's Mamata versus Suvendu in Nandigram||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 6It is official now, the BJP has fielded former TMC leader and once close confidante of Mamata Banerjee, Suvendu Adhikari against the Chief Minister in high-stakes Nadigram Assembly constituency in poll-bound West Bengal.The party made the announcement in its first list of 57 candidates ahead of the Prime Minister's visit to the state.Mamata announced her candidature from Nandigram on Friday. "The BJP has announced Shri Suvendu Adhikari as its candidate from Nandigram. Mamata Banerjee will soon join the inglorious list of incumbent Chief Ministers to lose their own elections. Let the drums roll...," tweeted BJP IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya. Earlier, Malviya had claimed that Abbas Siddiqui-led CPIM-Congress alliance left the Nandigram seat for "their shadow partner, the TMC, but it will not help" Mamata win Nandigram."But even then, Pishi won’t be able to win Nandigram because there is a strong undercurrent in favour of the BJP! Such adjustments make BJP the only alternative in WB," he said.Malviya had on Friday said that Mamata "deserted" Bhowanipore, her traditional seat, in favour of Nandigram because she was “scared” and that she was also keeping “open” the option of Tollygunge.“A nervous Mamata Banerjee not only deserts her traditional seat of Bhowanipore but also keeps the option of contesting Tollygunge open. In the press she slips in, ‘I may contest too’ while announcing Arup Biswas’s name for the seat! Pishi is sensing defeat,” Malviya said.The BJP leaders also claim that Mamata took the decision to shift out of Bhowanipore because of the “large number of Hindus” there. “She knows she would have lost in Bhowanipore,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/game-on-its-mamata-versus-suvendu-in-nandigram-221517

The campaign was led by VHP with support of other constituents of the “Sangh Parivar”. The Trust had authorised VHP and the RSS regarding it.“Nine lakh volunteers were involved in the campaign,” Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai said here on Saturday.He said the computing of the funds till March 4 shows that it has crossed Rs 2,500 crore.He said the figure will further increase in the final tally. The computing process is still on.Responding to a question, he said the largest contribution for the temple construction is likely to be from the state of Rajasthan.“The details relating to the funds would be made public after they are audited,” Rai said.He added no roadblock was created during the campaign by the TMC government in West Bengal.Rai said that although the campaign date for collection of the funds is over, devotees who were left out may do so online.The volunteers and leaders involved in the campaign visited four lak villages and, in all, contacted 10 crore households across the country.He said thousands of members from Muslim faith also contributed funds for construction of the temple.When asked if Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was contacted to seek donations, Rai said: “There has to be some kind of relationship with someone to ask for something.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crowd-funding-for-ram-temple-crosses-rs-2-500-crore-221509
06-03-2021||Mumbai||Oppn questions probe into death of ‘owner’ of vehicle found near Ambani’s house||A day after the purported owner of the vehicle with explosives parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house was found dead, the opposition BJP said on Saturday that it appeared to be a murder and questioned the investigation by police.Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said the Sena-led Maharashtra government should not be put in the dock over the death of a prime witness, but finding out the truth was important for the coalition government’s image.Mansukh Hiren (46), who the police had said was the owner of the stolen Scorpio with gelatin sticks parked near Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai on February 25, was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on Friday morning.Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who belongs to the NCP, announced transfer of the probe to the Anti-Terrorism Squad on the same evening. He also said Hiren was not the owner of the SUV but was in its possession for carrying out some interior work.“It is wrong to politicise this death and put the government in the dock. There are doubts whether Mansukh Hiren’s death was a suicide or murder. He was an important witness in the case,” Raut said here.“The home department should unearth the truth at the earliest. It is important for the prestige and image of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government,” he said.On the transfer of the probe from the Mumbai crime branch to the ATS, the Sena leader said the BJP wanted the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe it, but it would not guarantee that the case would be solved immediately.“The home minister has handed over the case to the ATS, which is capable of solving it. Let us have faith in it,” Raut said.State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, on the other hand, questioned the “seriousness of the probe”.“Prima facie he was murdered. But I have my doubts about the seriousness of the investigation,” Patil told reporters.He also accused the state government of “promoting criminalisation of politics”.“In less than two years, several ministers have faced serious allegations but none of them stepped down, except the recent resignation of forest minister,” he said.Forest minister Sanjay Rathod resigned earlier this month after his name was linked to the death of a young woman in Pune.“It gives an assurance to criminals that they can join politics and get protected. The BJP protested strongly due to which the MVA government was forced to accept Rathod’s resignation,” Patil said.Ashish Shelar, another BJP leader, questioned the presence of an “encounter specialist” police officer at Hiren’s autopsy.“His presence is suspicious as he is neither part of Thane police nor the ATS. It gives impression that there is something this government wants to hide,” he said.Shelar also asked what prompted the home minister to hand over the probe to the ATS shortly after praising the job done by the Mumbai crime branch and Thane police.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Sandeep Deshpande demanded inquiry by a sitting judge.As per police, Hiren, who was in vehicle spare parts business, went missing after leaving his shop in Thane around 8.30 pm on Thursday.

06-03-2021||New Delhi||Centre asks states witnessing spike in COVID-19 cases to accelerate vaccination||The Centre has asked states and Union Territories witnessing surge in new COVID-19 cases and high active caseload to continue with the strategy of “test, track and treat” that had yielded rich dividends at the height of the pandemic and accelerate vaccination for priority population groups in districts reporting higher infections on mission mode.In a meeting held on Saturday, they have been asked to collaborate with private hospitals to open up vaccination time-table for a minimum of 15 days and maximum of 28 days at a time.They have been asked to increase the share of RT-PCR tests in districts dependent on high levels of antigen testing, refocus on surveillance and stringent containment of those areas in selected districts which are seeing cluster of cases and carry out an average close contact tracing of minimum of 20 persons per positive case.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and NITI Aayog Member (Health) Vinod K Paul on Saturday interacted with health secretaries and mission directors of the National Health Mission of Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and the Union Territories of Delhi and Chandigarh, the Union Health Ministry said.Also read: Centre rushes high-level teams to Punjab, Maharashtra amid rapid surge in Covid-19 cases“These states and UTs, in the recent past, have seen increased positivity and increased number of daily positive cases,” it underlined.They reviewed the ongoing public health measures of surveillance, containment and management of COVID cases in wake of the steep rise in daily new cases of COVID and the high number of active caseload being reported from these eight states and UTs, the Ministry said in its statement.In a detailed presentation, it was pointed out that nine districts in Delhi, 15 in Haryana, 10 in Andhra Pradesh, 10 in Odisha, nine in Himachal Pradesh, seven in Uttarakhand, two in Goa, one in Chandigarh continue to be of concern as these districts are seeing a decrease in total tests being conducted, low share of RT-PCR tests, increase in weekly positivity and low number of contact tracing of the COVID positive cases.“These together can pose a high risk of transmission to the neighbouring states and UTs. A granular analysis of the COVID-19 response in the districts was shared with the states and UTs for further action,” the statement said.States were specifically asked to continue with the effective strategy of ‘test, track & treat’ that had yielded rich dividends at the height of the pandemic, improve overall testing in districts reporting reduction in testing and increase share of RT-PCR tests in districts dependent on high levels of antigen testing.They have been asked to refocus on surveillance and stringent containment of those areas in selected districts which are seeing cluster of cases, carry out an average close contact tracing of minimum of 20 persons per positive case and focus on clinical management in districts reporting higher deaths, the ministry in the statement.They have been asked to actuate their health infrastructure to provide effective clinical management to all patients as a surge in cases also affects the case fatality rate in those districts.“Accelerate vaccination for priority population groups in districts reporting higher cases. Make optimal use of the available vaccine doses and focus on critical districts,” the Ministry said.They had been asked to collaborate with private hospitals to open up vaccination time-table for a minimum of 15 days and maximum of 28 days at a time and promote COVID-appropriate behaviour through communication and enforcement, the statement said.“Stress was laid on prompt isolation and on medical supervision of those active cases presently in home isolation for early identification of progressive deterioration of the disease. The states were also asked to actively watch out for super-spreading events and share their best practices in breaking the chain of transmission,” the statement stated.

06-03-2021||London||10 million doses from India won’t impact poor nations’ vaccine access, says UK||UK Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi has defended a shipment of 10 million doses of Covishield en route from India amid some concerns that it would impact supplies of COVID-19 vaccines for poorer nations.The minister in charge of overseeing the UK’s vaccination programme said the vaccine doses developed by the Serum Institute of India, in collaboration with Oxford/AstraZeneca, were always intended for Britain and that assurances have been sought that the delivery would not impact other supplies.“We, of course, sought assurances from AstraZeneca and from Serum that our doses will not impact their commitment to the low-income and middle-income countries of the world,” Zahawi told the Associated Press in an interview on Friday.“And they are making about 300 million doses available to low- and middle-income countries. You’ve seen those arrive in Accra in Ghana, last week and the Philippines this week… and Ivory Coast as well. And you’re going to see much more of that volume also going out,” he said.Non-governmental organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) had raised concerns that shipments from India would reduce supplies to developing countries.The minister insisted this was not the case and that supplies around the world would also be deployed through the United Nations backed COVAX system.Britain has acquired the rights to around 457 million doses of various vaccines, estimated at three times the total needed to fully vaccinate everyone in the country.“While some of the leftover doses may be offered through bilateral relationships, the bulk of it will be offered through COVAX,” Zahawi said.Meanwhile, in an update from Downing Street on Friday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that as of midnight on Thursday, a total of 21.3 million people have been vaccinated in the UK — which is two fifths of the entire adult population of the country.The government has set a July-end target to vaccinate all adults with at least one of two-dose vaccines.“We’re on course to hit our target of offering a first dose to everyone who’s 50 or over, or part of an at-risk group, by April 15. And all adults by the end of July," said Hancock.The minister also confirmed that coronavirus cases in the UK were “falling steadily” and that the country was headed in the “right direction” with the pandemic.The average daily number of cases is now 6,685 — the lowest since late September 2020 and the weekly case rate across the UK is now 84 per 100,000.“The vaccine roll-out has allowed us to set out our roadmap for how we’ll carefully lift some of the restrictions that we’ve all endured for far too long,” added Hancock.It comes as the UK begins its first phase of lifting strict lockdown restrictions with the re-opening of schools from Monday. The coronavirus, in the UK, has so far killed 124,495 people, along with over 4.2 million confirmed cases.

06-03-2021||Chennai||Row over saffron, ash smeared on Periyar statue||The BJP and Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) leadership are raising allegations and counter allegations over the desecration of the statue of Periyar EV Ramaswamy in front of Sirkazhi DSP office, which was found smeared with saffron and ash on its forehead, on Saturday morning.“The BJP and RSS combine is responsible for the desecration of the statue of EVR Periyar and we will not take this by lying low. Will give a fitting response to them,” Myladuthurai unit president of DK, MR Maniyan told IANS.Erode Venkita Ramaswamy Nairkar Periyar or EVR Periyar was a leading light in the rationalist movement of Tamil Nadu and had come out against all Brahminical rituals.The smearing of saffron and ash on his statue is considered an insult to him by his followers and sympathisers.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership has, however, distanced itself from the issue. BJP leader Velmurugan, who is in-charge of Myladuthurai and Sirkazhi areas, told IANS: “The BJP has no need to desecrate the statue of EVR and anyone who has done this has cheap intentions which the BJP will never do”.“We are a political party with nationalist beliefs and if we are opposing an ideology, we will do it in the open as we always do. There is no need to smear the statue of a person with saffron and ash to stamp our ideology. These are all gimmicks during election time to which we don’t subscribe.” Police have not taken any chances and are on alert in the state.”DSP of Sirkazhi, S. Mahendraraj told IANS: “The situation is under control and there is no issue at present. Police is on alert and we will find out the real culprits behind this”.In Tamil Nadu, the Dravidar Kazhagam is a social movement founded by EVR Periyar and he has a cult status among his followers. The police and home department do not want any major issues cropping up following the smearing of saffron and ash on the forehead of his statue. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/row-over-saffron-ash-smeared-on-periyar-statue-221496
06-03-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand tragedy: Heavy rains, rise in overall temperature in 4 decades could have led to rock collapse||Heavy precipitation in the Chamoli region from February 4-6 and an overall rise in temperature in Uttarakhand in the last four decades could have led to the rock collapse, which triggered the deadly flash floods in the state last month, according to a study by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.The report by Kathmandu-based ICIMOD, which was released on Friday, found that a crack had formed prior to the incident at the site where the rock detachment led to a rockslide from the Raunti peak.The rockslide brought along with it mounds of earth and snow, which could have triggered the flash floods. With a straight slide line of 1.6 km (5500 to 3900 masl), the kinetic energy during the fall generated enough heat to melt the ice.As the debris moved downstream in the Rishiganga river, it pushed running river water ahead of it, including water from small ponding structures along the river path.So far 72 bodies and 30 human body parts have been recovered from different places in the avalanche-hit areas, out of which 41 bodies have been identified. As many as 132 persons are still missing.The ICIMOD is a regional organisation that works on different aspects in the Himalayan-Hindukush region. It has eight members—India, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.At the same headwall of the Raunthi peak, a large ice avalanche was previously released somewhere between 19 September and 9 October 2016, which deposited ice and more bedrock in the valley below, the report states.“The resulting destabilisation of the rock due to the lack of ice cover (glacial debuttressing, stress-release fracturing), and increased exposure to solar radiation and hence an increased freeze thaw cycle, in combination with a large snowfall event preceding the event of February 7, 2021 and rapid melt water production, may have favoured the fracturing of rock,” the report states.“This can, however, not explain the depth of the fracture (150 metres), which must have evolved over a longer period of time,” the report states.The ICIMOD report further states that a strong western disturbance passed across Kashmir and northwest India from February 4-6. It was fully charged with convective instability that may have contributed to the heavy precipitation. The Uttarakhand tragedy occurred on February 7.“Numerical simulation of some of the attributes have been carried out which depict strong evidence of heavy precipitation contributing to high flows downstream,” it said.The numerical simulation on February 4 shows heavy precipitation over the region. The western disturbance travelled with relatively slower speed and its stagnancy produced concentrated precipitation, the report states.“Precipitation data derived from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission suggests that there were continuous precipitation events from February 3-5 which resulted in approximately 58 mm of cumulative precipitation. Most of the precipitation in the high altitude areas of Chamoli would have occurred as snowfall,” it states.The temperatures are also rising in Uttarakhand, the report states, saying maximum temperature in the Chamoli area has increased at the rate of 0.032 degrees C per year between 1980 and 2018.Furthermore, January 2021 was the warmest January on record in Uttarakhand for six decades, the report states.“While a hazard event like the flood at Chamoli cannot be directly attributed to climatic changes, the increased thaw-freeze cycle of permafrost could have partially contributed to the event,” it states.A report by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) also stated that the collapse of a massive rock, which brought down a large amount of earth and snow, may have triggered the flash floods.The debris also blocked the mouth of a stream in the upper reaches of the Rishiganga river. This led to formation of a glacial lake which is being monitored continuously. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-tragedy-heavy-rains-rise-in-overall-temperature-in-4-decades-could-have-led-to-rock-collapse-221493
06-03-2021||Lucknow||Government razes illegal structure built by Mukhtar Ansari’s associate||The Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday razed an illegal structure built by a person named Shahid,  said to be a close associate of  Mukhtar Ansari, strongman MLA from Mau in the heart of state capital Lucknow.The Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) team demolished the fourth floor of Rani Saltanat Plaza located next to Sahu Cinema in Lucknow’s Hazratganj district. All the 10 illegal shops on the fourth floor of the plaza were demolished. A big police contingent was present during the operation.The LDA had issued a notice nearly a month ago to demolish this illegal plaza.Lucknow District Magistrate and LDA Vice-Chairman, Abhishek Prakash, said Mukhtar Ansari is not directly linked to this matter but this building has been found to belong to one of his close aides.Action is being taken against the plaza in zone 6 under the leadership of Ritu Suhas, LDA Joint Secretary. The action which started on Saturday morning continues even after five hours. The shops were built with glass and marble stones in the illegally built three-storeyed plaza.The plaza built next to Hazratganj Gandhi Ashram allegedly belongs to Rani Sultanate. Illegal construction is razed down next to the Authority’s zone 6 of Hazratganj Gandhi Ashram.Joint Secretary Ritu Suhas, Executive Engineer Kamaljeet, Interior Engineer Bharat Pandey, Interior Engineer Nityanand Chaubey and Assistant Engineer N.S. Shakya oversaw the demolition.On the instructions of District Magistrate (DM) Abhishek Prakash, all the 10 illegal shops built in the fourth floor of the plaza were demolished. This entire building is built over nearly five square feet. Engineers pointed out that the fourth floor was built opposite the map of the site.Notice has already been given earlier, but neither the complex owner followed the same policy nor broke the illegal construction himself. Therefore, the Lucknow Development Authority has taken the requisite action. The DM said the shops would be demolished first and then the side walls razed. Finally the roof was demolished as well. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-razes-illegal-structure-built-by-mukhtar-ansaris-associate-221491

06-03-2021||Chandigarh||New device to detect effect of alcohol on red blood cells may help understand drinking-related disorders||Scientists have developed a platform to detect the effect of prolonged exposure of red blood cells (RBC) to alcohol through high-resolution measurements of their size.The high-resolution platform that shows the reduction in size of RBCs on alcohol exposure can be tuned for a point-of-care screening of multiple conditions that alter the size and count of RBCs in blood.Although it is known that alcohol affects RBCs, the exact physiological changes are very subtle and difficult to measure. In order to overcome this challenge, scientists from the Raman Research Institute (RRI), have developed a custom-made electro-fluidic platform that can detect the change by measuring the cell size in enhanced resolution.Cell volume changes are an important biomarker for multiple diseases, especially blood-related conditions.Accurate measurement of volume changes of RBCs has applications in the detection as well as mechanistic studies of diseases such as sickle cell anaemia and malaria.Similarly, small volume changes of RBCs could also be indicators of malnutrition in a cell. Results of the study may also be used to explain the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of RBC under alcohol exposure leading to blurred vision, muscular in coordination, and altered mental states from alcohol abuse, the Ministry of Science and Technology announced on Saturday.The device made by the RRI team, led by Professor Gautam Soni, relies on pulse sensing principle. The team first developed techniques for making tiny micron (1/1000th of a millimetre) sized holes or micro-pores at the tip of a glass capillary with careful fabrication, flame polishing, and image verification.Cells passing through the pore created very tiny electrical pulses, which give direct and most sensitive information of cell count and volume.“Our lab had been working on building nano-fluidic single-molecule detectors for the past few years. We found that some of the ideas used in the nano-fluidic field may also be used in micro-fluidics in general and cell-biology in particular. We were pleasantly surprised with the reproducibility and resolution of our devices,” Professor Soni said.With this work, the RRI team envisages that the high-resolution platform can be tuned for a point-of-care screening of several other blood-related conditions.The study has also been published in ACS Sensors journal of the American Chemical Society.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-device-to-detect-effect-of-alcohol-on-red-blood-cells%C2%A0may-help-understand-drinking-related-disorders-221488

The letter listed details for four police, aged between 22 and 25 years, including a female officer.“In order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries, you are kindly requested to detain eight Myanmar police personnel who had arrived to Indian territories and hand-over to Myanmar,” the letter said.India’s Home Ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. India’s Foreign Ministry responded to a request for comment by referring to a statement given at a media briefing on Friday which said the ministry was still “ascertaining the facts”.

After losing the Lok Sabha election in 2019, he was sent to the Rajya Sabha by the party.With the BJP being successful in wooing over a number of TMC leaders to its fold, the saffron party has said that this underscores an increasing unease in its rival camp and is a pointer to its "decisive" victory in the assembly polls to be held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29.

Annadaatas demand their rights, government commits atrocities."    The Congress leader has been supporting the farmers' protest against the three central farm laws and has attacked the government over the legislations on several occasions.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the MSP and the mandi system. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also assured farmers that the MSP would continue.Farmer leaders have already made it clear that they would not settle for anything less than the repeal of the new farm laws.

06-03-2021||Chandigarh/Delhi||Was just a trial, says Rakesh Tikait as farmers' blockade of KMP Expressway ends||As farmers' blockade of the six-lane Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway came to an end on Saturday evening, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait warned of intensifying such measures unless the Centre heeded to their demands of repealing the controversial agriculture laws.  "Like Delhi borders, KMP can also be blocked completely. Today was a trial for five hours," he said. Farmers blocked some parts of the highway as a mark of 100 days of their protest at Delhi's borders on Sunday.  The road blockade began at 11 am and continued till 4 pm.Farmers have pitched tents at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, since November in an attempt to pressure the central government into repealing three laws ---the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The protesters have held several rounds of talks with the central government with no headway. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a joint front of 32 farmers' unions that have been spearheading the protests, had called a 5-hour blockade of the 136-km Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway,  also known as the western peripheral Expressway, on Saturday. Protesters said they would only allow emergency vehicles to pass during those five hours. Released from Sonepat jail, Dalit activist Shiv Kumar says was thrashed by cops dailyThe 53-km Manesar-Palwal section was inaugurated by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari in 2016 and the 83-km Kundli-Manesar section was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018.Won’t hesitate to take produce to Parliament: BKU leader Rakesh TikaitFarmers holding black flags and wearing black armbands and some women protesters with black ‘dupattas’ shouted slogans against the BJP-led government for not acceding to their demands.Protesters in Sonipat and Jhajjar districts and some other places brought their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles and parked them in the middle of the KMP Expressway in some stretches.The Haryana Police had made arrangements for traffic diversions and deployed adequate personnel.Protesting farmers squatted on the expressway and criticised the Narendra Modi government for not withdrawing the farm legislation, which they called “black laws”.“Our agitation against the three farm laws will continue unless the Centre withdraws these laws. We will not step back,” said a protester in Sonipat.Farmers held a protest at the KMP Expressway near Mandothi village in Jhajjar district. Some people from nearby villages joined them.“We are holding our protest in a peaceful manner,” said a farmer, adding that they were also observing “black day” on Saturday.Protesting farmers said the government should withdraw these laws.Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, while addressing a gathering on the KMP Expressway, asked the Modi government to withdraw these laws.This agitation will certainly put pressure on the central government, he said.Farmers claimed that their five-hour protest remained peaceful.Sonipat Superintendent of Police Jashandeep Singh Randhawa said arrangements were made for traffic diversions.Heavy vehicles were diverted from Panipat and others from Ganaur to Delhi, said officials.Traffic was also diverted from Murthal via Sonipat city to Narela and Bawana and from Bahadurgarh to Baghpat, they said.Officials said traffic resumed at KMP expressway after famers lifted their blockade at 4 pm.In Palwal district also, farmers staged a ‘dharna’.At some places in Haryana, farmers even put up black flags atop roof of their houses as a mark of their protest against the government for not withdrawing the farm laws.Also read:The KMP Expressway was built to decongest the ever-busy roads of Delhi, especially by reducing the number of trucks entering the national capital, thus helping to curb pollution.It provides a high-speed link between northern and southern Haryana districts and gives an uninterrupted high-speed link for traffic, especially commercial traffic, from Haryana to neighbouring states.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the three laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.What next?As plains of North India brace for scorching summers and the harvesting season begins, farmers made it clear that they would not turn back until their demands are met.“After completing 100 days of an unparalleled sit-in at the Delhi’ borders, unions will unveil the next agenda and programme for coming days on March 11,” Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU (Dakaunada), said. The aim is to expand the movement to other parts of the country, including poll-bound West Bengal and, also States like Madhya Pradesh Karnataka and Odisha, added BKU general secretary Yudhvir Singh.Senior leaders say despite “many hurdles posed by the government and its agencies, the movement is going strong and is set to become bigger”. However, the underlying message for BJP’s political rivals is that this does not mean all support for them.  Patiala said the organisations will coordinate with BJP’s rival parties to make this clear to them.“We are apolitical, we want to make it clear to the Opposition parties as well,” he said. Rajewal said the protest is a “symbolic” and will become “bigger”.“We are ready for talks if government invites us (farmer leaders). But our demand remains the same. We want the withdrawal of the three farm laws. We will not accept the modification in the laws,” said Rajewal, president of BKU Rajewal,  who has been leading the talks of farmer unions with the central government.    Unions are also planning meetings, panchayats and mahapanchayats in other states and other areas, but at a distance from the current dharna sites at the Delhi borders. Yudhvir Singh said the movement has got tremendous support from across the country and it is now timefor farmers in other states like Odisha and Karnataka to register it physically.“For 100 days farmers have been camping at the Delhi borders in bitter cold, many have also died. But the government’s attitude has not just been disappointing but also shameful. We have no other option but to take the movement to other states and ensure our physical presence there. We will do whatever it takes to show our ‘nararzgi’ (anger),” he said. Singh said the movement has got a very good response from Rajasthan and they are considering a panchayat in Jaipur on the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh.“We will hold meetings/panchayats in Bengal on March 12, 13, and 14, Madhya Pradesh on March 14 and 15, Odisha on March 19, and Karnataka on March 20, 21, and 22. The movement is no longer limited to dharnas. If we want, we can collect a huge crowd on Delhi borders in one hour, but that is not the only aim now,” he said. — With agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/was-just-a-trial-says-rakesh-tikait-as-farmers-blockade-of-kmp-expressway-ends-221437

06-03-2021||New Delhi||‘Raided in 2013 too’: Nirmala Sitharaman on Taapsee Pannu, Anurag Kashyap I-T raids||In comments seen as defending income tax raids on Bollywood actor Taapsee Pannu and filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the same persons were raided in 2013 as well, but no issue was made out then as it is being done now.Refusing to comment on individual cases, she said it is in the national interest to know if some evasion is happening.“First of all, I am not commenting on any A or B individual. (But) since the names were taken, (I want to say) the very same names were raided in 2013,” she said in an interaction with journalists at IWPC (Indian Women’s Press Corps).It “wasn’t an issue (in 2013). It’s an issue now,” she said.She, however, did not talk about the outcome of the 2013 raids and if any follow-up action was taken in the last seven years.The Income Tax Department on March 3 began raids on the homes and offices of Pannu and Kashyap as well as his partners, who launched the now-shuttered production house Phantom Films.Also read:The searches, part of a tax evasion probe against Phantom Films, carried out across 30 locations in Mumbai and Pune, also covered Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhasish Sarkar and some executives of celebrity and talent management companies KWAN and Exceed.Asked to comment on the raids, Sitharaman spoke of the 2013 raids not being an issue, and they suddenly become one now.“Answer it for the hypocrisy or answer it, saying from then this is happening till now, what’s the matter (with now),” she said.“In the national interest, do we want to know if there is some evasion happening.          Pannu and Kashyap are both known to be outspoken in their views on a range of issues. “I don’t know. I am not commenting on a particular case. But if that relates to particular names I want to ask - should we raise questions whether there was a serious omission and commission or should we raise a question about ‘oh it’s happening now’?” Sitharaman said.“Please look back. It happened in 2013.”The tax department in a statement on Thursday stated that search and survey operations were carried out in Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Hyderabad.“During the search, evidence of huge suppression of income by the leading film production house compared to the actual box office collections has been unearthed,” it had said, referring to Kashyap’s venture. “The company officials have not been able to explain the discrepancy of around Rs 300 crore.”“Evidence related to manipulation and under-valuation of share transactions of the production house amongst the film directors and shareholders, having tax implication of about Rs 350 crore has been found and is being further investigated,” it had said, adding “evidence” of cash receipts by the actor amounting to Rs 5 crore had been recovered.Tax department sources said some inter-linked transactions between the entities searched are under the scanner of the department. The raids, they added, are aimed at gathering more evidence to further probe tax evasion allegations against them.Founded in 2011, Phantom Films produced films such as “Lootera”, “Queen”, “Ugly”, “NH 10”, “Masaan” and “Udta Punjab”. However, it was disbanded seven years later. Kashyap later launched a new production company called Good Bad Films. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raided-in-2013-too-nirmala-sitharaman-on-taapsee-pannu-anurag-kashyap-i-t-raids-221433
06-03-2021||Bengaluru||Multilayer masks most effective at preventing aerosol generation||Multilayer masks are most effective at preventing aerosol generation, says a new study conducted by a team led by researchers at Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc).The study was carried out in collaboration with scientists in UC San Diego and University of Toronto Engineering.According to IISc, when a person coughs, large droplets (>200 microns) hit the inner surface of a mask at a high speed, penetrate the mask fabric and break up or “atomise” into smaller droplets, which have a greater chance of aerosolisation and thereby carrying viruses like SARS-CoV-2 with them.Using a high-speed camera, the team closely tracked individual cough-like droplets impinging on single, double and multi-layered masks, and noted the size distribution of the “daughter” droplets generated after penetration through the mask fabric, an IISc statement said on Saturday.For single and double-layered masks, most of these atomised daughter droplets were found to be smaller than 100 microns, with the potential to become aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for a long time and potentially cause infection, the study said.“You are protected, but others around you may not be,” says Saptarshi Basu, Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and senior author of the study published in ‘Science Advances’.Triple-layered masks? Even those made of cloth? And N95 masks were found to successfully prevent atomisation, and therefore offered the best protection.The researchers, however, clarify that when such masks are unavailable, even single-layered masks may offer some protection, and hence must be used wherever mandated by health officials.Face masks can significantly reduce virus transmission by blocking both large droplets and aerosols, but their efficiency varies with the type of material, pore size and number of layers.Previous studies have looked at how these droplets “leak” from the sides of masks, but not at how the mask itself can aid in secondary atomisation into smaller droplets.“Most studies also dont look at what is going on at the individual droplet level and how aerosols can be generated,” Basu adds.To mimic a human cough, the team used a custom droplet dispenser to pressurise a surrogate cough liquid (water, salt with mucin, and a phospholipid) and eject single droplets onto the mask.“The pressurisation increases the velocity of the droplet and the [nozzle] opening time determines the size,” explains Shubham Sharma, a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and first author of the study. “Using this, we could generate droplets ranging from 200 microns to 1.2 mm in size.”The team used a pulsed laser to cast shadows of the droplets, and a camera and zoom lens to capture images at high speeds (20,000 frames per second). Apart from surgical masks, some locally sourced cloth masks were also tested.The team also investigated the effects of varying the speed at which the droplet is ejected and the impingement angle.They found that single-layered masks could only block 30 per cent of the initial droplet volume from escaping.Double-layered masks were better (about 91 per cent was blocked), but more than a quarter of the daughter droplets that were generated were in the size range of aerosols.Droplet transmission and generation was either negligible or zero for triple-layered and N95 masks.The team also dispersed fluorescent nanoparticles of the same size as the virus in the artificial cough droplets to show how these particles can get entrapped in the mask fibres, underscoring the importance of disposing the masks after use.The researchers hope to pursue further studies using a full-scale patient simulator that would also allow tracking multiple droplets.“Studies are also going on to propose more robust models to understand how this atomisation is actually taking place,” says Basu. “This is a problem not just for COVID-19, but for similar respiratory diseases in the future as well.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/multilayer-masks-most-effective-at-preventing-aerosol-generation-221432

06-03-2021||Washington||Biden urged not to accept proposal on Covid by India and South Africa at WTO||Four top Republican Senators on Friday urged US President Joe Biden not to accept a proposal by India and South Africa to the World Trade Organisation to waive anti-Covid vaccine patents to boost its supply.“India, South Africa and other countries are presenting a proposal at the World Trade Organisation to waive all intellectual property rights for any innovation related to Covid,” the group of four Republican Senators wrote in a letter to Biden.“The proponents of this scheme argue that if we just destroy the intellectual property developed by American companies, we will suddenly have more manufacturers producing Covid vaccines,” they said.In the letter, Senators Mike Lee, Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst and Todd Young urged Biden to reject the upcoming proposal at the WTO.“But the opposite is true. By destroying the intellectual property of every American company that has worked on Covid vaccines and treatments, we would be ending the progress -- started under Operation Warp Speed -- that led to the fastest development of life-saving vaccines in history,” the Senators wrote.They alleged that some countries believed that they would benefit from seizing America’s intellectual property.“But this is a mistake,” they said.“Waiving all rights to intellectual property would end the innovation pipeline and stop the development of new vaccines or boosters to address variants in the virus. It also wouldn’t increase the supply of vaccines because of the tremendous time and resources needed to build new manufacturing plants and acquire the knowhow to produce these complex medicines,” they said.“Even if the waiver may temporarily result in a few copycats attempting to produce what American companies developed, it would introduce major quality control problems,” the Senators said.“As a global leader and a force for good, we can do a lot to help other countries overcome the virus. But destroying our rights to intellectual property wouldn’t advance our mission of fighting the virus -- it would make the problem worse, for America and for the world,” they wrote.

06-03-2021||Mexico City||Mexico experts recommend approving Indian Covid vaccine||A technical committee of experts in Mexico gave a unanimous favourable opinion on Friday on approving the Covaxin vaccine made by the Indian pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech.The report by the committee for new molecules will be sent to the federal medical safety commission’s approval board, which usually follows such recommendations.The interim results from the vaccine manufacturer’s late stage trials shows its Covid vaccine to be about 81 per cent effective in preventing illness from the coronavirus.The Bharat Biotech vaccine was controversially approved by India in January without waiting for trials to confirm that the vaccine was effective. Since then 1.3 million of doses have been administered in India.Health-care workers have been reticent to take the shots and health experts are concerned the regulatory shortcut has amplified vaccine hesitancy. Bharat Biotech has already signed an agreement with Brazil to supply 20 million doses of the vaccine by September.It will be the fifth vaccine approved for use in Mexico, which has received relatively small amounts of each. Mexico has administered only about 2.7 million doses of all vaccines, a tiny amount given the country’s population of 126 million.Mexico reported 712 more confirmed deaths on Friday, bringing the total to almost 190,000. However, Mexico does so little testing that government excess-death figures suggest the real toll was well above 220,000 at the start of January, the last date for which such figures are available. There were almost 6,800 more confirmed cases on Friday, bringing the total to over 2.1 million.

If confirmed, I will continue to monitor the situation closely as both parties work towards a peaceful resolution,” he said, in his written answers to the questions for his confirmation hearing.The past decade has seen promising trends in the US-India defence trade and technology relationship, he said, adding that if confirmed, he would work to sustain these trends, including through a focus on major procurements and high-end technology.Responding to a question on India, Kahl said if confirmed, he would continue to operationalise India’s status as a “Major Defence Partner” by positioning the US and Indian militaries to cooperate more closely to advance shared interests in the Indo-Pacific region.“To this end, I would support efforts to strengthen interoperability, expand bilateral and multilateral security cooperation across the region and deepen defence trade and technology sharing,” he said.He added that he would also leverage regular senior-level bilateral and multilateral engagements with likeminded partners to bolster the relationship.

However, Abbas Siddiqui, the Islamic cleric who floated the ISF, has expressed desire for putting up a candidate of his outfit from the seat.Nandigram is in the spotlight because CM Mamata Banrerjee will contest from the seat. Muslim vote is an important component in Nandigram and the ISF’s entry can ultimately help the cause of the BJP candidate from the seat.While announcing candidates for the 60 seats going to polls in the first two phases (30 seats in each phase) in the state, Biman Bose, CPI(M) leader and convener of the Morcha, said a candidate for Nandigram, where polling would take place in the second phase on April 1, would be announced later.“Nandigram has become heavyweight constituency,” Bose said. Egra, Kashipur and Garbeta (first phase) and Pingla and Daspur (second phase) are the other constituencies that the Morcha has not allocated to any of its members yet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sanyukta-morcha-yet-to-take-call-on-whom-to-pit-against-mamata-221078

The External Affairs Minister had emphasised that with the completion of disengagement in the Pangong Lake area, the two sides should now move quickly to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at the weekly media briefing.Interestingly, these attempts by India and China to cool tensions on their land border come amid concerted attempts by the Biden administration to keep afloat the Quad grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia aimed at containing China in the South China Sea.Close on the heels of a Quad Foreign Ministers’ interaction on February 18, US President Joe Biden has proposed a step up in the engagement through a virtual summit this month with PMs Narendra Modi, Yoshihide Suga (Japan) and Scott Morrison (Australia).Srivastava went on to add that the Indian expectation was that the Chinese side would work, both through the WMCC and Senior Commanders’ meetings, to effect a speedy disengagement. The Senior Military Commanders, in their last meeting held on February 20, had also noted that the disengagement in the Pangong Lake area provided a good basis for the resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in the Western Sector.India maintains that maintenance of peace and tranquility along the LAC was essential for the development of bilateral relations and that a prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side. The two ministers have also agreed to establish a hotline, details of which will be worked out subsequently through diplomatic channels.India asks China for speedy disengagement on LACPrez Biden looks forward to summit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-attempt-to-cool-tension-as-us-plans-quad-meet-221251

Suvendu Adhikari, who won the seat in 2016 as TMC nominee, had switched to the BJP shortly before and the CM appeared keen to teach him a lesson.The BJP responded to Mamata’s announcement by resorting to propaganda saying Banerjee, unsure about winning from Nandigram, would also contest simultaneously from Bhabanipur.With the TMC supremo on Friday ruling out contesting from any other constituency but Nandigram, the stage is set for a fierce contest between her and Adhikari, who is expected to be the BJP candidate. The agitation in Nandigram over land acquisition in the late 2000s catapulted Banerjee to power in 2011, ending 34 years of the Left rule. The TMC has announced names for 291 of the total 294 constituencies.

The body was found on the banks of the creek along the Mumbra Reti Bunder road in the morning, a senior official of Thane Police said.Mansukh’s Scorpio with 20 gelatin sticks inside was found near ‘Antilia’, Ambani’s multi-storey residence in South Mumbai, on February 25. Police had said it had been stolen from Airoli-Mulund Bridge on February 18.Crime Branch of Mumbai police had recorded Mansukh’s statement in the case. Mansukh, who was in vehicle spare parts business, had said he had lodged a police complaint after the SUV was stolen.On Friday his family members approached Naupada Police Station in Thane saying he had gone missing.An accidental death report has been registered and probe is on, the Thane police official said.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said the death of a prime witness showed that something was fishy. “I reiterate the demand that the case be handed over to the NIA,” the BJP leader said.Earlier, Fadnavis raised the issue in the state Assembly, seeking probe by the National Investigation Agency.Home Minister Deshmukh said Mansukh’s body bore no injury marks. Autopsy report was awaited, and Maharashtra Police were perfectly capable of investigating the case, he said, adding that the state ATS will now probe it.The home minister also said that the original owner of the SUV had handed it over to Mansukh for some interior work.Fadnavis said Deshmukh had not been briefed properly about the case, as Mansukh had told the police that he was the owner.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said it is not necessary that the person told the truth. “Let the police probe the matter. Give them some time and have faith in them,” Parab said, adding that the NIA was already conducting a parallel probe.Speaking to reporters later, Deshmukh reiterated that Mansukh was not the vehicle’s owner but he was in its possession for some time.A Mumbai crime branch official, meanwhile, said that Mansukh had complained to the police that some local police officials and journalists were harassing him for the last few days.He had written letters to police commissioners of Thane and Mumbai where he also mentioned that he was disturbed and under stress due to this harassment, the official claimed.
