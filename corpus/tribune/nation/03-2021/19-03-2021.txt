In another incident, a coach of the Dehradun-bound Shatabdi Express caught fire in a suspected case of short circuit on March 13 and barely six days later, fire broke out in the engine of a static goods train at the Ranchi station on Friday."Safety remains the focus area of Railway operations and no one should let the guard down on that front. A thorough review and rechecking of all safety measures in the running of trains needs to be taken up by all concerned," the minister said at a review meeting on "safety measures", according to a statement issued by the railway ministry.The meeting was attended by all board members and general managers of the zonal railways.While reviewing the safety performance, Goyal advised the officials to focus on remedial measures for safety hazards like fire and ensuring alertness for signals and crossings, the statement said.He asked the officers to focus on the root-cause analysis of breaches in safety and advised to launch a safety drive.Goyal directed the officials to take proactive steps towards sensitising  passengers against smoking in trains and also said the erring passengers need to be deterred from causing risks to others by smoking in trains."Strict monitoring needs to be done to ensure that the quality of materials that is utilised in the manufacture of the coaches is of the best possible quality," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goyal-directs-officials-to-focus-on-remedial-measures-after-fire-incidents-on-trains-railway-premises-227626
19-03-2021||New Delhi||Lok Sabha clears amendment Bill to modify list of Scheduled Castes in Tamil Nadu||The Lok Sabha on Friday passed the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to modify the list of scheduled castes in Tamil Nadu by grouping seven castes that presently exist as separate castes under one nomenclature of “Devendrakula Vellalars”. Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot called the change in nomenclature a long-pending demand of the community.It does not involve either the deletion or addition of any community in its ambit, he also specified.Supporting the Bill, the Opposition said the government was acting on the demand only because elections are on in Tamil Nadu. Questioning the timing, Congress’ Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh said he had gone through files of this case and the demand has been there for a while.“It should have been expedited but the government dragged its feet just to time it with elections,” he said. Amar Singh also wondered about its relevance given that the Narendra Modi government was “privatising public sector institutions”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-clears-amendment-bill-to-modify-list-of-scheduled-castes-in-tamil-nadu-227623
19-03-2021||Shillong||Meghalaya planning to redevelop Shillong locality that saw group clashes in 2018||Meghalaya Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong on Friday informed the assembly that the state government is planning to redevelop the Punjabi Lane area in Shillong as it is adjacent to Them Iew Mawlong, the city’s main commercial hub.The area is inhabited by people from Punjab, who were brought to Shillong around 200 years ago by the British to work as cleaners and sweepers. An incident of assault in the area in May 2018 had resulted in group clashes, following which it was put under curfew for over a month.There were demands from various quarters to relocate “illegal settlers” from Punjabi Lane at that time and the state government set up a High-Level Committee (HLC) headed by Tynsong to look into the issue.“The HLC will again sit very soon and a report (on redeveloping Punjabi Lane) will be submitted to the state government,” Tynsong said while replying to a query by Congress member M Rapsang.The HLC found many problems that need to be corrected, the deputy chief minister said.The Centre has selected Shillong in the Smart City project and “we are thinking of redeveloping quite a number of places including Them Iew Mawlong area”, he said.Tynsong said that the urban affairs department is working on a detailed plan to refurbish the area.The deputy chief minister also informed the House that the government is seriously considering to find out a permanent solution to the issue of relocation of alleged illegal settlers from the Punjabi Lane area.On May 29, 2018, clashes erupted when a bus driver and his friend were attacked at the Punjabi Lane area and they received injuries. As rumours of the assaulted victims dying in hospital spread on social media, people attacked the settlers following which the entire area was put under curfew for over a month.Following the incident, a delegation of the Punjab government visited the city and interacted with the settlers.The delegation members also met Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma.However, the Meghalaya administration expressed unhappiness after the Punjab government sanctioned Rs 60 lakh as compensation to the community members who were affected by the violence.

19-03-2021||Bengaluru||Zomato delivery case: I won't flee Bengaluru, says Chandranee||Model-turned-make-up artist Hitesha Chandranee, who had accused Zomato delivery boy K. Kamraj of assaulting her, on Friday posted a three-page message on her Instagram account stating that she has not left Bengaluru, despite media reports suggesting so.A section of the media, especially local news channels, ran a story suggesting that she had 'left the city' after her address  was leaked online following the barrage of opinions and hate messages about the whole incident.This news was on air after Kamraj filed a counter-complaint against her alleging abuse and assault. However, Chandranee has now taken to Instagram to inform the public that Bengaluru is her home and that she has not run away anywhere following the controversy.On March 10, taking to Instagram and Twitter, Chandranee had accused Kamraj, a Zomato delivery person, of punching her on the nose after she tried to ask him why her order was delayed.This video clip has already garnered 2.5 crore views till date since it was posted on her Instagram. Her video with a bloody nose  went viral. Chandranee filed a complaint with the police  against Kamraj for assault.Soon after this video went viral, Kamraj was kept under suspension by the Zomato food delivery platform. But he denied the woman's  story and alleged that it was she who assaulted him with slippers due to the delay in delivering the food. While Kamraj was holding his hands up in defence, he claimed the woman hurt herself with her ring. This week, he filed a counter  complaint against Chandranee for assaulting and abusing him.Chandranee has now revealed on Instagram that she has been receiving threats ever since the incident went viral. She said that her family  has been threatened too. "I have had to take medical treatment for my nose which was fractured due to the incident. I have received many calls from various people using repulsive and threatening words against me," she wrote. "I have been cooperating with the police and have not left Bengaluru...Bengaluru is home for me," she  further added.In her post, Chandranee also wrote that she was waiting for a neutral probe by investigative agencies to reveal the truth about what  actually happened and requested people to not voice their opinions before the trial is completed."From the time the incident occurred and while undergoing trauma on what happened to me as what happens to many girls and women who  live alone in this city, I've been hounded on social media by tweets, posts and statements by 'celebrities' because of which I have decided to make this statement," she wrote in her post.She also clarified why she had asked for free food. "Online narratives say that I asked for free food, but it was Zomato which had  an offer that they would not charge me, if the food was delivered late," she added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/zomato-delivery-case-i-wont-flee-bengaluru-says-chandranee-227619

No notice now," A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Friday told senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.Contending that the petitioner had sent letters to the Election Commission and other authorities which didn't respond, Singh wanted the Bench to issue notices to the Centre and the Election Commission.However, the top court refused to issue notice on the PIL at this juncture and instead asked the petitioner to serve a copy to the Attorney General.Describing party symbol as the root cause of corruption and criminalisation of politics, Upadhyay urged the top court to issue appropriate directions to use the name, age photograph and educational qualifications of candidates on EVMs instead of party symbol.As Singh submitted that in Brazil, one just got numbers to contest and no symbols, the Bench wondered how a symbol could affect the electronic voting process in any way.The intrinsic value of a candidate could be measured by voters if details other than party symbols were taken into consideration, Singh submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-seeks-polls-without-party-symbol-in-evms-sc-asks-petitioner-to-serve-a-copy-to-ag-227616
19-03-2021||New Delhi||AICTE's move not to make Maths, Physics mandatory for engineering courses 'disastrous'||The AICTE's decision not to make Mathematics and Physics mandatory for students who want to enrol for engineering courses will be "disastrous" and further "deteriorate" the standard of education, Niti Aayog member V K Saraswat said on Friday.He said both these subjects are the major building blocks for any engineering education."Even engineering disciplines like biomedical engineering and biotechnology also need the knowledge of Maths and Physics. In the name of flexibility to reduce the standards of students entering the engineering field would be disastrous because then the students will not be able to pick up the basic engineering education," the senior scientist told PTI.The AICTE last week said Physics, Chemistry and Maths will continue to be important subjects in engineering courses and it is not mandatory for state governments or institutions to offer these courses to students who have not studied them in Class XII.It said students opting for streams like Biotechnology, Textile or Agriculture Engineering will have an option to not study these subjects in Class XII."The decision taken by the AICTE will further deteriorate the standards of education," Saraswat, who is a Member (Science) in the Niti Aayog, said.Earlier, he was also the Chairman of the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO)."Decision to make Physics and Maths education not essential for entrance in engineering streams will very adversely impact the already dwindling standards of engineering education in the country. Need for a rethink and due diligence at wider platform @AICTE_INDIA @PMOIndia @MHRD," Saraswat had earlier tweeted.He said that he has conveyed his concerns to Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan.The AICTE's move met with criticism from several quarters.In response, AICTE chairperson Anil Sahasrabudhe said it was in receipt of many representations from the industry as well as student community to give an option to pursue technical courses such as Agriculture, Biotechnology, Information Technology, Electronics to students who did not have prior electives of Physics and Maths at class-level but had studied relevant portions of the same to a certain desired extent.Considering the need to develop a multi-disciplinary outlook amongst the students, it was imperative to redefine the entry barriers for pursuing higher education in the domains of Engineering and Technology, he said."This is totally in line with the philosophy of the new National Education Policy (NEP) in terms of flexibility and multi-disciplinary courses, innovation."Hence, the Council reiterates and hereby also places on record that it has neither diluted nor removed the elementary subjects of Mathematics, Physics or Chemistry for pursuing the technical programmes under Engineering and Technology domain, which inter-alia shall continue to be academically delivered while undergoing the curriculum," he said.Sahasrabudhe was also imperative to mention that it is an option given by the Council, which is not binding on the states or universities, and for various entrance exams such as Joint Entrance Examination, CET, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) said.He added that they may continue to hold the entrance exams in Physics, Chemistry and Maths as is being done now and gradually decide to conduct exam in other subjects later after discussing and taking decisions in the university senates, academic councils and state level committees.

Next day he found the SUV was missing, he said.The CCTV footage showed Waze leaving in Mercedes from police commissioner’s office. Hiran is seen walking towards the car when it is parked outside CSMT.Both sit inside and ten minutes later Hiran steps out and walks away while Waze drives back to the commissioner’s office.The ATS suspects that Hiran handed over the keys of Scorpio to Waze during this meeting, sources said.On February 25, the Scorpio was found parked near Ambani’s residence ‘Antilia’ with gelatin sticks and a threat letter.Waze was arrested by the NIA on March 13 for his alleged role in parking the SUV near Ambani’s residence.The NIA had earlier this week seized a black Mercedes car from a parking lot near CSMT and seized Rs 5 lakh in cash, note-counting machine and some ‘incriminating’ documents.Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5.His family alleged that Waze had a role in his death.

It would have been better had their claims benefitted the poor people at the ground level.”          Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav retweeted a party activist’s tweet carrying a newspaper cutting which claimed that violence against women had doubled in Uttar Pradesh in the last four years.Earlier, Yadav in a tweet had said, “Today, the call of Haldhar Balarama will be raised from the land of Krishna, the mahapanchayat of farmers will change the history of our country” referring to the farmers’ mahapanchayat organised in Mathura on Friday.At the state headquarters of the Congress party, senior leaders, including Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee President Ajay Kumar Lallu, Congress Legislature Party leader Aradhana Mishra and party leader in Legislative Council Deepak Singh, released a booklet on the “inefficiency of the BJP government”.In a tweet, Lallu said, “Hatred, unemployment, suicides, destruction of small industries, betrayal of farmers… this is what the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh has given in the last four years”.“Today, a booklet has been released on the inefficiency of the BJP government. The situation in UP has worsened in the last four years. Uttar Pradesh is at the number one spot in terms of farmer suicides and crime against women,” Lallu said.The state unit of the CPI (M-L), in a statement,  said during the four years of the Yogi government, maximum damage has been done to civil liberties and constitutional democracy in the state.CPI (M-L) state secretary Sudhakar Yadav said, “The Yogi government has made the entire state an encounter state by considering every encounter as its achievement”.

19-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC asks Centre to reply to plea challenging new IT rules regulating digital news media||The Delhi High Court Friday sought the Centre’s response on a plea challenging the new Information Technology rules which seek to regulate digital news media.A Bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notices to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and granted them time to file their responses.The court listed the plea filed by Quint Digital Media Ltd for further hearing on April 16, along with another similar petition filed earlier by the Foundation for Independent Journalism and The Wire.According to amended IT rules, social media and streaming companies will be required to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist in investigations.Advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, representing the petitioners, urged the high court to grant them interim protection so that no coercive steps are taken against the digital news media outlets by the authorities till the next date of hearing, that is on April 16.The bench, however, refused to pass any interim order and said it will be considered at a later stage.The petition, also filed by director and co-founder of Quint Ritu Kapur, has challenged the Constitutional validity of the IT Rules under the provisions of Information Technology Act, 2000.It said they purport to apply to ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’ as part of digital media, and consequently regulate these entities under the Rules by imposing Government oversight and a ‘Code of Ethics’ which stipulates such vague conditions as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’ and prohibition of ‘half-truths’.The petitioners said they bring out a wholly digital news and current affairs publication called ‘The Quint’ and are directly impacted by the new IT Rules, which is also an overreach by subordinate legislation.“The petitioners’ digital news portal publishes news and views, as distinct from curated content. The present Petition challenges the IT Rules, 2021 only in so far as they affect digital news portals, and is not with reference to ‘publishers of online curated content’, that it, OTT media platforms or any other entities sought to be regulated by the impugned Rules,” said the plea, filed through advocates Prasanna S, Vinoothna Vinjam.“Creating a differential classification by way of subordinate legislation, when not contemplated by the parent IT Act is an overreach by itself and this has been done to specifically target digital news portals, by subjecting them to an unprecedented regulatory burden and State interference, which no other form of news publication is subject to,” it said.It claimed that this overreach is aggravated by a virtual legislation by reference, inasmuch as the Rules incorporate the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act, the Programme Code under the Cable TV Act, and vest draconian powers and control in the State.The plea sought striking down of the specific part of the IT Rules on the ground that it violates Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution creating a chilling effect on media freedom, Article 14 of the Constitution by creating an unreasonable classification and by setting up a parallel adjudicatory mechanism to be overseen by the officials of the executive and is ultra vires the IT Act.The 2021 Rules regulate the functioning of online media portals and publishers, over-the-top (OTT) platforms and social media intermediaries. According to the Rules, a ‘significant social media intermediary’ has some additional obligations in comparison to other social media intermediaries.

19-03-2021||Noida (UP)||Two Nepal-origin persons among 3 held for cyber frauds in Noida||The Noida Police on Friday said it has busted an inter-state gang involved in cyber frauds across India and arrested three persons, including two of Nepalese origin.The police claimed that the gang, which worked in association with other cyber frauds, would call people from Nepal to India and have identification cards like Aadhaar, PAN made for them on forged documents in order to open bank accounts in their name.The Nepalese people were brought to India by the gang on the pretext of taking them to music concerts or other programmes and the gang would bear all of their expenses, including food and lodging, the officials said.Around two dozen bank passbooks, 18 such Aadhaar cards, 18 PAN cards, two Indian voter ID cards, three Nepal residence certificates, 11 mobile phones, 19 SIM cards, among other items, have been seized from them, a senior official said.A total of Rs 14,000 in Indian currency, Rs 21,500 in Cambodian currency and Rs 120 Nepalese currency have also been seized from the gang, Noida Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Ranvijay Singh said.“These people would then be given some money by the gang and sent back to Nepal. Their bank accounts, however, were used by this gang to transfer and withdraw money they illegally got through cyber fraud,” Singh said.“The trio, which includes a woman also, worked with their other associates who hacked bank accounts of other people pan-India or duped them using other cyber means. The money would be sent to the accounts created by this gang, withdrawn and split among them,” he added.Those held have been identified as Ashok Kumar Yadav, who hails from Ballia district in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Baliram Sharma and Geeta Sharma, both from Nepal, the Noida Police said.The arrests were made by two police teams led by ACP 3 Noida Vimal Kumar Singh and SHO Sector 49 police station Sudhir Kumar, the additional DCP said.Further legal proceedings against the gang are being carried out and their network being traced, the officer added.

It belongs to Tipeshwar area, and we have confirmed it through its stripes. The route the tiger took to reach here has not been confirmed as it is not collared," Satpute said."We have formed seven teams to keep a watch on this tiger. Gautala has good prey base, which may be the reason why it is here. We have found that the tiger has hunted wild boar," he said.Maharashtra State Wildlife Board member Yadav Tarte Patil said the tiger may have come through Pandharkawda, Umarkhed, some parts of Telangana, Akola, Dnyanganga (Buldhana), Hingoli, and reached Gautala from Ajanta mountain ranges."The tiger's journey may be close to 2,000 kilometres.Such corridors should be declared as critical tiger habitat and best wildlife management practices must be implemented to protect such routes," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tiger-seen-in-guatala-autramghat-sanctuary-a-first-after-1940-227594
19-03-2021||New Delhi||State assemblies’ resolutions against CAA, farm laws: 'Can't they express their opinion?' wonders SC||Wondering if state legislatures had the right to express their opinion on central laws, the Supreme Court on Friday asked an NGO—which raised the issue before it in a PIL—to do more research on the issue.“We don’t want to create more problems than resolving the issue. We will see,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told the petitioner’s counsel while deferring the hearing for four weeks.Petitioner ‘Samata Andolan Samiti’ has challenged the legislative competence of different state assemblies in passing resolutions against central laws like Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the three farm laws, contending the subjects fell under the Union List of the Seventh Schedule.The NGO made the Centre and the Speakers of the Legislative Assemblies of Punjab, Rajasthan, Kerala and West Bengal party in the petition, saying the apex court is already seized of multiple petitions challenging these laws passed by Parliament.On behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate Soumya Chakraborty said state assemblies were incompetent to pass such resolutions against the central laws.Referring to CAA law and the Kerala Assembly resolution, Chakraborty said the state legislature said that central law was against the basic structure of the Constitution as it did not grant citizenship to Muslims and gave it only to Hindus, Jains, Christians and Sikhs.“This is the opinion of the majority of Kerala Assembly and this may not have the force of law. This is just an opinion. They have simply requested the Centre and sought repeal of the law. Do they have no right to express their opinion? They have not asked the people to disobey the Central law,” the Bench said.The NGO has sought a direction “prohibiting all the state legislatures of India to discuss/debate/ adopt adverse resolutions never in regard to the subject matter of central legislations falling under the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution in any manner whatsoever”. However, the Bench asked, “How can you say that the assembly does not have the right to express their opinion?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/state-assemblies-resolutions-against-caa-farm-laws-cant-they-express-their-opinion-wonders-sc-227593

Hiran's wife had made direct allegations against the police officer, it added.  Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV found near Ambani's house, had claimed that it had been stolen a week earlier, but the case got murky when Hiran himself was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5.Hiran's wife had claimed that her husband had given the SUV to Waze in November, which the officer returned in the first week of February. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hirans-death-hearing-on-wazes-pre-arrest-bail-plea-deferred-227591

19-03-2021||London||Indians studying at London universities register ‘astonishing’ growth||The UK capital is by far the most attractive destination of choice for Indian students coming to study at British universities, rising from third place in 2018-19 to become the second-largest international student market for London in 2019-20.According to new data released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), 13,435 Indian students are enrolled at London universities, up a massive 87 per cent on the previous year’s 7,185 students.The latest data has been dubbed “an impressive period of growth” for India, after falling to fourth place in 2017-18 before rising to third place the following year.“These new figures are a resounding confirmation of the status of London’s world-leading universities,” said Lalage Clay, Director of Education and Talent at London & Partners (L&P) – the Mayor of London’s international trade, investment and promotion agency.“The astonishing growth of Indian students choosing London demonstrates the great opportunity that studying in the UK’s capital unlocks, alongside the option to remain in the UK for two-years post study,” she said.“Whether it’s fashion or financial economics, accountancy or art history, prospective international students know when they choose London, they are choosing a first-class education and a cultural experience like no other,” she added.China maintained its first place in the ranking with 29,940 students, while the US dropped to third with 7,245.       For India, the 2019-20 figures demonstrate an “unprecedented” 152 per cent increase on 2017-18 levels. “Applications by Indian students may have been encouraged by the reintroduction of the two-year post-study visa for international students by the UK government, allowing overseas graduates a longer period of time to look for employment after their studies,” the L&P notes.Overall, the data shows 55,465 Indian students enrolled across higher education institutions across the United Kingdom, with England being the dominant region for these students followed by Scotland and then Wales and Northern Ireland.The statistics from HESA, the designated higher education data body for England, show that the total number of international students at London’s universities has risen to 135,490, up 8.4 per cent on last academic year to the highest level on record.This also marks an uplift in overseas students in London for the seventh consecutive year, which L&P says reflects the UK capital’s growing appeal for prospective international students.

19-03-2021||Egra (WB)||BJP old-timers shedding tears as party fielded TMC turncoats: Mamata at poll rally||Branding TMC turncoats as “traitors”, party supremo Mamata Banerjee on Friday said it was good riddance that they have left her camp, but the “switch over has left BJP old-timers sulking” as the saffron party has chosen to field the defectors over its loyalists.Addressing a poll rally at Egra in Purba Medinipur, the West Bengal chief minister accused the BJP of practising “politics of riot, loot and murder”, and urged everyone “to be on guard against outsiders appearing in their localities”.The TMC, which has made ‘Bengali pride’ its core poll plank, has called the BJP a ‘party of outsiders’, as its top leaders hail from outside the state.In an obvious reference to Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee who had shifted allegiance to the BJP along with other leaders like Mukul Roy, the TMC supremo said “Gaddars, Mirjafars (traitors) have now become BJP candidates, to the dismay of old-timers of the saffron party.”     Noting that “these turncoats” had been given many responsibilities in the past, Banerjee said, “I will be monitoring every project so that its benefit reaches everyone.”Slamming the saffron party for chanting “Hari Hari in front and stabbing from behind”, the TMC chief claimed, “Chewing panparag and putting tilak on forehead, the BJP carries on attacking people.”Coining the slogan “No vote to BJP”, Banerjee also asked the crowd not to vote for the CPI-M and the Congress either “as they are friends of the BJP”.The CPI-M, Congress and the fledgling ISF have formed an alliance in West Bengal.Banerjee asked the people to maintain vigil outside the counting centres where the EVMs will be kept after polling, saying “Do not leave the place even if central security and state police ask you to do so.“Also if an EVM malfunctions, ensure that the machine replacing it is tested properly.”About her decision to contest from Nandigram, she said, “Many people had asked me why I decided to contest from faraway Nandigram rather than a constituency in Kolkata. I replied, I chose it since the movement against land acquisition in Nandigram (in 2007-2008) and Singur had played a significant role.“Also I consider every corner of West Bengal as my own place.”Alleging that women are not secure in BJP-ruled states, she said, “In Uttar Pradesh, women are raped and murdered. The father of a rape victim was killed recently.“If a poor man steals Rs 500 we pounce on him. What about the BJP stealing lakhs of rupees in jumla, what about lakhs of cash being plundered in the name of selling of PSUs? These thefts by BJP leaders are never known publicly.”The chief minister said, ‘Duare Sarkar’ (government at the doorstep) camps will be set up again in August-September and will be held twice a year from now on.Asserting that the victory of the TMC in the assembly polls “will be the precursor to dislodging the BJP in Delhi, Banerjee said, “If you want me to be at the helm again, make every TMC candidate a winner.”The TMC leader chanted ‘chandi’ sloka while wrapping up her speech and also wished Muslims, Christians and members of different tribes and castes.“We are all united and together. None can rupture our unity. This is Bengal”, she said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-old-timers-shedding-tears-as-party-fielded-tmc-turncoats-mamata-at-poll-rally-227579
19-03-2021||Lahowal (Assam)||Congress will not implement CAA if voted to power in Assam: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Friday assured that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will not be implemented in Assam if the party is voted to power in the state in the coming Assembly poll.It will be ensured in the state Assembly that the CAA is not implemented in Assam, Gandhi told students of Lahowal College in Dibrugarh district.“In the other states, we will stop it (CAA implementation) after we (Congress) come to power at the national level,” he said.Asked to comment on whether the BJP is mixing religion and politics, he said that the saffron party does not use religion but hatred to create divisions among different sections of the society.“No religion has asked to use hatred. Where is it written in Hinduism that there should be ‘nafrat’ (hatred)? It is BJP that spreads hatred to divide society and wherever they do it Congress goes there to promote love, brotherhood and harmony,” he said.In an apparent reference to the RSS, the senior Congress leader said that there is a force in Nagpur that is trying to control the entire country. But the youth of today should resist it with love and confidence as they are the future of democracy.Twenty years ago Assam was hit by violence but after Congress came to power it ensured peace and development.“BJP ka kaam hain todna, hamaara kaam hain jodna (BJP’s work is to divide but our job is to unite people), he said.Gandhi said there is a direct relation between hatred and unemployment. “If hatred increases, unemployment will increase and vice versa. Can two sections of the society fighting against each other do business together? For business and employment oppurtunities to thrive, there should be harmony and brotherhood”.He also accused the saffron party of selling off Assam’s resources to outsiders like the tea companies in the state, the Guwahati airport to the Adanis and the tea companies.The senior Congress leader said that at present the country has a ‘Hum do, Hamare do ka Sarkar’ (a government of two with two others)- one in Parliament (apparently Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah) and two outside (Adani and Ambani likely).“Assam’s resources and wealth must go into the pockets of the Assamese. The state must be managed in the interest of the people here”, the Congress leader said.The erstwhile Congress government, he said, had laid the foundation for the country’s future growth, employment and development by initiating several schemes, including MGNREGA and Food Security.“Can you name the schemes started by BJP? We had promised in Chattisgarh to waive off farm loans and we did it.We have a record of not making promises in the air. We give guarantees”, he asserted.In Assam Congress has given ‘5 guarantees’. They are five lakh government jobs to youths in five years, upto 200 units of free electricity per household, Rs 365 daily wage to tea workers and Rs 2000 per month to housewives besides the assurance not to implement the CAA in the state, he said.Asked by students about rising unemployment and Congress’ plans to tackle it, Gandhi said that the priority of the party if voted to power will be to first fill up vacant posts and focus on sectors like health and education for creating new jobs.When a student questioned him about privatisation of education, Gandhi said that it is a “big problem” created by BJP. “Education should not be commercialised as it is a fundamental right. We are against the commercialisation of education”.He said, “There are certain places for privatisation, but not in education and health where public sector has a role. We are fighting against BJP on this”, he said.The biggest sale is taking place in the agricultural sector and its privatisation is being done through the three farm laws, he claimed.To another question on why protesting students are being sent to jail, Gandhi said “The rulers are scared of the confidence of the youth. They are scared that if more become confident they cannot control. So the youth are sent to jail”.When another student pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not visit Assam during floods but only during elections, the Congress leader quipped, “What can you give him during floods? So why will he visit you? But now you can give him votes, so he is visiting you.“You can ensure that he does not come at all and stays at home by your vote. You have to save India’s democracy as you are the future of democracy. More youths should enter politics and actively participate in fighting against the wrongs”, he added.Gandhi is on a two-day visit to the poll-bound north eastern state from Friday. He will campaign in upper Assam and will release the party’s manifesto in Guwahati on Saturday, Congress sources said.

19-03-2021||New Delhi||BJP MP Bhupender Yadav raises issue of telephone tapping in Rajasthan in Rajya Sabha||BJP member and party heavyweight Bhupender Yadav on Friday alleged tapping of telephones of leaders of opposition parties, media persons and even leaders of the ruling Congress in the state of Rajasthan.Raising the matter during Zero Hour in Rajya Sabha, Yadav said he has received complaints that telephones of Congress’ opponents, media persons and even leaders of the ruling Congress were being tapped.This led to vociferous protests from members of the main Opposition Congress in the House.Yadav said that tapping and surveillance of telephones was gross violation of Article 21 of the Constitution which provides for right to life and liberty.He further said that Indian Telegraph Act also forbids tapping of telephones.“How can telephones of people be tapped,” Yadav asked, and said this was gross violation of right to life, dignity and liberty of the people of Rajasthan.Congress benches erupted in protest drawing attention of Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to Rules of Procedure, saying it did not permit members to raise matters in the House against a state government.Yadav countered saying he was not levelling any allegation but raising the issue which was brought before him by aggrieved persons.He represents the state of Rajasthan in the House.There is, however, a context to Yadav raising the phone tapping issue in the House.The Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government had been on tenterhooks on account of rebellion by party MLAs led by the then Deputy Chief Minister and state Congress president Sachin Pilot against the chief minister in the past.The dissidents had camped, including in Haryana, demanding replacement of the chief minister.The dissidents had then alleged that telephones were tapped and their movements shadowed.Things were apparently brought under control after a long spell of shadow of uncertainty over existence of the government.Gehlot had then alleged that the dissident Congress MLAs were in touch with the main Opposition BJP in Rajasthan and were colluding to topple his government.Observers say that uneasy calm prevails in Congress camp in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mp-bhupender-yadav-raises-issue-of-telephone-tapping-in-rajasthan-in-rajya-sabha-227572

But I trust people of the state to cooperate (and follow the COVID-19 norms voluntarily) like the last time,” he said.When the pandemic began last year, there was nothing to fight the virus with, Thackeray said.“But now at least we have vaccines as a shield. The priority now is to ensure that everyone is vaccinated. "People should come forward to take the vaccine,” he said.The Union government has assured that there would be no shortage of vaccines, he said.There have been a few instances where a person caught infection after vaccination, but such cases are not “life- threatening”, the chief minister said.“Everyone should get vaccinated without fear,” he added.

We launched this drive to reach out to people and convey the message of Ram Mandir and the reasons behind building such a magnificent temple (in Ayodhya)," he said.He added that over 20 lakh Sangh workers reached 5,45,737 places across the country and through this drive the RSS was able to develop contacts with more than 12.5 crore families in the country."Our workers reached out even tiniest habitats situated in the most difficult of terrains in Mizoram, Andaman and Ladak with this drive," he explained.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-didnt-mark-houses-during-ram-mandir-fund-drive-vai-227556
19-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Europe, US top carbon emitters historically; India a sufferer: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 19The government on Friday said India was a sufferer, not a perpetrator of climate change with the European Continent and the US being top carbon emitters over the past two centuries.Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday shared historical carbon emission data by major regions and nations between 1751 and 2017 and said the European Continent contributed 514 billion tones to overall global carbon emissions during the period, which makes 33 per cent of the entire carbon footprint burden.“I have data from 1751 to 2017. The European continent has contributed 33 per cent – 514 billion tons -- of historical emissions over this period. The US has contributed 25 per cent, which is 400 billion tons; China has contributed over 13 per cent, which comes to 200 billion tons while India has contributed only 48 billion tones. Our net emissions are much lower than these regions and we are absolutely not responsible for climate change,” Javadekar said answering questions on the Paris Climate Change Agreement of which India is a signatory.The minister firmly stated that India was a sufferer, not a perpetrator of the climate change problem.“We are the sufferers. That is why our stand has been that the developed nations should reduce their carbon emissions, and transfer technology at low costs to developing nations to help them further reduce their emissions,” Javadekar said adding that not every major environmental event was taking place due to climate change.He was speaking in context of the recent Chamoli floods and forest fires.“Every such natural incident is not related to or caused climate change alone. These events have a history and over hundred to 1,000 years we see recurrence of such events,” he said.The minister informed the house that the government had developed an efficient system of forest fire alarms which was helping it avert major disasters even in areas with tough terrains.Javadekar also said plans had been developed with states to reduce pollution in India’s top 100 polluted cities in the next five years. He also took a swipe at the AAP led Delhi government for taking credit for marginal reductions in pollution in the capital city noting that the reduction was a result of steps taken by the Centre.“But some people love to rush to take credits,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/europe-us-top-carbon-emitters-historically-india-a-sufferer-govt-227551

The action resulted in a cash seizure of Rs 5.32 crore," the Board said in a statement.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) frames policy for the tax department.In another case, searches were carried out against a business group engaged in yarn trading and supply of PPE kits, bags and baby care kits to various state governments. It was found, the statement alleged, that the group is engaged in the practice of "suppressing" profit by inflating purchases and other expenses."The unaccounted income so generated is utilised for making investments in land and expansion of business," the statement said."The search has resulted in seizure of unaccounted cash of Rs 11.5 crore and total unaccounted income detected so far is Rs 80 crore," it said.Polls to the 234-seat Tamil Nadu Assembly will be held in a single phase on April 6."Seizure of large unaccounted cash will reduce the possibility of its utilisation for electoral purposes and will aid the objective of free and fair poll in the state of Tamil Nadu," the statement said."The Income Tax department has stepped up its monitoring and is closely watching the cash movement during the ensuing Assembly election," it added.

My siblings were fearful that she could contract COVID-19, but we thought she has lived a good life and not everyone gets to see their 100th birthday. So, we made it a special one for her," her youngest daughter Jyotica Sikand told PTI.  Born on September 3, 1920, Das was administered the vaccine at BLK Hospital here, a day after Brij Prakash Gupta, also born in 1920, had received his first shot of Covieshield vaccine at the same facility, a spokesperson of the hospital said.Sikand, 72, said, "We allowed her to live a very normal life even during the entire pandemic last year. And, she's fine and today also got her shot." "She told me that the shot was so painless, she doesn't recall which hand it was administered in," the daughter said in a lighter vein.Sikand remembered her father, Maj Gen Das, who had served in the Second World War and retired from the Army in 1965, and also authored many books on the armed forces."He was born in Lahore and educated at Government College, Lahore and received his military training at Royal Military College, Sandhurst in England, and Staff College, Quetta (now in Pakistan). He was commissioned in the British Indian Army in 1933 and posted as a Subaltern with the Lancashire Fusiliers. He joined the 5 Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles in North-West Frontier Province in 1934. "During his 32 years of service with the Army, he held both command and staff appointments at many levels. During World War II, he served in Hong Kong, Burma, Italy and Greece and was awarded the Officer Class of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his distinguished service," according to information shared by his daughter.She said her mother's father was in the railways and the family lived mainly in Lahore."My mother, who has so many stories and memories, was born in Sukkur in Sindh province (now in Pakistan). She went to Sacred Heart School and Kinnaird College, both in Lahore. None in my family migrated, and my father just happened to be posted in Delhi when the partition happened," Sikand said."My father was born in 1911 and died in 2006, aged 95. When my mother turned 100 last year, defence personnel had come from the Rajputana Rifles regiment to honour my mother with a ceremonial gesture on September 4. And, later a small event was held at Raj Rif here to mark her 100th birthday. The Indian Army is truly a family. Such a touching gesture it was," the daughter recalled. Sikand said her father was very interested in military history and books authored by him include "Traditions & Customs of the Indian Armed Forces" and "Hours of Glory (Famous Battles of the Indian Army 1801-1971)".Many centenarians have been vaccinated in the past few days. On March 15, 107-year-old Kewal Krishan, who was just five-years-old during the deadly Spanish Flu, and later became part of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India, received his first shot of COVID-19 vaccine at a private facility here.Tulsi Das Chawla, 104, who was born a few months before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu, had received his first shot of COVID-19 vaccine at a private hospital here on March 5.

19-03-2021||Johannesburg||South Africa has world's most dangerous roads; India in fourth place: Study||South Africa has been ranked as the world's most dangerous country to drive in while India came in at a fourth place, according to a research study undertaken by international driver education company Zutobi.Among the list of 56 countries in the study, Thailand came in the second position and the US took up the third spot.The safest roads in the world can be found in Norway, with its Scandinavian neighbour Sweden having the third safest roads while Japan took second place, according to the study.“We analysed each country on five factors, giving each one a normalised score out of ten for each factor, before taking an average final score across all five factors,” Zutobi said.These factors included estimates on the number of road traffic deaths per 100,000 population; the percentage of car occupants who use a seat-belt when travelling in the front of a vehicle; and the proportion of road traffic deaths that have been attributed to alcohol consumption over the national legal limit.These estimates were based on the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory data repository.The maximum speed limit on motorway and blood alcohol content restrictions in the various countries were also taken into account.But Zutobi's findings have been challenged by the Justice Project SA (JPSA), an NGO that aims to improve road traffic laws and their enforcement in South Africa.JPSA Chairperson Howard Dembovsky, while agreeing that South Africans tended to be poor drivers, said that Zutobi had used outdated figures in its study.Dembovsky also queried why South Africa was the only African country on its list.“So to accuse us of being the worst in the world is a little bit unfair. If you are going to talk about the worst countries in the world, then you need to adopt a balanced approach,” Dembovsky said as he commented on poor driving in his country in an interview with radio station Cape Talk.“(South African drivers) do have a shocking road safety record. As much as I would not place much reliance on that so-called study, there is still plenty of evidence to show that South Africans are dangerous drivers and inconsiderate drivers and have very little regard for the safety of others on our roads,” he said.

We demand that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should ask the Uttarakhand Chief Minister to apologise immediately," she said.Lamba also warned that if Rawat didn't apologise, the BJP will have to replace him as the women of the country will launch an agitation and expose the BJP leaders and their mindset."The Congress feels that the women of the country have complete freedom to eat, wear or speak whatever they want according to the Constitution. They will not tolerate any such remarks," she said.On Tuesday, Rawat had said, "Showing bare knees by wearing ripped jeans just to look like rich kids is the value given now which is just a race towards westernisation when the western world today are following us.

19-03-2021||Washington||Senators ask Blinken to raise farmers issue, say Indians will determine path ahead on new laws||Observing that it is for the people and the Government of India to determine the path forward on its recently enacted farm laws, two top Democratic senators have urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to raise the issue of treatment of peaceful farmer protesters and journalists.In a letter to Blinken, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday urged the Biden administration to further engage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over its treatment of farmers in India who have been peacefully demonstrating against the passage of new farm laws.“India is a long-term strategic partner with deep ties to the United States, thanks to our many shared values and our large and valued Indian American community. In light of these shared values and strong connections, we write with serious concern regarding the response of the Indian government to the farmer protests,” Menendez and Schumer wrote in their joint letter to Blinken.In their letter, released to the press, the two senators urged Blinken to raise the importance of freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest in conversations with his Indian counterparts and to ensure that State Department officials at all levels do so as well.After becoming the Secretary of State, Blinken has spoken with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar multiple times. The readouts of the phone calls do not indicate that Blinken raised this issue, under pressure from his party men, with Jaishankar. The Biden administration has insisted that the two countries share democratic values.Schumer and Menendez said the months-long demonstrations have been met with orders from the central government and local authorities to shut off internet access in protest areas, cut off water and electricity supplies for the tens of thousands living in protest camps, and impede the work of journalists reporting on the protests.“India's people and government will determine the path forward on these laws, and peaceful dialogue and respect for the viewpoints of all peaceful actors should drive that decision. As the US pursues a more perfect union here at home, including efforts to bolster the rule of law and our democracy, those efforts reinforce the importance of addressing challenges to democracies abroad as well,” the Senators wrote.The letter by Schumer and Menendez comes a day after the latter wrote a similar letter to Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is visiting India this week.There has been no response from either Austin or Blinken if they plan to raise these issues with their Indian counterparts, especially when the Biden administration is going out of its way in its outreach with the Modi government given the serious challenge it is facing from China.

19-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Chief Minister's wife defends ripped jeans remark||Amid uproar over Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat's ripped jeans remark, his wife defended his statement on Thursday, saying his words were not being presented in full context.In a statement through a video here, Rawat's wife Rashmi Tyagi said that the entire context in which he made the comment is not being described.Also read: 'Ripped jeans' row: ‘Oh my God, their knees are showing’, Priyanka Gandhi posts pics of PM Modi, Gadkari in khaki shots"He (Tirath Singh Rawat) said that women's participation is unprecedented in building the society and the country. It is the responsibility of the women of our country to save our cultural heritage, save our identity, save our costumes," Rashmi, who has been Miss Meerut, clarified. At an event on Tuesday, Rawat criticised women for wearing ripped jeans and wondered what values they will impart to their children, triggering a protest from opposition parties.The Uttarakhand chief minister said due to a lack of values, youngsters these days follow strange fashion trends and consider themselves to be big shots after wearing jeans ripped at the knees, while women also follow such trends.He said youngsters go to the market to buy ripped jeans and if they do not find one, they cut their jeans using scissors.Rawat went on to describe the attire of a woman, who once sat next to him on a flight.He said the woman was wearing boots, jeans ripped at the knees and several bangles in her hands with two children travelling with her. "She runs an NGO, goes out in the society and has two children, but she wears jeans ripped at the knees. What values will she impart?" he asked.  Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said he was "shocked" by Rawat's statement.In a statement, Uttarakhand Congress chief Pritam Singh termed Rawat's remarks "shameful" and demanded that he apologise to women.State Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni added that it doesn't behove a chief minister to make a derogatory remark about someone's sartorial choices and said such comments can hurt public sentiment.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) slammed Rawat over his "distasteful" remarks.Rawat did find support in his party colleague, Surendra Singh, MLA from Bairia in Uttar Pradesh. Men and women, he said, need to wear "decent clothes" and women, especially daughters, are the family's "prestige" and must behave in a dignified manner.In a reply to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tweet congratulating Rawat on his oath ceremony as Uttarakhand CM, RJD leader Rabri Devi blasted the ruling party for trying to define identity and culture through one's clothes.

19-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Treat donations to CMs’ relief fund as CSR: Panel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 18In contrast to the government’s position, a parliamentary committee on Thursday said financial contributions to the Chief Ministers’ Relief Fund should also be treated as corporate social responsibility (CSR) spending and necessary changes should be made to the Companies Law to make this change.The government last year said financial contributions to CMs’ relief fund for Covid-19 would not be considered as CSR spending, but corporate donations to PM Cares Fund would get CSR tag benefits.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs last year told companies to donate to state disaster management authorities to claim CSR spending.The Parliamentary Committee on Petitions today sought to bring corporate donations to CMs’ relief funds on a par with PM Cares Fund.“Since public health is under the state list and states have to implement relief measures, not considering voluntary corporate contributions to the CMs’ relief funds as CSR contributions even under unprecedented circumstances like Covid-19 appear discretionary. We recommend the government consider including the CMs’ relief fund in the Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013, so that contributions to such funds can qualify as CSR expenditure,” said the committee.It also told the government to ensure CSR donations are not made to flagship government projects.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/treat-donations-to-cms-relief-fund-as-csr-panel-227271
19-03-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India looks forward to upping ties with US in 5 areas: Envoy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 18India looks forward to closely working with the new US administration and other stakeholders around five immediate baskets of cooperation, India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told The Tribune in an exclusive interview.Speaking after the February 18 Quad summit, Sandhu outlined cooperation in healthcare and pharma as the first item on the wish list. This also includes ensuring affordable medicines and vaccines.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, India’s ambassador to US‘Austin’s visit to boost defence partnership’The visit of US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin to India will enable the two sides to review ongoing cooperation and provide new momentum to our defence ties.Like Covid cooperation, the second area — digital space; information and communication sectors — was also discussed in the Quad under the rubric of emerging technologies. The third is the energy sector, including LNG, renewable and solar, that will help in the fight against climate change. Equally important are advanced partnerships in education and knowledge partnership; and cooperation in strategic and defence areas, including in the Indo-Pacific.“We look forward to building on the momentum to strengthen our existing partnerships across diverse sectors,” he said.He said industries in both countries were working together to chart out reliable supply chains in next-generation defence technology and to undertake joint R&D, manufacturing, innovation and experimenting in new domains. Both sides can offer a lot to each other in critical and emerging technologies such as AI, big data analytics, robotics, quantum computing, block chain and Internet of things.“In recent years, we have cemented traditional areas of cooperation, while simultaneously exploring new horizons. Today, there is no area of human activity that the partnership does not touch — from nanotechnology to space and Indo-Pacific to Covid vaccine manufacturing and delivery,” he observed.“The visit of US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin to India will enable the two sides to review ongoing cooperation and provide new momentum to our defence ties,” he said.India remained committed to the bilateral trade target of $500 billion and hopes to re-engage with the US on trade and tariff issues. “In coming days, once senior officials of the Biden administration take their positions, intensive discussions can be expected on trade issues,” he added.Sandhu was hopeful that the brakes on immigration and easier work visas would also be revisited by the new administration. “We remain engaged on issues related to movement of Indian professionals, who bring in value to the US economy,” he said.There is a strong sense of commitment and determination among the political leadership of both India and the US to take the bilateral strategic partnership to the next level. The Ambassador, however, did not take questions on the farmers’ agitation and allegations in New Delhi about the increased activity of US-based Khalistanis.InterviewQ: Please tell us about the recent Quad Summit. What are the major takeaways?A: The virtual Quad Leader’s Summit on February 18 captured the vision of the four leaders for a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific as well as layout practical areas of cooperation. The Quad countries share a lot in common as political democracies, market economies and pluralistic societies.This was the first Summit at the Leaders’ level involving four countries: India, U.S., Japan & Australia, and assumes particular significance. These have been important conversations and reflect the importance of like-minded countries coming together during unprecedented times such as these, to fight common global challenges.There are some important areas of cooperation under focus such as Covid vaccine manufacturing and delivery; critical and emerging technologies; climate change. It has been decided to set up separate working groups of experts and officials in these three areas. These will be continuing and regular conversations. As noted by Prime Minister Modi at the Summit, the agenda for cooperation makes the Quad a “force for global good”.I would like to elaborate on the Quad vaccine partnership. The Quad initiative will utilize India’s well-known capabilities in manufacturing safe, effective, and affordable vaccines by adding new capacities for manufacturing in India. Development financing institutions of partner countries like the US and Japan would finance these efforts. Australia will assist with its logistics capability. Vaccines ‘Made in India’ would be made available for global benefit. These will be undertaken in close coordination with multilateral initiatives such as WHO, COVAX, GAVI. Quad’s collaborative initiative will speed up the global vaccination efforts, and India will be an active partner in these.Q. Could you give a broad-brush picture of the Biden administration’s approach towards India?A: The India-US bilateral partnership has been on an upward trajectory, the result of strong bipartisan support in the US and India, our shared values, and our strong people to people ties. In recent years, we have cemented traditional areas of cooperation, while simultaneously exploring new horizons. Today, there is no area of human activity that the partnership does not touch – from nanotechnology to space, from the Indo-Pacific to Covid vaccine manufacturing and delivery.There is a strong sense of commitment and determination among the political leadership of both India and the US to take the bilateral strategic partnership to the next level. There have been several high-level conversations between the two sides since President Biden’s inauguration.PM Modi and President Biden spoke in early February, their second call after President Biden’s election. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Raksha Mantri Rajnath Singh, and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval have spoken to their U.S. counterparts. These initial interactions have been forward-looking, where our shared priorities such as the Covid-19 pandemic, energy and climate change, defence and security, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region were discussed.India looks forward to closely working with the new Administration and other stakeholders around five immediate baskets of cooperation: first, given the pandemic, cooperation in healthcare and pharma and Covid-19 management including affordable medicines and vaccines; second, the digital space; information and communication sectors; third, the energy sector, including LNG, renewables, solar that will allow us to combat climate change; fourth, the education and knowledge partnership; and finally, our cooperation in strategic and defence areas, including in the Indo-Pacific. We look forward to building on the momentum to strengthen our existing partnerships across diverse sectors.Q. Trade seems to be back on the agenda. You had tried for a mini trade deal with the Trump Administration but it didn’t work out. What were the sticking points? After top trade officials got in touch, what kind of trade deal are both sides looking at in keeping with their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership? Is the restoration of GSP on the table?A: We have a robust bilateral economic partnership that has overseen a tremendous growth in trade over the last two decades registering over $150 billion in trade and nearly $63 billion in two-way investment. The deep-rooted nature of our bilateral relationship is also evidenced by the presence of over 2,000 US Companies in India including every major Fortune 500 company; and presence of over 200 Indian companies in the U.S. that have created over 125,000 jobs in the United States across all states. Hence, there was a lot of excitement and interest in deepening these linkages.At the same time, there is work to be done in realising the full potential of our economic cooperation, leveraging our mutual complementarities. We remain committed to the ambitious target of $ 500 billion in bilateral trade. Our discussions in bilateral mechanisms such as the India-U.S. Commercial Dialogue, CEO Forum, the Trade Policy Forum can help advance these common objectives. Both the governments and the private sectors are steadfast in their commitment to work together and achieving innovative breakthroughs that can accelerate the partnership in this area. In coming days, once senior officials of Biden Administration take their positions, intensive discussions can be expected on trade issues.Q. On the defence side, what kind of relationship is India looking for? Are there some pointers in the direction of tailoring Indian requirements for US defence platforms with PM Modi’s Make-in-India and Atmanirbhar Bharat approach?A: The defence and strategic ties continue to grow from strength to strength. If you look at the trajectory of cooperation in this particular sphere, there have been several important milestones, including India’s designation as a ‘Major Defense Partner’ and accordance of Strategic Trade Authorization-1 Status by the U.S.; signing of LEMOA, COMCASA, Industrial Security Annex and BECA foundational agreements. The defence exercises in both bilateral and plurilateral formats have become more frequent and have expanded in their scope. The recently concluded Exercise Yudh Abhyas was a tremendous success. U.S. was a major participant in the AERO India 2021 held last month.We have also been working together for co-production and co-development of defence equipment, under the framework of the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative. Industries in both India and U.S. are working together to chart-out reliable supply chains in next-gen defence technology, and to undertake joint R&D, manufacturing, innovation, and experimenting in new domains. The upcoming visit of U.S. Defense Secretary Austin to India later this month would enable the two sides to review ongoing cooperation and provide new momentum to our defence ties.Q. Sovereign and pension funds from other parts of the world have shown interest in India’s National Infrastructure Investment Pipeline. How do you see the response from US investors and financiers?A: Several US investors and pension funds have shown interest in investing in India in infrastructure and other sectors, and we welcome it. Some of the key institutional investors from US had participated in the Virtual Global Investor Roundtable that was chaired by PM Modi in November 2020. We continue to engage with these institutional investors and pension funds in the U.S. to facilitate their investment plans for projects under the National Infrastructure Pipeline and in other sectors. As we forge ahead the economic recovery path, we will continue to remain focused on encouraging U.S. investors to invest in India.Q. After difficulties on immigration issues, do you see a restoration of immigration, student and gig visas for Indians due to the new Bill and other reforms? What qualifications would be welcome in the US for prospective immigrants?A: The contribution of over four million-strong Indian diaspora in all fields, including science, engineering, research, medicine, academia, business, entrepreneurship and governance in the US has been widely acknowledged and appreciated. You would have seen the comment made by President Biden himself recently recognising the contribution of the Indian American community to the US society and economy. The Indian American community has also been on the frontlines of America’s pandemic response from health services to information technology and financial services. People-to-people ties are at the heart of India-U.S. relations. There is strong complementarity between India’s talent pool and the capital as well as expertise of the US. We remain engaged with the U.S. administration and other stakeholders, on issues related to movement of Indian professionals, who bring in value to the US economy. We are confident that this talent will continue to be welcomed in the US.Q. Could you tell us about the emerging areas of Indo-US cooperation such as AI, 5G and Industry 4.0?A: The salience and possibilities of digital partnership have only increased with the pandemic. Along with the US, India is a founding member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. As societies that respect innovation and leveraging technologies for the benefit of the people, India and the US can offer a lot to each other in critical and emerging technologies such as AI, big data analytics, robotics, quantum computing, block-chain, Internet of Things. The India-US Science and Technology Forum, a binational organization, has been an important platform for advancing collaboration in these critical areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-looks-forward-to-upping-ties-with-us-in-5-areas-envoy-227272

Banerjee was referring to the unearthing of skeletal remains at Narayangarh in Paschim Medinipur district in 2011 and a CPI-M leader was accused in connection with it.“Only the TMC will keep up its fight against the BJP,” she said and blamed the saffron party for conspiring against her at Nandigram which led to her being injured on March 10 when she was campaigning there. “After the attack, they (BJP) are now spreading falsehoods. After the conspiracy they are now involved in character assassination,” Banerjee said.The Trinamool Congress supremo alleged that the BJP-led government at the Centre is involved in plundering crores of rupees and accusing rival parties of graft. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-vote-for-cpm-congress-mamata-urges-marxist-friends-227303

Alleging trivialisation of sexual offences, they had urged the top court to restrain courts across India from imposing such bail conditions.Asking judges to avoid passing stereotype orders, it also issued directions to the National Judicial Academy to develop within three months a gender sensitisation module for training of judges, standing counsel and public prosecutors with the help of sociologists, phycologists and gender studies experts.Issuing a slew of directions with regard to bail conditions, the top court said, “Bail conditions should not mandate, require or permit contact between the accused and the victim. Such conditions should seek to protect the complainant from any further harassment by the accused.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-sets-aside-mp-hcs-rakhi-for-bail-order-227326

We are greatly troubled by this scenario. Even more troubling is the possibility that our university may have acceded to pressure to remove Prof Mehta or to request, and accept, his resignation,” the letter read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ashoka-faculty-write-to-vc-on-prof-mehtas-resignation-227329

The dismal response has forced the health authorities to plan holding an awareness campaign at Tikri. “We have been contacting farmers for vaccination, but they refuse to take jab. They often claim that the Covid-19 pandemic is nothing but a conspiracy of the Centre to divert the public attention,” said an official.Parminder Singh of Moga claimed no farmer had been infected for three months at the stir site hence there was no need for vaccination.“The issue will be discussed in the next meeting of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to take a final call in this regard,” said Purushottam Singh Gill, a senior BKU leader.Civil Surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya said efforts were being made to convince the protesters.Dr Vinay Deswal, Senior Medical Officer, said health officials had been directed to meet the farmers to motivate them.

19-03-2021||New Delhi||SC sets aside MP HC order to molestation accused to get ‘rakhi’ tied from victim for bail||The Supreme Court on Thursday set aside a Madhya Pradesh High Court order that required a molestation accused to get a ‘Rakhi’ tied on his wrist from the victim as a condition for grant of bail.A Bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice S Ravindra Bhat—which asked judges to avoid passing stereotype orders—also issued directions to national judicial academy to develop a gender sensitisation module for judges, advocates and public prosecutors.The verdict came on a PIL filed by nine women lawyers against the Madhya Pradesh High Court order granting bail to a molestation accused on the condition that he would request the victim to tie him a ‘Rakhi’.The petitioners had urged the top court to restrain courts across India from imposing such bail conditions against the principle of law.The MP High Court had on July 30 granted bail to a molestation accused and imposed a condition that he along with his wife shall visit the house of the complainant and request her to tie a ‘Rakhi’ to him with the promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come.Alleging that such an order amounted to trivialisation of sexual offences by courts, the petitioners had said the bail condition further victimized the complainant and trivialised the trauma that she suffered.During the hearing of the PIL, Attorney General KK Venugopal had told the Supreme Court that more women judges were needed at every level of the judiciary in India to ensure gender sensitive handling of cases of sexual violence.“Improving the representation of women in the judiciary could also go a long way towards a more balanced and empathetic approach in cases involving sexual violence,” Venugopal had argued.Pointing out that the Supreme Court has only two women judges against a sanctioned strength of 34, he had said, “There has never been a female Chief Justice of India.”The AG had said courts must not encourage a compromise between a complainant and accused persons.Venugopal had highlighted the need to educate judges on gender sensitisation to ensure that they don’t trivialise sexual violence against women.“Courts must restrict themselves to conditions under Sections 437 and 438 of the CrPC,” he had said,“On the face of it, the (MP) high court judge seems to have got carried away as this order was nothing less than a drama that must be condemned,” Venugopal had submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-sets-aside-mp-hc-order-to-molestation-accused-to-get-rakhi-tied-from-victim-for-bail-227044
