12-03-2021||Kolkata/Delhi||TMC, BJP delegations meet EC over ‘attack’ on Mamata; injured TMC chief discharged from hospital||A TMC delegation met the Election Commission of India on Friday and claimed that the attack on party supremo Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram was a “conspiracy”, while the rival BJP demanded that the video footage of the alleged incident be made public.Amid a raging war of words between the rivals over Wednesday's incident, Banerjee was discharged from the state-run SSKM Hospital in Kolkata this evening after doctors found her recovery to be “satisfactory”.Doctors released the 66-year-old TMC supremo following her repeated requests to discharge her from the medical establishment.Banerjee, seated on a wheelchair with her left foot plastered, greeted party workers gathered outside the Woodburn Block of the hospital.She left the hospital in her vehicle for her Kalighat residence in the eastern metropolis.The two contenders to power—BJP and TMC—are locked in fierce recrimination ever since the alleged attack on Banerjee happened on Wednesday when she had gone to file her nomination for the seat, where she is locked in a tense face-off with Suvendu Adhikari, a former loyalist-turned-adversary.In the national capital, a six-member Trinamool Congress delegation met the full EC team, including Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, for over an hour and submitted a memorandum, claiming BJP leaders in West Bengal had threatened the chief minister through tweets and other remarks.“Injuries to Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram were not a result of an unfortunate incident but that of a conspiracy. The events leading up to the attempt on her life leave no doubt that the attack was part of a deep-rooted conspiracy,” TMC MP Saugata Roy told reporters after meeting the EC in Delhi.In the memorandum, the TMC has made allegations against Suvendu Adhikari, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate from Nandigram in the upcoming state Assembly polls.“When an attempt was made on the life of Ms Banerjee, in which she was grievously hurt, to cover up the attack, eyewitnesses were planted, illustratively, eye-witnesses Chittaranjan Das and Debabrata Das, who testified that Ms Banerjee’s car was hit against an iron pillar, are associates of Suvendu Adhikari, BJP candidate from Nandigram,” the memorandum says.The party said the BJP’s Bengal president Dilip Ghosh had uploaded a caricature depicting that she would be hit at Nandigram.Around the same time, numerous complaints were filed by the saffron party with the EC seeking immediate removal of the then police chief and IGP of West Bengal, it said.“There is a clear nexus between the post by Dilip Ghosh on Facebook, multiple complaints seeking removal of DGP, the unilateral decision of the ECI to remove the erstwhile (police chief), the plan revealed by Saumitra Khan on Twitter, BJP’s request to suspend/remove security personnel of Ms Banerjee, the resultant attempt on the life of Ms Banerjee and the cover-up of the same by Adhikari,” the memorandum said.The TMC delegation also handed over documents containing translated tweets of BJP leaders as well as photographs of Banerjee’s car.“The chairperson’s car does not show even a scratch—clearly demolishing the lie that the vehicle hit an iron pillar on the road.“In this context, we would also like to mention the unfortunate comment made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the ‘Brigade Cholo Rally’ on March 7 in which he had said If the scooty has decided to topple in Nandigram, what can we do?” the memorandum stated.Hours after the TMC delegation visited EC, a BJP team comprising Union Minister Piyush Goyal and party general secretary Bhupender Yadav met poll panel officials and demanded an independent inquiry into Nandigram incident resulting into injury to the TMC president.The BJP delegation demanded a high-level probe into the alleged attack on West Bengal Chief Minister in Nandigram.Besides Goyal and Yadav, party leaders Sambit Patra, Anirban Ganguly and Swapan Dasgupta were also in the BJP delegation.Addressing reporters after the meeting, Yadav said the BJP has demanded an independent inquiry into the incident in West Bengal’s Nandigram on March 10 when Banerjee got injured.Yadav, a general secretary of the BJP, said, “The party also requested the election commission to make public the video of Banerjee’s rally in which she got injured.”   The BJP leader said once a candidate files nomination, the poll panel maintains a visual record of his public engagements.The saffron party also demanded that special observers be appointed for the Nandigram Assembly seat from where Banerjee is contesting against her protege-turned-adversary the BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari.Voting on the high-profile seat will take place on April 1.On Banerjee’s discharge from the SSKM hospital a doctor said “Her condition has improved a lot and she repeatedly insisted to be discharged from the hospital. She will be able to move with restrictions but she needs to come back for another round of check-up within a week.”   The TMC held silent protest rallies across West Bengal during the day in protest against alleged attack on their boss at Nandigram. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-bjp-delegations-meet-ec-over-attack-on-mamata-injured-tmc-chief-discharged-from-hospital-224240
12-03-2021||New Delhi||Quad has come of age and will be an important pillar for stability in the region: Modi||The four-nation grouping of Quad announced its arrival on the world stage with its first-ever summit meeting that announced three specific areas of cooperation to begin with.A joint statement, which indicated a complete convergence of views, outlined these areas as vaccine development, climate change and future technology which will be pushed forward by joint working groups.    The first initiative will be for vaccine development with India set to manufacture one billion doses of American vaccines that will be supplied to Pacific, South East Asian and Indian Ocean Rim countries.The US and Japan will bankroll the initiative, India will manufacture them and Australia will handle the last mile issues such as cold storages and training of health workers.“The historic nature is obvious. The four countries have upgraded the Quad conversation to the apex level which highlights their desire to step up international cooperation to address global challenges,” said Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla after the summit.However, both the US and India, while underlining their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, sought to ensure that it will not be openly hostile towards.On the same day as the Quad summit, India and China held a meeting on the border issue with the MEA stating that the agreement of disengagement in north and south bank of Pangong lake “provided good basis to work for early resolution of remaining issues”.Also China’s top foreign policy envoys, Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi, will meet US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and NSA in Alaska next week.The Quad has resolved to keep the momentum going by agreeing to hold an in-person summit later this year.“India has always said that Quad does not stand against something. It stands for something positive. The meeting has put at rest any speculation that it is directed against others,” maintained Shringla.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Quad has come of age and will remain an important pillar for stability in the region.“Our agenda today — covering areas like vaccines, climate change and emerging technologies — makes the Quad a force for global good. I see this positive vision as an extension of India’s ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which regards the world as one family,” said the PM at the first-ever summit of the Quad initiated by US President Joe Biden.With Vice President Kamala Harris by his side, Biden described a free and open Indo Pacific as essential to the futures of each of the countries and assured that the US is committed to working “with you, our partners, and all our allies in the region, to achieve stability”.South Block and the White House both said the virtual meeting of Quad countries, the first at leader level, shows the importance Biden places on the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-has-come-of-age-and-will-be-an-important-pillar-for-stability-in-the-region-modi-224238

12-03-2021||New Delhi||AICTE makes Physics, Chemistry and Maths optional for UG technical courses in some streams||Marking a major shift in education system, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the technical education regulator, has made Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM) optional for students opting for UG technical courses like biotechnology, textile or agriculture engineering However, PCM will continue to be important subjects for streams like mechanical engineering. Confirming this, AICTE chairperson Anil Sahasrabudhe said, “For streams like textile engineering, agriculture or may be biotechnology, the students will have an option of not studying the three subjects compulsorily in Class 12.”The revised regulation is in line with the National Education Policy vision that students should be offered more flexibility in their choice of subjects, especially in secondary school, so that they can chart their career and life path better, he added.The AICTE has listed PCM among 14 subjects wherefrom students can choose three and secure a minimum 45 per cent in each to take up engineering.They include physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, electronics, information technology, biology, informatics practices, biotechnology, technical vocational subject, engineering graphics, business studies, entrepreneurship. A student can study engineering if he gets minimum 45 per cent marks in any three of the above subjects including PCM but can be any other three subjects also. Stating that the new approval handbook offers a window of opportunity to those students who don’t study PCM in Class IX and XII, the chairperson also said that it is not mandatory on any state government or institution and they can continue with the admission policy based on PCM. Technical institutions can decide on which subjects to adopt.“The universities will offer suitable bridge courses such as mathematics, physics, engineering drawing, etc., for the students coming from diverse backgrounds to achieve desired learning outcomes of the programme,” according to the new regulation.Earlier there were reports that physics and mathematics were no longer compulsory for studying engineering as per the approval handbook for 2021-22 issued by AICTE. With two subjects being the core of all engineering courses, concerns were raised about “quality of engineers” the system would produce with many experts terming them “absolute essentials” for a course in engineering.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aicte-makes-physics-chemistry-and-maths-optional-for-ug-technical-courses-in-some-streams-224214

12-03-2021||Pune||Pune sees fresh curbs in light of rise in COVID-19 cases||Considering the recent spike in COVID-19 cases, the administration in Maharashtra’s Pune district has directed schools and colleges to remain shut till March 31 and curtailed the operating time for hotels and restaurants.According to the new set of restrictions, schools and colleges will remain closed till March 31, hotels and restaurants will be allowed to function till 10 pm, and food deliveries will be permitted till 11 pm, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said.The administration will ensure that the preparations for Class 10 and 12 board exams will not be affected at this time, he said.Hotels and restaurants will have to operate with 50 per cent seating capacity, and operators have been asked to put up a board displaying the number of patrons in the premises at any given time, the official said.Citizens will not be permitted to wander on city roads unnecessarily between 11 pm and 6 am, Rao said.Apart from this, only 50 persons will be permitted to gather at weddings, funerals and political and other social events, the official said, adding that stringent action will be taken by the police in case of violations.All public gardens and parks in Pune city will remain closed in the evenings, while they will be kept open in the mornings for “serious” morning walkers, he said.Malls and multiplexes will be allowed to operate till 11 pm, he said.The decision to impose additional curbs was taken during a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of the district.The authorities have also held a detailed discussion on COVID-19 vaccination in the city, Rao said.“As Pune city is witnessing a rise in active cases and daily count of infections is also high, the authorities plan to send a proposal to the Centre seeking a policy decision to inoculate people above the age of 18 in Pune, as an exception,” the official said.If the Centre decides to allocate additional vaccine doses, the preparedness of the local administration was also reviewed, he said.“According to the experts, if we inoculate people above 18 in Pune, we will be able to bring down the second wave of the pandemic here,” he added.He said a decision has been taken to increase the number of institutional isolation centres, while those in home isolation would be monitored closely.Speaking to reporters, Deputy CM Pawar said some tough decisions have to be taken as it was being seen that some people were not following COVID-19 protocols.He said the district had adequate number of hospital beds for COVID-19 treatment.Queried on the vaccination drive in Pune, Pawar said the number of cases were rising and more doses would be needed if everyone above the age of 18 was to be inoculated within city limits.“I have asked Pune MP Girish Bapat and Maval MP Srirang Barne to raise this issue in Parliament. I will also ask MPs like Amol Kolhe, Supriya Sule to raise the issue,” the Deputy CM said.Pune district on Thursday reported 2,840 coronavirus cases that took its tally of infections to 4,28,344. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pune-sees-fresh-curbs-in-light-of-rise-in-covid-19-cases-224206

12-03-2021||Kanpur (UP)||Death of rape victim’s father: Kanpur police look into suicide angle||The police here on Friday ordered an inquiry into allegations that the father of a 13-year-old gang-rape victim committed suicide after he felt humiliated by the policemen probing the case.The man was on Wednesday knocked dead by a truck outside a health centre in Ghatampur area here where his daughter was undergoing a medical examination.His family members have alleged that he was killed in a planned manner. While the police were probing these allegations, another relative claimed that the man committed suicide after being humiliated by policemen probing the rape case.Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Preetinder Singh said Superintendent of Police (rural) Brajesh Srivastava has been asked to conduct the inquiry and thoroughly probe charges of humiliation following reports that the manner in which policemen dealt with the case “perhaps” drove the rape survivor’s father to take the extreme step.The SP has also been instructed to probe the allegations that the girl was repeatedly asked objectionable questions at the health centre where she was taken for medical examination and that questions were raised about her character, the officer said.The SP has been asked to probe all charges and submit the fact-finding report within the stipulated time, he added.Singh, however, defended his men and said women police personnel spoke to the girl. He said every victim has to be asked certain questions to know what exactly happened with them and ascertain charges against the accused.“No evidence has so far been found which indicates that the rape survivor’s father was so frustrated with the police that he might have committed suicide,” he said.He added that any police personnel found guilty of insensitivity or negligence during the probe would not be spared.According to the police, the 13-year-old girl was allegedly abducted and raped by two men, identified as Golu Yadav and Deepu Yadav, in Sajeti area here on Monday when she had gone out to collect fodder for cattle.Both the accused have been arrested.A third accused, Saurabh Yadav, who is the brother of main accused Golu, is at large, the police said.Five police teams have been formed to arrest Saurabh, who allegedly intimidated the girl’s family, DIG Singh said.Four policemen have been suspended so far. While three were suspended for negligence in probing the gang-rape case and the death of the victim’s father, the fourth, Sub-Inspector (SI) Devendra Yadav, who is Golu’s father, was suspended after he was found absent from duty in Jalaun during Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s visit.Speaking to PTI on phone, DIG Singh confirmed the suspensions.Yadav has also been booked for the murder of the rape survivor’s father after her family members lodged a complaint alleging that the SI hatched a conspiracy to kill him and make it look like a road accident.However, so far, no action has been initiated against Yadav in the case.The action against him would be decided only after the probe confirms his involvement in the alleged murder, the police said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-of-rape-victims-father-kanpur-police-look-into-suicide-angle-224198
12-03-2021||New Delhi||SC issues notice to Centre on BJP leader’s plea to open Kashi, Mathura temple disputes||Sixteen months after paving the way for the construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya, the Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by a BJP leader’s petition seeking to open Kashi and Mathura temple disputes.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Centre to respond to Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay’s petition challenging the validity of certain provisions of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which said the character of religious places—except the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid at Ayodhya—at the time of Independence can’t be changed.Courts at Varanasi and Mathura are already seized of petitions on the issue. The petition is being seen as an attempt to start a fresh legal battle to reclaim disputed religious sites at Kashi, Mathura and some other places.Represented by senior advocates Vikas Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, the BJP leader alleged that the 1991-law creates an “arbitrary and irrational retrospective cut-off date” of August 15, 1947, for maintaining the character of the places of worship or pilgrimage against encroachment done by “fundamentalist-barbaric invaders and law-breakers”.Sections 2, 3, 4 of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 be set aside on grounds including that these provisions take away the right of a judicial remedy to reclaim a place of worship of any person or a religious group, the petition contended.Earlier, ‘Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh’ had moved the top court in June 2020 challenging the validity of the 1991 Act.Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind—which works for Islamic causes—has already moved the top court against the Mahasangh’s plea, saying it will open floodgates of litigation against countless mosques.In its plea filed in June last year, it had urged the top court not to entertain Mahasangh’s petition. “Even issuance of notice in the present matter will create fear in the minds of the Muslim community with regard to their places of worship, especially in the aftermath of the Ayodhya dispute and will destroy the secular fabric of the nation,” Jamiat had said in its intervention application.In its unanimous November 9 verdict, a five-judge Bench headed by the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had described the 1991 Act as a legislative instrument designed to protect the secular features of Indian polity.But now the Mahasabha and Upadhyay have sought directions to declare Section 4 of the 1991 Act unconstitutional. The Mahasabha contended the top court’s remarks were mere observations without any judicial force as the Act was not under challenge before it.“The impugned Act has barred the right and remedy against encroachment made on religious property of Hindus exercising might of power by followers of another faith,” it said.By making the impugned provision, Parliament has without resolution of the dispute, through process of court, abated the suit and proceedings, which is perse unconstitutional and beyond its law making power, it said.Parliament cannot restrain Hindu devotees from getting back their religious places of worship through the judicial process, the plea said.It cannot make any law that takes away or abridges the vested religious right of devotees and cannot make any law with retrospective effect, it said, invoking the fundamental right to religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.Mahasabha said Parliament cannot restrain Hindu devotees to get back their religious places of worship through the judicial process and cannot make any law that takes away or abridges the vested religious right of devotees and cannot make any law with retrospective effect.Upadhyay submitted that the Centre has barred the remedies against illegal encroachment on places of worship and pilgrimage of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs, who cannot file a suit or approach a high court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-bjp-leaders-plea-to-open-kashi-mathura-temple-disputes-224197

12-03-2021||New Delhi||Government launches ‘mera ration’ mobile app under ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ programme||The government on Friday launched “mera ration” mobile app under “One Nation One Ration Card” programme that aims at nationwide portability of ration cards under National Food Security Act (NFSA).Currently the ONORC covers 32 states and UTs. The integration of remaining four states, West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Assam, is expected to be completed in next few months, said Sudhanshu Pandey, Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution.Pandey said the app will especially benefit those ration card holders who move to new areas for livelihoods.“The system which was started initially in four states in August 2019 has been swiftly rolled out in 32 states and UTs by December 2020,” he said.Currently it covers nearly 69 crore NFSA beneficiaries (about 86% NFSA population) in the country and a monthly average of about 1.5-1.6 crore portability transactions are being recorded under ONORC. It has proved value-added service to each NFSA beneficiary during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly migrants, which allowed them to avail the benefit of subsidised foodgrains with flexibility from any location wherever they were during the lockdown and crisis period.During the period April 2020 to February 2021, a total of about 15.4 crore portability transactions have been recorded under ONORC. With regards to reaching out to migrant NFSA beneficiaries, he said that the department is collaborating with other ministries and departments.  “The system allows all NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrant beneficiaries, to claim either full or part foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country through existing ration card with biometric/Aadhaar authentication in a seamless manner. The system also allows their family members back home, if any, to claim the balance foodgrains on the same the ration card,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-launches-mera-ration-mobile-app-under-one-nation-one-ration-card-programme-224191

Responding whether the FCI’ decision on land records in Punjab could affect procurement and transfer of MSP benefits to farmers, they said officials at village level, like patwari, could provide details.“It is important to know exact yield from a piece of land. A transparent method is important to ensure the benefits reach right hands—that is, farmers,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-to-ascertain-age-of-crops-being-brought-to-mandis%C2%A0stop-recycling-of-grains-from-previous-crop-years-224187
12-03-2021||New Delhi||TMC says Modi knew of conspiracy to physically hurt Mamata||Sticking to the story that a conspiracy was hatched to “attack” West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram, the Trinamool Congress on Friday named Prime Minister Narendra Modi as among those who were in the know of things.A memorandum submitted to ECI here by a TMC parliamentary delegation cited comment made by Modi in his March 7 address in Kolkata. Making fun of Mamata’s unsuccessful attempt to ride a battery operated two-wheeler to protest against fuel price hike, Modi had said: “If your scooty falls in Nandigram, what can we do”.The comment by the prime minister showed that a plan was underway to assault Mamata at Nandigram, the memorandum said. The memorandum also cited a meme posted by BJP state president Dilip Ghosh of Mamata fleeing from Bhabanipur (her old constituency) and landing in Nandigram with a thud as yet another evidence that there was a conspiracy to physically hurt Mamata at Nandigram.The TMC memorandum also cited a tweet by BJP Member of Parliament Saumitra Khan and claimed that posted soon after the DGP was transferred, the tweet was an indication that “something grave was planned and in the offing”.On the eyewitness accounts, reported by TV channels, saying Mamara got hurt when the open door of her moving SUV slammed shut after hitting an iron pole hurting Mamata who was sitting on the front seat and greeting people, the memorandum claimed that the eyewitnesses were associates of Suvendu Adikari, BJP candidate who has challenged Mamata in Nandigram.TMC claimed there was a clear nexus between the post by Dilip Ghosh on Facebook, complaints against the DGP Virendra by BJP and removal of Virendra from DGP’s office by ECI, plan revealed by Saumitra Khan on twitter, absence of local police and District SP during Mamata’s Nandigram tour and the eyewitnesses planted by Suvendu Adhikari.While stating that Mamata, though in hospital, remains stable and in good spirit, the TMC memorandum reiterated that the attack was a “deep rooted conspiracy” and urged the ECI for an “immediate, thorough and unbiased investigation” into the incident.The delegation consisted of six MPs including senior leader Saugata Roy of Lok Sabha and Derek O’Brien, party’s leader in Rajya Sabha.Talking to reporters, Roy, when asked about the stinging letter sent by ECI to the TMC on Thursday saying TMC’s charge against the ECI of working at the behest of BJP was below its dignity to even answer, Roy said the letter was written by a Secretary but today they met the whole Election Commission including CEC Sunil Arora.Roy said the issue of administrative control of the state during elections was raised during the meeting and ECI said they supervised the election related issues only.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-says-modi-knew-of-conspiracy-to-physically-hurt-mamata-224185

She said though she has the tenure of an apex court judge for less than three years but she is leaving with a great sense of satisfaction.Justice Malhotra, thanked the CJI and the members of the bar and said “I am very blessed to be a part of the institution”.“I can understand the feeling which one goes through on the last day. We will hear her speech on some other day,” said the CJI, who headed the bench comprising Justice Malhotra and Justice AS Bopanna.Attorney General KK Venugopal said that it is very unfortunate that judges of the Supreme Court have to retire at the age of 65.“We all will miss a great judge,” Venugopal said while praising Justice Malhotra.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, who is also the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, agreed with Venugopal’s view and said judges of the apex court should not retire at the age of 65.“65 year is the age when you are at the peak. There is no reason why judges (of the apex court) should retire at 65 years,” Singh said.                        He said, “demand of the bar is that there should be an immediate replacement at the bench by a lady member”.“She (Justice Malhotra) is an icon and she is a motivation for young as well as lady members of the bar,” Singh said.Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, P S Narasimha, V Mohana and other lawyers also praised Justice Malhotra for the grace, dignity and patience with which she did her work as a judge of the apex court and also as a member of the bar before being elevated to the bench.Malhotra, who was designated as a senior advocate in 2007, became the first woman lawyer to directly enter the top judiciary as a judge on April 26, 2018. With her retirement, Justice Indira Banerjee remains the only woman judge in the top court. The first woman to be appointed as a judge of the apex court was Justice M Fathima Beevi in 1989, 39 years after the Supreme Court was set up in 1950.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-know-any-finer-judge-than-justice-indu-malhotra-cji-224174
12-03-2021||Kolkata||Bengali theatre actor dropped from play after joining BJP||A theatre group in West Bengal,   known for its productions on socio-economic themes, has dropped an artiste from a play after the actor joined the BJP.Saurav Palodhi, whose 'Ghum Nei', an adaptation of the Utpal Dutt classic on the present political situation of the country through the prism of Left ideology, had posted on his official Facebook account that the artiste, Kaushik Kar, was removed from the production for joining the saffron party.Kar, had been invited by Palodhi's group Ichcheymoto' in 2019, to play a character whose name had a reference to the victim who was lynched in 2015 Dadri case on suspicion of eating beef.Palodhi, known to be a Leftist, posted on Facebook three days back in Bengali "We are removing Kaushik Kar from 'Ghum Nei' with immediate effect because he has joined the BJP. And that is enough reason to remove him in the present times. There can be no place for communal elements in a play for the working class".The theatre group would soon announce the date for the next show of 'Ghum Nei'.The post triggered a storm in social media with netizens like Arka Roy saying "Is it the example of artistic freedom? Democratic right? Can an artist be judged by his Leftist or Rightist leanings? ......It should be left to the person concerned which political party he or she should join.None has the right to interfere."Director Kamaleswar Mukherjee said, "So far I am concerned my casting had never been influenced by anyone's political beliefs or colours."Palodhi said he stood by the decision "as the play is fundamentally against BJP's ideology and someone associated with that party cannot be part of 'Ghum Nei'."Associating Koushik Kar with the production, despite being aware of his current political identity, will be grave injustice to the spirit of the play and the working class for whom it is meant."Describing the entire episode as a manifestation of "Left-wing Fascism", Kar said, "Only armchair elites, giving lecture on communism, having no connect with the masses and ignorant about the history of progressive cultural movement can take such a decision."I am shocked at the unilateral decision."

12-03-2021||New Delhi March 12||CPI(M) calls upon cadre to ensure victory of ‘democratic and secular forces’||The CPI(M) has called upon its cadres in the country to ensure victory of the Left, democratic and secular forces in the forthcoming Assembly elections in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Puducherry and the Autonomous District Council elections across the state in Tripura.The party feels giving a ticket to a clutch of young leaders, including the sitting head of Students’ Union of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Aishe Ghosh, in West Bengal would help garner votes for Sanyukt Morcha nominees in the state.The Left, including CPI(M) and CPI, the Congress and Indian Secular Front (ISF), headed by a Muslim cleric Abbas Siddiqui, are constituents of an alliance named Sanyuk Morcha.The Left is focused on West Bengal from where they were dethroned by the present ruling TMC after more than three decades of their rule.The CPI(M) called upon its cadre following a meeting of its Polit Bureau which discussed the forthcoming polls in the states.“The main focus of the CPI(M) shall be to defeat the BJP which is essential for people’s welfare in the concerned states and for the unity and integrity of India as a whole,” the party’s communique said.CPI(M), which leads the Left Front in West Bengal and, ipso facto, is leader of the Morcha, has fielded Ghosh from Jamuria and the state president of Democratic Youth Federation of India Meenakshi Mukherjee from Nandigram.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and BJP heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari are in the fray in Nandigram.Ghosh had shot into the limelight for her anti-establishment actions, and attack on her and other student leaders by outsiders on the JNU campus in January last year.Dipsita Dhar, another JNU student leader, State SFI Secretary Srijan Bhattacharya DYFI, and state president of SFI Pratikur Rahaman are among other youth leaders who have been given tickets by the CPI(M).The Polit Bureau also reiterated the party’s support to farmers’ agitation against the farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpim-calls-upon-cadre-to-ensure-victory-of-democratic-and-secular-forces-224169

12-03-2021||New Delhi||SC seeks Centre’s response on plea for appointment of regular CBI director||The Supreme Court on Friday sought response from the Centre on a plea seeking direction for  appointment of a regular CBI director.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat issued notice on the plea filed by NGO Common Cause, which has alleged that the government has failed to appoint a regular CBI director as per section 4A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, on the expiry of term of Rishi Kumar Shukla on February 2.It had said that government had instead appointed Praveen Sinha as an interim director of the premier investigating agency.“We are issuing notice. We will have it after two weeks,” the bench said.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the NGO, said the work of the CBI is suffering because of this and the court could have the matter next week.The top court said that next week the bench is not available as it would be sitting in the Maratha reservation matter and for that reason it is listing the case after two weeks. Bhushan said the court could ask them (Centre) to at least convene the meeting of the selection committee.“We will hear them. We are issuing notice,” the bench said.The plea, filed through Bhushan, has also sought a direction to the Centre to initiate and complete the process of selection of the CBI director well in advance, at least one to two months before the date on which the vacancy to the post is about to occur.

They are demanding that at least one Muslim candidate from any of district’s four unreserved assembly constituencies should be put up as an independent candidate.In Nalhati assembly constituency also the sitting MLA Moinuddin Shams has been ignored and the ticket has been given to Rajendra Prasad Singh. Shams called TMC “B team of BJP” and said his only crime was that he was a Muslim.In Uluberia Purba assembly seat, sitting MLA Idris Ali has been denied ticket. Former footballer Bidesh Bose has been named as TMC candidate from the constituency.Similarly, the Labpur seat, where a Muslim candidate from TMC was victorious in 2016, has been given to a Hindu candidate.Overall, there are 16 assembly constituencies in the state where Hindu candidates nominated by the TMC have replaced Muslim candidates put up by the party in 2016.The TMC had given nomination to 57 Muslim candidates in 2016, an increase of 19 over the 38 tickets given to Muslim candidates in 2011. This time, the party has given ticket to 44 Muslims, 13 less than 2016.Kolkata-based senior journalist Anirban Bhattacharya said that relentless attack by BJP accusing her of “Muslim appeasement” may have prompted Mamata to reduce the number of Muslim candidates from TMC.“For a while now that Banerjee has been asserting her religious identity as a Hindu by demonstrating her familiarity with Hindu religious practices. In March last year, she had even challenged PM Narendra Modi and HM Amit Shah in a Sanskrit mantra chanting contest,” Bhattacharya said.Pictures of Mamata wearing a hijab and offering namaz that were once circulated widely and even featured in a railway advertisement have disappeared from Kolkata streets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muslim-aspirants-upset-over-denial-of-ticket-by-mamata-224161
12-03-2021||New Delhi||Mobile seized after Delhi Police approach Tihar authorities in Ambani bomb scare probe||A mobile phone suspected to have been used for operating a Telegram channel to claim responsibility for a terror threat has been seized from Tihar Jail, after the Delhi Police's Special Cell approached prison authorities in connection with the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare probe.On Thursday, a senior Mumbai police official said a Telegram channel through which an organisation named Jaish-ul-Hind had claimed responsibility for placing an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Ambani's residence in Mumbai last month was "created in the Tihar" area of Delhi.The Delhi Police's Special Cell had approached the Tihar Jail administration on Thursday after the new angle emerged, according to official sources."Tihar Jail authorities have seized a mobile phone which is suspected to have been used for operating Telegram channel used to claim responsibility for terror acts/ threats," the Delhi Police said on Friday."Based on information provided by the Special Cell, Tihar Jail authorities have seized a mobile phone from a jail where certain terror convicts are lodged. It is suspected that this phone has been used for operating Telegram channels used recently for claiming responsibility for terror acts/ threats," said Pramod Singh Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).The officer said further investigation and forensic analysis will be done after the mobile handset and details of the seizure are received from Tihar Jail authorities.The Mumbai Police took the help of a private cyber agency to track the location of the phone on which the Telegram channel was created, the senior Mumbai Police official had said.During the investigation, the location of the phone was traced near Delhi's Tihar Jail, he added.A Mahindra Scorpio SUV with gelatin sticks was found parked near "Antilia", the multi-storey residence of Ambani, in south Mumbai on February 25.According to police sources, the Telegram channel was created on February 26 and the message claiming responsibility for placing the vehicle outside Ambani's residence was posted on the Telegram messaging app late in the night on February 27.The message had also demanded payment in cryptocurrency and mentioned a link to deposit the same.During the probe, the link was found as "not available", due to which the investigators suspected it to be mischievous, the official said.On February 28, another message from Jaish-ul-Hind surfaced on a social media platform, claiming that the organisation did not have any role in the incident.The investigation in the case was initially conducted by the Crime Branch of the Mumbai police.After the mysterious death of Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV that was later found parked outside Ambani's residence, the probe was transferred to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).On Monday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case related to the recovery of the explosives-laden vehicle.

12-03-2021||Kolkata||Attacks and injuries shaped Mamata’s political career||Mamata Banerjee has earned for herself the image of the gutsy political leader, who has weathered physical attacks and injuries in her four-decade-long career to emerge stronger in her public life.Her comebacks after such incidents saw her attacking her opposition with greater ferocity.The TMC supremo’s image as a fearless fighter, endowed with nerves of steel and political acumen who can become one with legions of her supporters, took shape after one such deadly attack when she was hit on the head by a CPI-M youth leader in 1990 and had to be confined to a hospital bed for an entire month.Again in July 1993 Banerjee, then a Youth Congress member, she was beaten up by the police when she leads a rally to Writers’ Buildings, the erstwhile secretariat, demanding voter photo identity cards.The rallyists had clashed with the police prompting the force to fire killing 14 Youth Congress activists.Banerjee was beaten up and then too she was under treatment in the hospital for a few weeks.The Bengal chief minister, who is presently facing one of the toughest political battles of her career, is in the hospital yet again with her leg in a cast and complaints of chest pain after being injured in an alleged attack on Wednesday night at Nandigram hours after she filed her nomination for the seat.Banerjee has said that she was attacked by four to five men on that day.The battle is crucial this time as BJP, which has emerged as the main opposition, has thrown down the gauntlet and aims to stop her from returning to power for the third straight time.Nandigram is where she will take on her former protege and now BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. The place had played a significant role in her career as the historic anti-farmland acquisition movement led by her party there in 2007 in the face of violence and police bullets saw her emerging as a giant slayer.Riding the crest of the movement, she had led TMC to defeat the longest-serving democratically elected communist regime of the world in 2011. The CPI-M-led Left Front had to bite the dust that year in West Bengal after helming the state for 34 long years.A quick look at the 66-year-old leader’s political journey in the mid-1970s shows how injuries and physical assaults have shaped her political career over the years.Banerjee, then Youth Congress leader, first came into the limelight after defeating CPI(M) stalwart and former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee from Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency in 1984 riding the sympathy wave following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. She, however, lost the 1989 Parliamentary polls.The attack on her on August 16, 1990, by DYFI leader Lalu Alam, who hit her on the head with a stick, had taken place at Hazra crossing in the city, the scene of many of her agitations, near her Kalighat residence.The attack had fractured her skull. The incident had made her a household name in the state and one of the tallest mass leaders of West Bengal Congress on the same pedestal as stalwarts like A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury, Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi and Somen Mitra. Banerjee was in her 30s then.Three years later in January 1993, Banerjee, then president of the state Youth Congress, had stormed into Writers’ Buildings with a hearing-and speech-impaired girl heavily pregnant after being raped by a CPI-M man.She had led a three-hour-long dharna in front of the chambers of the then chief minister Jyoti Basu alleging that the rapist had not been arrested because of his political affiliations.Banerjee had sat with the victim on the floor virtually laying a siege on the chief minister’s office demanding immediate arrest of the rapist and an audience from Basu.After the police failed to persuade her, a huge contingent of the force had reached Writers’ Buildings, dragged her by the hair, put her in a prison van and whisked her to the nearby Lalbazar central police lock-up.In 2000-01, just two years after she broke away from the Congress and formed Trinamool Congress, her vehicle was repeatedly attacked at Keshpur and Chamakaitala in West Midnapore district, where several TMC workers were killed during the bloody turf war between the party and CPI(M).Crude bombs were hurled at her car in 2001 when she visited Choto Angaria in West Midnapore where 11 workers of her party had been killed in political clashes.In 2006 and 2007 Banerjee was attacked on several occasions by alleged CPI(M) goons who threw bombs and fired at her car to stop her entry into Nandigram - then a battlefield due to the anti-farm land acquisition movement.In 2006 during her protest outside the office of the block development officer at Singur, she was dragged by the police and removed from the spot.In 2010 during her tenure as Railway Minister, a car in Banerjee’s convoy was hit by a truck. The TMC supremo was returning from a rally at the then Maoist bastion of Lalgarh and had alleged that it was an attempt on her life.Such incidents, however, did not occur since TMC came to power in 2011 and Banerjee became the chief minister until Wednesday’s attack at Nandigram.The attacks on her had been greeted with derision by her political opponents.CPI-M had on several occasions alleged that Banerjee had herself scripted the “dramas” of being attacked to gain sympathy.The TMC has claimed that Wednesday’s incident was a “well-planned conspiracy” by BJP to “remove” her from the poll campaign.“Mamata Banerjee is a fighter. The more you attack her she makes a comeback with more ferocity,” TMC leader Sougata Roy said.Banerjee has described herself as a “street fighter” many times in the past.“Many people don’t want her to campaign for the elections. They want her to be removed from their path. The BJP should be ashamed that it has stooped so low that its supporters are attacking a woman,” Roy said.The BJP has denied the allegation and said Banerjee is only trying to get sympathy votes.West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Thursday demanded a CBI probe into the attack on Banerjee at Nandigram saying that it needs to be seen whether the incident was a “well-scripted drama” to garner votes.“The people of the state have seen such a drama earlier too”, he added.The Congress too has been critical about the alleged attack on Banerjee at Nandigram.Its state party president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had on Wednesday accused her of resorting to “hypocrisy and theatrics” to gain public sympathy ahead of the assembly polls.Chowdhury, who is also the Congress’ leader in Lok Sabha, said Banerjee is “feeling the heat” in Nandigram and is thus resorting to “stunts and drama”.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attacks-and-injuries-shaped-mamatas-political-career-224143
12-03-2021||New York||Kamala Harris to participate in Quad summit with Modi||US Vice President Kamala Harris will also participate in the first Quad summit with President Joe Biden and Prime Ministers Narendra Modi of India, Scott Morrison of Australia and Yoshihide Suga of Japan on Friday, according to the White House.The virtual summit is scheduled for 8.30 am in Washington and 7 pm in Delhi (10.30 pm in Canberra and 12.30 am on Saturday in Tokyo). Reporters will be allowed to see the opening of the meeting, according to the White House schedules for Biden and Harris.Biden’s spokesperson Jen Psaki said that National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan would give a readout of the meeting at noon (10.30 pm India time).Harris has had limited personal exposure to international leaders and has started a round of talks with some of them, starting with President Emmanuel Macaron of France and Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau of Canada and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.According to readouts, they discussed a wide range of regional and global issues during the one-on-one calls.Introducing her during their visit to the State Department, Biden said that Harris was committed to “crafting a foreign policy that puts diplomacy first and that keeps our nation safe and delivers real results to the American people”.Most of Harris’s political career has been in California and during her four years in the Senate, she gained direct exposure to international affairs as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.She is reported to be planning regular lunches with Secretary of State Antony Blinken to deepen her familiarity with the nitty-gritty of foreign policy.Modi and Harris will probably be face-to-face, though virtually, for the first time on Friday as there does not appear to be a record of any meetings between them.After her election, Modi had tweeted: “Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chithis, but also for all Indian-Americans.” ‘Chithis’ as it is pronounced, is the Tamil term for aunts who are mother’s younger sisters and Harris used the word to include them while acknowledging her extended family in her speech accepting the Democratic Party nomination for vice president.Harris has been frosty towards the current Indian government. While a Senator she criticised External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar for refusing to meet with the House Foreign Affairs Committee because it wanted to include Indian-American Pramila Jayapal, a critic of Modi’s government, in the meeting although she is not a member of the committee.Harris’s niece Meena recently got involved in the farmers’ agitation in India tweeting support for it even though she has not opposed conditions in the US similar to what the Indian farmers are against.

Military Commanders of the two sides, who last met on February 20, will meet next after an understanding at the WMCC is reached on the next steps of the process.There has been visible disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops along both banks of the Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake, along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. The next two steps called de-escalation and de-induction — which means pulling back troops and war equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases — have not yet begun in the area.The need to go to the WMCC arose as the military commander-level could not arrive at a time-line of the phased de-escalation and de-induction. There has been no forward movement on the two issues, said sources, adding lack of trust on either side.The first phase of the disengagement process commenced on February 10, as both sides commenced withdrawal from the banks of Pangong Tso. It is stalled at the next phase of de-escalation and de-induction. The matters of disengagement at Depsang, Gogra or Hot Springs were slated to come up in subsequent talks. The WMCC will discuss this. Minister of External Affairs had spoken to his counterpart Wang Yi. The military is cautious as the snowmelt will open up several mountain passes by April. Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, speaking at an event of a think tank in New Delhi in February, sounded a word of caution: “We now have to go on to the stage of de-escalation, then deinduction of troops.” The present positions of troops, tanks or guns are not face to face, but they are within the striking range of artillery fire and from where rapid redeployment is possible.Snowmelt to open passes by April2nd squadron of Rafale in a monthThe Indian Air Force will by mid-April raise the second squadron of the Rafale fighter jets at Hasimara in northern part of West Bengal. Five jets are expected to arrive in India from France and these will be based in Hasimara.

The high-burden states, it said, needed to prioritise vaccinations.The surges have been high in six states in particular. The daily new cases in Punjab grew around 4.5 times between February 11 and March 11, from 2,112 to 9,402. The rise is around six-fold when compared with 1,388 cases in the first week of February. With around 8,000 cases and over 100 deaths reported over the past one week, Punjab appears headed towards a spike worst than the one in September last when over 60,000 cases were reported in a month. The active cases too have shot up five times—from around 2,000 in February first week to almost 10,000 today. The state today also saw imposition of night curfew in Patiala and Ludhiana districts in view of the rising cases.The government said India had seen active cases as high as 10 lakh on September 18 last and the situation nationally was overall in control, except in six states.The eight of the country’s 10 highest active case burden districts are in Maharashtra and one each in Kerala and Karnataka. The government said Haryana, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were at a tipping point and were yet to enter a surge, said Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan. In MP, daily cases have risen from 1,951 on February 11 to 3,915 on March 11; corresponding period rise in Haryana is 824 to 2,440 and in Gujarat from 1,800 to 3,529.On vaccinations, the government said the speed was satisfactory with 2,56,90,545 doses administered till today morning. Globally, India is second only to the US on the speed and scale of inoculation.As of March 9, the US had delivered 9.36 crore doses followed by India (2.43 crore) and the UK (2.37 crore).“The signs from Maharashtra are very worrying. Do not take the virus for granted. It can come up unexpectedly. We also need to caution Delhi as many adjoining districts like Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budhh Nagar are seeing surges,” the government said.Punjab fears 3,000 cases a dayPunjab health officials said the state may see the worst spike by March-end with cases expected to soar to 3,000 a day. The state has recorded around 8,000 cases and over 100 deaths in a week.PM’s mother takes jabPM Narendra Modi’s mother Hiraben, a centenarian, took her first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday.

The BJP demanded a CBI inquiry to ascertain if the incident was “staged”.Battleground BengalWas badly hurt, felt severe pain... will campaign even on a wheelchair. — Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief MinisterThe TMC has pointed out that the incident took place within 24 hours of the EC “summarily” removing and replacing the state DGP “at the behest of the BJP”.A letter submitted to CEO, West Bengal, in Kolkata by TMC leaders Partha Chatterjee, Derek O’Brien and Chandrima Bhattacharya cited the absence of local police and SP at the spot of the “assault” despite Mamata being a “Z-plus protectee”.Noting that the ADGP (Law & Order) had also been replaced, the TMC criticised “deliberate transfers” at the top echelons of police.How a Z-plus protectee gets attacked? Order a CBI probe to bring out the truth. — Dilip Ghosh, West Bengal BJP chief A picture posted on social media by her nephew Abhishek Banerjee showed the CM lying on a hospital bed with her left foot cast in plaster strung to an iron stand. “The Chief Minister has severe bony injuries in her left ankle and foot, besides injuries in right shoulder, forearm and neck. She is stable now but is having severe pain in the injured leg,” a senior doctor at the state-run SSKM Hospital said.The TMC alleged it appeared there was a nexus between a complaint by the BJP against the erstwhile DGP and his removal by the EC and the absence of the SP and local police during Mamata’s tour on Wednesday.Describing the “attack” a deep-rooted conspiracy to murder Banerjee, the TMC asked for an immediate investigation. The TMC also announced that 12 party MPs—six each from the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha—would meet the Election Commission in Delhi on Friday.The BJP also submitted a memorandum to the CEO and asked for a detailed enquiry and to make the relevant video footage public. “We are concerned that how such an incident could have occurred, especially when Director and Additional Director (Security) were both present at the spot,” the BJP letter said, pointing out the presence in Mamata’s entourage of two senior IPS officers who were in charge of her security.Purba Medinipur DM Vibhu Goel and SP Praveen Prakash visited Birulia Bazar, where the incident took place, and talked to local people on Thursday morning. Goel said he was collecting eyewitness accounts for sending across a report to the EC.Mamata Banerjee submitted her nomination papers at Haldia (to contest from Nandigram) and went to Nandigram from there to campaign. She was reportedly injured when her vehicle door slammed shut on her. Banerjee alleged it was a conspiracy and claimed four-five men pushed the door to hurt her.Opposition parties—Congress, BJP and CPM—have alleged that the Chief Minister was enacting a drama to gain sympathy. TMC workers are holding protests at various places of the state on the issue.No bias, says Election Commission||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-attacks-ec-as-didi-lands-in-hospital-oppn-calls-it-drama-223986
12-03-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Quad meet today, focus on ‘common threat’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 11The first-ever Quad summit to be held on Friday is as much a consequence of China’s 360 degree attempt to simultaneously settle its boundaries as it is of videoconferencing getting acceptance in the interplay of diplomacy.Leaders from the US, Japan, India and Australia will hold a virtual summit. The agenda will be wide-ranging, but the focus will be on countering the “common threat”.China has accepted the inevitability of Quad as is clear from its toned down reaction to the meeting of the US President with PMs of Japan, Australia and India.A Chinese spokesperson merely “hoped” that Quad would only do things that “are conducive to regional peace, stability and prosperity rather than the opposite”. This is a far cry from the frenzied demarches it had served on the very same participants in a joint naval exercise over a decade ago.Quad’s interactions by videoconferencing accelerated a process that would have taken a couple of years, given the scheduling difficulties of some of the world’s busiest leaders.So far, Quad has not done anything substantial beyond adding a couple of Indian naval boats to what military allies Japan, Australia and the US were already doing. The group sail of naval boats through contentious maritime territory has been going on since Beijing entered the game of occupying and militarising islands in South China Sea and East China Sea that had been conducted till the 90s by mostly US allies.Quad is a continuation of the change in the US foreign policy outlook after 2001, when the Pentagon had to look beyond its traditional military allies in Asia.NATO countries assisted the US in the Asian theatre, from Afghanistan to Iraq. But their weak military footprint in East and South Asia led the US to reach out to India after its credibility in Pakistan military began souring.The casualties India suffered in Galwan Valley puts a premium on the defence side, but as previous Quad ministerial meetings have noted, the balancing with China needs to be multi vector.1st virtual summit between PM, President Biden||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-meet-today-focus-on-common-threat-223994

If we look at the list of candidates in Cachar district, we can see candidates who will help in smuggling of illegal drugs, various weapons, etc,” he was quoted as saying after senior leader Himanta Biswa Sarma failed to convince rebel leaders of the Barak valley to not contest as independents. They include Paul, former Union minister Kabindra Purkayastha’s son Kanad Purkayastha and two sitting MLAs. BJP leaders, who call such rumblings “an expected feature of any election”, denied any trouble in the state leadership.Over Rs 4 lakh seized in Cachar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-dilemma-over-cm-face-in-assam-223996

As farmers we will continue with our protests against the farm laws,” said Tikait, who will be addressing meetings in Kolkata, Nandigram, Singur and Asansol.“We are waiting for the talks to restart,” the BKU leader added.Tikait said the SKM had decided to slash the delegation for talks drastically from 40-odd organisations to nine-member delegation.“They (SKM) have decided to make a small committee to speak to the government. A 40-person delegation is a large group. We (BKU) will also be part of that delegation,” he said.However, while he is open to talks, Tikait is adamant that the SKM will plead with the Bengal voters to vote against the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rakesh-tikait-in-bengal-today-to-launch-anti-bjp-campaign-223997

This is utterly false and mischievous to circulate a wrong impression in the ensuing elections. I would like to reiterate that the EVMs are most credible and I have no doubt about its efficacy and reliability. Electronic Voting Machine is indeed our nation’s pride and that there cannot be any doubt whatsoever about its credibility,” the statement said.The FIR has also been lodged under the IPC Section 500 (punishment for defamation) and Representation of the People Act 1951 Section 128 (maintenance of secrecy of voting), 134(breach of official duty in connection with elections), the statement said."Investigation has been initiated in this matter and stern action will be taken against the miscreants who have uploaded fake news to create wrong impressions about the election process," it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stern-action-against-fake-news-says-ec-over-evm-hacking-claims-223773

During the investigation, the location of the phone was traced to near Delhi’s Tihar Jail, he added.A Mahindra Scorpio with gelatin sticks was found parked near Antilia, the multi-storey residence of Ambani, in south Mumbai on February 25.According to police sources, the Telegram channel was created on February 26 and the message claiming responsibility for placing the vehicle outside Ambani’s residence was posted on the Telegram messaging app late in the night on February 27.The message had also demanded payment in cryptocurrency and mentioned a link to deposit it.During the probe, the link was found as “not available”, due to which the investigators suspected it to be mischievous, the official said.On February 28, another message from Jaish-ul-Hind surfaced on a social media platform, claiming that the organisation did not have any role in the incident.The investigation in the case was initially conducted by the Crime Branch of the Mumbai police.After the mysterious death of Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV that was later found parked outside Ambani’s residence, the probe was transferred to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad.On Monday, the National Investigation Agency took over the case related to the recovery of the explosives-laden vehicle.

12-03-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee stable, say doctors||Doctors treating West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was stable but had low sodium in her blood.    Banerjee claimed she was recently attacked while she was campaigning for the state's high-decibel assembly elections. A photo shared by her nephew Abhishek Banerjee on Wednesday evening showed her sitting on a hospotal bed with a cast on her leg. Videos that did the rounds after the incident showed a pale and disheveled Mamata Banerjee pointing to her leg in a cast and saying: "See how it is swelling up". She claims a group of four of five people pushed her against her car in   Birulia Anchal and tried to shut the car door on her. She claimed no policemen were present during the time of the incident. Doctors said she will remain under strict observation. "The chief minister has severe bony injuries in her left ankle and foot, besides injuries in right shoulder, forearm, and neck. She is stable now but is having severe pain in the injured leg," a senior doctor at the state-run SSKM Hospital said."The board of doctors evaluated her condition in the afternoon and have decided to conduct a further radiological investigation to exclude any pathology arising out of the the post-traumatic syndrome," he said.The doctors will meet again in the evening for another round of review, he added."The treatment continues in the same line with correction of hyponatremia. The review board will again meet in the evening," the doctor said.Hyponatremia is a condition in which the concentration of sodium in the blood is abnormally low.Replying to a question on how long the chief minister is needed to remain at the hospital, the doctor told reporters, "Can't give you any date, the treating doctors will decide depending on her health condition". Till afternoon, Banerjee underwent around eight different types of blood tests, sources at the hospital said.The doctors are planning to conduct a series of medical tests, including a CT scan, to assess the degree of her injury, they said."A temporary plaster was done on her left ankle. Her ECG report was fine. Her fever has subsided," one of the sources said.The state government constituted a six-member medical team to treat Banerjee, and doctors conducted an X-ray on the chief minister as soon as she was taken to the hospital from Nandigram on Wednesday evening.Banerjee is undergoing treatment at special cabin number 12.5 at the Woodburn Block of SSKM Hospital, following an alleged attack on her during the election campaign in Nandigram..@BJP4Bengal Brace yourselves to see the power of people of BENGAL on Sunday, May 2nd.Get READY!!! pic.twitter.com/dg6bw1TxiU  In a video message from the hospital, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urged supporters to maintain peace.“Don’t do anything that would cause problems to the public,” he said.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she would return to the election campaign in few days and use a wheelchair if necessary.— Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-banerjee-stable-say-doctors-223700

The Commission does not appropriate or take over the day-to-day governance of any state including West Bengal...,” it noted.The EC also slammed the TMC for linking the shunting of state DGP Virendra with Wednesday’s Nandigram incident.It said, “DGP wasn’t removed without any application of mind. It was the outcome of the recommendation given by special observers. Yesterday also when the commission became aware of the incident, a report was immediately sought from WB chief secretary and special observers within 48 hours.”Earlier in the day, the ruling TMC slammed the poll panel for failing to provide proper security to Banerjee and said the EC can’t shun responsibility as it is in charge of law and order situation in the state.A TMC delegation that met the EC officials in Kolkata today accused the poll panel of acting “as per orders” of the BJP leaders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-says-tmcs-memorandum-over-mamata-injuries-full-of-insinuations-and-averments-223694
12-03-2021||---||Delhi Police foil plot to kill faction head of Nihang Sikh Buddha Dal||New Delhi, March 11Delhi Police claim to have foiled a plot to kill a faction head of a Nihang Sikh jathebandi.The Special Cell said Malkit Singh alias Jujhar Singh and Bhupinder Singh were arrested from Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh and two pistols and 20 cartridges were seized from them.They also intended to eliminate a-witness in a 2010 murder case in which Malkit, currently out on parole, and his mother Jasbir Kaur got life imprisonment.“On March 6, a tip-off was received that a convict in a murder case, who is currently on parole, along with his friend, is coming from Madhya Pradesh with illegal firearms and intends to commit a crime. A raid was conducted and Malkit and Bhupinder were arrested from near Beri Wala Bagh, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi, and a pistol with 16 cartridges was recovered from Malkit and a pistol with four cartridges was recovered from Bhupinder. A case under the Arms Act was registered,” the Special Cell said.The duo was planning to execute the murders during the Holla Mohalla celebrations later this month. Malkit and Bhupinder sourced the arms from an arms supplier named Jyoti in Madhya Pradesh.Malkit’s first brush with the law took place a decade ago after his father Baldev Singh was replaced as the granthi of Gurdwara Jaimal Singh, Lal Bagh, Azadpur, for his involvement in Patiala’s Banta Singh Bagichi firing incident where four Nihang Sikhs were killed.Thereafter, Malkit, his mother and sewadars Sukhpal Singh and Ranjit Singh kidnapped the new granthi Lakhwinder Singh and murdered him. All four were sentenced to life imprisonment.In 2017, the 27-year-old was involved in killing of four people belonging to Buddha Dal Balbir Singh in Muktsar over a property dispute. The same year, he was arrested for his involvement in a conspiracy to kill a sewadar, Pyara Singh, Balwangarh Sahib gurdwara, Fatehgarh Sahib.“He has revealed that he wanted revenge from the head of one faction of Nihang Sikh Buddha Dal as he felt that the latter is responsible for keeping him and his mother in jail. There is also a dispute over the possession/heading of the jathebandi as Malkit wanted someone else to head the jathebandi,” the Special Cell said.“He also wanted to eliminate one of his neighbours, who was witness in the murder case of the granthi, in which he and his mother were convicted,” it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-foil-plot-to-kill-faction-head-of-nihang-sikh-buddha-dal-223689
