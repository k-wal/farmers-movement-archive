15-03-2021||Mumbai||Antilia scare: Suspended police officer Waze moves HC against arrest, says he was made ‘scapegoat’||Suspended police officer Sachin Waze on Monday filed a ‘habeas corpus’ petition in the Bombay High Court, challenging his arrest by the NIA in connection with the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near Mukesh Ambani’s house.The NIA, on the other hand, denied before a lower court that he had been detained illegally before the arrest.Waze, an assistant police inspector with Mumbai police, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency on Saturday for his alleged involvement.The petition, filed through his brother Sudharm, claimed that Waze (49) was made a “scapegoat” by “certain political powers”.A Habeas Corpus petition is usually filed to challenge ‘illegal’ detention or arrest.The plea, moved by his lawyer Sunny Punamiya, sought a direction to the NIA to produce Waze before the HC and to prove that due procedure was followed during the arrest.The police officer was not provided a copy of the FIR and he was also not explained the reasons for arrest, nor was his family informed, the petition said.The haste with which he was arrested showed that the central agency acted with malafide intentions, it alleged.The NIA is probing the recovery of an explosives-laden Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s multi-storey house ‘Antilia’ here last month.The case was taken over by the NIA after the mysterious death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran who had claimed the vehicle had been stolen from his possession.The petition said the allegations made by Hiran’s wife, blaming Waze for her husband’s death, were false.After the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad registered an FIR against him, the “entire media fraternity and society started targeting” him as they wanted a “scapegoat to pin this entire conspiracy on”, Waze claimed.The petition is yet to be listed for hearing.Meanwhile, arguing before a special court here, the NIA denied that Waze had been detained illegally before the arrest.The special court had remanded Waze in the custody of the central agency till March 25 on Sunday.Waze’s lawyers had alleged during the remand hearing that he was illegally detained by the NIA officials from 11 am on Saturday and shown as arrested only late at night.During the hearing on Monday, the NIA told the court that Waze was summoned by NIA officials on Saturday as he was the previous investigating officer of the SUV recovery case.There were several discrepancies in case documents such as memos, seizure documents and station diary but Waze gave evasive answers when questioned, said special prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves.He had come to the NIA office even without his mobile phones, the prosecutor said.Since Waze did not provide satisfactory explanations about his probe, he was placed under arrest around 11.50 pm on Saturday, the agency claimed.On Waze’s allegation that his family was not informed, the agency said he refused to give their contact details, so his police station was informed about his arrest.On defence’s demand for CCTV cameras in the interrogation room, the NIA claimed that there are CCTV cameras in all the rooms at their office.The defence lawyers asked the agency to submit the same in writing before the court.The hearing will continue on Tuesday.On Monday, the NIA also took Waze to the state-run J J hospital here for medical examination where he spent about four hours, a police official said.Hospital sources said that he told NIA officials that he was a diabetic, hence he was taken for medical examination.

15-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Amend laws to punish people filing false cases: Parl panel to govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 15The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home on Monday asked the Government to work with states and ensure that people and cops filing false cases do not go scot-free and recommended changes in existing laws to ensure action against those who perpetrate falsehoods.The committee further lamented only 38 pc utilization of Nirbhaya Fund noting that the fund meant for the safety and security of women was being diverted for other schemes.On false cases, the panel expressed concern and said after an investigation about the veracity of cases, appropriate penal action should be taken by fixing accountability of the police personnel who have registered false cases.“Also individuals who register false cases must not get off scot-free. We recommend that the Home Ministry advises states to take strict actions against police personnel and individuals who have registered false cases. The Home ministry may take up the matter with the Ministry of Law if need be and laws should be amended to add stringent provisions against false cases,” said the panel headed by Congress veteran Anand Sharma in its report “Atrocities and Crimes against Women and Children” tabled in Parliament today.Ruing that only 10 pc of Indian police force are women where 33 pc recruitment is mandatory, the panel said that only Rs 3,581.11 crore has been disbursed from Nirbhaya Fund out of Rs 9,288.45 crore which is around 38.55 pc.“We are disappointed to note that Nirbhaya Fund is continuously diverted towards other schemes and projects. We take a very serious note of this and strongly recommend that the ministry should desist from sanctioning funds for such schemes from Nirbhaya Fund and adhere to the original purpose of Nirbhaya Fund,” said the panel adding that out of 1023 fast track special courts for expeditious trial and disposal of cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, very few courts were operational.“Cases registered under POCSO Act during 2017 to 19 were 31,668, 38,802 and 46,005 respectively. The committee is perplexed to note that against the 1023 Fast Track Special Courts only 597 courts including 325 exclusive POCSO courts have been made operational in 24 states and UTs,” the panel noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amend-laws-to-punish-people-filing-false-cases-parl-panel-to-govt-225621

We are also examining possibilities of designing digital one stop centres. The idea came up today," she said.Asked how women's helplines would be merged, Secretary, WCD Ministry Ram MOhan Mishra said, "Women will be able to dial both helplines but both will be integrated to improve response time. Likewise,  child helpline 1098 would see the first interface with a government system in view of data sensitivity issues."So far, NGO Childline has been manning 1098.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/womens-helplines-to-be-merged-smriti-irani-225619
15-03-2021||New Delhi||Money laundering: ED attaches assets of former home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde's daughter, son-in-law||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth over Rs 35 crore of the daughter and son-in-law of former Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in a money laundering case linked to an alleged bank fraud.The central agency said the properties, provisionally attached under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), are "in the form of two commercial properties measuring about 10,550 sq ft area each in the Kaledonia building, Andheri (East), Mumbai". The assets valued at Rs 35.48 crore, the agency said in a statement, belong to businessman Raj Shroff and his wife (Priti Shroff).Agency sources said Priti Shroff is the daughter of Congress leader and ex-chief minister of Maharashtra Sushil Kumar Shinde.Shinde has also served as the Union home minister.The attachment of assets has been done in connection with a money laundering probe linked to an alleged bank fraud case linked to HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan."Rakesh Wadhawan, Sarang Wadhawan and others are being probed for siphoning off the loan to the tune of Rs 200 crore sanctioned by Yes Bank to Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd, by showing it for fictitious purpose," the ED said.Wadhawans "illegally and fraudulently" transferred one commercial property of Mack Star located in Kaledonia building, Andheri East, Mumbai to Jindal Combines Pvt. Ltd at price of Rs 9.39 Crore (having value of Rs 15.64 crore at that time) in 2014 and another commercial property to Orlando Trading Pvt Ltd at the agreement value of Rs 18 Crore (having value of Rs 19.84 crore) in 2016, it said."However, they paid only Rs 10 crore for the second property till date. The firms are receiving rent of Rs 1.76 crore and Rs 1.39 crore per annum for these two properties respectively," it said.Both the companies, the ED said, are owned by Raj Shroff and his wife in a 50:50 partnership mode.  "Thus, Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan cheated Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd  by illegally selling above said properties without consent of the majority shareholder (DE Shaw Group which holds 83.36 pc shares) of Mack Star Marketing Pvt. Ltd. at a very low price causing loss to Mack Star," it said.The total value of attachment in this case now stands at Rs 69.84 crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/money-laundering-ed-attaches-assets-of-former-home-minister-sushil-kumar-shindes-daughter-son-in-law-225616

And, today, we just took him in a car to the hospital, where he had undergone a major operation in 2019, got the vaccine shot, and came back,” he said.He is feeling fine and has not exhibited any adverse effects post immunisation, the son said, adding, that he performed his daily ‘puja’ after returning home.“When the pandemic hit us all last year and we got to learn about the 1918 Spanish Flu too, I used to ask my dad about that time, but he was just a five-year-old boy then, and with age and infirmity, his memory has faded, along with reduced eyesight and hearing capacity,” 72-year-old Krishna told PTI.He said his father was born in Kartarpur in Jallandhar district on August 4, 1913, just a year before the outbreak of the World War I.“In 1930s, he moved to Delhi, and worked in the Home and Defence Ministry, and was later part of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India. My father really worked hard and made his way up the ranks. After Independence, he went on to become a deputy secretary in Rajya Sabha,” the son said.Old sepia-toned image of a group photograph taken in February 1948 with BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, sitting in front at the centre and Kewal Krishan standing behind him, is part of the well-preserved family archives, he said.“We have got this picture and a few other photos related to the making of the Constitution framed for posterity. In another photo, one can see Jawaharlal Nehru signing on the Constitution, with my father watching him close by. These are pieces of history in our family collections now, and we treasure it,” Anil Krishna said.So, he has seen the World War I era and the Spanish Flu that followed it, the making of the Constitution, the Independence of India in 1947, and making of the Republic in 1950, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and now got his vaccine shot. That’s quite a spectrum of experience in a lifetime, and he will soon turn 108, he said, adding that “I and my wife got vaccinated recently”.          The vaccine shot was given to him at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI) in south Delhi, a spokesperson of the facility said.In July 2019, Kewal Krishan had undergone carotid artery stent implantation at FEHI, after suffering multiple repeated minor strokes that had caused “transient paralysis and loss of speech of right side of the body”, and he was on the “verge of permanent paralysis”, doctors at the facility said.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest: HC asks authorities to consider representation to remove barriers on Delhi borders||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the authorities to treat as representation a plea seeking direction to remove barricading on various routes connecting the neighbouring states with the national capital due to the over 3-month long farmers’ protest against the new agri laws passed by the Centre.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh disposed of the petition and asked the authorities, including the Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police, to decide the representation in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case.Petitioner Himanshu Kaushik, a practicing advocate, sought to remove unnecessary barricading and obstructions on various routes which have been blocked due to the protesters’ presence there.The plea sought direction to make separate lanes and routes for heavy vehicles and also direct the authorities concerned to allow free movement of vehicles for public convenience.It also sought to direct the administration to deploy efficient manpower on the alternative routes/ routes suffering from heavy congestion on peak hours.The pleas said from the very beginning of the protest on November 26, 2020, the protesters are haggling over the law which has created a sombre environment in the capital and the adjacent cities.It said Delhi’s seven borders—Singhu, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh, Tikri, Jharoda are disturbed and the traffic in the national capital its bordering areas continue to remain affected due to the farmers’ protest.“The Ghazipur border on NH-24 is closed for traffic from Ghaziabad to Delhi due to Farmer’s protest. People are advised to avoid NH-24 for coming to Delhi and use Apsara/ Bhopra/ DND for coming to Delhi. The Chilla border on Noida Link road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to protest near Gautam Budh Nagar. People are advised to avoid Noida Link road for coming to Delhi and use DND,” it said.The plea added that the scenario is becoming worst and in order to protect the right of peaceful protest of farmers, the right of free movement throughout the territory of India under the Constitution is being violated since the day the protest has started.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over three months now against the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.

15-03-2021||---||Data shows decline in cyclones over Bay of Bengal, increase in storms over Arabian Sea: Centre||Vibha SharmaTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 15    While the number of cyclones forming on the Bay of Bengal side of the Indian subcontinent is decreasing, those on the Arabian Sea are showing an increasing trend and likewise the number of those making a landfall, Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan said. Harsh Vardhan recently told Lok Sanja that the increase in frequency over the Arabian Sea has not posed a corresponding increase in the coastal vulnerability along the west coast.Most of such cyclones are making landfall over the coasts of Oman, Yemen, etc, therefore the threat to Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts remains same, he told the Lower House.Studies show a decreasing trend in the frequency of formation of cyclonic Storms over the eastern side (the Bay of Bengal) and an increasing trend over the western side (the Arabian Sea), Vardhan said quoting data during 1965 and 2020 and scientific investigations on frequency and impacts of cyclones over the North Indian Ocean region. On average, out of five cyclones developing in the North Indian Ocean region comprising the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, about three to four make a landfall, causing loss of life and property. Low lying coastal belts of West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry are more prone to the impact of these systems, he said.As per data, in 2020, four of the five cyclones in the region made a landfall over the Indian coast, killing as many as 113 persons; in 2019 two out of eight made the landfall taking the toll of 105 persons, and in 2018 three of the seven cyclones made it to the land, killing 131 persons. In 2017, none of the three cyclones made the landfall, while in 2016, only one of the four traveled to the mainland, killing six persons. Though the very Severe Cyclone ‘Ockhi’ in 2017 did not cross the coast, it claimed the lives of more than 200 fishermen out in the sea.Although studies showed a decreasing trend in the frequency of formation of cyclonic storms over the Bay of Bengal, the region still remains prone to ‘Extremely Severe Cyclones’ or storms of higher intensity.“There is no significant trend in the frequency of Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms (ESCS),” he said. The minister said that improvement in the early warning skill by the IMD and response actions by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has helped bring down the number of deaths due to cyclones significantly.Still, there is a huge loss to property, he said. “Greater vulnerability to tropical cyclone damage all over the world is mainly due to socio-economic and demographic factors. Improvements in warning systems and preparedness in disaster management remain critical to mitigate the loss of lives and, to some extent, loss of property. Some of the studies have highlighted the importance of land-use planning, development of coastal districts and insurance measures, in addition to the development of a vigilant disaster management system,” he added.The Centre has also initiated the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) to address cyclone risks in the country. Its main objective is to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities to cyclone and other hydro-meteorological hazards through improved early warning dissemination systems and enhanced capacity of local communities to respond to disasters, the minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/data-shows-decline-in-cyclones-over-bay-of-bengal-increase-in-storms-over-arabian-sea-centre-225605

If voters are dissatisfied with the background of the contesting candidate, they will opt NOTA to reject such candidate and elect a new candidate,” the PIL contended.“The injury caused to the public is extremely large and continues till date, as the right to reject is an integral part of Article 19, but the Centre and ECI did nothing to declare the election result invalid and hold fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA,” it submitted.“The Court may declare that if ‘none of the above’ (NOTA) gets maximum votes, then election to that constituency shall be nullified and a fresh election shall be held within six months; and the contesting candidates rejected in the nullified elections, shall not be allowed to participate in the fresh election,” the petition read.Alleging that political parties choose candidates in a very undemocratic manner without consulting electors, the PIL contended that was why many a time people were totally discontented with candidates presented before them.“This problem can be solved by holding a fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA. In such a situation, the contesting candidates should be considered as rejected and not be allowed in the fresh election,” Upadhyay said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-reject-sc-notice-to-centre-ec-on-bjp-leaders-plea-225601
15-03-2021||New Delhi||Ally AIADMK’s poll promise opposing CAA throws spanner in BJP's works||An election promise by All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham has not only put ally Bharatiya Janata Party in a spot in Tamil Nadu but also appears to have put them on defence in two other poll-bound states—Assam and West Bengal.In its manifesto released on Saturday, the ruling AIADMK has made a slew of promises, including home appliances like washing machine and solar stoves, one government job per home, and dual citizenship for Sri Lankan refugees. Also part of the manifesto is the AIADMK’s promise to make the central government reconsider the contentious citizenship law. This is especially significant given the strong opposition to the law in the state, even among celebrities, and the call to grant citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India, always a sensitive topic in the state.The promise has put BJP, which claims the Tamil Nadu coalition is built on “anti-corruption and development plank”, in an awkward position of having to clarify its stand—that it won’t scrap the law “no matter who opposes it”. “(DMK chief MK) Stalin or anyone else can oppose it, the CAA will not be scrapped,” BJP general secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu CT Ravi tweeted in what otherwise appeared to be a counter to main rival DMK, which has made the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act a key talking point in these elections.   Additionally, BJP sources say the party will release its own manifesto to “balance things out”.  As for DMK’s demands to grant citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, BJP president Ravi also asked the party and its president MK Stalin why the party did nothing on that front when it was in power in the state.“DMK owner MK Stalin says that his party will continue to fight against the CAA. Why is Stalin opposing a law that would provide Citizenship to oppressed Hindus, Sikhs and Christians from Pakistan and other nations,” he said. DMK was part of the United Progressive Alliance in the Centre from 2004 to 2013, the tweet said.“What stopped DMK from giving Citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in camps in India? What was DMK owner doing in those years? Was he so busy looting the Nation that he forgot Tamil refugees,” he asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ally-aiadmks-poll-promise-opposing-caa-throws-spanner-in-bjps-works-225599

The seat which was vacated by the former Chief Minister and Congress leader V Narayanaswamy is now a bone of contention between the BJP and the AIADMK.BJP leader Vivian Richards, son of former MLA A John Kumar, had vacated the seat for V Narayanaswamy when he became the Chief minister. Later John Kumar left the Congress to join the BJP and has been nurturing the constituency even after he had vacated the seat.AIADMK former MLA Om Sakthi Sagar who had won the seat in 2011 but lost to John Kumar in 2016 filed the nomination from the Nelithope constituency. It has to be seen in the days to come who will contest the seat and whether a truce will be achieved in the NDA among the parties.V Karthikeyan of the DMK is the candidate of the Secular Democratic Alliance (SDA) for Nelithope constituency and he has also filed his nomination papers.BJP state president Swaminathan while speaking to IANS said, “These are small matters and these things happen in a political front.

The camp was inaugurated by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla in the presence of the health minister, a health ministry statement said.Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Venkatesh Joshi, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh and other dignitaries were also present at the event.Talking about the health facilities provided at Parliament House Annexe medical centre round the year, Vardhan said services of specialists from various specialties are available along with the provision for laboratory investigations, X-ray and ultrasound facilities.“In the camps organised during the last few years, a large number of beneficiaries, including MPs, ex-MPs, their family members and other staff members, availed of the services. In-house arrangements have also been made for COVID testing and vaccine administration this year,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.Speaking on rising COVID-19 cases in India, the health minister said, “Only few states account for more than 80 per cent of the rising cases. The negligence towards COVID appropriate behaviour is the main reason behind it. It is important to ascertain that COVID appropriate behaviour is followed even after the vaccine is available.”   He also said the COVID-19 vaccination drive should be made a “Jan Andolan” (people’s movement) by raising awareness among the masses.The total vaccination doses in the country are nearing 3 crore and the vaccination drive is rapidly catching up, Vardhan added.Apart from usual services, specialised super specialist consultations are being offered to members of parliament, including cardiology, neurology, endocrinology and gastroenterology. Ayush services and nutritional services are also offered, it said.In the camp held in December 2019, almost 240 members of parliament availed of the services. In today’s camp, super speciality services in cardiology, cardiovascular surgery and pulmonology with specialists from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have been introduced, the statement added.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||SC may hear NCB plea challenging bail to Rhea Chakraborty on March 18||The Narcotics Control Bureau has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court order granting bail to Rhea Chakraborty in cases registered against her under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS Act).A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde and comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V  Ramasubramanian is likely to hear the matter on March 18. The high court granted bail to Rhea in October last year after furnishing a bond of Rs 1 lakh. She was among the 20 arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with the drugs angle probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. She had spent 28 days in custody.Rhea’s counsel had contended that the NCB lacked jurisdiction to probe the matter in view of the Supreme Court order of August 19 directing to hand over all investigations in the Sushant case to the CBI, the offences under which  the accused were nabbed by the NCB were bailable and the charges under the NDPS Act Section 217A against the accused did not have supporting evidence.Rhea and her brother Showik Chakraborty and three others—Abdel Basit Parihar, Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant—were accused of having facilitated the procurement of drugs for consumption by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.  They filed bail applications before the Bombay High Court after their bail plea was dismissed by a Special NDPS Court in Mumbai.Among the conditions listed for Rhea’s bail was depositing her passport with the NCB, reporting to the local police station daily for 10 days, not leaving Mumbai without informing the NCB, etc.“The arrest and custody of Rhea was totally unwarranted and beyond the reach of law. The hounding and witch hunt by three Central agencies—the CBI, ED and NCB—of Rhea should come to an end”, Rhea’s counsel had said then.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-may-hear-ncb-plea-challenging-bail-to-rhea-chakraborty-on-march-18-225590

The accused is absconding.The woman is a native of Chamoli district in Uttarakhand and currently resides in Aliyar village in Gurugram.The woman in her complaint told the police that nearly 4-5 days ago, she had come into contact with the accused, Amit Kaushik, a Delhi resident, on Facebook messenger.“During the online chat, Amit told me that he was a Delhi resident and used to commute to and from Gurugram. After this, he promised me a job at a reputed company in Manesar,” she told the police.“On Sunday, Amit called me and told me he had arranged a ‘good job’ for me. He asked me to reach Manesar immediately,” the girl said.“Trusting Amit, I went to Manesar where he took me to a hotel there and offered some soft drink laced with sedatives. After consuming the drink, I lost my senses and then he raped me,” the victim told the police.“After committing the crime, Amit threatened me with dire consequences if I narrated the incident to anyone.

15-03-2021||Lucknow||Rajnath Singh calls for dialogue on farmers’ issue||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called on Monday for a dialogue between the protesting farmers and the union government.Appealing to the agitating farmers, who have been upset over the new farm laws since they were passed in September last year, Rajnath Singh said any problem can be resolved through talks.“The BJP’s resolve is to double the farmers’ income, and in no case will the MSP end,” he said, referring to the apprehension among farmers who have been agitating on the Delhi borders since November 26, 2020.Singh, who was addressing a meeting of the BJP state executive in Lucknow, said: “We are all from farmers’ families and we are ready for amendments and solutions, whatever is needed in the interest of agriculture.” He focused on the role of grassroots workers in the Bhartiya Janata Party and said this was the only party which has not seen a split so far.“This is not a crowd of workers aiming to gain power but a lively party which has a political vision,” he said.Commenting on the construction of the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the minister said: “People used to say that whenever elections come, BJP leaders speak about construction of the Ram temple. It is a coincidence that when the structure fell in Ayodhya, there was a BJP government in the UP, and Kalyan Singh was the chief minister. And when the foundation stone for construction of the Ram temple was laid, there was a BJP government in UP, and Yogi Adityanath was the chief minister.” Referring to the face-off with China in Ladakh last year, the minister said, “Our Army jawans have been displayed courage and valour with patience. We do not wish to attack anyone but will not tolerate the grabbing of our land”. He further said no power on earth can stop India from becoming a global superpower.Singh claimed that in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the BJP will get more seats than its 2017 tally.Addressing party workers, he said they cannot complain of any injustice to them by the party.“I never made any demands and just kept working. We are lucky that we got an opportunity to become BJP workers,” he added.Citing the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, “Credibility is the biggest capital in politics and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an example of this”. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-singh-calls-for-dialogue-on-farmers-issue-225581
15-03-2021||New Delhi||NIA raids 11 locations across country in Kerala ISIS module case||In a major crackdown against Kerala ISIS module led by accused Mohammed Ameen, the anti-terror probe agency, NIA on Monday conducted searches at 11 locations in Delhi (1), Karnataka (2) and Kerala (8).In Kerala the raids were carried out in Kannur, Mallapuram, Kollam and Kasargod, whereas in Karnataka it was in Bengaluru.A senior NIA official said, “The group has been running various ISIS propaganda channels on different social media platforms such as Telegram, Hoop and Instagram for propagating the violent Jihadi ideology of ISIS and radicalising and recruiting new members to the ISIS module.”In this case, the NIA had registered the case against seven known and other unknown accused persons under various sections of the IPC, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act—UAPA on March 5, 2021, the official said.According to the official, the searches were conducted at the premises of accused Mohammed Ameen and his associates, who were members of the various groups and channels on encrypted chat platforms.“During the searches, several digital devices, including laptops, mobiles, hard disk drives, pen drives, multiple SIM cards of different service providers and incriminating documents have been seized,” the official said, adding that the seized exhibits “are being scrutinised and will be sent for forensic examination”. The searches today were preceded by extensive verification jointly by the NIA, the Special Cell of Delhi Police and Kerala ATS, the official noted.The group of radicalised individuals under the leadership of Mohammed Ameen owning allegiance to ISIS had identified certain individuals in Kerala and Karnataka for targeted killing, the official said.“They had also planned to undertake Hijrat (religious migration) to Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) for engaging in terrorist acts. Further, Mohammed Ameen had travelled to J&K immediately after his return to India from Bahrain in March 2020 and had been camping in Delhi for the last two months for establishing connection with J&K-based operatives having allegiance to ISIS,” the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-raids-11-locations-across-country-in-kerala-isis-module-case-225579
15-03-2021||Kolkata||From escaping death on burning train to winning medals, MP archers achieve the ‘impossible’||The brave-hearted Madhya Pradesh junior archers “achieved the impossible” by winning four medals in the Nationals Championships after miraculously escaping the Shatabdi Express train inferno on their way to Dehradun, their head coach said on Monday.With less than an hour to reach Dehradun on Saturday, the eight-member recurve men’s and women’s team experienced the horror of being chased by black thick smoke and fire as they jumped to safety to the adjacent bogey.But they lost all their belongings, right from their equipment to original documents including Aadhaar Card and birth certificates after their coach C5 was charred near Kansrao.Starting from scratch with a new set of equipment that arrived in the wee hours of Sunday, the archers without any pre-match day practice concluded their campaign with two silver and one bronze in the recurve category and a team silver in the compound category earlier.Class X student Sonia Thakur, who won two silver medals in the ranking round, went one step up advancing into the Olympic round on Monday as she nearly bagged a third but only to go down to her Haryana rival in a tightly-contested bronze playoff that was decided in a tiebreaker.“They have achieved something impossible. Miracles like this do happen in sport,” MP head coach Richpal Singh told PTI from Dehradun.Singh, who had reached with the compound team ahead of the recurve archers, remembers Saturday’s ordeal vividly when he first learnt about the horrific incident.“They were slated to reach Dehradun at 12.55 pm and we were to go for practice after grabbing a quick bite. But there were no phone calls as I dropped a message in our WhatsApp group and learnt about the trauma.”“The first thing I asked them was ‘Are you all safe?’ After hearing that they all are safe, our first job was to boost their morale and ensure that they stay focus on the competition the next day.”      With a combined support from the MP state administration and Archery Association of India, they managed to get a new set of equipment ordered from Patiala.“We are told that the equipment would land around 2 am so we made sure the archers got some rest before it arrives as they have a sleepless night in store in tuning them, something that takes hours.”         So all the coaching staff and archers assembled in their hotel lobby at 2 am and got on the job of setting them up that requires cutting and fetching the arrows. After that they rushed to the Survey Ground in the early hours of 6 am to get some desperate practice, three hours before the competition.“Just tuning them was not enough as for an archer it takes months’ to have a finger tap set with the release. So to shoot and win medals with the new set of bows and arrows, with less than two hour’s practice shows their mental resolve. It was something impossible,” Singh said.“All eyes were on us and everyone was asking about them during the competition. But the team held their focus firm. The showed a different kind of attitude,” he added.Son of a truck driver, Amit Kumar, who won a bronze in the individual ranking round before partnering Sonia Thakur for a silver in the mixed pair, in fact did not tell anyone in his family about the train incident.“They would have panicked and would have made it difficult for me so I remained mum. But now I’ve told them that I’ve won two medals. They would have known about the incident by now,” Amit said.Class IX student Sonia, who finished with a silver in the individual ranking round before her double with Amit in the mixed pair, was horrified seeing her personal belongings go up in smoke.“It was a devastating sight to see the bogey gutted in front of our eyes. But there was reassurance from coaches and family members who said ‘life is more important’,” Sonia recalled.“We all got amazing support and the equipment arrived so there was no looking back for us. We had to live up to their expectations and it showed in our performances.“The last few days have taught us one of the most important lessons of life: don’t ever lose your focus,” Sonia concluded.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||No proposal to bring petrol, diesel, ATF, gas under GST: Finance Minister Sitharaman||Amid record-high fuel prices, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said there is no proposal as of now to bring crude oil, petrol, diesel, jet fuel (ATF) and natural gas under the Goods and Services Tax (GST).When the GST was introduced on July 1, 2017, amalgamating over a dozen central and state levies, five commodities—crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) -- were kept out of its purview given the revenue dependence of the central and state governments on this sector.This meant that the Central government continued to levy excise duty on them while state governments charged VAT. These taxes, with excise duty, in particular, have been raised periodically.While the taxes haven’t come down, a spike in global oil prices on demand recovery has pushed petrol and diesel to an all-time high, leading to demand for them to come under the GST.“At present, there is no proposal to bring crude petroleum, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas under GST,” Sitharaman said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.She said the law prescribes that the GST Council shall recommend the date on which the goods and services tax be levied on petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and ATF.“So far, the GST Council, in which the states are also represented, has not made any recommendation for inclusion of these goods under GST,” she said.The Council may consider the issue of inclusion of these five petroleum products at a time it considers appropriate keeping in view all the relevant factors, including revenue implication, she added.Including oil products in GST will not just help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country.Sitharaman has in recent weeks talked of inclusion of fuel under GST as well as Centre and states taking a joint call on cutting taxes to cushion consumers against the spike in retail prices.To a separate question, her junior in the Finance Ministry, Anurag Singh Thakur said excise duty on petrol was Rs 19.98 per litre a year back and is Rs 32.9 now. Similarly, on diesel, the excise duty has been raised from Rs 15.83 to Rs 31.8.“The excise duty rates have been calibrated to generate resources for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure keeping in view the present fiscal position,” Thakur, Minister of State for Finance, said giving reasons for raising the levy.On the impact of higher fuel rates on general prices, he said ‘petrol for vehicle’ inflation has increased from 7.38 per cent in January 2020 to 12.53 per cent in January this year.Similarly, ‘diesel for vehicle’ inflation has increased from 6.44 per cent in January last year to 12.79 per cent this year, he said.On fuel pricing, Thakur said the prices of petroleum products in the country are benchmarked to international product prices.“Generally, the price of petroleum products in the country are higher/lower than other countries due to a variety of factors, including prevailing tax regime and subsidy compensations by the respective governments,” he said.The government ended subsidies on petrol in 2010 and on diesel in 2014. ATF pricing was freed in 2002. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-proposal-to-bring-petrol-diesel-atf-gas-under-gst-finance-minister-sitharaman-225574
15-03-2021||Kolkata||Suvendu seeks rejection of Mamata’s nomination for ‘suppressing’ info on criminal cases||Suvendu Adhikari, the BJP candidate against Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram, Monday said he has sought rejection of the nomination of the West Bengal chief minister for not declaring six criminal cases against her while filing her papers.In his complaint to the Election Commission, Adhikari, a former confidante of Banerjee, claimed she suppressed the information about five cases filed against her in Assam and another lodged by the CBI in West Bengal.He said he has mentioned the case numbers in his complaint but did not elaborate on the offences allegedly committed by the TMC supremo, sources in the office of the state’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) said.“The TMC candidate for the Nandigram assembly constituency, the honourable chief minister, in her affidavit has not mentioned at least six cases which are under trial against her. One is a CBI case and five others are in Assam.“I have appealed to the ECI (for rejecting her nomination). I hope they will take necessary action. I will wait and see what action they take. The action must be as per the law,” Adhikari told reporters.A senior EC official said the matter is being looked into.No immediate reaction was available from the TMC.In a significant ruling in March 2018, the Supreme Court had said the returning officer for an election can reject nomination papers of a candidate for non-disclosure and suppression of information, including those related to their assets and criminal background.It had ruled that voters have a fundamental right to know about their candidates and leaving columns blank in the nomination paper amounts to violation of their right.

15-03-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana has become a role model for other states, says Governor Soundararajan||The Telangana Vidhan Sabha Budget Session that started with the Governor’s address on Monday will continue for 10 business days till March 26.The state budget for 2021-22 will be presented in both Houses on March 18. This was decided by the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the House soon after Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan delivered her address at the joint session of the assembly and the council. After the budget presentation on Thursday, there will be no sitting on Friday. The assembly will resume operations from March 20 for a general discussion on the state budget and the chief minister will reply to the discussion on March 22. There will be no session on March 21 (Sunday). It has been decided to hold the Question Hour commencing from the same day till March 26. In her address, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said Telangana state said several innovative and first of its kind programmes and schemes had been introduced by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) that were now being replicated in other parts of the country.Telangana, she said had been placed in the third position in the country in the Sustainable Development Goals India Index declared by Niti Aayog. Highlighting that from 2014, when the state came into being till 2019, Telangana has had a 17.24 per cent annual growth rate.From a GSDP of Rs 4,51,580 crores in 2014 the state in 2019-20 touched a 114.71 per cent increase with GSDP at Rs 9,69,604 crores.Similarly, in 2013-14, the per capita income in Telangana was Rs 1,12,162, but by 2019-20, it had more than doubled at Rs 2,28,216.Stating that the state government’s policy was to “increase wealth and distribute it among the poor”, Soundararajan said by allocating a large share of the increase in revenues for welfare programmes, the state transformed itself into one of the best welfare-oriented governments in the country.The Aasara pensions given by the government to the poor provided the people with security to life. At the time of the state’s formation, beneficiaries were getting only Rs 200 per month as pension which has gone up ten-folds now at Rs 2016 per month, she said. “To pull the agriculture sector out of crisis and instil confidence among farmers, the government for the past seven years has initiated several measures in a phased manner. To optimally utilise river water in tune with the needs of the state, the government redesigned projects and completed them on war footing.“The Kaleswaram project, which created history as the biggest multi-purpose and multi-stages lift irrigation scheme in the world, is now providing water to lakhs of acres,” she said, adding that major projects like Palamuru-Ranga Reddy and Sitarama projects were being completed on a fast track. “For the first time in the country, farmers are given Rs 10,000 per acre as financial assistance under Rythu Bandhu to ensure that farmers don’t worry about input expenditure. Families of farmers are given Rs 5 lakh under Rythu Bima policy when a farmer dies irrespective of the cause of death,” she said, adding that both these schemes had been applauded by the United Nations. Overcoming a very complicated power crisis that persisted in Telangana, the Governor said the state scripted a new history as the only state providing 24-hour free power supply to the farm sector and uninterrupted power to all sectors.“This is a first of its kind in the state. The installed power capacity at the time of state formation was only 7778 MWs while it is 16245 MWs now. Then the per capita power consumption was 1356 units which increased to 2071 units at present,” she said. The Governor also spoke about the success of Mission Bhagiratha in ensuring supply of safe drinking water to all the households in the state, quality education to students from the poorer and weaker sections of society through residential educational institutions and improved public health, among various other initiatives launched by the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-has-become-a-role-model-for-other-states-says-governor-soundararajan-225568
15-03-2021||Kolkata||TMC MLA Debashree Roy quits party after being denied poll ticket||Noted actor and two-time TMC MLA Debashree Roy on Monday quit the party after being denied a ticket for the upcoming assembly elections.The Raidighi legislator, in a letter to TMC state chief Subrata Bakshi, said she will no longer be associated with the party.“Although, I don’t hold any post in the party, but I felt it is necessary to write this letter as I wanted to inform the leadership that I don’t want to be associated with the TMC anymore,” she said.When asked about her future plans, Roy said she will concentrate on acting but is open to joining any other party if there is a “concrete proposal”.Roy was scheduled to join the BJP in 2019 but her plans got scuttled after TMC turncoat and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee and his friend Baisakhi Bandopadhyay opposed her induction into the saffron camp.Incidentally, Chatterjee resigned from the BJP on Sunday after he was denied a poll ticket.

15-03-2021||Jhalda/Balarampur (WB)||Conspiracies cannot stop me, will continue to fight BJP: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is still recuperating from the injuries she sustained last week in Nandigram, asserted on Monday that she would continue her fight against the BJP “as long as her heart beats and vocal cords function”.The TMC supremo, who addressed two rallies in Purulia during the day, also said that no conspiracy or injury can stop her from taking forward her battle against the saffron camp, and said the BJP, despite bringing in leaders from Delhi, will cut no ice with the people of Bengal.Banerjee, after filing her nomination in Nandigram on March 10, suffered severe injuries on her left leg, hips, arm, neck and shoulder as she fell down after allegedly being pushed by miscreants.TMC leaders have claimed that BJP men orchestrated the attack, a charge denied by the saffron camp. The Election Commission has ruled that she suffered injuries following an accident, and not an attack.“Wait for a few days, my leg will get better. I will see whether your legs get to move freely on Bengal’s soil,” the chief minister said at Jhalda, in a veiled attack on saffron camp leaders.The feisty TMC boss further claimed that “no other government in the world has done as much work for its people as her dispensation”.Launching a scathing attack on the Centre over rise in fuel prices and disinvestment of PSUs, Banerjee said, “Their (BJP’s) prime minister cannot run the country, (he is) totally incompetent.”She further urged people not to cast their votes in favour of the Congress and the CPI(M), claiming that the two parties and the BJP are “all brothers-in-arms”.“On March 10, I sustained injuries on my body. Maybe, due to good fortune, I was saved. Some may have thought I will not be able to go out at all with my broken leg, but (for me) people’s wellbeing is far more important than my own pain,” Banerjee noted.Taking potshots at the BJP for nominating sitting MPs from several assembly seats in Bengal, the chief minister, during her second rally in Balarampur, said many of them have done nothing for the welfare of the state, and sought to know if they would be “peddling lies and engineering riots” after the elections.“Some of the 18 MPs nominated by the BJP have done nothing for the state. What they will do if they win the elections? Spread lies and engineer riots?” the CM, who addressed rallies sitting on a wheelchair, stated.Mocking the BJP’s ‘rath yatra’, Banerjee said that she has always known that chariots are taken out for Lord Jagannath and his divine siblings.“Some BJP leaders are moving around in so-called ‘rath’, but we have always known that Lord Jagannath and his divine siblings travel in chariots. Are they (BJP leaders) bigger than God?” she said.Hitting out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah over cancellation of his first public meeting of the day at Jhargram, Banerjee, insinuating that the rally was called off due to lack of attendees, said, “Had he requested, we would have sent some people to the venue.”Raking up the “insider-outsider” debate, she asked the Purulia administration to seal the interstate border, claiming that she has information that some people are planning to enter the state to create disturbances. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conspiracies-cannot-stop-me-will-continue-to-fight-bjp-mamata-225558

I wish you a speedy recovery. But, what about the pain of the mothers of 130 BJP activists who were killed by TMC goons. Did you ever try to feel their pain?" he said."You never felt the pain of these people. They will give you a befitting reply while casting their votes in the assembly polls," he added.Shah said that if the BJP is voted to power in the state, it will ensure that the rights of the tribals are secured."TMC seeks cut money even for a tribal certificate. We will ensure the land rights of the tribals. The special focus will be on education, health and drinking water for the tribals in the area. We will also mention it in our manifesto," he said.Bankura district, in the western part of the state, has a significant tribal population, crucial to any party's electoral success.Earlier in the day, Shah was scheduled to address a rally in the Jhargarm district but gave a brief speech virtually.The BJP said that he couldn't attend the rally due to technical glitches in his helicopter.

15-03-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Waze’s arrest by NIA ‘insult’ of Maharashtra Police: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday said the arrest of Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze by the NIA over the recovery of explosives from a car near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence was an “insult” of the Maharashtra Police, and alleged that it was being done deliberately.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said it is surprising that when the investigative capabilities and bravery of the Maharashtra Police are being acknowledged around the world, the NIA should investigate this case.If Waze was guilty in the case, the Mumbai police and the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) were capable of taking action against him, it said.But, the central probe agency (NIA) did not want that to happen, the Marathi publication said.It alleged that since Waze had arrested journalist Arnab Goswami in the Anvay Naik suicide case, he was on the “hit-list of the BJP and the Centre”.Goswami and two others were arrested on November 4 last year by Raigad police in connection with the suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018. They were granted bail by the Supreme Court a few days later.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Waze on Saturday in connection with its probe into the recovery of a Scorpio containing 20 gelatin sticks near Ambani’s house in south Mumbai on February 25.Waze, credited with eliminating 63 alleged criminals in ‘encounters’, is also facing heat in the murder case of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the Scorpio. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane district on March 5.The Marathi daily said it is surprising that when the investigative capabilities and bravery of the state police were being acknowledged across the globe, the NIA should investigate the case of the recovery of 20 gelatin sticks.“Waze’s arrest by the NIA was an insult of the state police and was being done deliberately. Those expressing happiness over this are hurting the state’s autonomy,” the editorial alleged.It expressed hope that the truth will come out soon.The editorial also said the state government had handed over the probe into the recovery of the explosives- laden vehicle and the death of Mansukh Hiran to the ATS. But the central government deputed the NIA in the explosives case.There was no hurry to do so, it opined.It is still a “mystery” how explosives reached Pulwama (in Jammu and Kashmir) and claimed the lives of 40 jawans (in 2019), the editorial said.“In the Kashmir Valley, explosives are found every day. Does the NIA go there to conduct a probe into it?” the Sena asked. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sachin-wazes-arrest-by-nia-insult-of-maharashtra-police-shiv-sena-225523
15-03-2021||New Delhi||India to take up with UK 'racial issue' of Rashmi Samant at Oxford||India will take up with the UK when required the alleged incidents of racism in Britain, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. He also described India as the land of Mahatma Gandhi and said it can never turn its eyes away from racism.   Responding to concerns raised by a BJP MP over racism and cyberbullying that forced Indian-origin Rashmi Samant to resign as president of the Oxford University Students Union, the minister said New Delhi has strong ties with the UK and will take up such matters with great candour when required.Also read: Rashmi Samant resigns as Oxford Student Union President-elect amidst row over her past remarks"I note the sentiments of the House," he said. "I do want to say that as a land of Mahatma Gandhi, we can never ever turn our eyes away from racism wherever it is. Particularly so when it is in a country where we have such a large diaspora," he said.Samant, the first Indian woman to be elected as president of the Oxford University Students Union, was forced to resign within five days of her appointment over several of her social media posts that were labelled anti-Semitic and racist.BJP's Ashwini Vaishnav said she was cyberbullied and her parent's Hindu religious beliefs were publicly attacked by a faculty member."As a friend of the UK, we also have concerns about its reputational impact," Jaishankar said. "What I do want to say is that we have strong ties with the UK (and) we will take up such matters with great candour when required." "We will monitor these developments very, very closely. We will raise it when required and we will always champion the fight against racism and other forms of intolerance," he added.Raising the issue through a zero hour mention, Vaishnav said there appears to a  continuation of attitudes and prejudices from the colonial era in the United Kingdom.Samant, a bright student from Udupi, Karnataka,overcame all challenges to become the first Indian women president of the union, he said.But "what was the treatment meted out to her?" he asked. "Shouldn't this diversity been celebrated?" "Instead of that, she was cyberbullied to the point that she had to resign. Even the Hindu religious belief of her parents was publicly attacked by a faculty member, which went unpunished. If this happens at an institute like Oxford what is the message that goes out to the world," he said.While she did issue a public apology for 'unintentionally' hurting anyone's emotions, Samant believes she was unfairly targeted as a 'conscious attempt'.Vaishnav also brought up Prince Harry's wife Meghan Markle's accusations of racism by UK royals."A behaviour of a society is actually a reflection of its beliefs and value system. If such practices of racial discrimination are followed at the highest level in society what would be the following at the lower levels," he asked.Stating that the two instances were not isolated, he said the treatment of migrants and their segregation in the UK on a racial basis is very well known all over the world.A recent report stated that the death rate among people of Asian origin because of COVID-19 is higher than the death rate in other communities in the UK, he said."Doesn't it raise a major question about equitable access to health and indeed the entire basic human rights issue?" He went on to state that India is a country with a large diaspora in the UK. "There is a natural concern for all of us. The era of colonialism is over but the mindset seems to be still persistent. This is where the UK has to change. If it wants our respect, it has to change," he said, asking the External Affairs minister to take up the matter with the UK government.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||SC commences hearing whether Mandal verdict needs to be revisited||The Supreme Court commenced hearing on Monday on whether the landmark 1992 verdict in the Indira Sawhney case, which caps the quota at 50 per cent, require a re-look by a larger bench.A five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, gave a week time to all the states to submit their brief note of submissions after some of them sought time.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for petitioners who opened the arguments on the question of reference to a larger Bench, said there was no need to revisit the Indira Sawhney verdict.Datar argued that a 11-judge Bench needed to be constituted to revisit the verdict, which dealt with several issues, including the cap of 50 per cent quota, adding that it was not required.Since its inception of the Supreme Court, a 11-judge Bench has been constituted only five times to examine issues that are unique and of immense constitutional importance, he said. Datar said the question raised in the matter was only whether the 50-per-cent quota limit could be breached and not other issues dealt by the 1992 verdict."Indira Sawhney (judgement) was delivered with so much deliberations and views that in my humble view it need not be revisited," Datar said, adding that the 50 per cent cap had been accepted since the verdict.The Bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat said: "On the request of counsel for different states, we allow one week time to file their brief note of written submissions."    At the outset, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta for Kerala sought adjournment on the ground that assembly elections were on in the state.The top court rejected his plea and said: "We cannot adjourn the hearing in this case because of the elections."             The Bench said it needed to address the issue of 102 amendment of Constitution as it affects every state.Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, representing Tamil Nadu, said the court would have to see the special circumstances in which reservation in excess of 50 per cent had been given.Both Naphade and Gupta said reservation was a policy matter and the hearing on the issue be adjourned due to the elections.The Bench said it was not deciding the factual aspects and would deal with the legal propositions.On March 8, the top court had framed five questions to be taken up by the constitution bench to consider whether the 'Mandal verdict' require a re-look by a larger bench "in the light of subsequent Constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics of the society".It had issued notices to all the states on issues of "seminal importance", including whether the 102nd amendment deprives the state legislatures of its power to enact a law determining the socially and economically backward classes and conferring benefits to them under its enabling power.The 102nd Constitution inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Classes, and 342A that deals with power of the President to notify a particular caste as Socially and Educationally Backward Class and power of Parliament to change the list.The issue of interpretation of the amendment cropped up before the Bench, which is hearing the pleas pertaining to the 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-commences-hearing-whether-mandal-verdict-needs-to-be-revisited-225513

Its main focus was upliftment of the party," said the 88-year-old technocrat, a day after his name was officially declared as the BJP's candidate for Palakkad Assembly constituency.Taking a dig at Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Sreedharan said, "he is a good chief minister for his party but not for the state."Sreedharan alleged that the LDF government did nothing for the development of the state during its five-year rule.He said the CPI(M)-led government did not take any steps for the implementation of NilamburNanjangud line to create a broad-gauge rail connection from the town of Nanjangud in Karnataka to Nilambur in Kerala.Nothing has been done to implement a railway line between Guruvayur and Thirunavaya despite getting sanction, he added.The government stopped the preliminary works of light metro projects for ensuring improved transports systems in the cities of Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram.He expressed hope that the BJP-led NDA will win the Assembly polls and a government will be formed under his leadership.Sreedharan said if elected, he would try to regain the lost glory of Palakkad district in rice production."Once upon a time Palakkad was the largest producer of paddy, popularly called 'Nellara (the rice bowl of the state). Those days have gone by a long time back. That lost glory will be regained," Sreedharan told a news channel.He lamented that Palakkad lacks basic facilities needed for a town."There are no good higher education facilities in Palakkad barring Victoria College. Improved higher education facilities are required in Palakkad," said Sreedharan who made a surprise entry into politics through the BJP last month.Sitting MLA Shafi Parambil of the Congress and CPI(M)'s C P Pramod are his main rivals in the election.

The trial court had pronounced him guilty and awarded life imprisonment.However, the Allahabad High Court recently acquitted him, holding that the victim’s testimony was found trustworthy and the medical evidence belied any case against the accused. The high court expressed anguish over Tiwari’s prolonged incarceration and the government’s failure to recommend his case for remission of sentence or to commute it.Mishra contended that the SC/ST Act was being “abused by filing fake and malicious complaints and no action is taken against the culprit in the absence of effective statutory/legal scheme for providing mandatory compensatory relief and to prosecute the fake complainants”.Noting that false cases often lead to suicides of innocent men, he submitted that the state was responsible for the tortuous acts of its employees (Police and Prosecution) and must repair the damage done to citizens by its officers, by adequate monetary and non-monetary compensation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-moves-sc-seeks-relief-for-up-man-framed-in-rape-case-225258

He is scheduled to meet his counterpart Rajnath Singh. He is expected to bring along a few top industry leaders.Operationalising the partnership would mean a deeper engagement, a greater information sharing and the US allowing India access to cutting-edge technology in robotics, artificial intelligence, armed drones and even unmanned fighter jets. At present, India and US are running separate programmes for making unmanned jets.Since 2008, the US has authorised defence equipment sales worth $20 billion to India. The latest is India’s proposed purchase of 30 armed drones of the “predator-family” from US firm General Atomics.As of now, hectic discussion is on for negotiating the end-use monitoring arrangements (EUMA) needed for the import of US technology, defence equipment and supplies. India would be looking for a wider role of drones and the EUMA would focus on that.Since the late 1990s, both nations have been entering into such agreements. A generic formulation was agreed in 2009 for all future supplies that India chooses to procure to give predictability in what was otherwise an ad hoc case-by-case arrangement for procurement of defence technology and equipment from the US.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-to-work-for-stronger-defence-ties-225260

It is also the first after the reorganisation of J&K and Ladakh into separate UTs and PM Narendra Modi’s announcement of several hydel projects in Ladakh.Pakistan fears the dams and storage ponds will give India excessive ability to block the flow of the river, thus giving it strategic leverage during political tension or war. The World Bank, which is the IWT adjudicator, has often cleared India-built dams after asking for minor adjustments to account for Pakistani concerns.The India-Pakistan ties thawed last month after the ceasefire announcement and since then both sides have been mulling the next move. One of the low-hanging fruits was the meeting of Indus Commissioners, which was put off last year due to the pandemic.Interestingly, both India and Pakistan are on a dam building spree on the western rivers. India has identified several hydel projects and the issue is expected to come up during the meeting, India’s Indus Commissioner PK Saxena said. The most famous project on the Chenab is the Dul Hasti project, the first phase of which was inaugurated by then PM Manmohan Singh and the second by PM Modi.

It also asked the state that Goel should not be given any election-related responsibility.SP Pravin Prakash has also been placed under suspension. He has been replaced by 2009-batch IPS officer Sunil Kumar Yadav. The EC asked the government to frame charges against Prakash for “major failure in security bandobast”.“The Chief Secretary shall ensure that the investigation of Nandigram PS case number 97/21, dated March 11, 2021, is completed and consequential action taken as per law in the next 15 days. Report in this regard shall be sent to the commission by March 31, 2021,” the EC said.The TMC alleged it disagreed with the EC's observation that there was no pre-meditated attack on Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram and demanded a high-level probe into the incident, insisting the inquiry by the election observers "lacked credibility".However, party spokesperson Sougata Roy expressed satisfaction that the EC agreed that there were security lapses and took action against some officials.“We disagree with the EC's observation based on the report of special election observers that there was no attack on Mamata Banerjee. The report of the election observers lacks credibility and fails to inspire confidence. We reiterate our demand for a high-level probe into the incident,” Roy said.Reacting to the removal of officials by the EC over security lapses, Roy said, "It is good that at least they have accepted that there were security lapses. It is a welcome move that the EC has removed the officials over security lapses. At least they have taken some action. We had raised this question as to how there were lapses in the security of the chief minister."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/election-commission-cites-lapses-suspends-mamatas-security-officer-225286

She was injured in Nandigram during campaigning.“If I take bed rest, who will reach out to the people of Bengal. The conspiracy (against her) will become successful,” she said. Stating that injury had been inflicted on her in the past also, Mamata said she would start campaigning without further delay and revealed her plan of leaving for Durgapur immediately and addressing a series of rallies starting from Purulia on Monday.“In this fight to protect our revered land, we have suffered a lot and will suffer more but we will NEVER bow down to COWARDICE! Banerjee had earlier tweeted minutes before arriving for the march.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-never-bow-down-to-cowardice-mamata-hits-the-road-on-wheelchair-225252

Give us another five years and we will also be able to solve the problem of infiltration,” Shah claimed.At Nazira, currently represented by Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia, Shah said the Opposition, despite efforts, would find no reason to accuse the BJP government of corruption.“Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma have ensured that the days of violence, agitation and corruption are over and the ‘parivartan’ (change) to usher in development has begun,” he said.Shah also held an impressive roadshow at Kharagpur in West Bengal in the evening.

Under the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, both the commissioners are required to meet at least once a year alternately in India and Pakistan.“The meeting will take place in New Delhi on March 23-24,” P K Saxena, India’s Indus Commissioner, told PTI.    This will also be the first meeting between the two commissioners after the nullification of special provisions under Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The state was later carved into two union territories—Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir.Since then, India has cleared several hydropower projects in Ladakh.They are Durbuk Shyok (19 MW), Shankoo (18.5 MW), Nimu Chilling (24 MW), Rongdo (12 MW), Ratan Nag (10.5 MW) for Leh, while Mangdum Sangra (19 MW), Kargil Hunderman (25 MW) and Tamasha (12 MW) have been cleared for Kargil.India had conveyed the projects to Pakistan and the issue is expected to come for discussion during the meeting. Saxena said that Pakistan’s concerns to the design of Indian hydropower projects on the Chenab river will also be discussed.    The last year’s meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2020, was cancelled for the first time since the signing of the Treaty, in view of the pandemic situation.India in July 2020 had proposed to Pakistan that the meeting to discuss pending issues pertaining to the Indus Water Treaty be held virtually in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but Pakistan insisted on holding the talks at the Attari check post.However, India said it was not conducive to hold the meeting at the Attari Joint Check Post due to the pandemic.           With the improvement in the situation, this mandatory meeting is being held. All COVID-related protocols will be followed, Saxena said.The meeting will take place after a gap of nearly two-and-half years. The last meeting took place in Lahore in August 2018.The Indian delegation will be led by Saxena with his advisors from the Central Water Commission, Central Electricity Authority and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation.The Pakistani delegation will be led by Syed Muhammad Meher Ali Shah, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters and his eight advisers. Under the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, all the waters of the eastern rivers—the Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi—amounting to around 33 million acre-feet annually is allocated to India for unrestricted use and the waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab—amounting to around 135 MAF annually largely for Pakistan.Under the Treaty, India has been given the right to generate hydroelectricity through a run of the river projects on the western rivers subject to specific criteria for design and operation. It also gives the right to Pakistan to raise concerns on the design of Indian hydroelectric projects on western rivers. “India is committed towards full utilisation of its rights under the Treaty and believes in an amicable solution of issues through discussion,” Saxena said.

15-03-2021||Kolkata||Mamata leads TMC’s march on wheelchair, says injured tiger more dangerous||True to her street fighter image, Mamata Banerjee was back on the roads of Kolkata on Sunday, four days after being injured at the hustings in Nandigram, leading a TMC march on a wheelchair and declaring an injured tiger is far more dangerous.Accompanied by senior TMC leaders, Banerjee was seen greeting the crowd with folded hands, with security personnel pushing her wheelchair.Banerjee joined the five km road show from Mayo Road to Hazra More as part of observation of Nandigram Diwas to commemorate the killing of 14 villagers in police firing during the anti-land acquisition protest in 2007.Banerjee is contesting the high-profile Nandigram seat for the first time against former confidante-turned- adversary Suvendu Adhikari.Addressing the gathering after the hour-long march, Banerjee said attempts to incapacitate her to stop her from campaigning have failed, and asserted she will canvass for TMC candidates across the state on wheelchair.“I have faced a lot of attacks in my life but I have never surrendered before anyone. I will never bow my head. An injured tiger gets more dangerous,” she asserted.Banerjee was injured in her left leg, head and chest while campaigning in Nandigram on March 10 after filing her nomination, an incident the ruling TMC claimed was a “BJP conspiracy to take her life”.The Election Commission, however, ruled out that there was any attack on the West Bengal chief minister and the ruling Trinamool Congress leader after reviewing the reports sent by its two special poll observers and the state government. The Commission concluded that Banerjee sustained injuries due to lapse on part of her security in charge.“Doctors advised me against going out for campaign today. But I felt that I should participate in today’s rally as we have already lost a few days due to my injury.“My pain is not greater than the suffering of people as democracy is being trampled through dictatorship,” she said.Banerjee said she will leave for Durgapur on Sunday evening and address two rallies on Monday.Carrying posters and placards hailing Banerjee as the “daughter of Bengal”, TMC supporters raised slogans against the BJP and called for “defeating the outsiders” in the assembly elections.The TMC activists also chanted the slogan “Bhanga Paye Khela Hobe!” (Will play with broken leg), a reference to Banerjee’s leg injury.“We will continue to fight boldly!  I’m still in a lot of pain, but I feel the pain of my people even more. In this fight to protect our revered land, we have suffered a lot and will suffer more but we will NEVER bow down to COWARDICE!” Banerjee had earlier tweeted minutes before arriving for the march.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||Drastic changes in monetary policy framework can upset bond market: Raghuram Rajan||As the economy slowly comes out of the pandemic blues, former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Sunday cautioned that “drastic changes” in India’s monetary policy framework can upset the bond market as the current system has helped in containing inflation and promoting growth.Rajan, also a noted economist, opined that the government’s ambitious target to make India a USD 5-trillion economy by 2024-25 was “more aspirational, rather than a carefully computed one even before the pandemic”.“I believe the (monetary policy) framework has helped bring inflation down, while giving the RBI some flexibility to support the economy. It is hard to think of what would have happened if we had to run such large fiscal deficits without such a framework in place,” Rajan told PTI in an interview.His remarks were in response to a query on whether he was in favour of reviewing the 2-6 per cent target band for inflation under the monetary policy framework.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the mandate to maintain retail inflation at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side. The central bank’s six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor decides on policy rates keeping this target in mind.The current medium-term inflation target, which was notified in August 2016, ends on March 31. The inflation target for the next five years starting April 1 is likely to be notified this month.Against this backdrop, Rajan said, “We risk upsetting bond markets if we make drastic changes in the framework”.“I think the framework has been beneficial in bringing down inflation, I don’t think it has been costly in slowing growth, and this is probably the wrong time to make drastic changes,” he pointed out.With the government embarking on substantial borrowing plans to boost the coronavirus pandemic-hit economy, there are concerns among certain quarters about the overall financial health, and bond yields have also been on an upward trajectory.The latter trend indicates that government borrowings could become more costly.About reform measures, Rajan said that while the 2021-22 Budget has placed a lot of weight on privatisation, the history of the government delivering on this is checkered, and he wondered how it will be different this time.He pointed out that in the latest Budget, laudably, there is more transparency about the true extent of spending, as well as a degree of conservatism about budget receipts that has not been seen in recent budgets.However, Rajan opined that the budget is less clear about revenue raising and the financial sector actions. The slow projected pace of fiscal consolidation could have been made more feasible by credible measures such as a fiscal council and a debt target, he added.The government has budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore from stake sales in public sector companies and financial institutions, including 2 public sector banks and one general insurance company for the next fiscal beginning April 1.Rajan, currently a Professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that the budget says little about what it will do for the poor and the unemployed.“It also continues the process of raising tariffs. At a time when global demand is rising because of the huge spending in the West, we need to be positioned to export... Raising tariffs is not a sensible way to do this,” he said.About the proposed privatisation of two banks, Rajan said there is very little detail on how this will be done.“I think it would be a colossal mistake to sell the banks to industrial houses,” he said, adding that it will also be politically infeasible to sell any decent-sized bank to foreign banks.The former RBI chief said that perhaps one of India’s private banks may be in a position to acquire a public sector bank, but he is not sure whether they have the appetite.Regarding India’s current macroeconomic situation, he said when the economy shrinks 8 per cent, as it did in fiscal 2021, any rebound because of the end of lockdown coupled with ordinary growth and some pent-up demand can make the subsequent growth numbers look extraordinary.“Virus willing, we will definitely see a huge rebound in growth in 2021-22. We have to be careful in interpreting it, though.“... However, the true test of our resilience is not 2021-22 but 2022-23, when the numbers will be more reflective of our actual situation,” he emphasised.While pointing out that India was in a tough situation before the pandemic because of slowing growth, Rajan said that with a tightening fiscal space, the pandemic has made matters worse by hitting economic activity, worsening the fiscal condition and the plight of small and medium firms and the poor.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected the Indian economy to grow 11.5 per cent in 2021-22 while the RBI has pegged growth at 10.5 per cent for the same period.In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisioned to make India a USD 5 trillion economy and global power house by 2024-25.“The Prime Minister can use it to motivate people but policy makers need to base plans on a more realistic sense of where we are. I presume they are doing so,” Rajan said.On the government’s proposed asset reconstruction company and asset management company, Rajan said with the new ‘bad bank’, the devil is in the details.“If its management has proper incentives, independence and adequate capital, it can improve the restructuring of bad assets significantly.“Poorly designed, the bad bank will just shift bad loans from one pocket of the government to another,” he argued.On bank’s gross non-performing assets (GNPAs), the former RBI governor said the economy cannot really get going until credit flows freely, and credit cannot flow until bank balance sheets are cleaned up and banks are well capitalised.“Whether it needs another asset quality review (AQR) to do this, I don’t know, but I certainly think the government should prioritise this issue,” he opined.“The low amounts set aside to capitalise PSU banks in the budget, despite the alarming rise in NPAs predicted by the RBI, indicates it needs to give this issue more weight,” Rajan said.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||Quad leaders: Committed to free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region||The four leaders of the virtual Quad summit on March 12 have jointly penned an op-ed in the Washington Post.The op-ed dwells on the widened ambit of the grouping apart from its core task of ensuring that the Indo-Pacific is accessible and dynamic, a code for ensuring China does not dominate the maritime zone.US President Joe Biden along with prime ministers Narendra Modi, Scott Morrison and Yoshihide Suga described the Quad as a group of democratic nations dedicated to delivering results through practical cooperation.They wrote that just like the Tsunami of 2004, the four countries have been summoned to “act together in support of a region in need” although they did not mention who had summoned them.The four areas where Quad will work together are climate change that has “grown more perilous”, new technologies have “revolutionised our daily lives”, geopolitics that has “become ever more complex”, and a pandemic that “has devastated the world”.They reiterated that the Indo-Pacific region must remain free, open, resilient and inclusive. “We are striving, governed by international law and bedrock principles such as freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of disputes, and that all countries are able to make their own political choices, free from coercion. In recent years, that vision has increasingly been tested. Those trials have only strengthened our resolve to reckon with the most urgent of global challenges together,’’ the leaders wrote.The Quad leaders pledged to expand and accelerate production in India of safe, accessible and effective vaccines. “We will partner at each stage to ensure that vaccines are administered throughout the Indo-Pacific region into 2022. We will combine our scientific ingenuity, financing, formidable productive capacity and long history of global-health partnership to surge the supply of life-saving vaccines, in close collaboration with multilateral organisations,” they said.The Quad Vaccine Experts Working Group will bring together scientific leaders from Australia, India, Japan and the US to meet the region’s pressing needs. “And though the pandemic prevents us from meeting in person, we will do so before the end of 2021” they promised while recommitting themselves to an Indo-Pacific region that is “free, open, secure and prosperous”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-leaders-committed-to-free-open-secure-and-prosperous-indo-pacific-region-225102
