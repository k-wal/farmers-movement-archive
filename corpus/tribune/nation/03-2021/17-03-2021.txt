17-03-2021||New Delhi||Political obligation not synonymous with constitutional obligation: Dhavan tells SC||Noting that political obligation was not synonymous with constitutional obligation, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan on Wednesday countered before the Supreme Court the argument that circumstances have changed, saying the only changed circumstance is that more people want reservations.“What exactly is the change that has taken place that requires a re-examination of the Indra Sawhney case? Why to go beyond 50%?... Just because there is clamour for it? If more people want it, we have to be more rigorous,” Dhavan told a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.On the third day of the hearing to decide whether the 11-judge Bench in the 1992 verdict in the Indira Sawhney (Mandal) case which fixed 50% ceiling for quota in government jobs and admission to educational institutions should be revisited, Dhavan and senior advocates Pradeep Sancheti and BH Marlapalle opposed the proposition.“When they seek 75% or 80% of reservation, it needs to be kept in mind that there is no obligation at all. Political obligation is not synonymous with constitutional obligation. The standard for reservation above the 50% limit is extremely high. In certain areas, there can be no reservation. Did Maharashtra take this into account?” Dhavan wondered.He said reservation was being given in states because of social pressure and almost as a consequence of threat that “if you don’t do it, we will rebel”.“This was done by the Jat community. Meena community also wants to be included in the Scheduled Caste,” Dhavan submitted.“The secret of India’s success with reservations apart from political factors that have armed it is that the idea behind this is you maintain a balance. If you go beyond (50% ceiling), then there something is wrong,” Dhavan said, adding he didn’t know of any case where any community had been deleted from the list.On Tuesday, senior counsel Shyam Divan had contended that after the 102nd Constitution Amendment, Parliament alone has the power to make changes to the list of ‘Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs)’ as now there’s a specific procedure for identifying SEBCs under the Constitution.The 102nd Constitution Amendment Act, 2018 inserted Article 338B which deals with the structure, duties and powers of National Commission of Backward Class (NCBC) and Article 342A on power of the President to notify a particular caste as Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) and the power of Parliament to change the SEBC list.According to Article 342A, the President may specify the socially and educationally backward classes in the various states and union territories in consultation with the Governor of the state concerned.  However, a law passed by Parliament is needed for the list of backward classes to be amended, Divan had explained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-obligation-not-synonymous-with-constitutional-obligation-dhavan-tells-sc-226615
17-03-2021||New Delhi||Toolkit case: HC grants last opportunity to Centre, police to file reply on Disha Ravi’s plea||The Delhi High Court Wednesday granted last opportunity to the Centre and Delhi Police to file reply on a plea by climate activist Disha Ravi for restraining the police from leaking to the media any probe material in relation to the FIR lodged against her in the toolkit case.Justice Prathiba M Singh said the central government and Delhi Police shall file their counter affidavits within two weeks and listed the matter for further hearing on May 18.“A last and final opportunity is granted to the Centre and Delhi Police to file their counter affidavits within two weeks and rejoinder by petitioner thereafter,” the court said.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and advocate Ajay Digpaul, representing the Centre, and advocate Amit Mahajan, appearing for Delhi Police, sought more time to file their replies to the petition.Ravi was arrested by Delhi Police on February 13 for allegedly being involved in sharing on social media a “toolkit” related to the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three new agri laws, and was granted bail by a trial court here on February 23.The high court was hearing her plea to restrain police from leaking to the media any probe material in relation to the FIR lodged against her.The petition also sought to restrain the media from publishing the content or extract of any private chats, including those on WhatsApp, between her and third parties.Ravi, in her plea, has said she is “severely aggrieved and prejudiced by the media trial surrounding her arrest and the ongoing investigation, where she is being viscerally attacked by the respondent 1 (police) and several media houses”.She has claimed that her arrest from Bengaluru on February 13 by a Cyber Cell team of Delhi Police was “wholly unlawfully and without basis”.She has also contended that in the present circumstances, it was “highly likely” that the general public will perceive the news items “as being conclusive as to the guilt of the petitioner (Ravi)”.She has claimed that the police first “leaked investigative material”—like alleged WhatsApp chats—the substance and details of which were only in the possession of the investigating agency.The high court had on February 19 said certain media coverage of investigation into the FIR against Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a toolkit backing farmers’ protest indicates “sensationalism and prejudicial reporting”, but declined to order removal of any such content at this stage.The issue of removal of content which was already in public domain shall be considered at a later stage, it had said.The high court, in its earlier order, asked media houses to ensure that no leaked investigation material is broadcast as it could affect the probe and directed Delhi Police to abide by its stand on affidavit that it has not leaked nor intends to leak any probe details to the press.Justice Singh had said while a journalist cannot be asked to reveal a source, he/she has to ensure that the source is “verified and authentic” and the content being published is not “merely speculative or conjectural”.The high court also said that police would be entitled to hold press briefings in the matter in accordance with the law and the Ministry of Home Affairs’ 2010 office memorandum with regard to media coverage, including press briefings, with regard to investigations.The police had placed an affidavit categorically denying leaking of any information to the media. It also assured the court that it had no intention of leaking any information to the media.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had said the petition was not maintainable as no complaint was first made to it for taking action against any TV channel or media house for any alleged incorrect reporting of the case.

The body was decomposing and appeared a day or two old,” Yadav said.It was learnt that kidnappers may have demanded a ransom of Rs 10 lakh from the victim’s father and threatened to kill the boy if he went to the police.Locals alleged that despite being informed about the kidnapping, police did not take the matter seriously.

When the final NRC was published on August 31, 2019, a total of 19.06 lakh people were excluded out of the total 3,30,27,661 applicants, which created a ripple across the country.Replying to another question, Rai said there is no provision of detention centres under the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the National Register of Indian Citizens.The Minister said the Supreme Court on February 28, 2012 had directed that foreign nationals, who completed their sentence, shall be released from jail immediately and be kept in an appropriate place with restricted movement pending their deportation or repatriation.Following that directive, Rai said, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued instructions on March 7, 2012 to state governments and UT administrations to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court.Responding to a specific query in the question, the Minister informed that detention centres are set up by the state governments and UT administrations as per their local requirements to keep illegal immigrants and foreigners, as their deportation may be pending for want of proper travel documents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-decision-taken-yet-to-rollout-nationwide-nrc-govt-reiterates-in-rs-226603

By March 15, the number increased to average 1,338. The positivity rate has doubled and RT-PCR share is 89 per cent, Bhushan said.In Chandigarh on March 1, an average of 49 new cases were being reported. By March 15, the number increased to average 111. The positivity rate has increased from 3.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent and RT-PCR share is 40 per cent.“We would want a distinct increasing trend of tests in which RT-PCR share is substantially higher than the current 40 per cent share,” he said.In Chhattisgarh on March 1, an average of 239 new cases were being reported. By March 15, the number increased to average 430. The positivity rate increased from 1.4 per cent to 2.4 per cent and RT-PCR share is 34 per cent.So, again, we would want the RT-PCR tests to increase to up to 70 per cent and also an overall increase in testing.In Gujarat on March 1, an average of 398 new cases were being reported.

Other children informed the girl’s parents about it following which police were alerted.The girl was found in an injured state at an isolated place. The accused was identified and arrested five hours later.Investigating officer in the case Suresh Sharma, who is the circle officer of Chirawa, said the court convicted the man on Tuesday and pronounced the death penalty under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on Wednesday.“Swift action was taken in the case and all evidence collected. The charge sheet was filed and the court pronounced the judgment today,” he said.The court also appreciated the investigation conducted by the police, saying it was an example of an ideal investigation which contained direct, scientific, electronic and circumstantial evidence.It was observed that the circumstantial evidence collected by the police was enough to prove the case.Hailing the judgment, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the police filed the charge sheet within nine days and the court delivered judgment within 26 days of the incident.“This is an example of the efficiency of the police, judiciary and the government’s commitment to bring justice to the victim,” he tweeted.Rajasthan police chief M L Lather also congratulated the Jhunjhunu police team.Inspector General of Jaipur Hawa Singh Ghumariya said more than 40 witnesses and around 250 documents were presented in the court.

You remain peaceful…Dismissed,” the CJI told Dhingra.Comparing the issue raised in the PIL with those in the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws, the PIL submitted that while the government offered to form a high-powered committee for negotiations with farmers, the same has not been done in the case of petitioner’s agitation with regard to agricultural sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-seeking-uniform-guidelines-for-resolution-of-agitations-226600
17-03-2021||New Delhi||Farmers to intensify agitation with 'Bharat bandh' on March 26, burning farm laws on Holi||Ahead of their Sampurna Bharat Bandh on March 26, farmer leaders on Wednesday said they were preparing to intensify the agitation against the three farm laws.During the nationwide strike on March 26 that also marks four months of the farmers’ movement, all shops and other business establishments will remain shut for 12 hours, followed by the burning of the copies of the three laws during “holika dehan” on March 28.“The strike will start from 6 in the morning and will continue till 6 in the evening, during which all shops and dairies and everything will remain closed.“We will burn the copies of the three laws during Holi and hope that better sense prevails within the government, and it repeals the laws, and gives us a written guarantee for MSP,” said Ranjit Raju of Ganganagar Kisan Samiti addressing a press conference.The bandh has found support in all trade and transport unions, students’, youth and women’s unions.“We are also trying to create such meetings at the state level so that the strike is observed everywhere,” said another farmer leader Purushottam Sharma.All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) leader Krishna Prasad said the fact that the movement had managed to continue for as long as 112 days was an achievement in itself, and it would only get stronger from now.He added that the Bharat Bandh will happen at “state, zila, tehsil and village levels”.“The protest has been going on for 112 days. That itself is an achievement. Neither you, nor us had thought that we could do this, and the public has shown that it supports us,” he said.Prasad also expressed concerns over the central government’s move to introduce the Electricity Amendment Bill 2021, claiming that any amendments made to the act would be in violation of the government’s commitment made to the farmers in January.“During the 11 rounds of talks that we have had with the government, Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar said that they accepted our demands over the electricity bill.“The media wrote that 50 per cent demands of the farmers’ movement were resolved. But, now they are trying to introduce the act again. This is cheating,” he said.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

The government is going to bring laws that milk, electricity, fertilisers, seeds and motor vehicles marketing will go into the hands of a few corporates,” he claimed.Giving a call to youth to take charge of the farmers’ movement, Tikait said there are no more jobs left in this country for them, youth should turn to their fields and create job opportunities in the fields itself.He said in the districts of Barabanki and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, when paddy and sugarcane were not purchased at the MSP, the farmers piled up the agricultural commodities at the district collector’s offices. “The government will have to buy the produce on the MSP.”Tikait said the media was not carrying the news of farmer movements in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other parts of the country, but we will reach out to people through social media. In Punjab, Haryana and parts of Rajasthan, agricultural produce was purchased on MSP only, but the farmers stir will get contentious agri laws repealed as well as implementing MSP across the country, he added.In Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, the MSP procurement movement is going to start in the next 15-20 days. Farmers have made adequate arrangements in view of the scorching heat and the agitation will be intensified for the remaining eight months.Revealing that the Samyukta Kisan Morcha will soon give a call to gherao Delhi from all sides, Tikait said millions of people will reach there. After Vidhan Sabha polls results in a few states, the NDA government will realise the heat of the farmers’ movement.Morcha leader Yudhveer Singh said “Modi bhagao, desh bachao” call has to be given. Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, chairman of Rajasthan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (ad hoc), said he will not let the martyrdom of his grandson Navreet Singh go waste. A youth rally will leave Moga on March 25 for Singhu border, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-target-corporates-godowns-if-black-laws-not-repealed-tikait-226582
17-03-2021|| Hyderabad||AP Police books Naidu again for Amravati Project||There is more trouble for former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Chandrababu Naidu after the state police booked another case relating to the Amaravati Project naming him as an accused. Crime Investigation Department (CID) registered an FIR against him along with some other Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders. As per the FIR based on the complaint of a ruling party MLA Alla Rama Krishna Reddy (Nani) to the Additional Director General of Police (CID), PV Sunil Kumar the allegations are that a few farmers from Mangalagiri Constituency had approached the MLA with complaints that influential persons from the previous TDP government had “cheated them by taking away their lands illegally, fraudulently” by keeping them “under confusion and fear of insecurity about their lands”.Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development in the TDP Government, Ponguru Narayana has also been named in the FIR. Naidu has been asked by the CID officials to appear for inquiry at the CID Regional Office in Vijayawada on March 23.   Responding to the notices issued by the CID, TDP state president Kinjarapu Atchannaidu called the move an “act of vengeance” by the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). The TDP has said that the land for the capital at Amaravati was taken with the consent and connivance of the farmers’ consent. Atchannaidu has alleged that the YSRCP government was occupying lands that were assigned to poor farmers for cultivation, to use them towards the government’s housing scheme for the poor and was not trying to bully the politicians from the erstwhile government. It is pertinent to mention that in January, the Andhra Pradesh High Court had quashed the previous criminal case filed by the Andhra Pradesh Government, alleging ‘insider trading’ by Naidu, his family members and some other leaders close to the TDP. The court held that the land was sold willingly, and no insider trading had occurred.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ap-police-books-naidu-again-for-amravati-project-226581
17-03-2021||New Delhi||Lok Sabha: Congress’ Manish Tewari claims vaccination drive not going on properly||Congress’ Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari on Wednesday claimed that the COVID-19 vaccination drive is not going on properly.Initiating the debate on Demand for Grants for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, he also accused the Narendra Modi government of mismanagement during the coronavirus lockdown.  BJP ally JD-U’s Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who praised Prime Minister Modi for “controlling and managing the pandemic well”, in turn accused Tewari “of trying to scare people”.  “Why is the number of cases increasing in Punjab, Singh said, accusing the Congress MP of “doing politics” on an issue related to public health.Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Tewari demanded that India must take the initiative as the current head of the executive board of the World Health Organisation (WHO) holds China responsible for spreading coronavirus across the globe.He also accused the government of “giving more stress on the export of vaccines rather than inoculation of the country’s citizens”.  “So far just 3.5 crore people in the country have been vaccinated while 5.74 crore doses were given to 72 countries. This shows that the government is giving more importance to its vaccine diplomacy rather than inoculation of its own citizens,” he said.Tewari claimed the pace of vaccination is “very slow” and many of those who received the first dose of the vaccine did not take the second dose.“This shows that the vaccination drive is not going on properly,” he said. He also questioned the rationale behind the imposition of a “drastic lockdown” in the country and said that many private hospitals indulged in profiteering rather than giving service to people during the pandemic.Terming this a “sin”, he urged the government to bring a law for the regulation of both private and government hospitals.Singh slammed Tewari for his “failure” to appreciate the leadership of Prime Minister Modi during the pandemic.Defending the government’s decision to export vaccines to other nations, he called it a humanitarian effort.  Criticising the Congress for allegedly doubting the efficacy of Indian vaccines and “spreading rumours” about them, he said: “Do not create panic. What you have said will create a fear psychosis. There is no shortage of Indian vaccines. Everyone will get vaccine phase-wise.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-congress-manish-tewari-claims-vaccination-drive-not-going-on-properly-226580

They are public health goods and therefore vaccines have to be optimally utilised. Vaccine wastage has to be drastically reduced. Any reduction in wastage means that you end up inoculating more people and therefore the chances of disrupting the chain of infection grow that much more,” he said.

17-03-2021||New Delhi||No proposal to appoint regulator for social media: Prasad||The government on Wednesday informed Parliament that there is no proposal with the IT ministry to set up a regulator for social media.Union IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, said the government has released Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, under the IT Act that specifies the due diligence to be followed by all the intermediaries, including the social media intermediaries.“The social media platforms are enjoined to develop a robust grievance redressal system. Presently, there is no proposal with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to appoint a regulator for social media,” Prasad informed the Lok Sabha.The government in February had announced sweeping regulations for social media firms like Facebook and Twitter as well as OTT players such as Netflix, requiring them to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and setting up a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country.The guidelines also make it mandatory for platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp to identify the originator of a message that authorities consider to be anti-national and against security and sovereignty of the country.The new rules related to social media platforms are to be handled by the IT ministry while the Information and Broadcasting ministry will look after content related issues on entertainment apps and online news portals.Prasad said under provision of section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the government blocks unlawful and malicious online content including social media account, in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above.“Under this provision, 9,849 URLs/accounts/webpages, mostly on social media platforms, were blocked during the year 2020,” Prasad said.In response to question whether the government has conducted any study regarding the impact of government’s control over social media vis-a-vis right to freedom of expression enshrined in the constitution, Prasad denied any such study undertaken by the government.He said that the government welcomes criticism, dissent and also the rights of people to ask questions on social media.“However, this needs to be acknowledged that the fundamental right of speech and expression under article 19(1) is also subject to reasonable restrictions under article 19(2) of the Constitution which can be imposed in the interest of security, safety and sovereignty of India, public order, friendly relations with foreign countries etc,” Prasad said.The minister said it is equally important that social media should not be abused or misused to defame, promote terrorism, rampant violence and compromise the dignity of women.

These officers having formidable domain expertise and impeccable track record are deputed for more effective election expenditure monitoring, the poll panel saidAs per its own assessment the EC has identified and marked 259 assembly as “expenditure sensitive constituencies” and asked the observers to keep a more focussed vigil, the Poll panel said in the statement.Distributing cash and gifts during the electoral process is not permitted under the law and is defined as “bribery” which is an offence both under section 171B of the Indian Penal Code and under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

During the search, the DVR was seized.The wife of businessman Mansukh Hiran, who had claimed that the Scorpio was stolen from his possession and who died mysteriously, has alleged that the SUV was being used by Waze for some time.Kazi had also allegedly procured the fake number plates found in the SUV, the official claimed.The SUV case was taken over by the NIA following Hiran’s death.

17-03-2021||New Delhi||Vaccine Maitri raised India's standing, showcased quality of products: Jaishankar||In a rare gesture, the opposition appreciated the Government’s Vaccine Maitri initiative of supplying Covid vaccines to other countries, which, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, said highlighted India’s selfless outlook and the quality of its products.Even amid a global crisis, the "PM’s initiative of such deep friendship raised India’s standing, and it also emerged as a source of strength for vulnerable nations,’’ said Jaishankar while making a statement on the Vaccine Maitri initiative in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.Steering clear of numbers, Jaishankar traced the supply of vaccine to over 70 countries as a natural extension of India’s stature as the pharmacy of the world, and its resolve to help other countries right from the time the pandemic began sweeping the world."There were already demands for India’s pharmaceutical and medical capabilities. We could meet them due to an extraordinary ramp-up of production,’’ he said while attributing the ability to reach out to is citizens and others as a result of the Prime Minister’s initiative of made-in-India. The export of masks, PPE and diagnostic kits, he said, was "so characteristic of our culture".As India contemplated vaccination, it was natural that a similar approach to meeting the needs of the globe was followed.In January, vaccination started in India. And within a few days, the Government began assisting the neighbours in keeping with the PM’s assurance to the UN General Assembly in September 2020 that India’s vaccine production and delivery capability will be used to help all humanity."The international community has great expectations and we are ready. India has believed that the pandemic threatens the entire humanity and the rightful response would be a collective one,’’ he added.Jaishankar, who invoked the PM several times in his speech, did not acknowledge the suggestion by Jairam Ramesh, Anand Sharma (both Congress) and Binoy Vishwam to also acknowledge the contribution of past policies that made India the pharmacy of the world."Success has many fathers. I am delighted to see so many fathers claiming success. They really want to praise Vaccine Maitri but are going about in a roundabout way…it is a great affirmation of the made-in-India programme which India pursued so strongly.’’Jaishankar, however, overlooked Jairam Ramesh’s suggestion to acknowledge the continuity in the policies of the past decades that "led to a situation we take legitimate pride in.’’Ramesh pointed out India’s unique Patents Act of 1970, the dilution of the equity stake of MNCs due to FERA and huge public investments in science and technology that led to the emergence of Indian companies such as Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute.Vishwam also pointed out India did not become the pharmacy of the world in six years. Anand Sharma took note of the "bridges of friendship built and trusts generated because of this initiative’’ but wanted the Government to acknowledge, appreciate and place on record contributions of publicly funded institutions that made India the largest producer of generic medicines in the 90s.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-maitri-raised-indias-standing-showcased-quality-of-products-jaishankar-226547
17-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP case: If there is evidence, why Republic TV, Arnab not named as accused? HC||The Bombay High Court asked the Mumbai police on Wednesday that since the latter claimed to have adequate evidence against Republic TV and its Editor-in- Chief Arnab Goswami in the alleged TRP scam, why had they not named them accused in the case.A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale directed Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Shishir Hiray to inform the court by Thursday whether the police plan to proceed against Goswami and Republic TV.It also asked Hiray to tell the court how much time were the police likely to take to complete the investigation into the case."You are investigating for the last three months.There are two charge sheets, and there seems to be no evidence against them. And this FIR is of October 2020. We are in March 2021," the HC said."Why keep the sword hanging on their head? You are not making them an accused also, why so?" it asked.The bench was responding to submissions made by senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, the counsel for Goswami and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, the company that runs Republic TV channels.Mundargi told the HC that the police had named Goswami and several employees of the ARG Outlier Media as suspects, but had no evidence to charge them as accused in the case."They (police) cannot keep investigating forever. If they have some material against us, they have to show us, they cannot keep playing hot and cold," Mundargi said.However, SPP Hiray said the police have adequate evidence in the case and that they are still "collecting" additional evidence."Then why not make them an accused? We do not think there is anything such as 'suspect' in criminal law," the bench said.The court said the contention of the petitioners, Goswami and the ARG Outlier Media, was that they were always under the fear that some action might be taken against them.The HC will continue hearing the arguments on Thursday.The ARG Outlier Media and Goswami approached the HC last year, filing a bunch of petitions seeking several reliefs in the Television Rating Points (TRP) scam.They alleged that the whole case was malafide and they had been targeted for Republic TV's reportage in connection with the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and Palghar lynching case last year.The Mumbai police in January this year filed two affidavits in the case through Commissioner of Police Param Bir Singh and ACP Shashank Sandbhor of the crime branch, saying they had not targeted the Republic TV or its employees.The police had said their probe was not a result of any political vendetta and there was evidence to show that Goswami had connived with senior officials of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) to rig the TRP of Republic TV.The Republic TV has denied any wrongdoing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trp-case-if-there-is-evidence-why-republic-tv-arnab-not-named-as-accused-hc-226541
17-03-2021||New Delhi||SC terms cancellation of 3 crore ration cards due to non-linking with Aadhaar as 'serious', seeks replies from Centre, states||The Supreme Court on Wednesday termed the cancellation of around three crore ration cards by the Centre due to non-linking with Aadhaar card as “too serious”, and sought response from the Central government and all states on the issue. A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said this matter should not be treated as adversarial as it is too serious a matter. The bench said the matter will be put up for a final hearing.  At the outset, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for petitioner Koili Devi, said the petition deals with the larger issue.  “We see the problem at hand and I have dealt with this kind of matter in Bombay High Court and I think this matter should be filed before the high court concerned,” the CJI said.  The bench told Gonsalves that he has sought a very omnibus kind of relief and widened the scope of the matter.  Gonsalves persisted with his arguments that it is an important issue as the Centre has cancelled around three crore ration cards. The bench said it will hear the matter on some other day as it is persuaded by Gonsalves that the Central government has cancelled the ration cards.  Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi said it is a wrong statement made by Gonsalves that the Centre has cancelled the ration cards.  “We are asking you (Centre) to respond because of the Aadhaar issue. This is not an adversarial litigation. We will hear it finally. Issue notice returnable in four weeks”, the bench said.  Lekhi said that notice has already been issued in the matter and the Centre's response is there on record.Gonsalves said notice has not been issued on the main plea but alternative grievance redressal.  “Principle issue is the cancellation of three crore ration cards and starvation death”, Gonsalves said. On December 9, 2019, the top court had sought responses from all the states over allegations of starvation deaths of people who were deprived of their ration supplies for not having valid Aadhaar cards. “Issue notice returnable in four weeks to the respondent States calling upon them to apprise steps they have taken for implementation of the grievances redressal mechanism contained in Sections 14, 15 and 16 of the National Food Security Act, 2013. Notice may be served on the standing counsel for the state,” the bench had said. The Centre had earlier said that reports suggest that the deaths were not due to starvation.  “No one was denied food because of lack of valid Aadhaar card,” it had said. The PIL has been filed by on Devi, whose 11-year-old daughter Santoshi of Simdega district in Jharkhand died of starvation on September 28, 2018. Santoshi's sister Gudiya Devi is the joint petitioner in the case. The petition pointed out that Santoshi, who belonged to a poor Dalit family, died as the local authorities had cancelled the ration card of her family since they failed to link it with Aadhaar.  It said that subsequently, the family stopped receiving ration from March 2017 and as a result, the entire family had been starving.  Even on the day Santoshi died, her mother could only serve her some tea with salt - the only thing the family had in its kitchen, the plea said, adding that Santoshi succumbed to hunger later that night.

However, if the Hon’ble CM persists in creating and attempting to perpetuate this myth for reasons best known to her, it is singularly, unfortunate and it is only for Hon’ble CM to adjudge as to why she is doing so.”Launching a scathing attack on the Union Home Minister, Banerjee on Tuesday said at a rally in Purulia that he is hatching a conspiracy to harass TMC leaders ahead of the Assembly elections in the state and wondered whether the Election Commission is working as per his instructions.The letter to the TMC leader, Jain, who is also Commissioner in-charge of West Bengal, noted that the Commission had met representatives of her party on four occasions in Delhi and Kolkata.“...if it is stated by Hon’ble CM that the Commission should meet political parties, it is only an attempt to belittle the institution of Commission with repeated innuendos and averments.”Last week, Banerjee was injured while campaigning for the ongoing Assembly elections in Nandigram. The EC had concluded that the then-Director Security Vivek Sahay had failed to stick to the approved route plan; preventing frequent changes in the plan; persuading the Z+ protectee, that is Banerjee, to travel in a bullet-proof car; and persuading her from removing the seat belt, opening the door and standing on the footboard of the moving car, Jain gave details of the turn events in the letter.It added that the Chief Secretary, in consultation with the DGP, had posted IPS officer Gyanwant Singh in place of Sahay. “Chief Secretary would have consulted you/got the approval on file being Hon’ble Chief Minister and Home Minister before issuing the orders of posting Gyanwant Singh. If the Government of West Bengal and you feel sanguine of the appointment of Director Security, the Commission has already accepted this arrangement,” the letter stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-asks-mamata-banerjee-to-refrain-from-belittling-poll-body-by-repeated-innuendos-226498
17-03-2021||New Delhi||While NIA zeroes on Vaze, 'trouble' in Maharashtra's Aghadi government||With NIA zeroing on controversial “Shiv Sena” member, suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, sources are indicating “trouble” in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government.The sources revealed several meetings have been held by allies—the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress—to discuss the issue related to Vaze which has become murkier after the National Investigation Agency on Tuesday seized a Mercedes car, which it claims belongs to the suspended Mumbai Police officer.The car contained the original number plate of the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Rs 5,75,000 in cash, a note counting machine, a set of clothes and kerosene concealed in its boot, it was claimed.The BJP, which has been gunning for the Shiv Sena-led government, is now demanding the resignation of Thackeray.Leading the attack, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis who has called this “just the start of the probe”, is suspecting more.“Much more will come out in the days to come,” he said, slamming the Shiv Sena for “supporting Vaze” and accusing Thackeray and Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of “protecting him like his lawyers”.Not just this, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya also alleged that Vaze had six businesses and two Shiv Sena leaders were his business partners while another party leader, Nitesh Rane, accused him and “a cousin of Aaditya Thackeray of running an IPL extortion racket”.Sena insiders claim Vaze, who is said to have carried out “63 encounters in his career”, was never an active member of the party.He was suspended from the police force in 2004 in connection with the murder and destruction of evidence in the case related to the custodial death of Khwaja Yunus, a bomb blast accused arrested in 2002.Though Vaze made several attempts to get reinstated before he resigned and joined Sena in 2008, he was reinstated last year “due to staff shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic”.The BJP is accusing Thackeray of “inaction” against his “favourite officer whom he reinstated after 16 years and handed over the high-profile cases”.The Shiv Sena, which said the Maharashtra Police is quite capable of solving the case and that the state government had handed the case to the Anti-Terrorism Squad, claims that even while the investigation was on the Centre moved the NIA.It has termed the arrest of Vaze, an accused in the death of automobile parts dealer Mansukh Hiren, by the NIA an “insult” of the Maharashtra Police. According to NIA, Vaze had been arrested for his “role and involvement in placing an explosives-laden vehicle near Carmichael Road on February 25".Currently suspended, speculations are flying around about what he has “told/spilt” to the NIA.Aghadi partner Nationalist Congress Party have convened an “urgent” party meeting to discuss the situation.NCP chief Sharad Pawar met CM Uddhav Thackeray while state NCP president Jayant Patil dismissed speculations regarding the resignation of Home Minister Anil Deshmukh amid reports of some Sena leaders saying that the police department was under his control.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/while-nia-zeroes-on-vaze-trouble-in-maharashtras-aghadi-government-226497

Netflix declined to comment."Bombay Begums" is a series about five women from different parts of society trying to get ahead in modern Mumbai, formerly called Bombay. It was released last week.In a separate letter to Netflix, NCPCR asked the company to remove five scenes which it said violated Indian laws governing Juvenile Justice and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences.In the series, children have been shown indulging "in snorting drugs and taking indecent pictures and selfies in the classroom", NCPCR told Netflix.The child rights group first asked Netflix to stop streaming the series last week after reviewing complaints on Twitter. As of Tuesday, the show was still available for viewing on Netflix in India.Netflix officials met the child rights agency on Tuesday to discuss details of the scenes and objections from NCPCR, which gave the company two days to consult its legal team.Video streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have recently faced a barrage of complaints around promoting obscenity or hurting religious sentiments in India, a key growth market.Amazon Prime Video's "Tandav" political drama is also facing complaints for depicting Hindu gods in a derogatory manner.

17-03-2021||United Nations||Escalation in hostilities will provide opportunities for terror groups in Yemen: India||India has expressed concern over the recent escalation in hostilities in several parts of Yemen, saying it is "worrisome" that this situation will provide opportunities for terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State to spread their presence in the strife-torn country.Speaking at the UN Security Council monthly meeting on Yemen on Monday, India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Nagaraj Naidu termed as "deeply concerning" the reports of military confrontations in Taiz, Al Jawf and Sana'a governorates, asserting that it has resulted in several casualties, extensive destruction and renewed displacement of civilians."We are concerned at the recent escalation in hostilities in several parts of Yemen, especially in Marib which hosts a large number of internally displaced Yemenis,” Naidu said."The current escalation will also provide opportunities for terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State to spread their presence in Yemen, which is worrisome,” he said.Naidu also condemned the drone and missile attacks launched by Ansarallah into Saudi Arabia and the deliberate targeting of civilian and energy infrastructure in the country, calling upon all parties to the conflict to eschew violence and to take meaningful steps towards dialogue and negotiations for a political settlement. Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths told the Council that there has been a “dramatic” deterioration of the conflict in Yemen and Ansar Allah's offensive on Marib governorate continues, putting civilians, including an estimated one million internally displaced persons, at risk. "Cross-border attacks have also increased significantly in recent weeks. I am like all of us concerned by the intensification of the missile and drone strikes, including ones that have targeted civilian and commercial infrastructure in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Subsequently, airstrikes took place within the confines of Sana'a city, endangering civilians there as well,” he said.Griffiths stressed that there should be no preconditions for resuming the political process.“Resuming the process, and engaging seriously in it, is an obligation upon the warring parties anywhere. They need to engage constantly and seriously at all stages with the United Nations to make this happen,” he said.He said they owe it to the people that they represent to provide hope even in these days that there is an end in sight to this conflict."I am alarmed, to be very frank, that the mere fact of meeting across the table to discuss with us or with others or with each other the contours of ending the war is being framed by some, not by all, as a concession rather than an obligation, as a transaction rather than a priority,” the UN special envoy said.Naidu recalled that two years ago, when Yemen was faced with a perilous situation in Hudaydah, the international community had acted swiftly and decisively, which resulted in the signing of the Stockholm Agreement and averted a humanitarian catastrophe."A similar focused diplomatic push is required now, not only to stop the battle for Marib, but also conflicts elsewhere in the country,” he said. Underlining that the already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen requires the full attention of the international community, Naidu said pledges from Yemen's regional partners to support humanitarian and aid operations in the country and the enhanced contribution of some donor countries give reasons for hope. India expressed disappointment over recent talks on exchange of prisoners and detainees ending without any agreement between the parties, voicing hope that there is resumption of talks in the near future. Expressing support for the contribution made by Yemeni women to peace efforts in the country, Naidu said India has consistently held that greater participation of women in areas of conflict resolution, peace negotiations, peacekeeping and peacebuilding is conducive for lasting peace and security. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/escalation-in-hostilities-will-provide-opportunities-for-terror-groups-in-yemen-india-226479

The committee believes laws prevalent in any country should reflect current situation in society and polity and be in consonance with changing times. We recommend that the government should review and scrutinise laws which no longer serve their purpose and intended objectives from time to time with suggestions from all stakeholders and general masses and take initiative for their repealing,” the panel on law and justice said today.It recommended that the government may explore the provision of including sunset clause in all proposed legislations.The panel on law and justice today also questioned 50 per cent vacancies in the legislative department of the government and its two wings. “It is seen that out of 232 sanctioned posts in the department, 91 posts are lying vacant. In Vidhi Sahitya Prakashan, 26 of the 75 sanctioned posts are lying vacant. Even in official languages wing, 56 of the 154 sanctioned posts were vacant till December 31, 2020.

17-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||House panel endorses one poll||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 16The government’s “one nation, one election” plan today got a boost with the parliamentary standing committee on law and justice endorsing it, besides batting for common electoral rolls for the Lok Sabha, state and local body elections.Committee bats for common poll rollsThe introduction of common electoral rolls will purify the voters’ lists, check malpractices and unnecessary duplication. — Panel reportSee if Lokpal Act can be revisited, Centre told“Holding simultaneous elections will reduce the burden on exchequer, expenditure of political parties and ensure that human resources are utilised optimally. It will reduce voters’ apathy towards frequent elections and rather enthuse them, which will ultimately enhance participation in the electoral process,” the panel said, adding that common electoral rolls were necessary to make simultaneous elections a reality.“All-out efforts should be made for the implementation of the common electoral rolls,” said the panel in its report tabled in both Houses on Tuesday.Headed by BJP’s Bhupendra Yadav, the panel argued that elections around the year — whether for local bodies, state Assemblies or the Lok Sabha — put a strain on the state machinery and created hurdles in governance.“Our country remains in election mode throughout the year. We are of the view that the idea of ‘one nation, one election’ is not new to our country as the first three General Elections (1952, 1957 and 1962) were held simultaneously,” said the panel.Holding simultaneous elections would entail amendment to the Constitution to have fixed terms for local bodies, legislative assemblies and the Lok Sabha.Amendments would also be required for common electoral rolls. “But common rolls will be good for the democratic health of our country as these will lessen the burden on exchequer. Wider consultation with all political parties should be held to reach a consensus,” the report said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/house-panel-endorses-one-poll-226325

Bank leaders warned they would also resort to an indefinite agitation like farmers, if the government remained insensitive to their demands.“Interests of workers of banks that are likely to be privatised will be protected. Whether their salaries or scale or pension, all will be taken care of,” she assured.The strike will be followed by a two-day strike by insurance sector employees. Trade union leaders are now in talks with farmer unions and transporters for a nationwide bandh towards the month-end.Sitharaman said the financial sector had been included in the four areas where the presence of public sector would remain. The government had earlier said the presence of public sector enterprises in these sectors would be minimal. “Not all banks are going to be privatised,” she said. Sitharaman also announced the decision to set up a Development Finance Institution to help raise long-term funds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bank-sale-not-to-hit-jobs-fm-allays-fears-226326

The Lok Sabha had passed the Bill in March last year.Under the law, doctors will face up to one year in prison and fine or both if they disclose the mother’s identity except to an authorised person.Demands for changes to the abortion law had intensified after a Chandigarh-based minor, raped for months by her maternal uncle, delivered a baby in August 2017. The 10-year-old underwent C-section after the SC rejected her request for abortion.The Bill accepts “failure of contraceptive” as a legal reason for abortion in cases of unmarried women. Such a condition is presently allowed only for married women.“The amendments have been made keeping global practices in mind. The law will preserve the dignity of women,” said Harsh Vardhan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-nod-to-bill-on-abortion-till-24-weeks-in-special-cases-226332

17-03-2021||New Delhi||Worse than they imagined: Rahul on V-Dem report on India’s freedom||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the situation in India was worse than imagined by foreign organisations who recently rated India poorly on freedom indices.In a virtual talk with Professor Ashutosh Varshney of US’ Brown University, Gandhi said although India does not need a stamp on freedom from foreign organisations but in fact “the situation is worse than they imagined”.Gandhi was reacting to questions on Sweden’s V-Dem and US based Freedom House rating India poorly on freedom.Noting that “electoral democracy can be destroyed” if someone can control the social media in the 20th century, Gandhi said about reports of foreign organisations on India’s freedom.“These are foreign institutions and they have their view but frankly, we don’t need a stamp from them…but directionally what they said was correct. I would say they are much behind the curve. I think the situation is actually much worse than they imagined,” said Gandhi days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called India the mother of democracy at an event to launch the celebrations for the 75th year of India’s Independence.Earlier the government denounced the Freedom House report as “misleading”.At a recent media summit, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had while reacting to the reports on India’s freedom said the foreign organisations were practicing “hypocrisy”.Jaishankar described these organisations as “self-appointed custodians of the world who find it very difficult to stomach that somebody in India is not looking for their approval”.Gandhi today said an election was not simply about people voting.“An election is about a judiciary that is being fair, about a debate that is taking place in Parliament. These things are needed for the vote to count,” Gandhi said.He said dictators Saddam Hussain and Gaddafi used to have elections and win them but there was no institutional framework to protect that vote.Gandhi also alleged that if someone controls WhatsApp and Facebook, one can control the narrative.“Facebook India head is a BJP person. A girl recently left the Congress party, went to Facebook, they found out she is from Congress and said you can’t come,” Gandhi alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/worse-than-they-imagined-rahul-on-v-dem-report-on-indias-freedom-226147
17-03-2021||New Delhi||One poll will reduce voters’ apathy of frequent elections: Parliamentary panel||Batting for holding of simultaneous elections in the country, a parliamentary committee on Tuesday said this will reduce the burden on the exchequer, expenditure of political parties and also ensure that human resources are optimally utilised.“The committee also believes that simultaneous elections will reduce voters’ apathy of frequent elections and will enthuse general population and voters in particular which will ultimately enhance voters’ participation in the electoral process,” the department-related standing committee on law and justice, and personnel ministries said in its report on demands for grants for the law ministry.The report was tabled in both Houses on Tuesday.The committee said it is of the view that the idea of ‘One Nation, One Election’ or simultaneous elections is not new to the country as the first three Lok Sabha elections in 1952, 1957 and 1962 were held simultaneously only and it can be brought into the mainstream with suitable amendments to the Constitution.“In view of this, certain provisions of the Constitution may be amended to have fixed terms for local bodies, legislative assemblies and the Lok Sabha for holding simultaneous elections. The terms of legislative assemblies and Lok Sabha are also required to be synchronised with one another and the mechanism in this regard requires to be evolved with political consensus as the term of the respective state assemblies need to be reduced or increased,” the report said.It said having continuous elections around the year whether it is for local bodies, state assemblies or Lok Sabha, put a big strain on the state machinery which further causes hurdles in governance.“Our country remains in election mode throughout the year,” the report observed.The first, second and third elections after promulgation of the Constitution were held simultaneously. However, premature dissolution of some legislative assemblies in 1968 and 1969 caused discontinuation of holding simultaneous elections, it noted.“The renewed emphasis on the concept of simultaneous elections was made in 1983 when the Election Commission brought out its first annual report and recommended for holding simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies as it will reduce expenditure and ensure effective use of manpower and human resources,” the report noted.The then Law Commission headed by Justice B P Jeevan Reddi in its 170th Report in 1999 on Reform of Electoral Laws also favoured holding of simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies as it will ensure stability in governance, the panel said.A couple of years ago, the Law Commission, this time under Justice B S Chauhan (retd), had recommended holding simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies to save public money.The draft submitted to the law ministry had, however, cautioned that holding simultaneous elections is not possible within the existing framework of the Constitution.It had recommended amendment to the Constitution and electoral laws.The Centre has been toying with the idea for quite some time now. The government think-tank, NITI Aayog, had suggested synchronised two-phase Lok Sabha and assembly polls from 2024 to ensure minimum campaign-mode disruption to governance.

17-03-2021||New Delhi||Parliament nod to Bill to raise upper limit for abortions to 24 weeks in special cases||Rajya Sabha on Tuesday passed a Bill to raise the upper limit for permitting abortions from the present 20 weeks to 24 for “special categories of women” including rape survivors, victims of incest, minors and  differently-abled.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to amend the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 was passed by voice vote. The bill was passed by Lok Sabha about a year ago.A resolution moved by Congress leader Pratap Singh Bajwa to send the bill to a select committee of Rajya Sabha was defeated by voice vote, along with some other amendments proposed by members.“The bill as amended is passed,” Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh said.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the amendments in the bill have been made after studying global practices and wide consultation within the country.“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we will not frame any law which harms women. This is to preserve and protect the dignity of women,” he said.The minister said the suggestions and objections made to the bill by some members were symbolic in nature and aligned with their party ideology.Besides Congress, members of various parties, including Shiv Sena, AITC, CPI, CPI-M and Samajwadi Party, had demanded to send the bill to the select committee.The bill amends the act passed in 1971 to Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2020.Under the new act, pregnancy in special can be terminated “where the length of the pregnancy exceeds 20 weeks but does not exceed 24 weeks” if no less than two registered medical practitioner are of the opinion that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health or there is substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from any serious physical or mental abnormality.The act bars registered medical practitioners from revealing the name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated as per the new law except to a person authorised by any law during that time.Anyone who violates the privacy norms defined under the act may be punished with imprisonment of up to 1 year or fine or both under amended act.Every state government and union territory will have to constitute a medical board comprising a gynaecologist, a paediatrician, a radiologist or sonologist and any member as may be notified by the respective government to handle functions under prescribed by rules under the new act.Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi said the decision to terminate a pregnancy impacts a woman mentally, physically and emotionally.“And for her who is in the advanced stage of pregnancy and a stage where she knows there is a life inside her womb, for her to take that decision is a difficult one indeed. For her across various medical boards with three doctors and some state representatives, I think is extremely demeaning to her, is invasion of her privacy, invasion of her choice and creating more bureaucratic hurdles needed at the time when she needs to take that decision,” she noted.Santanu Sen from the AITC noted that the bill does not say anything about the sex workers.Similarly, Binoy Viswam of the CPI said the right of making a decision to terminate the pregnancy should be with the women and not with the medical board.Congress leader Amee Yajnik said that there is no mention of time frame to taking a decision by these boards as prescribed in the bill,” she said.Fauzia Khan from the NCP said the bill should be sent to the select committee as it is incomplete.“Since all the stakeholders have not been taken into confidence, I suggest it goes to the select committee,” she said.She noted that taking the opinion of two specialist doctors, especially in rural areas, was an impractical expectation.“Opinion of one specialist should suffice in the gestation period of 20-24 weeks,” Khan said.Samajwadi Party leader Chaudhary Sukhram Singh Yadav also asked the government to send the bill to a select committee to remove all deficiencies.Jharna Das Baidya of the CPI-M said the MTP Act in the current form was against unmarried women.

The Committee believes laws prevalent in any country should reflect current situation in society and polity and be in consonance with changing times. We recommend that the Government should review and scrutinize laws which no longer serve their purpose and intended objectives from time to time with suggestions from all stakeholders and general masses and take initiative for their repealing,” the panel on law and justice said today.It recommended that the government may explore the provision of including sunset clause in all the proposed legislations.The panel on law and justice today also questioned 50 pc vacancies in Legislative Department of the government and its two wings. “It is seen that out of 232 sanctioned posts in the Department, 91 posts are lying vacant. In Vidhi Sahitya Prakashan, 26 of the 75 sanctioned posts are lying vacant. Even in Official Languages Wing, 56 of the 154 sanctioned posts were vacant till December 31, 2020. Having large vacancies impedes the smooth and efficient functioning of the organization,” said the Committee adding that legislation is one of the instruments of articulating the policy of the Government and the Legislative Department has a major role to play in formulating constitutionally valid and effective legislation.“The Committee is of the view that the concerned administrative ministries and legislative department should ensure that drafting of Bill is done by a person of high calibre having a sound legal background and experience and it should also assess the impact from the point of view of scrutiny and judicial review,” said the panel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/obsolete-laws-parliamentary-panel-for-sunset-clause-in-future-legislations-226121

17-03-2021||London||UK peers debate freedoms in India, minister points to close India-UK ties||Peers in Britain’s House of Lords held a debate on the issue of “freedoms of non-governmental organisations, academics and other groups in India” and called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to take up the issues directly with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi during his visit to New Delhi next month.The “India: Restrictions on Freedom” debate in the Upper House of the Parliament was called by crossbench peer Lord Richard Harries on Monday and, as is customary, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Lord Zac Goldsmith responded on behalf of the government to highlight the close ties between the UK and India which allow Britain to raise all issues as part of an ongoing dialogue.He pointed to a “very deep and broad relationship” with the world’s largest democracy, with which the UK’s trade and investment partnership is “thriving” and collaboration on defence and security mean the two countries a “force for good in the world”.“Our approach has always been to raise any concerns directly with the Indian government. We will continue to engage India on the full range of human rights matters and raise our concerns where we have them — as we do — including at ministerial level,” said Lord Goldsmith.“The Prime Minister will visit India shortly. That will be an opportunity to discuss a very wide range of bilateral and multilateral issues directly with the Indian government. Of course, where we have specific concerns, the Prime Minister will raise them directly with the government of India, as you would expect of a close friend and partner,” he said.The Lords debate comes a week after a debate in a House of Commons committee room on the issue of farmers’ protests in India over agricultural reforms.India has firmly told Britain that the country’s MPs should refrain from practising “vote bank politics” by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy.During the debate in the House of Lords, around eight cross-party peers called on the Boris Johnson led UK government to make representations to the Indian government over issues such as “the closure of Amnesty International India and the freezing of its accounts”, the situation in Kashmir and the “imprisonment of journalists and the fear of persecution felt by non-Hindu minorities, Dalit activists, NGOs and all those campaigning against human rights violations”.“The strong relationship with India, built on trust and mutual respect, should give us the confidence to play the role of a critical friend. That means stressing the importance of a free civil society in a democracy,” said Lord Roy Collins, an Opposition Labour Party peer.“Until recently India has broadly upheld the democratic principles and traditions she inherited from the UK. It is now observable that the Indian government has restructured some hitherto democratic freedoms in a number of areas,” noted Lord Howard Flight, a Conservative Party peer.Lord Goldsmith responded to all the issues raised by pointing to regular exchanges with the Indian High Commission in London and the Indian government.On the issue of Kashmir, he reiterated the UK government stance of being “concerned by the lack of communication between India and Pakistan and its impact on tensions” but that it is not for the UK to “prescribe a solution or act as a mediator”.The UK government had sought to reiterate that the issue is “absolutely and totally” an internal matter for India and highlighted that the scheduling of debates in Parliament are just part of the nature of its parliamentary democracy.The Indian government took strong exception over the Commons debate as “gross interference in the politics of another democratic country.”Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla summoned the British High Commissioner in New Delhi on March 9 and conveyed India’s strong opposition to the “unwarranted and tendentious” discussion on India’s agri reforms in the UK Parliament, describing it a “gross interference” in politics of another country.Shringla advised the envoy that British MPs should refrain from practising “vote bank politics” by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy.India has also consistently asserted that protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity.

17-03-2021||New Delhi||22 of world’s 30 most polluted cities are in India: Report||Twenty-two of the world’s 30 most polluted cities are in India, with Delhi being ranked as the most polluted capital city globally, a new report said on Tuesday.The report is prepared by Swiss organisation, IQAir, in the form of the ‘World Air Quality Report, 2020’, which has released globally.The report, however, shows that Delhi’s air quality improved by approximately 15 per cent from 2019 to 2020.It said despite the improvement, Delhi ranked as the 10th most polluted city and the top polluted capital city in the world.“India continues to feature prominently at the top of the most polluted cities ranking, with 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities globally,” the report said.Besides Delhi, the 21 other Indian cities among the 30 most polluted cities in the world are Ghaziabad, Bulandshahar, Bisrakh Jalalpur, Noida, Greater Noida, Kanpur, Lucknow, Meerut, Agra and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Bhiwari in Rajasthan, Faridabad, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad, Bandhwari, Gurugram, Yamunanagar, Rohtak and Dharuhera in Haryana, and Muzaffarpur in Bihar.As per the report, the top most polluted city is Xinjiang in China followed by nine Indian cities.Ghaziabad is the second most polluted city in the world followed by Bulandshahar, Bisrakh Jalalpur, Noida, Greater Noida, Kanpur, Lucknow and Bhiwari.The global cities ranking report is based on PM2.5 data from 106 countries, which is measured by ground-based monitoring stations, most of which is operated by government agencies.The report also reveals the impact of COVID-19 lockdown and behavioural changes on global particulate pollution (PM2.5) levels.Major sources of India’s air pollution include transportation, biomass burning for cooking, electricity generation, industry, construction, waste burning and episodic agricultural burning.“The transportation sector is one of the major contributors to India’s leading PM2.5 emission sources across cities,” the report said.Contextualising the global IQAir report in the Indian context, Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner at Greenpeace India said while many cities, including Delhi, have recorded marginal improvements in air quality due to lockdowns, the health and economic cost of air pollution remains severe.He said it is pertinent that governments prioritise sustainable and clean energy sources, as well as the cities, need to encourage low cost, active and carbon-neutral mobility choices such as walking, cycling, and accessible public transport.“Speeding up the transition to clean energy and clean transport not only saves lives but also dramatically reduces healthcare-related costs,” Chanchal said.“The year 2020 brought an unexpected dip in air pollution. In 2021, we will likely see an increase in air pollution due to human activity, again. We hope this report will highlight that urgent action is both possible and necessary to combat air pollution, which remains the world’s greatest environmental health threat,” said CEO of IQAir Frank Hammes.

Instead of running the country, he is sitting in Kolkata and hatching a conspiracy to harass TMC leaders. What do they want? Do they want to kill me? Do they think that they will win this election by killing me? They are wrong," she said while addressing a rally here.Banerjee also wondered whether the Election Commission had lost its independence, and alleged that the poll panel is working as per Shah's instructions."Is Amit Shah running the EC? He is giving instructions to the EC. What happened to their independence? My director, security (Vivek Sahay) was removed (by EC) as per his instructions," she alleged.Banerjee claimed that Shah, who came back to Kolkata on Monday night from Guwahati and held a series of meetings with the BJP's state leaders, was "hatching conspiracy as he has understood after witnessing poor turnout at his rallies that the saffron party is still miles away from winning the Assembly elections".

They include union Minister Supriyo from Tollygunge and Nishit Pramanik and Locket Chatterjee from Dinhata and Chunchura respectively. Dasgupta is the party’s nominee for Tarakeshwar assembly segment. Sources, however, say some decisions, including fielding the sitting MPs, has not gone down well among those “preparing” for the seats for “months now”.“Amid the election blitzkrieg by the top leadership, there is a certain amount of anger among cadres over the candidate’ selection, including sitting MPs like Dasgupta, Babul Supriyo and Locket Chatterjee being fielded,” said a source familiar with ground situation in the poll-bound West Bengal where the BJP is engaged in a tough fight with ruling TMC.“BJP state leaders working and preparing the ground in several constituencies are angry over ticket' distribution. The delay in seat announcement for later phases may be a part of the strategy but that too is causing unrest among cadres,” observers say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nominated-member-swapan-dasgupta-resigns-from-rajya-sabha-seat-226048
17-03-2021||New Delhi||Full-blown political slugfest over Sachin Vaze in Maharashtra||While the country’s attention is riveted towards high-profile elections in West Bengal, political developments in Maharashtra since the arrest of controversial Mumbai police cop Sachin Vaze are no less interesting. While the BJP stepped up its offensive against the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government with more allegations, the Shiv Sena accused it of “insulting the Maharashtra police”. Aghadi partner Nationalist Congress Party called an “urgent” party meeting to discuss the situation arising out of the arrest of Vaze in the Ambani bomb scare case. NCP chief Sharad Pawar also met CM Uddhav Thackeray. State NCP president Jayant Patil dismissed speculations of the resignation of Home Minister Anil Deshmukh saying that “Anil Deshmukh is our Home Minister, and he will continue to remain so". Meanwhile, a day after former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said that the arrest of Vaze “is just the start of the probe and much more would come out in the days to come”, senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiya alleged that the controversial Mumbai cop had six businesses and two Shiv Sena leaders were his business partners. Another BJP leader, Nitesh Rane, accused him and a cousin of Aaditya Thackeray of “running an IPL extortion racket”.The Shiv Sena hit back, claiming that the BJP-led Centre had “insulted” the Maharashtra Police force. A scathing article in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' stated that the Maharashtra Police was quite capable of solving the case, but the NIA sent by the central government arrested Vaze. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the state government handed the case over to the Anti-Terrorism Squad realising the seriousness of the situation. However, even while the investigation was on, the Centre sent the NIA, creating “unnecessary interference in the case”. Terming the arrest of Vaze, an accused in the death of automobile parts dealer Mansukh Hiren, by the NIA an “insult” of the Maharashtra Police, the Sena alleged it was a deliberate move.According to NIA spokespersons, Vaze had been arrested for his “role and involvement in placing an explosives-laden vehicle near Carmichael Road on February 25". Currently suspended, speculations are flying around about what he has “told/spilled out ” to the NIA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/full-blown-political-slugfest-over-sachin-vaze-in-maharashtra-226018
