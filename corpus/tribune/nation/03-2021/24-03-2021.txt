24-03-2021||New Delhi||SC reserves order on plea for stay on sale of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its order on a plea by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking to restrain the authorities from opening any further window for sale of electoral bonds in view of the ensuing assembly polls in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The Centre and the Election Commission opposed the ADR’s plea before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, even as the petitioner NGO’s counsel Prashant Bhushan demanded a stay on sale of anonymous electoral bonds, terming it legalised corruption, which paved the way for shell companies to offer bribes.Expressing concern over possible misuse of electoral bonds, the Bench asked the Centre to examine it."If a political party gets Rs 100 crore worth bonds, what is the control over the use of these bonds for illegal activities or purposes outside political agenda?" it asked.On behalf of the Centre, Attorney General KK Venugopal defended it saying, after the electoral bonds scheme was launched in 2018, black money in elections has been kept under check as these bonds could be purchased only through cheques or demand drafts.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, representing the Election Commission, opposed the plea for stay on electoral bonds, saying it was one step ahead of unaccounted cash system. He however said the EC wanted transparency in the electoral bonds scheme.Citing ensuing assembly polls ADR had on March 9 moved the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing of its PIL challenging the Electoral Bonds Scheme for funding political parties.Contending that there was a serious apprehension that further sale of Electoral Bonds before the upcoming state assembly elections would further increase “illegal and illicit funding” of political parties through shell companies, the NGO demanded that no further opening of window for the sale of Electoral Bonds should be allowed during the pendency of its petition.The PIL has been pending for the last two years and the RBI and Election Commission had said that illicit monies were being transacted, the NGO had submitted.A similar plea was filed by ADR in October last year ahead of the Bihar Assembly polls that were held in November 2020.The NGO’s petition against the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme is already pending before the top court, which had earlier refused to stay it ahead of Delhi assembly polls last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-order-on-plea-for-stay-on-sale-of-electoral-bonds-229930

It aims at preparing students for the 21st century and lays emphasis on competency-based education rather than an education which tests rote learning. "The CBSE has had a collaboration with British Council and three UK agencies, Cambridge, NARIC and Alphaplus who are helping CBSE in attaining this objective. The work has already started, and significant progress has been made and we do look forward to this co-operation and working with British Council in the future," CBSE Chairman Manoj Ahuja said. The framework is the basis for a larger project exercise currently underway where 40 assessment designers, 180 test item writers and 360 master trainer mentors are being trained in using this framework to create model question bank and collection of ideal lesson plans.In the first phase selected Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas, UT Chandigarh and private schools across the country will participate in the programme which will be rolled out to all 25,000 CBSE schools in India by 2024.Barbara Wickham OBE, Director India, British Council, said "Education and research collaboration is central to the India-UK relationship. The reformed assessment framework will support high quality teaching for both an improved learning experience and outcomes for all students in CBSE schools"."Our extensive work with government agencies in India over the past few decades and our links across the whole UK education network, meant we were able to propose a framework that will not only bring international assessment standards to Indian schools, but accompany it with an implementation roadmap tailored for India. We are committed to working closely with the CBSE and Indian school system stakeholders in the last mile delivery of the project," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-launches-competency-based-assessment-framework-aligned-with-nep-for-classes-6-to-10-229904

The migrant workers had returned during the lockdown through different modes. They also returned back to their work via flights provided by the companies. Now the flight ticket costs are being deducted from their salaries, which is an inhuman and irresponsible behaviour." The state government has written to the Central government to take action against the companies which are deducting air ticket costs from the salaries of the migrant workers.The official said the migrant workers returned to work as companies provided them air tickets. They had returned to Jharkhand by foot, on bicycles, buses and special trains during the lockdown.Some of the migrant workers working in difficult terrains were rescued and brought back to Jharkhand by the state government with the help of the people of Jharkhand living in other states.As per the complaint of the migrant workers, the air ticket cost is being deducted in two to three EMIs from their salaries.

The crew –driver and guard – will be provided by the Indian Railways. As far as other services are concerned, maybe housekeeping, on-board housekeeping, maybe catering, maybe all the other courtesies that are extended to passengers, I do not think that the government should interfere in that.“We should encourage private participants in PPP to get the best of talent, best of people, and train them and engage them, and make sure that they work efficiently so that passengers get good service. I would believe that it is in the best interest of the success of introducing modern and very efficient train services that those services are left to the private partner and let them hire those employees. Ultimately it is the youth of India who will get jobs, it is the young boys and girls from India who will get work opportunities, ´Goyal said.“These are all modern trains which are not already being used by the Railways. So, if we take that responsibility on ourselves, then we cannot be sure what is required, what is not required and whether we have the skill sets. The idea is to bring really world class trains. So, we decided that the maintenance is also their responsibility,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-trains-on-ppp-mode-%C2%A0maintenance-will-be-by-private%C2%A0operator-piyush-goyal-229896

There will come a time when they will get rid of it. There are many Muslim countries where 'burqa' is  banned," Shukla told reporters, without elaborating on his claim.The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 makes the practice of instant divorce through "triple talaq" among Muslims a punishable offence.Under the provisions of the Act, a Muslim man who pronounces "triple talaq" upon his wife can be sentenced to a jail term that may extend to three years.Shukla, the Uttar Pradesh Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs minister, said 'burqa' is "inhuman and evil custom" and added that those with progressive thinking are shunning it and not pressing for its use.On his letter to the DM in which he raised objection to the volume of loudspeakers at the mosque near his house, the minister said on Wednesday that those having problems should dial '112' and inform police about it, adding if proper steps are not taken, he will decide further course of action."Namaaz is offered five times in a day, and throughout the day. As a result of it, I face problems in doing Yoga, meditation, puja (worship) and discharging government duties," Shukla had said in the letter, referring to the Kajipura Madina Masjid in his constituency.Shukla had said there are a number of schools in the vicinity of the mosque and the practice hampers their studies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-minister-now-calls-burqa-evil-custom-says-practice-will-end-229878

They are collecting money from poor people...from hoteliers and pubs.”“Rs 100 crore is only from one city in Maharashtra,” Scindia said, referring to the former Mumbai Police Commissioner alleging that the Home Minister in the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Agadi government in Maharashtra was putting pressure on tainted police personnel to collect Rs 100 crore per month from pub and restaurant owners in Mumbai city.At another instance he retorted to Jairam Ramesh, asking him not to be agitated.Scindia had junked the Congress to join the BJP following which he was elected to Rajya Sabha. The satirical exchanges between him and the Congress Members suggested of lingering bad blood between them.Scindia’s joining the BJP led to his loyalist Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh junking the party as well, leading to collapse of Kamal Nath-led Congress government, and subsequent formation of BJP government in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sparks-fly-thick-and-fast-between-scindia-and-congress-members-in-rajya-sabha-229875

24-03-2021||New Delhi||LS passes Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021Earlier, the government brought the historic bill in Lok Sabha to prioritise children in administration by making district magistrates accountable for child protection in their areas besides granting DMs powers to monitor shelter homes and pass adoption orders.“We can’t wait for our children to become victims...serious lapses have been found in the audit of 7000 child shelter homes in India. For the first time in the history of Independence, we are going to prioritise children in administration. India’s children will, henceforth, be part of the list of administrative priority of DMs,” said the Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani while introducing the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection Amendment Bill 2021.The Bill besides making DMs responsible for inspection, review and monitoring of child care institutions, also defines offences under which 16 to 18-year-olds can be tried as adults.The minister cited a shocking instance from Bhagalpur in Bihar to make the case for amendments. She spoke about boys home in the district where children left notes in the complaint box for years pleading to be rescued from the rescue Home, but no one learnt of the crisis because the keys of the complaint box were with the child Home management.“When finally the box was opened, cries of help from children blurted out,” revealed Irani—noting, that it was time to make child welfare committees accountable for lapses and to define the line of responsibility in respect of children.Irani said the audit of 7000 homes by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had shown that 29 pc homes were not registered despite the mandatory requirement under the 2015 amendment.“Serious findings of the audit include—26 pc have no child welfare officer; one fourth have no bathing area; three-fifth have no toilet; one third have no drinking water source; 50 pc Don’t have separate beds for children, and one fourth said they had never been inspected by a CWC,“ Irani informed the house.She later spoke of a four-year-old from Prayagraj who wasn’t put up for adoption until she turned 12.“It took a citizens’ complaint to NCPCR to help the girl,” Irani said justifying powers to DMs in the amendment Bill to issue adoption orders, something only courts hitherto did.The minister said that about 900 adoption cases were pending in courts for disposal. Noting that a mechanism to ensure CWC members were qualified and accountable was overdue.“We are empowering DMs to protect children. Today’s reform is a human pledge not of government but this parliament. Politics can divide us but protection of children is an issue that concerns all of us,” said Irani.Speaking on the Bill Patiala MP Preneet Kaur said the government must carefully consider whether overburdened DMs will be able to yield the desired results.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ls-passes-juvenile-justice-care-and-protection-of-children-amendment-bill-229864
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Give 3-day notice to Arnab in case of his arrest: HC to police||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the Mumbai Police to give the advance notice of three days to Republic TV's editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami if it wanted to arrest him in the Television Rating Point (TRP) scam case.A bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale also dismissed the submission of state counsel Deepak Thakre that Goswami had to face the investigation and could not claim any special status.The bench noted the police had been investigating the case for three months now and was yet to name Goswami as an accused in the case.Goswami is named as a suspect in the charge sheet, and therefore, the "sword" of impending arrest is left hanging over his head, it said.Goswami's counsel Ashok Mundargi had argued that the criminal law in the country did not provide for the police to name someone merely as a suspect and not name him or her as an accused in the charge sheet.He had said the probe by the police against Goswami and other employees of ARG Outlier Media, which runs all Republic TV channels, was malafide.In the charge sheet, the police had named Goswami and all owners, managers, and all persons associated with Republic TV or ARG media under the category of "suspects", Mundargi had said.Without naming specific employees (in the charge sheet) but saying that anyone associated with Republic TV or ARG media is a suspect gave very wide scope to the police to continue to "harass" the petitioners, even when there was no evidence against them.Mundargi said the police had reopened a 2018 (Anvay Naik) suicide case in which Goswami had been named as an accused and arrested him last year.Goswami was released on bail by the Supreme Court, Mundargi said.The high court took note of this submission while granting relief to Goswami."This interim order is granted in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, keeping in view the serious malafide alleged by the Petitioners (Goswami and ARG media) against respondents (state government and the Mumbai police) and also keeping in view earlier actions taken by Respondent- State and its officials against the Petitioner No.2 (Goswami)."If during the course of the investigation, you come across something and you want to take coercive action against petitioner number 2, then you will give 72 hours prior notice (to Goswami)," the bench said.The HC, however, said Mundargi's request for a stay on the investigation could not be granted as there was "no clarity on who was the accused and who was not".Citing the material on record, the HC felt that the police did not have anything substantial against Goswami in the case.The HC also accepted the Maharashtra government's statement that the probe against Republic TV and other employees of ARG Outlier Media will be completed within 12 weeks.The court was hearing a bunch of pleas filed by Goswami and ARG media challenging the probe and seeking several reliefs in the TRP scam case.On Wednesday, the HC admitted the pleas and issued notices to the state and the Mumbai Police.The bench said it will consider in the hearings, if the prayers made in the plea for quashing of the FIR, and a transfer of probe to the CBI could be entertained given that the petitioners were only suspects and not accused, "and if the police could continue investigating the case without naming Goswami and the others as accused".The HC will hear the matter on June 28.

The legislation seeks to provide regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied and healthcare professionals.The majority of members, including Opposition parties, praised the government and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan for bringing the legislation “recognising the contribution of allied healthcare professional, giving them dignity and establishing the respect long due to them”.    “Whenever Covid pandemic is mentioned, doctors and nurses are recognised as frontline warriors. However, the allied and healthcare workers have played a major role in its management.,” the Health Minister said.Underlying the role played by paramedics and allied health care workers, such as lab technicians, radiographers, dieticians, during the coronavirus pandemic, the minister said they were as much part of people’s recovery as doctors.“The legislation will fill the unfilled block in the health puzzle,” he said.“In Corona period, we remembered doctors, nurses, frontline workers, security staff etc. But there were so many CT scan technician, etc who served during the Covid crisis. There are lakhs of such workers whom we have served,” he said.“It is a matter of great joy and happiness for the lakhs of health care worker and professionals across the country. Standardisation will improve the distribution of such healthcare workers. This bill makes a paradigm shift is making it more patient-centric,” he said.Though the bill their standards will be maintained, increasing their professional scope, he said.“Paramedics and allied healthcare workers are a critical part of the medical profession and their contribution is similar to doctors, if not more,” Vardhan said, initiating the debate.Vardhan said that the tenure of the Chairman will be two years, but they will be eligible for nomination, It is a new system that is why the tenure has been kept as two years. Several members echoed Vardhan’s sentiments that the proposed legislation will bring a paradigm shift in health professionals’ situation.The Bill provides for regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied and healthcare professionals, assessment of institutions, maintenance of a central and a state register and creation of a system to improve research and development and adoption of the latest scientific advances.The advancement in the health sector, changing preferences of consumers and service providers, had warranted the creation of a fresh vision of healthcare delivery with a patient-centric approach and focus on moving to multi-disciplinary team-based care, according to the Bill’ statementThe allied and healthcare professions include a wide range of workers for diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of acute and chronic diseases. These professions also work to optimise patient outcomes and attend to the overall prevention, promotion, wellness, and management of diseases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-clears-national-commission-for-allied-and-healthcare-professionals-bill-2021-229859

However, it does not provide for determination of tariff for a group of airports.Developing more number of airports through public-private partnership mode would expand air connectivity to relatively remote and far-flung areas.Therefore, the government has decided to club or pair airports having profitable and non-profitable airports which could be offered in public-private partnership mode as a package to the prospective bidders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airports-economic-regulatory-authority-of-india-amendment-bill-%C2%A0-2021-introduced-in-lok-sabha-229858

Use of official machineries by these VIPs is making a mockery of the principle of creating a level-playing field for contestants, TMC alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-objects-to-deployment-of-up-cops-in-west-bengal-on-poll-duty-229855

They are an integral part of our state."We consider only those pan masala-chewing, tilak- sporting people sent from states like Uttar Pradesh to foment trouble in West Bengal before elections as outsider goons. We will continue to call them as such," the TMC chief said.Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in the state to campaign for BJP candidates, Banerjee said, "I have great respect for the PM's chair, but I am sorry to say that Modi is a big liar.""What happened to Modi's promise of crediting Rs 15 lakh to everyone's bank accounts? Why should an LPG cylinder cost Rs 900? Why is kerosene scare? What is the fate of the Ujjwala scheme?"Why are Modi and (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah silent even as farmers are agitating out in the open for months? Why are iron nails being laid out at the farmers' protest site? Is Modi concerned only about a large industrial group and not agriculturists?" the feisty leader said.Claiming that the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme has been a non-starter, Banerjee said, "I deliver what I promise but Modi fails to keep his promises." She cited the implementation of state government projects like Kanyashree, Sabuj Sathi and Swasthya Sathi to back her claims.Flaying the BJP for promising to constitute the seventh pay commission for state government employees if voted to power in West Bengal, the chief minister said, "First answer why the PSUs are being closed down and at whose behest?You are rendering lakhs of people unemployed. People don't trust you." —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-those-sent-from-other-states-to-foment-trouble-in-bengal-before-polls-are-outsiders-for-tmc-mamata-229851

24-03-2021||Kanthi (WB)||No Indian is outsider in Bengal; BJP CM will be son of soil: Modi||Bengal has brought together the nation through 'Vande Mataram', and on this land, CM Mamata Banerjee was terming people "bohiragoto", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday, announcing that if voted to power, a son of the soil would be made the BJP chief minister of the state.Addressing an election rally in Kanthi in Purba Medinipur district, Modi said Bengal is the land of icons like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose and on this land no Indian is an outsider."Bengal brought together the people of India through Vande Mataram, and on that land Mamata-didi is talking about 'bohiragoto' (outsider). No Indian is an outsider here, they are children of Bharat Mata," he said."We are being called 'tourists', fun is being made of us, we are being insulted. Didi, people of Rabindranath's Bengal don't consider anybody outsider," Modi added.When the BJP forms government in Bengal, the chief minister would be a son of the soil, he said at the rally amid loud cheers from his supporters.Modi's comments came amid an "insider vs outsider" debate with Banerjee asserting regularly that she wouldn’t allow Bengal to be ruled by "outsiders" from Delhi or Gujarat, in a reference to the BJP and the prime minister.The Trinamool Congress has even launched the 'Bangla Nijer Meyeke Chaye' (Bengal wants its own daughter) campaign, with party leaders calling BJP functionaries visiting the state as "election tourists".The prime minister said Banerjee insulted the people of Nandigram with false accusations, and people would give her a befitting reply."You are maligning Nandigram and its people before the entire country. This is the same Nandigram that gave you so much. The people of Nandigram will not forgive you and will give you a befitting reply," he said, apparently referring to the March 10 incident in which the chief minister was injured.The prime minister said Banerjee was talking about 'Duare Sarkar' (government at doorstep), while she would be shown the door on May 2.

The other day I didn’t allow MPs to flag a Maharashtra related issue. You can’t raise issues on your convenience. There has to be a policy.”Earlier Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to say “those stripping democracy have no right to call themselves a government.”He said the opposition will continue to speak up for the people and was not afraid of anyone."It is evident from the brazen events in Bihar Assembly that the CM is under the control of the BJP and RSS. Those stripping democracy have no right to call themselves a government," Gandhi said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also posted a video appealing to people to “raise their voice against the murder of democracy lest the state legislature ceases to survive.”Surjewala called the alleged police assault on unprecedented and said “The MLAs were raising their voice against the passage of the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill in the state assembly, that will empower the police to put anyone behind bars. Democracy had been murdered and if the people do not raise their voice now, there will be no democracy left in the country," he said.Surjewala said hooliganism had become the norm in the JDU and BJP government in Bihar."For how long can this go on?

24-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhiites can soon place order for 'full bottle' of liquor in clubs, bars||Delhiites will soon have an option to place order for a full bottle of liquor on their tables in hotels and clubs as a Group of Ministers headed by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has recommended several steps that are part of excise reforms.Currently, people having drinks at these establishments are served liquor as pegs in the national capital.In its report, the GoM, however, said it will be the sole responsibility of bars to ensure that no customer takes the served bottles out of their premises.There are over 1,000 hotels, clubs and restaurants in the city, which have an excise license to serve liquor to their customers.“The GoM is of the view that service of full bottle on table may be allowed by the licensees to ensure service of quality liquor to the customers. This, however, shall be the subject to the sole responsibility of the licensee to ensure that no customer takes the served bottles out of the license premises,” it stated.The GoM said these establishments may be allowed to have additional dispensing counters against payment of five per cent of the applicable license fee per additional counter.It also said that the liquor service in open spaces like terrace, balcony, lower area of restaurant, clubs and hotels may be allowed.“Timings of bars in restaurants and clubs may be increased to be at par with neighbouring cities like Noida,” it said.“Hotel, clubs and restaurants will have to place purchase order only from retail vends instead of wholesalers,” the GoM said.All establishments will be permitted two counters without any additional charge, it added.During a press conference on Monday, Sisodia, who also holds the excise portfolio, said the Delhi Cabinet has accepted the recommendations made by the GoM.In the report, the GoM said the conditions related to playing of Music/DJ under “conduct of business”, as mentioned in rule 53 (4) of Excise Rules is archaic and not reflecting present day needs.“Licensees will be permitted to play all types of music, including DJ, Live Bands and Karaoke without creating nuisance in the neighbourhood,” it said.The GoM also recommended that draught beer will be allowed to be taken away in bottles or ‘growlers’ as applicable in other states like Punjab and Karnataka.It said the move will help fuel the micro-brewery industry and added that draught beer can also be allowed to be served at events like wedding functions and parties which have sought license to serve liquor to their guests.However, wherever draught beer is being served as a take away, clear signage and information will be need to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly, the report stated.Micro-Brewery will be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants having excise license.As part of excise reforms, the GoM also said that banquet halls, party places, farm houses, motels and others will be offered one-time annual fee, a move which will ensure that organisers of functions do not have to separately apply for a license (P-10) to serve liquor to their guests.It said no separate P-10 license will be required at any event being conducted at these venues once the yearly license is acquired.For an in-house party or a function in any community centre, the P-10 fee will be applicable at Rs 10,000 irrespective of the number of guests, it also said.“To serve liquor in banquet halls, party places, farm houses, wedding/party/event venues the one time P-10E licence fee will be Rs 50,000 per event, if the said venue does not hold regular licence,” the GoM said in its report.Lowering legal drinking age to 21 from 25 years and the government withdrawing from running liquor vends in Delhi are also among other features of an excise policy approved by the AAP dispensation on Monday, with Sisodia saying the measure is expected to lead to an annual revenue growth of 20 per cent.The government decided to shut all its shops in the national capital as they were generating less income in comparison to private liquor stores.

The police force confirmed that it had “received a report of an alleged hate incident”.The comments under scrutiny, posted with an image of Samant's family on Instagram by Dr Abhijit Sarkar, made references to their Hindu faith and also categorised their home state of Karnataka as a "bastion of Islamophobic forces". "An investigation into these online comments is ongoing and we must allow time for this formal process to be followed. In cases such as these, student support is provided through their college and department,” an Oxford University spokesperson said."The university is fully committed to creating an environment where people of all backgrounds, including our Hindu students and staff, can feel welcome, valued and respected," the university said, adding that it has strong policies in place to protect staff and students against “all forms of harassment, including online harassment”. Samant has been working on completing her MSc course in Energy Systems at the university remotely from her hometown in Udupi, after she flew back to India in the wake of her resignation.

Japan, which recently lost a container terminal deal in Sri Lanka, abstained from the vote.The resolution against Sri Lanka is for war crimes against Tamils and is among the series of such resolutions the UNHRC has been bringing for a decade. India abstained from voting in 2014 and had voted in favour of a similar resolution in 2012.The preset draft resolution is based on a report submitted by the Office of the High Commissioner for human rights in January. The report warned that Sri Lanka is "on an alarming path towards recurrence of grave human rights violations" and that "failure to deal with the past continues to have devastating effects on tens of thousands of family members from all communities who persist in seeking justice, reparations and the truth about the fate of their loved ones".The resolution was tabled by the UNHRC’s Core Group, which includes the UK, Germany and Canada and wants sanctions to be imposed on Sri Lanka besides listing certain action points for its government.Ten days before the vote, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had called up PM Narendra Modi, who had reiterated the importance of Sri Lanka to India’s Neighbourhood First policy.Tamil parties had called on PM Modi to vote in favour of the resolution but that would have jeopardised the prospects of India building major infrastructure projects as well as provided a breach to China to step in.Twin pressure from Tamil allies, Colombo||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-abstains-from-unhrc-vote-on-sri-lanka-resolution-229681

He has sought directions to the Maharashtra Government, Centre and the CBI to immediately take into custody the CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence.The BJP, meanwhile, escalated pressure on the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, challenging Deshmukh’s statement on his movements during the period he was accused of meeting suspended police officer Sachin Waze to discuss the alleged Rs 100 crore extortion plan.Former CM Devendra Fadnavis, who claimed to have in his possession police reports to establish Deshmukh’s movements between February 17 and 24, called his quarantine claim a “big lie”.He released copies of communication “showing the severity of allegations in the transfers/postings racket”.Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also produced a flight manifest to say that Deshmukh flew from Nagpur to Mumbai during the period he said he was in isolation.“By backing Deshmukh, a senior leader like Sharad Pawar has lost his political credibility. The only way he can reclaim it is by ensuring the minister’s exit,” Prasad said.He accused the Uddhav Thackeray government of “stalling” the probe into Mansukh Hiren’s death and not handing over it to the NIA.Fadnavis, who claimed that Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray was aware of the ongoing corruption/extortion racket in the police department, also accused the state government of acting against IPS Rashmi Shukla for unearthing the transfer racket.Fadnavis claimed she was given a posting which did not even exist rather than being given a promotion following her investigations into the corrupt practices in the department. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-mumbai-ex-top-cops-cbi-probe-plea-today-229611

The amount already charged should be refunded or adjusted, it added. “It is directed that there shall not be any charge of interest on interest/compound interest/ penal interest for the period during the moratorium and any amount already recovered under the same head, namely, interest on interest/penal interest/compound interest shall be refunded to the borrowers concerned and to be given credit/adjusted in the next instalment of the loan account,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.Also read:Word of cautionJudges should “very warily” encroach upon the field of economic and fiscal regulatory measures as they are not experts in these matters, the Supreme Court said.The government had earlier allowed this benefit in case of loans up to Rs 2 crore only. But the Bench said there’s no rationale to restrict such a relief on the basis of loan amount.The court, however, refused to extend the loan moratorium beyond August 31, 2020, saying it’s a policy decision. Courts cannot do judicial review of the government’s financial policy decisions unless it’s mala fide and arbitrary.It also allowed banks to declare the accounts of borrowers not paying EMIs on their loans as NPA.The Bench said this in its verdict on a batch of pleas filed by various trade associations seeking extension of the loan moratorium period and other reliefs in view of the pandemic.The order would be applicable to all banks, non-banking financial institutions, housing finance companies and other financial institutions compulsorily and mandatorily, it said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-compound-penal-interest-for-moratorium-period-sc-229626

Aroop Biswas, sitting MLA, was once again named in the TMC list as party candidate from Tollygunge, but he deliberately kept a low profile so that there was no confusion in case “Didi” decided to contest from the seat.Meanwhile, the BJP today released its final list of 13 candidates for the WB polls. The list comprises prominent faces, but veteran actor Mithun Chakarborty, who joined the BJP earlier this month, finds no mention.The BJP sprang up a surprise by naming Lt Gen Subrata Saha (retd), a member of the National Security Advisory Board and former commander of the Kashmir Corps, as its candidate from Rashbehari.Ashok Lahiri, economic adviser to then Vajpayee as well as Manmohan Singh governments, got ticket from Balurghat. He was earlier allotted Alipurduar, but his candidature was changed to Balurghat owing to some technical reason. While Supriyo Thakur, younger brother of sitting BJP MP Shantanu Thakur, will contest from Gaighata, Debabrata Mazhi will fight from Chowrangee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-shuns-safe-seat-to-take-on-adhikari-229648

24-03-2021||New Delhi||States can impose local restrictions to check Covid spread: Home Ministry||The Centre on Tuesday issued a fresh set of COVID-19 guidelines for the month of April asking the states to strictly enforce Test-Track-Treat (T3) protocol, other containment measures and step up the speed of ongoing vaccination drives in the country.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its order said the Government of India has launched the world’s largest vaccination drive against COVID-19, which is going on smoothly, but the pace is uneven across different states and Union Territories (UTs).“The slow pace of vaccination in some states/UTs is a matter of concern. Vaccination against COVID-19, in the present scenario, is critical to break the chain of transmission. Therefore, all state/UT governments should rapidly step up the pace of vaccination, to cover all priority groups in an expeditious manner,” the MHA said.Talking about the main focus of the guidelines, the MHA in its order said states and UTs collectively need “to consolidate the substantial gains achieved in containing the spread of COVID-19”, which was visible in the sustained decline in the number of active cases, continuously for about five months. It, however, said, “Keeping in view a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases, which is being witnessed in some parts of the country, the guidelines mandate the state/UT governments to strictly enforce the Test-Track-Treat (T3) protocol in all parts of the country and ensure observance of COVID appropriate behaviour by everyone.”The MHA has also asked that in states and UTs, where the proportion of RT-PCR tests is less, they should rapidly increase it to reach the prescribed level of 70 per cent or more.“The new positive cases, detected as a result of intensive testing, need to be isolated at the earliest and provided timely treatment. Even their contacts have to be traced at the earliest and similarly isolated,” it said.Asking for listing of containment zones, the MHA said they should be notified on the websites by the respective District Collectors and by the states/UTs. This list will also be shared with MoHFW on a regular basis, it added.Asking for fixing accountability at the local level, the MHA in the guidelines said district, police and municipal authorities “shall be responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed”.“For strict enforcement of wearing face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing, states and UTs may consider administrative actions, including imposition of appropriate fines,” the MHA said. The guidelines have allowed restrictions only at the local level, based on the assessment of the authorities at district/sub-district and city/ward level, with a view to contain the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-can-impose-local-restrictions-to-check-covid-spread-home-ministry-229395

It was essential to vaccinate more and more people to break the chain of transmission, he added.Captain Amarinder also urged the people to strictly adhere to all Covid safety protocols, including wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. The state government, which has already announced fresh restrictions, would be forced to impose more curbs if the people do not follow the Covid appropriate behaviour, he warned.The appeal from the Chief Minister came after the state’s Covid expert committee head, Dr KK Talwar, apprised him of the developments on the new variant in the state, which has been witnessing a surge in the number of COVID-19 positive cases during the last few weeks. The state health department had sent 478 COVID positive samples to NIB, IGIB, and NCDC for genome sequencing, of which results of 90 samples were received and those showed only two samples for N440K variant. Subsequently, a team from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, visited the state to review the increase in positivity. The team was informed about the pending results of genome sequencing.  Thereafter, 401 more samples, collected between 1.1.2021 to 10.3.2021, were sent to NCDC for genome sequencing. The result of these samples was worrying as it showed presence of B.1.1.7 variant in 326 COVID samples, said Dr KK Talwar.The Chief Minister said he had been informed by Dr Talwar that though this UK variant B.1.1.7 is more infectious yet not more virulent.  Further, the Oxford (Covishield) vaccine is equally effective against this new UK variant. It is noteworthy that the B.1.1.7 variant is now spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, representing 98 per cent of the new cases in UK and 90 per cent in Spain. UK authorities have suggested it is up to 70 per cent more transmissible than the original virus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-81-per-cent-of-punjab-samples-show-uk-variant-capt-urges-pm-to-widen-vaccination-ambit-to-cover-younger-population-229350

He said he demanded a CBI inquiry and has been assured "appropriate" action into the matter.“I have given all information and evidences of Maharashtra Police transfer racket, in a sealed envelope to Union Home Secretary in New Delhi and demanded a CBI probe. They have assured appropriate decisions after going through it,” he said in Delhi."Deshmukh should have put in his papers the moment allegations were made. Now there are also these reports about IPS officer Rashmi Shukla and how she was shunted out on a posting which did not even exist rather than being given a promotion after her investigations on corrupt practices in the department," he said earlier.Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said defending Deshmukh has made a serious dent in political credibility of senior NCP leader Sharad Pawar"The only way he can restore his political credibility is by making Deshmukh resign," Prasad said addressing a press conference here.He called the Maha Aghadi government of Maharashtra a "maha vasooli" government.On Monday, the former Mumbai CP said Deshmukh’s baseless utterances about his transfer was to camouflage the minister’s own “misdeeds and malign” him.Singh also gave the example of "victimisation" of another top police officer, Rashmi Shukla, "who had intercepted telephone conversations about Deshmukh’s alleged corrupt practices""Shukla, the commissioner intelligence, state intelligence department, had brought to the notice of the director-general of police, who in turn brought it to the knowledge of the additional chief secretary, home department, about corrupt malpractices in postings/transfers by Deshmukh based on a telephonic interception. She was shunted out rather than taking any firm action against Deshmukh, " he had said.Allegations by Devendra Fadnavis:1.Parambir Singh wrote a letter to CM with allegations of Rs100 crores per month collection.2. Yesterday Sharad Pawar tweeted that HM was in Nagpur during his home quarantine period.3. I have 2 police manifest documents which show HM Anil Deshmukh’s movements on 17th February and 24th February 2021 in Mumbai.4.

An intelligence report dated 25th August 2020 was submitted to the DGP and in turn the DGP very next day forwarded to ACS home for appropriate further actions.7. I have 6.3 GB of data and all these transcripts which were given to the CM.8.But this MVA Govt did not take any action on these severe & sensitive allegations.9. It Instead transferred the intelligence Commissioner.All officials mentioned in these transcripts got the same postings.10. CM Uddhav Thackeray did not take any action.

24-03-2021||New Delhi||India justifies designs of Pakal Dul, Lower Kalnai hydro projects in J-K as Pakistan objects||Pakistan raised objections to the designs of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydropower plants in Jammu and Kashmir and sought more information on the projects in Ladakh sanctioned after the abrogation of Article 370 as the Indus Commissioners of the two countries met here on Tuesday, sources said.On its part, India justified its stand on the designs.The Pakal Dul Hydro Electric Project (1,000 MW) is proposed on the Marusudar river, a tributary of the Chenab river, in Kishtwar district in Jammu and Kashmir. The Lower Kalnai project is proposed in Kishtwar and Doda districts.The two sides also discussed a host of other issues under the Indus Waters Treaty during the annual Permanent Indus Commission meeting.The two-day meeting which started on Tuesday is taking place after a gap of over two years. The last meeting took place in Lahore in August 2018.The Indian delegation was led by PK Saxena, India’s Indus Commissioner, and his team from the Central Water Commission, the Central Electricity Authority and the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation.The Pakistani delegation was led by its Indus Commissioner Syed Muhammad Meher Ali Shah. The delegation arrived here on Monday evening.This year’s meeting is the first between the two commissioners after the August 2019 nullification of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution that gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.The meeting also assumes significance as this is the first important engagement between India and Pakistan after militaries of the two countries had announced last month that they would strictly observe a ceasefire along the Line of Control and other sectors.In 2019, the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was also bifurcated into union territories—Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.India has since cleared several hydropower projects for the region.Of these, Durbuk Shyok (19 MW), Shankoo (18.5 MW), Nimu Chilling (24 MW), Rongdo (12 MW), Ratan Nag (10.5 MW) are in Leh; and Mangdum Sangra (19 MW), Kargil Hunderman (25 MW) and Tamasha (12 MW) are Kargil. Both Leh and Kargil fall in Ladakh.Pakistan has sought information on these projects, sources added.The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) warrants the two commissioners to meet at least once a year, alternately in India and Pakistan.However, last year’s meeting scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March was cancelled, a first since the treaty came into being, in view of the coronavirus pandemic.In July 2020, India had proposed to Pakistan that the meeting for discussing pending issues pertaining to Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) be held virtually in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but Pakistan insisted on holding talks at the Attari border checkpost. However, in response, India said it is not conducive to hold the meeting at the Attari Joint Check Post due to the pandemic. With the improvement in situation, this mandatory meeting is being held following all COVID-19-related protocols.         Under the provisions of Indus Waters Treaty, signed between India and Pakistan in 1960, all the water of the eastern rivers—Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi—amounting to around 33 million acre feet (MAF) annually is allocated to India for unrestricted use. The waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab—amounting to around 135 MAF annually has been assigned largely to Pakistan.          According to the treaty, India has been given the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river projects on the western rivers subject to specific criteria for design and operation.
