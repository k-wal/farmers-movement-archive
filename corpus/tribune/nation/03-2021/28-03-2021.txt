He, however, refused to elaborate further.A senior police officer of the district told PTI, “A week ago, it came to light that around 1,450 cartons of illicit liquor seized are missing from Kotwali Dehat police station.”When asked whether some cartons have been damaged by rats, the police officer said, “The general diary of the police does mention that 239 cartons were damaged by rodents. However, this is not acceptable, and it seems that the matter is fishy. It has been probably done to cover the goof-up.”   A case has been registered against SHO Indreshpal Singh and clerk Rishal Singh. Both of them had not turned up to provide an explanation for the incident despite summons issued in their names, he said.Meanwhile, Vikas Kumar, a police officer from Aligarh who is probing the case, said, “Efforts are on to ascertain as to where the seized liquor has gone.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cops-blame-rats-for-disappearance-of-seized-illicit-liquor-from-up-police-station-231739
28-03-2021||New Delhi||SC sends man to 3-month jail for not paying Rs 2.60 cr maintenance arrears to estranged wife||The Supreme Court has sentenced a man to three months’ imprisonment for contempt of court after he did not pay an outstanding of Rs 2.60 crore along with Rs 1.75 lakh monthly maintenance to his estranged wife.The top court said the husband has already been given a long rope and he has not utilised the chances given to him to pay the maintenance to his estranged wife.A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said in a recent order, “We have already given (the respondent) a long rope. The respondent (husband) has not utilised the chances so given. Therefore, we punish the contemnor/respondent for committing contempt of this court and sentence him to imprisonment for a period of three months in civil prison.”The top court noted that the husband has not complied with its order of February 19, giving him a last opportunity to pay the entire outstanding maintenance amount along with the monthly sum fixed earlier by the court.On February 19, the top court had said a husband cannot abdicate the responsibility of paying maintenance to his estranged wife and gave a last opportunity to the husband, failing which he would be imprisoned.The man, who claimed to have been working on a project of national security in the telecom sector, had said that he had no money and sought two years’ time to pay the entire amount.The top court had said that the man has lost credibility by failing repeatedly to follow the court’s order and wondered how a person with this kind of case was associated with a project of national security.It had told the man, a Tamil Nadu resident, that “husband cannot abdicate from his responsibility to provide maintenance to his wife and it is his duty to provide the maintenance”.It had noted that the man has been directed by the trial court and the decision upheld by the top court and the high court to pay money to his wife under two heads which include monthly maintenance of Rs 1.75 lakh and the other is the past arrears of maintenance from 2009 which amounts to approximately Rs 2.60 crore. The top court had said to his counsel that the husband has not complied with even a single order of courts and if he does not make the payments within two-three weeks, he will be sent to jail.The wife had filed a case under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act before the metropolitan magistrate court in Chennai in 2009.The court had allowed the wife to share the house until the husband made alternative arrangements for her permanent residence. It had directed the husband to pay Rs 2 crore as maintenance to the wife; Rs 50 lakh compensation for deserting her for 12 years; Rs 50 lakh for living in extra marital life; Rs 50 lakh for leaving his wife to face the court cases; Rs 50 lakh for forcing her to take a job in a media company; Rs 50 lakh for mental torture and agony by openly living with foreign women, and Rs 50 lakh for not paying rent to the shared household.On the appeal filed by the husband against the order, the sessions court directed him to pay Rs 1 lakh per month towards maintenance from the date of filing the petition which is January 6, 2009 and Rs 75,000 per month for residential accommodation from the said date.The high court upheld the order of the sessions court on December 2, 2016, after which the husband filed the appeal in the top court, which was dismissed by the top court on October 26, 2017 with a direction that within six months he would pay the maintenance and arrears.Thereafter a review petition was filed in 2018 by the wife and the husband was directed to clear the arrears of maintenance Rs 1.75 lakh by the 10th day of every month.

I prefer a personal interaction but if we have to do it over Zoom then we will do it,” said Singh.“We will also be announcing two reserves per event. If the selected shooter is infected then the one named Reserve 1 will be sent. If both get infected then we will send Reserve 2,” he added.Singh—who is also the vice president of ISSF—sport’s governing body further said that the body has plans to put the Olympic-bound team in a secure bio-bubble before the Olympics.“We are looking for an advisory from the Health Ministry regarding when the peak of this Covid-19 is expected. My first priority now is to think about their exposure or competitions. We have experienced and highly exposed athletes, but you can be anyone, the best in the world, you will be rusty if you do not have international exposure. We are ready, we need to get the rustiness out,” said Singh, explaining the plans leading up to the Tokyo Games.“But at the same time, it is equally important to make sure that our athletes are protected from Covid-19. It is a difficult thing to keep people away from the families, and it can be counter-productive. We are looking at the peak period, and we are planning to keep them in the bio-bubble till the Olympics with only one intention to minimise the possibility of them getting ill,” he added.Two golds on the final dayMeanwhile, the hosts won two gold medals on the final day of the World Cup, to take the overall tally to 30 medals, including 15 gold, 9 silver and 7 bronze medals.The day’s first gold medal was won on the trap ranges, where the Indian team of Shreyasi Singh, Manisha Keer and Rajeshwari Kumari, beat Kazakhstan in the final by a margin of 6-0 in the final of trap team women.The win was followed by another top performance by the men’s team of Kynan Chenai, Prithviraj Tondaiman and Lakshay Sheoran as they beat Slovakians 6-4 in a closely contested final.However, there was disappointment in the 25-Metre Rapid Fire Pistol men’s team competition, where the Indian trio of Gurpreet Singh, Vijayveer Sidhu and Adarsh Singh went down to the USA 2-10 in the final.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nrais-anti-corona-plan-two-reserves-in-each-discipline-team-in-bio-bubble-before-olympics-231732
28-03-2021||New Delhi||Can consensual sex between consenting teenagers be punishable under POCSO Act?||Can adolescents having consensual sex be punished under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 for rape?The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu Government on a petition, challenging the March 16 order of the Madras High Court, refusing to allow an application filed by a teenager accused of seeking to compound the offence of rape. The high court held that offences under the POCSO Act were non-compoundable.The High Court had also dismissed the rape complainant’s plea for permission to depose before the trial court to bring it on record that her sexual relations with the accused were consensual in nature.A Bench headed by Justice Indira Banerjee on Friday issued the notice after the petitioner’s counsel submitted that the top court needed to consider if adolescents in a live-in relationship or those having consensual sex should be punished under the POCSO Act. It also gave interim protection from arrest to the petitioner accused.The trial court had in 2019 refused to take the complainant evidence on record, saying she had not filed the petition through the public prosecutor. It held the petitioner guilty under the POCSO Act and sentenced him to 10-year imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. It also asked him to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to the victim.Now, he contended before the top court that the objective of the POCSO Act was not to punish teenagers engaging in consensual sex.The accused and the complainant fell in love while studying in school and the accused allegedly established a sexual relationship with her on the pretext of marriage. The girl filed a rape complaint in 2015 after he allegedly refused to marry her, saying his parents wanted him to marry another girl. Besides rape and cheating, he was also accused of causing miscarriage and repeatedly committing penetrative sexual assault aggravated penetrative sexual assault under POCSO Act as the victim was a 17-year-old minor. During the trial, the complainant said she was not forced to engage in sexual relations with the accused and her statements were made at the behest of the states. She said she wanted to live with the petitioner with whom she had been in a live-in relationship.This High Court suspended the sentence in June 2019. In February this year, the complainant came out in support of the petitioner and contended she had been in a live-in relationship with him for four years and that their sexual relations were consensual and that they intended to get married. But the high court turned it down on March 16.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/can-consensual-sex-between-consenting-teenagers-be-punishable-under-pocso-act-231727

Up to 2 of the allocation to States/ UTs can be utilised for water quality monitoring and surveillance activities, which includes setting up, and upgrading existing water quality laboratories.In habitations that are adversely affected by Arsenic/ Fluoride contamination, States are advised to plan and install Community Water Purification Plant (CWPP) on priority, as an interim measure to provide 8-10 lpcd (litres per capita per day) potable water for cooking and drinking purposes.To involve and empower the community at the grass-roots level for monitoring the quality of water in their respective habitations, Field Testing Kits (FTKs) are being distributed, and 5 women from every village are being trained for using these kits.So far, 4.7 Lakh women in 1.25 Lakh villages have been trained for water testing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/7-19-crore-tap-water-connections-provided-to-rural-households-kataria-231720
28-03-2021||New Delhi||BJP will sweep Assam, West Bengal: Amit Shah after polling for 1st phase concludes||Exuding confidence in winning both West Bengal and Assam elections, Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday thanked the people of the two states on the behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president JP Nadda for coming out to vote in large numbers.The former BJP president said the voter turnout in the first phase has given “shubh sanket” (good indications) that the “BJP is winning the elections with huge numbers”.Shah added that the fact that no incidence of violence or any other untoward incident reported on the day of polling was another “shubh sanket” that the BJP was “sweeping” the two states.“Both states have a history of poll violence. No person lost his or her life during the voting, this is a ‘shubh sanket’ for the BJP,” Shah said addressing media persons in Delhi.Shah claimed that the BJP was winning “26 out of the 30” seats that polled in Bengal and “37 out of 47” constituencies that voted in Assam yesterday.“We are increasing seats by a large number in Bengal. In Assam, BJP is winning 37 out of 47 seats. Our grassroots workers and election machinery have indicated these figures. The two states have voted for development and the mandate is the verdict in favour of the BJP,” he added.“In Assam Sarbananda Sonowal (CM) and Himanta Biswa Sarma have succeeded in winning the confidence of people. People have understood the meaning of double-engine government and seen its proof in form of bridges on the Brahmaputra, vast network of roads and other development works,” Shah said.Slamming TMC supremo and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, he said people had hoped that she would bring a change in the state. “But only the name of the party ruling Bengal changed, rest everything remained the same. Bengal can be ‘sujalam suphalam’, there can be development, there will be change under Narendra Modi, people of Bengal have realised,” he said, also thanking the Election Commission for peaceful polling.“This has happened for the first time. The peaceful polling is a positive indication that the BJP will win more than 200 seats in Bengal and form the government. In Assam also we will come back with more seats than last time,” he added.“The momentum of Phase -I will be maintained. I have been saying from the beginning that the BJP is winning 200 seats, from feed-back from the grassroots. The TMC has already lost its ground,” he said, in response to queries regarding the reason and source of his confidence.Regarding Nandigram, he called it “another seat for BJP”.At the same time, however, he also appealed to people of Nandigram— where CM Mamata Banerjee is contesting—to “initiate the change".Shah denied that the Prime Minister’s Bangladesh visit had anything to do with the Bengal elections.“Did the PM say anything on corruption (in Bengal)? The trip was meant to revive relationship between the two countries,”, he said. Shah also denied allegations that his party had anything to do with the Election Commission changing some processes.“It was not a secret we had given it in writing to the EC,” he said. The ruling Trinamool Congress in Bengal has accused the BJP of trying to change the process of polling agents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-will-sweep-assam-west-bengal-amit-shah-after-polling-for-1st-phase-concludes-231712
28-03-2021||New Delhi||BJP’s scare-mongering over ‘love Jihad’ will never go far in pluralist Kerala: Tharoor||The BJP can only offer communalism, tired scare-mongering over “love Jihad” and a hate-filled politics of division that will never go far in pluralist Kerala, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Sunday and asserted that the BJP’s high-profile recruit 88-year-old E Sreedharan cannot be the answer to the state’s political future.He also dismissed suggestions that not having a chief ministerial face could dent the Congress-led United Democratic Front’s (UDF) chances in the Kerala Assembly polls and said the party is “richly endowed” with experienced and capable leaders, any of whom could assume the mantle of chief ministership.In an interview with PTI, Tharoor said the trend in Kerala is clearly in favour of the UDF and he expects a “strong victory” when the results are announced on May 2.On whether the BJP would be a factor in the polls and the impact of ‘Metroman’ E Sreedharan being projected as the key person by the saffron party, the former Union minister said the BJP “can only offer communalism, tired scare-mongering over ‘love Jihad’ and a hate-filled politics of bigotry and division that will never go far in pluralist, inclusive Kerala”.“They (the BJP) have hit their ceiling in the state. Mr Sreedharan’s impact peaked with the announcement of his candidacy. An 88-year-old technocrat cannot be the answer to the state’s political future,” Tharoor said.On the BJP accusing the Congress of double standards in aligning with the Left in West Bengal and fighting against it in Kerala, the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said in a vast country like India, each state has its distinctive political characteristics.The competition between the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the UDF is deeply entrenched here, but on national issues, especially those related to secularism and opposition to the “anti-people policies” of the BJP, they share many common views and often make common cause, he said.“Since 2014, CPM MPs who campaigned against me in Kerala have supported my stand on many issues in the Lok Sabha. As for Bengal, you will have to ask the local party leaders there,” Tharoor said.But the BJP’s allegation is not surprising because they have never understood or appreciated the diversity of India, he added.Asked about Home Minister Amit Shah questioning Congress’ secular credentials over its alliance with the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in Kerala, the Indian Secular Front in West Bengal and the All India United Democratic Front in Assam, Tharoor reiterated that each state and each state party has its own history, traditions and political appeal.There is little in common among the three parties mentioned other than that they are seen as essentially Muslim parties, he pointed out.“For the BJP, which has built its entire narrative and constructed its rise on communalism, to accuse Congress of that sin is preposterous. It is like the proverbial pot calling the kettle black, except that in this case the kettle is white,” Tharoor said.“Speaking of Kerala, we understand the difference between, on the one hand, community organisations like the NSS (Nair Service Society) or SNDP (Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam) and community-rooted parties like the IUML, and on the other, communal parties like the BJP or the SDPI (Social Democratic Party of India) that have no vision beyond the narrow religious community they seek to serve,” he alleged.Asked whether not having a chief ministerial face could dent the Congress-led UDF’s chances in the polls, Tharoor answered in the negative and pointed out that even opinion polls have not suggested that this is a major factor.“The fact is that when the Congress does not have an incumbent CM, it tends not to project one. I cannot think of an exception in recent memory,” he said.But the party is “richly endowed” with experienced and capable leaders, any of whom could assume the mantle, Tharoor asserted.Talking about the defining issues of the Kerala polls, he said there are both negative as well as positive issues.“The negatives relate to the failures, corruption and violence of the ruling Left in Kerala; the positives rely on the strong forward-looking vision of the Congress-led UDF, reflected in a ‘people’s manifesto’ that addresses all the key questions facing the state,” he said.Against the proven corruption over which the LDF has presided, the UDF offers far-reaching welfare provisions, major educational reform, and an investor-friendly approach that will generate much-needed revenues for the state, Tharoor  asserted.“The LDF has been shamelessly piling on debt for future generations to pay,” he alleged.Kerala goes to polls to elect members of its 140-member assembly on April 6. Counting of votes will take place on May 2 along with that of Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal and Puducherry polls.

28-03-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh accidental home minister, says Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut Sunday called Anil Deshmukh an accidental home minister, claiming he got the post after senior NCP leaders like Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil refused the responsibility.Raut's remarks came amid speculation in political circles that Union Home Minister Amit Shah met NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel at a top industrialist's residence in Ahmedabad on Saturday.At a press conference in New Delhi on Sunday, Shah parried a query on the purported meeting, saying everything cannot be made public.NCP minister Nawab Malik, whose party shares power in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena and Congress, said no such meeting took place, adding there is an attempt to create confusion by spreading such rumours.Malik claimed that Shah sought to create confusion by making a journalist ask that question in the media briefing.In his weekly column Rokhthok in the party mouthpiece Saamana, Raut also said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra did not have damage control machinery as was seen after former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh claimed that Deshmukh asked cops to collect Rs 100 crore a month."Deshmukh got the home minister's post by accident.Jayant Patil and Dilip Walse-Patil declined the post. That is why Sharad Pawar gave the post to Anil Deshmukh," Raut wrote in his weekly column.Perhaps mindful of the fact that his remarks about a senior minister of the ruling alliance partner may be viewed in poor light, Raut later tweeted, "Bura na mano Holi hai.." In his column, Raut said, "If a junior officer like Sachin Vaze was running a (money) collection racket from the Mumbai police commissioner's office, why was the home minister not aware of it?""Vaze was a mere API in Mumbai police. Who gave him so many powers? Whose favourite was he? All this should come out," Raut wrote."Deshmukh unnecessarily rubbed some police officials the wrong way. A home minister cannot function properly if he gets surrounded by suspicious officers," he said.Raut said a home minister should always speak less.Facing the cameras frequently and ordering inquiries is not his job, the Sena MP added."The (home minister's) job is not only for accepting salutes but for giving a strong leadership. How can one forget that strong leadership requires honesty," Raut wrote.Deshmukh on Sunday said a retired judge of the high court will probe the allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh.Deshmukh told reporters in Nagpur that he had asked Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to initiate an inquiry into the allegations made against him by Param Bir Singh."The chief minister and the state government have decided that a retired judge of the high court will conduct a probe into the allegations against me. Whatever is the truth will come out," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anil-deshmukh-accidental-home-minister-says-sanjay-raut-231701

28-03-2021||New Delhi||Over 4 crore old vehicles on Indian roads; Karnataka tops list at 70 lakh||Over four crore vehicles older than 15 years are plying on roads pan-India and fall under the ambit of green tax, with Karnataka occupying the top slot with more than 70 lakh such vehicles.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has digitised the data of such vehicles throughout the country, excluding Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Lakshadweep as their records were not available.A proposal to levy green tax has already been sent to the states.More than four crore vehicles have been found to be older than 15 years, including over two crore which are more than 20 years old, as per the data.The digitised vehicle records are as per the centralised Vahan database that excludes “Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Lakshadweep”, the ministry said.Uttar Pradesh occupies the second spot with 56.54 lakh vehicles, of which 24.55 lakh are older than 20 years.The capital Delhi is at the third place in terms of old and polluting vehicles at 49.93 lakh, of which 35.11 lakh are older than 20 years.The digitisation of vehicle numbers revealed that Kerala has 34.64 lakh such vehicles, followed by 33.43 lakh in Tamil Nadu, 25.38 lakh in Punjab and 22.69 lakh in West Bengal.Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana have these vehicles in the range of 17.58 lakh and 12.29 lakh.The number of such vehicles ranges between 1 lakh and 5.44 lakh for Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Tripura and the union territories of Dadra-Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.Rest of the states have such old and polluting vehicles below one lakh each, as per the central data.The government plans to impose a green tax on old vehicles soon in a bid protect the environment and curb pollution.Vehicles like strong hybrids, electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol and LPG will be exempted. The revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution, as per the ministry.Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari in January this year had approved a proposal to levy a ‘green tax’ on old vehicles which are polluting the environment.The proposal  has been sent to the states for consultation before it is formally notified.Green tax is imposed by a few states/UTs at different rates at present.Under the scheme, transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10 to 25 per cent of road tax.Personal vehicles will be charged green tax at the time of renewal of registration certification after 15 years; public transport vehicles, such as city buses, will be levied lower green tax; while higher green tax (50 per cent of road tax) is proposed for vehicles being registered in highly polluted cities.Differential tax will also be charged depending on fuel (petrol/ diesel) and the type of vehicle.Apart from strong hybrids, electric vehicles and alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol, LPG etc, vehicles used in farming, such as tractors, harvestors and tillers, will be exempted from the tax.According to the ministry, the revenue collected from the green tax will be kept in a separate account and will be used for tackling pollution.The states will be required to set up state-of-the-art facilities for emission monitoring.Listing the benefits of the green tax, Gadkari had said it will dissuade people from using vehicles which damage the environment and motivate them to switch to newer, less polluting vehicles.The government earlier this month unveiled the finer details of the vehicle scrapping policy that provides that about 5 per cent rebate on new cars would be offered to buyers on scrapping of old vehicles.Gadkari has termed it a “win-win” policy that will help improve fuel efficiency and reduce pollution.The voluntary vehicle scrapping policy announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 provides for fitness test after 20 years for personal vehicles, while commercial ones would require it after the completion of 15 years.

28-03-2021||New Delhi||Political slugfest over PM Modi’s ‘Satyagraha for Bangladesh’ remark||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Friday remarks that he did “Satyagraha” for the freedom of Bangladesh triggered a political slugfest back home with the Congress countering the claim and the BJP posting a citation Bangladesh awarded to late Atal Bihari Vajpayee for “organising a satyagraha to demand the liberation of Bangladesh”.Congress veteran Jairam Ramesh was the first to question PM’s remark after historian Srinath Raghavan tweeted, “The claim that anyone did satyagraha for the freedom of Bangladesh and were arrested is too ridiculous to require refutation.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also countered satyagraha remark in a tweet.The BJP hit back with the party’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya saying on Twitter, “Was Prime Minister Modi part of a satyagraha organised by the Jana Sangha for the recognition of Bangladesh? Yes, he was. A citation awarded by Bangladesh to Vajpayee ji speaks of the rally. PM Modi, in a book authored in 1978, also wrote about going to Tihar during Bangladesh satyagraha”The citation Malviya shared is titled, “Bangladesh Liberation War Honour for Atal Bihari Vajpayee”. It reads, “Former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee played an active role in support of the Liberation War of Bangladesh. As President of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and a Member of the Lok Sabha, he took various steps towards that end…To press the demand for Indian Government’s expedited support to Bangladesh’s Liberation War, Jana Sangh held a Gana Satyagraha during August 1-11and their volunteers organised a huge rally in front of the Indian Parliament House on August 12, 1971. Vajpayee took a firm stand at national and international levels for the cause of Bangladesh and its striving people.”As the Twitter back and forth ensued, Srinath Raghavan said the Jana Sangh agitation after the Indo-Soviet treaty in August 1971 was for the recognition of the Bangladesh provisional government and “not a satyagraha for the freedom of Bangladesh”. He also said the Bangladesh provincial government was set up in April 1971 with the support of India but not recognised as it didn’t control the territory in Bangladesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-slugfest-over-pm-modis-satyagraha-for-bangladesh-remark-231492

Since when can a state party promise jobs in the defence forces? It is a desperate attempt to misguide people for votes. Why is the BJP silent on this?” Kharge said at a press conference here. — PTIRSS dividing people on religious lines: RahulKottayam: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday offered prayers at a temple of Lord Ayyappa and a Muslim shrine dedicated to Vavarswami at Erumeli, an important centre connected to Sabarimala pilgrimage, as he slammed the BJP-RSS and LDF while campaigning in Pathanamthitta, Kottayam and Idukki districts.

28-03-2021||New Delhi||Amid clashes, 82 per cent polling in West Bengal; 77 per cent in Assam||The high-stakes Assembly elections in West Bengal and Assam got off to a stormy start on Saturday with reports of violence from several places in Bengal and the overall first-phase voting turnout settling at a high of 82 per cent and 76.89 per cent in the two states.Amid allegations and counter-allegations by the ruling TMC and rival BJP, Bengal saw polling in 30 constituencies, 26 of which were won by the Trinamool and three by the Left-Congress alliance in 2016.In Assam, the stakes were higher for the incumbent BJP that had wrested 35 of the 47 segments where polling was conducted.The first phase saw Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Bengal campaign” from Bangladesh and the BJP hitting back by releasing a purported Mamata audio where she is allegedly heard telling a local leader to return to the Trinamool and help her win the Nandigram seat. The TMC and the BJP led counter-delegations to the Election Commission in Kolkata, accusing one another of malpractices and violence.TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay petitioned the EC against alleged “voter turnout discrepancies and permission to have outsiders as polling agents in booths”.The BJP’s Bengal election in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya, on the other hand, complained to the EC against the alleged “poll violence perpetrated by the TMC on saffron workers”. The BJP said four of its workers had been killed in the past four days. “We are used to getting assaulted here,” Vijayvargiya said even as the brother of BJP’s Nandigram candidate Suvendu Adhikari alleged that TMC goons had vandalised his vehicle in Contai.A majority of the first-phase seats in Bengal are in the erstwhile Naxal hotbed of Jangalmahal where 730 companies of central forces stood guard at 10,288 booths across 7,061 locations. The 30 seats are spread across Purulia, Bankura, Jhargram, Paschim Medinipur and Purba Medinipur districts.Though the EC said the elections in Bengal were largely peaceful with 82 per cent voting till 5 pm (highest of over 82 per cent in East Medinipur), minor skirmishes were reported from various locations, including Kanthi Dakshin in Purba Medinipur where some voters levelled EVM malfunction allegations and Majna where some people alleged that votes were getting cast in favour of a certain party.The TMC took to Twitter to allege EVM tampering but BJP state chief Dilip Ghosh rebutted the charges saying the Trinamool, “staring at a loss, was crying over EVMs.” The EVMs were replaced at some places. The CM, in her rally at West Midnapore, also made EVM manipulation charges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-clashes-82-per-cent-polling-in-west-bengal-77-per-cent-in-assam-231405
28-03-2021||New Delhi||It’s advantage BJP in Phase-I  of West Bengal elections||PM Narendra Modi’s stopover in Bangladesh at a temple besides the birthplace of Matua community’s spiritual guru will have a marginal impact on the 30 constituencies in West Bengal that went to the polls today. Mamata Banerjee can consider herself in the race for a third term if she manages to win even half of the 30 seats at stake.Comparisons with the 2016 elections will be misleading. The ground shifted in most of these constituencies, first in the 2018 panchayat elections followed by the defection of the Adhikari family to the BJP.That the dice is loaded against the TMC can be judged from the fact that elections are broadly taking place in five parliamentary constituencies, four of which are held by the BJP (Midnapore, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia)while Sisir Adhikari, who won Kainth on the TMC ticket, has crossed over to the BJP.A broad brush picture would show that the BJP led in at least 20 of the 30 seats during the 2019 elections. Also, the TMC had won all seven seats in Kainth. But the power balance shifted after Adhikari crossed over to the BJP. All these constituencies were once Left bastions. These fell to the TMC after tribals and Scheduled Castes began aspiring for material development.The battle in this election is between material advancement promised by the BJP against TMC’s incremental social welfare. Issues such as Hindu-Muslim and outsider versus tourist find no resonance here. This is because Muslims are below 10 per cent of the population and the SC\T population is so high that TMC’s outsider versus tourist battle cry finds little resonance.If Mamata has held rallies in all 30 seats, Mithun Chakraborty’s roadshows were a huge hit. Campaigning by Union Minister Arjun Munda was countered by Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren pitching for TMC candidates. BJP’s widely respected Jyotirmay Singh Mahato had won the Purulia Lok Sabha seat in 2019, leading in six of the seven Assembly seats. The BJP won Bankura and led handsomely in all the seven seats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-advantage-bjp-in-phase-i-of-west-bengal-elections-231406

After spending a large part of the day visiting three rural and remote locations, PM Modi was received at “Tiger’s Gate” at the Prime Minister’s Office late afternoon by his counterpart Sheikh Hasina.After inking five MoUs, the two leaders jointly laid the foundation stone for power evacuation from Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant being built with Russian help. The Indian involvement will be a $1 billion credit line. The two sides resolved to set up cooperation in space and artificial intelligence (AI). They inaugurated the Bangladesh leg of the Bapu-Bangabandhu Digital Museum, a passenger train on the Chilahati-Haldibari rail route and three border haats and took stock of the progress in diverse areas that included preserving the legacy and spirit of ’71, commerce and connectivity, defence and security, societal applications of nuclear energy and AI.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, at a special briefing, defended the PM offering prayers at the Matua community’s spiritual centre as well as at Jeshoreshwari Kali Temple. The Matua community’s votes are crucial in 30 West Bengal Assembly constituencies. The BJP is aligned with one branch of the community’s spiritual founder.The PM expressed his desire to visit Matua community’s Thakurbari, Kali Temple and Rabindranath Tagore’s residence. Due to paucity of time, he could visit only two places. “When dignitaries travel outside, they visit different places. Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid travelled to Garo Hills in Meghalaya.
