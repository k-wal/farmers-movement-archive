Who confers Bharat Ratna? It is the right of the prime minister and a committee,” Thackeray said.The BJP has been targeting the Shiv Sena chief for “giving up” his Hindutva ideology for sharing power with the NCP and Congress. Among other things, it has questioned the ‘delay’ in renaming Aurangabad in central Maharashtra, named for the Mughal emperor, as Sambhajinagar.“You don’t give Bharat Ratna to Savarkar and you preach to us about renaming?” the chief minister said, adding that Aurangabad will definitely be renamed.He asked the opposition party who created roadblocks in Maharashtra’s proposal to rename the Aurangabad airport after Sambhaji Maharaj, the son of warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.Iron spikes were fixed in the path of farmers protesting near Delhi borders against the new farm laws, and their electricity and water supplies were cut, he said.“Barbed wire fencing, which should have been erected along the border, was erected between farmers and Delhi... China would not have intruded had such arrangement been made there (along the border),” the chief minister said.Asking if the protesting farmers were terrorists, he said the country was not the BJP’s “private property”.The Shiv Sena was not part of the freedom struggle and neither was the “parent organization” of the BJP, he said, apparently referring to the Rashtriya Swaymsevak Sangh.“Therefore, only chanting ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ does not prove your love for the country. You don’t have the right to chant Bharat Mata Ki Jai if you are not going to give justice to people and if you are forcing farmers to protest on the streets,” Thackeray said.Farmers are waiting for their income to double as promised but it has not happened, he said, adding that “instead, fuel prices have doubled”.He also asked the BJP to “give up its thought” of separating Vidarbha from Maharashtra. “We will not let Vidarbha separate from Maharashtra,” he said.Despite being in power for six years at the Centre, the BJP did not bring a law to construct Ram temple at Ayodhya and it became possible only due to the Supreme Court verdict, Thackeray further said.“You formed government with separatists in Kashmir...you shared power with them. Didn’t your Hindutva get corrupted then?” he asked.“How many displaced Kashmiri Pandits got homes? Don’t teach us about Hindutva, you are not qualified to do that,” Thackeray told the former ally with which he parted ways after the 2019 Assembly elections.The BJP did not keep its promise of sharing the chief minister’s post though it had been discussed by him and then BJP chief Amit Shah in the room (in the Thackeray residence) where late Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray once lived, he said.“Is this your love for Balasaheb? We don’t consider that room as a room, but it is a temple,” he said.Thackeray also took a dig at the renaming of the Motera cricket stadium after Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Somebody said India will win every match there. Why? Because the name of the stadium has been changed,” he quipped.“You wiped out the name of Vallabhbhai Patel (in the process),” he added.The Centre had said after the renaming triggered controversy that only the stadium’s name was changed and the sports complex continues to be named for Sardar Patel. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-teach-us-hindutva-why-no-bharat-ratna-for-savarkar-yet-uddhav-to-bjp-220084
03-03-2021||Patna||Nitish unimpressed by Rahul Gandhi calling Emergency a mistake||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday appeared unimpressed with the candid remark of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that the Emergency, imposed by his grandmother and the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was a “mistake”.The JD(U) leader recalled his own days in prison where he had been lodged beside other young student activists opposing the draconian measure, and pointed out that the verdict of the elections held after the Emergency was lifted had unequivocally established that it was “galat” (wrong).“The resounding victory of the Janata Party, formed as an amalgam of small outfits facing persecution by the Congress regime, had proved the wrongness of the Emergency.“Rahul Gandhi has aired his views. But, if he has chosen to speak on the issue, he should say more”, said Kumar replying to queries from journalists.Kumar, who was then an engineering student, was an enthusiastic participant in the “JP movement” of 1974 during which he cut his political teeth, alongside contemporaries like Lalu Prasad and Sushil Kumar Modi.Gandhi had made the remarks while taking part in a webinar organised by a US-based private university.The NDA ally also sought to disagree with the perception that IT raids were being carried on property of those critical of the Narendra Modi government in a bid to stamp out dissent.“The Income Tax department carries out its operations in accordance with the law by which it is governed. This is not something that should generate controversy,” he remarked.The Bihar chief minister was also asked about raids being conducted across the states jails during the day.“Yes, this is in accordance with my stress on regular updates about the functioning of various departments which I keep reviewing from time to time. If anything problematic comes to the fore during the raids, officials concerned will be taken to task.”Asked about media reports regarding merger of RLSP of former union minister Upendra Kushwaha with the JD(U), Kumar evasively said “wait for the time”.Kushwaha, Kumar’s protege-turned-foe, had separated from his former boss and formed his own party before 2014 general election.His Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) performed poorly in 2019 Lok Sabha election as well as the assembly polls last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-unimpressed-by-rahul-gandhi-calling-emergency-a-mistake-220082
03-03-2021||Panaji||Cheeky Goa police ad offers ‘sea view prison’ for drug abusers||Often at the receiving end of blunt media coverage, the Goa Police on Wednesday pulled off smooth, cheeky wordplay in a print advertisement aimed at creating awareness about drug abuse in the coastal state.A Goa Police ad published in leading newspapers, warning of a ‘Sea View Prison’ awaiting drug users in the state, has now gone viral, thanks to the pun spun around stereotypical ads selling real estate in the coastal state.Speaking to IANS, Superintendent of Police (Crime Branch) Shobhit Saxena said the advert is an extension of its efforts to create awareness about the ills of drugs.“We have been doing some or the other sort of awareness campaign urging people to stay away from drugs. We had taken the support of renowned football players of Goa like Mandar Sardesai and others in the past. We had done videos and created some posters too. This ad is a continuation of the drive,” Saxena said.The creatives of the ad, which have gone viral on social media, depict an image of the setting sun, through a barred window, with the accompanying copy stating “Sea View Prison - Do drugs in Goa and win a sunset view prison cell for FREE”.The ad also urges people to inform the police on 112 about leads related to drug abuse in the state, with an assurance that the identity of the informer would be kept a secret.One of the most popular beach and nightlife destinations in the country, Goa, over the last couple of decades, has also earned the reputation as a narco-tourism destination, thanks to the easy availability of drugs and other narcotics substances.According to statistics tabled during the recently concluded winter session of the state legislative assembly, from 2018-2020, 589 drug-related cases were booked in Goa spread over 1095 days.And the narcotic flavour of the season, predictably turns out to be ganja or grass or marijuana, one of the cheapest banned drugs which has accounted for 71.30 per cent of the total drug busts.According to Saxena, the Goa Police is committed to cracking down on the drug trade in Goa and has been anchoring a series of initiatives since the anti-narcotics day which is observed on June 26.The viral ad campaign, Saxena said, was devised in-house with the help of two design experts Aditya Chikte and Deshaj and anchored by Director General of Police Mukesh Kumar Meena.“The DGP had sought to create an innovative campaign to create awareness about the issue. We will be coming out with more such ads soon,” Saxena said. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cheeky-goa-police-ad-offers-sea-view-prison-for-drug-abusers-220077
03-03-2021||New Delhi||‘SC’s query to rape accused on marrying girl was based on judicial records’||The Supreme Court’s query asking a rape accused whether he would marry the victim was based on “judicial records” containing an undertaking of the man that he would marry the minor girl, a relative after she attains 18 years of age, it was stated on Wednesday.The remarks by a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Monday during the hearing of a plea of the accused, who had challenged the cancellation of his anticipatory bail by the Bombay High Court’s Aurangabad bench, had invited sharp reactions.CPI (M) politburo member Brinda Karat wrote to CJI Bobde and urged him to withdraw his remarks, saying that courts should not give an impression of supporting such “retrograde” approaches.Several women’s rights activists,  eminent citizens, intellectuals, writers and  artistes had also written an open letter to the CJI demanding an apology and retraction of his remarks.An apex court official termed the criticism as unfair and referred to the  judicial records of the case.“When the informant (rape victim) along with her mother reached at police station to lodge the proposed complaint, mother of the Petitioner (accused) requested them not to lodge any complaint as she accepts the guilt of the Petitioner and she is ready to make the informant her daughter-in-law.“It is further alleged that, after execution of notarized undertaking on 02.06.2018, when the informant became 18-year-old, the mother of informant requested the mother of Petitioner to perform the said promised marriage but she refused the same and therefore the informant lodged the present complaint against the petitioner,” said the plea of the accused.The pleadings to the effect in the petition of the accused, who is a relative of the victim, had prompted the bench to put such queries, the apex court official said.When the hearing on the plea commenced, the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, had asked the accused, “Are you willing to marry her?”         “If you are willing to marry her then we can consider it, otherwise you will go to jail,” observed the bench, adding, “We are not forcing you to marry.”The bench had disposed off the plea of the accused and had asked him to seek regular bail from the court concerned. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scs-query-to-rape-accused-on-marrying-girl-was-based-on-judicial-records-220076

After that they will be asked to select the email or mobile number that can be used to receive the security code.Once they receive the 7-digit security code, they will have to enter it to reset the password.“Here, if we can bruteforce all the combination of 7 digit code, we will be able to reset any user’s password without permission. But, obviously, there will be some rate limits that will prevent us from making a large number of attempts,” he said.After several days of efforts, he was able to spot the account takeover flaw.“Immediately, I recorded a video of all the bypasses and submitted it to Microsoft along with detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability. They were quick in acknowledging the issue,” Muthiyah said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-techies-bug-alert-wins-rs-36-lakh-from-microsoft-220065
03-03-2021||New Delhi||Mukhtar Ansari dodging judicial system, running illegal activities from Punjab jail: UP to SC||The Uttar Pradesh government Wednesday told the Supreme Court that gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari has been “dodging” the judicial system and is running his alleged illegal activities from Rupnagar district jail in Punjab where he is lodged.   While Uttar Pradesh alleged in the apex court that there is “collusion” between Ansari and Punjab Police, the Amarinder Singh government refuted these claims and raised questions over the maintainability of plea filed by the Yogi Adityanath-led government.A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy was hearing a plea filed by the Uttar Pradesh government seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari, an MLA from Mau constituency, to district jail Banda.   Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Uttar Pradesh, told the bench that several cases are pending against Ansari in the state and in 2019, an FIR for alleged extortion was lodged in Punjab against him.He said that no charge sheet has been filed yet by the Punjab Police in the case and investigation is still going on.“He (Ansari) is dodging the judicial system,” Mehta told the bench, adding that he managed medical certificates which said that he is not permitted to travel but at the same time, Ansari had attended proceedings in other courts.“He has mocked and taken for ride the entire judicial system and the administrative system,” he said.The senior law officer said it appears like a film script as several cases were pending against him in Uttar Pradesh and suddenly, the Punjab Police lodged an FIR in 2019.Mehta said Ansari, who is lodged in Punjab jail, has not been produced before the court in Uttar Pradesh despite several orders.“I am showing the collusion between them,” the solicitor general said, adding, “He is operating and running his illegal activities from jail in Punjab”.Referring to cases pending against him in Uttar Pradesh, Mehta said that state has the power to prosecute the accused for the victims, witnesses and also the citizens and their fundamental rights gets affected if the trial gets delayed.  Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for Punjab government, questioned the maintainability of the plea filed by Uttar Pradesh and said this issue would have “far reaching consequences”.“We have nothing to do with Mukhtar Ansari. If he is a criminal, he is a criminal. The question is whether one state can file a writ petition in this court against another state in the circumstances in which Uttar Pradesh has done in this case,” Dave said.Giving an example of the case of journalist Siddique Kappan who was arrested on his way to Hathras where a young Dalit woman had died after being allegedly gang-raped, Dave said, “Can Kerala tomorrow move the Supreme Court and say that he (Kappan) is from Kerala so he be transferred to Kerala from Uttar Pradesh?”Referring to the averments of Uttar Pradesh, he said these are grievances against judicial orders in which the state of Punjab has no role whatsoever.“State of Punjab has no role in this. This writ petition is not maintainable and it cannot be entertained,” he said, adding that the jail authority has to comply with the medical records.The apex court also heard arguments on a separate plea filed by Ansari in which he has sought transfer of cases pending against him in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Ansari, said the MLA is seeking transfer of cases pending against him in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.He alleged there is a threat to Ansari’s life in Uttar Pradesh as one of the co-accused was “eliminated in encounter” by the Uttar Pradesh Police.“Government of Uttar Pradesh says I (Ansari) am lodged in Punjab jail while cases are pending in Uttar Pradesh so there is problem in the cases there. This problem will be resolve if my cases are transferred to Delhi,” Rohatgi said.“We will consider this,” the bench told Rohatgi.The Uttar Pradesh government had earlier told the apex court that the Punjab government is “shamelessly” protecting Ansari, who is lodged in Rupnagar district jail in connection with an alleged extortion case, by not sending him to Uttar Pradesh to face trial in several cases.The Punjab government had sought dismissal of plea filed by Uttar Pradesh, saying that only a “citizen” can move Supreme Court under Article 32 to claim fundamental rights and a state cannot invoke this provision.Article 32 deals with the ‘Right to Constitutional Remedies’, and gives the right to move the top court for the enforcement of the rights conferred in the Constitution.Ansari is lodged in district jail Rupnagar in Punjab since January 2019.The Uttar Pradesh government has also sought a direction to transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the extortion case in Punjab to the special court in Allahabad.In its affidavit filed earlier in the apex court, Punjab had referred to the medical condition of Ansari and said that he had been undergoing treatment at jail hospital as well as other hospitals from time to time since January 2019.While referring to the medical condition and advice of doctors, Punjab had said that custody of Ansari “could not be handed over to the state of Uttar Pradesh due to the specific advice of the medical officers/medical board /specialists” from time to time.

CERT-In official said some servers in China were trying to communicate with systems belonging to Telangana State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) and TS Transco (Transmission Corporation of Telangana Ltd).But due to the high alert after the Mumbai incident, the systems are very vigilant. As an immediate reaction, the CERT-In temporarily disabled the control function for remote operation of circuit breakers.User credentials for all those accessing TSSLDC website were changed and suspected equipment within the perimeter of the SCADA (process control system) the control centre was isolated to ensure the safety of the grid and satisfactory power supply to all consumers of the state, the officials told some local media.The official said not just Telangana, but other states should remain careful during the coming days.Earlier, a study by US-based Recorded Future had said that Chinese malware was flowing into systems that manage power supply across India.In October, the Chinese malware tried to introduce malware into the Indian Power Supply System that could have resulted in a massive power outage in Mumbai in October, which stopped trains and shut down hospitals and the stock exchange for hours.This flow of malware into the Mumbai system was detected by Recorded Future, a Massachusetts-based company that analyses online digital threats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attempt-to-hack-telangana-power-system-foiled-220049
03-03-2021||New Delhi||IMD’s climate summary for winter shows average maximum, minimum, mean temperature above normal across the country||An official climate summary for winter (January-February) shows that average maximum, average minimum and, mean temperatures remained above normal during the season across the country. The rainfall during February was also much less than the LPA, in fact sixth lowest since 1901.According to the National Weather Forecasting Centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), actual observed average maximum, average minimum and, mean temperature for the country during the Winter 2021 were 27.47°C, 15.39°C and 21.43°C, respectively, against the normal of 26.70°C, 14.59°C and 20.65°C based on period 1981-2010. Therefore, the average maximum, average minimum and mean temperature were above normal by 0.77°C, 0.80°C and 0.78°C, respectively, it said. The average maximum and mean temperature over Northwest India during February 2021 were 24.4°C and 16.92°C, respectively. The maximum and mean temperatures over Northwest exceeded the normal during February by 2.94°C and 2.11°C, respectively, second warmest since 1901, it said. Meanwhile at 27.8 mm, rains were 32 per cent less than the Long Period Average (LPA) of 40.8 mm. February recorded 7.6 mm which is 68 % less than its LPA of 23.5 mm. In fact rains across India during February were sixth lowest since 1901.Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist at IITM, Pune and IPCC Co-Author says “now almost every year and every month are warmer than the earlier ones. 2020 was one of the warmest years despite having a La Niña with cool waters in the east Pacific. This was the same for the last two months, Jan-Feb, when La Nina was fading from the Pacific.  La Niñas typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is now offset by global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, La Niña years now are warmer than years with El Niño events of the past.“The La Nina (cool) conditions in the Pacific are fading, and global agencies forecast that the temperatures will return to neutral and then warm up in the coming months. Hence global temperatures might also rise further in the coming months. IMD has already forecasted hotter summers ahead for India. “Rainfall patterns have changed, with longer dry spells intermittent with heavy rainfall events. The frequency of very severe cyclones has increased over the Arabian Sea. Over the Himalayas, the  glacier retreat is going at a fast pace— we saw its impact in the Uttarakhand event recently.

03-03-2021||---||SC restrains courts across India from taking up contempt petitions against EPFO||New Delhi, March 3The Supreme Court has restrained courts across India from entertaining contempt petitions against the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and the Centre with regard to implementation of judgements that said employees’ pension can’t be capped at Rs 15,000.This follows the top court’s February 2 decision recalling its order that could have led to higher pension for employees as it had removed the salary ceiling of Rs 15,000 and said it should be proportionate to the last drawn salary.“Pending further consideration, no contempt application seeking implementation of any of the orders passed in the aforesaid four categories of matters, shall be taken up by any Court,” a Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit said in its February 25 order.“It is made clear that under no circumstance, the matters shall be adjourned and the matters shall be taken up for hearing on day-to-day basis,” it said.Posting the matter for further hearing on March 23, the Bench made it clear that no adjournments will be given.The Kerala High Court had in October 2018 set aside the amendments in the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995 that fixed the maximum pensionable salary at Rs 15,000 per month.On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed by EPFO against the Kerala High court’s verdict. Both the Centre and EPFO filed petitions requesting the top court to review its decision.The top court had on February 2 allowed the review petitions and decided to reconsider the previous order that permitted grant of Provident Fund pension proportionate to salary.The top court is examining afresh the 2018 Kerala high court judgment required the organisation to pay full pension to retiring employees on the basis of their total salary instead of capping the amount on which a pensioner’s contribution of is calculated at Rs 15,000 a month.The HC had then noted that some workers made more contributions voluntarily towards EPFO but their pension calculation was on the Rs 15,000 salary ceiling, which was not fair on workers post their retirement. However, the Kerala High Court’s verdict wasn’t implemented as the matter was pending before the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-restrains-courts-across-india-from-taking-up-contempt-petitions-against-epfo-220039

It had awarded a 25-year jail term to third convict Pehalwan.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish Katara from a marriage party on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002 and then killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, the sister of Vikas.Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician DP Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.Nitish Katara was murdered as Vishal and Vikas Yadav did not approve of his affair with Bharti because they belonged to different castes, the lower court had said in its verdict. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nilam-katara-to-be-given-security-on-her-visits-to-delhi-from-dehradun-police-to-hc-220034

A Congress MLA and kin of senior party leaders and MLAs lost in these elections. This means people’s faith and love for Prime Minister Narendra Modi stands."This is vote for development and his work. This is also endorsement by farmers of the farm laws and reforms. This is a vote for development and work, this is a vote by farmers. The Congress created a whole drama out of LPG, made a stage of LPG cylinders, used it to keep a mike but people do not like negative campaign,” Javadekar said.Though regarding the outcome of MCD bypolls in Delhi, the senior BJP leader just said that parties held on to seats they had. “Jo seat jiske pass thi wo usko gyi,” he said. The AAP swept the MCD bypolls by winning four out of the five wards where election was held. While the Congress won one, the BJP failed to hold onto its seat.Meanwhile, lauding the hard work put in by senior leaders, Javadekar said Home Minister Shah also performed his duty as ‘panna pramukh’ to garner support for the party. “He (Amit Shah) is also a ‘panna pramukh’, he too asked people to vote. Everyone worked hard. The results show that hard work pays and people voted for those who worked for development,” he said.Javadekar said of the 31 Zila Panchayats the Congress had won 22 in 2015 and the BJP nine. “But this time, we won all 31 and the Congress was wiped out completely. Of the total 976 seats, the BJP had 368 in 2015 but this time we got 800, about 80 per cent of the total seats, he said, speaking on the outcome of polls in district panchayats, taluka panchayats, municipalities and by-elections in Gujarat which goes for its Assembly test next year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-lauds-gujarat-local-bodies-poll-win-dismisses-delhi-loss-220027

03-03-2021||New Delhi||Rahul’s claim that Congress did not try to capture institutions during Emergency ‘laughable’: BJP||The BJP on Wednesday hit back at Rahul Gandhi for attacking the RSS and claiming that the Congress at no point during the Emergency attempted to capture India’s institutional framework, saying his statement was “laughable” as his party had then ended the independence of institutions, denied media freedom and jailed dissenting voices. Union minister Prakash Javadekar said it will take Gandhi a long time to understand Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindutva organisation and ideological fountainhead of the ruling BJP, and asserted that it is the “world’s biggest school of patriotism”.The RSS’ role is to effect good changes in people and inspire patriotism in them, he told reporters after he was asked about Gandhi’s comparison of the Hindutva organisation with radical Islamists in Pakistan.In a conversation with Kaushik Basu, professor at the Cornell University in the US and India’s former chief economic advisor, Gandhi had termed the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a “mistake”.However, he added that it was fundamentally different from the current scenario as the Congress at no point attempted to capture the country’s institutional framework.Attacking the Congress leader, Javadekar said lakhs of people, including MPs and MLAs, were arrested during that time while institutions were denied any freedom.Now for him to say that they did not target institutions is laughable, Javadekar said.Responding to a question, the minister also rejected allegations that the Income Tax raids on the premises of filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and actor Taapsee Pannu were linked to their comments, which are seen at times critical of the BJP.“This is too much,” he said to the question and added that “probe agencies undertake investigations based on credible information and the matter later goes to courts as well”.              The Income Tax Department on Wednesday raided premises linked to the filmmakers, including Kashyap, who launched the now-dissolved production house Phantom Films, Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhashish Sarkar and Bollywood actor Taapsee Pannu, officials said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahuls-claim-that-congress-did-not-try-to-capture-institutions-during-emergency-laughable-bjp-220020
03-03-2021||Kochi||Five new species of shrub frogs found in Western Ghats||Researchers from India and the US have discovered five new species of shrub frogs from the Western Ghats, one of the globally recognised biodiversity hotspots.The frogs, belonging to the the Old World tree frog family Rhacophoridae, were discovered by researchers from University of Delhi and Kerala Forest Research Institute and University of Minnesota as part of a long comprehensive study on the Shrub frogs (genus Raorchestes) of the Western Ghats, carried out over a period of nearly 10 years.Researchers said the new species were identified and found to be distinct based on multiple criteria, such as their external morphology, DNA, calling pattern, behaviour, and other natural history observations.The findings are published in a scientific article titled 'An integrative approach to infer systematic relationships and define species groups in the shrub frog (genus Raorchestes), with description of five new species from the Western Ghats, India'.The authors are Sonali Garg, Robin Suyesh, Sandeep Das, Mark A Bee, and Prof S D Biju and it is published in the current issue of the International journal PeerJ.The study was carried out under the leadership of Delhi University Professor Biju.While one of the new species called Raorchestes drutaahu (Fast-calling Shrub Frog) was discovered from two localities: Kadalar in Idukki district and Siruvani in Palakkad district of Kerala, another one named Raorchestes kakkayamensis (Kakkayam Shrub Frog) was found only in the vicinity of Kakkayam dam in the southern state.Raorchestes keirasabinae (Keira's Shrub Frog), a unique tree frog inhabiting the highest canopy layers, was found in Agasthyamalai and Anamalai hills in the southern Western Ghats.The species is named after young nature lover Keira Sabin, in appreciation of the long-time support and commitment of the Andrew Sabin Family Foundation towards amphibian research and conservation around the world.Raorchestes sanjappai (Sanjappa's Shrub Frog), a beautiful green shrub frog, was discovered from the Wayanad region of northern Kerala.The species is named after Dr M Sanjappa, a renowned Indian Botanist and former Director of the Botanical Survey of India.TheRaorchestes vellikkannan (Silver-eyed Shrub Frog) was discovered in the Siruvani hills and adjoining regions of the Silent Valley National Park.The name is derived from Malayalam 'velli' (meaning silver) and 'kannu' (meaning eye), referring to its distinct silver eye colour.According to the researchers, over 80 per cent of the globally known shrub frogs are restricted to the Western Ghats, and most species are known to have narrow geographical ranges.For the first time, male calls for as many as 48 species of shrub frogs were studied, they said.According to the study, the shrub frogs of the genus Raorchestes exhibit highly unique and diverse eye colour and patterns.Biju, who is the head of Department of Environmental studies in Delhi University, said the study was a testament to how little is known about the most threatened group of vertebrates in India."Shrub frogs are among the most researched groups of frogs in India, with frequent new discoveries being made over the past two decades. Yet, we are far from fully understanding their existing diversity and uniqueness."           "Our work has once again added new insights on what we thought we knew about this group of frogs, from how to identify different species and their affinities to each other, to where they live and how vulnerable they may be to various anthropogenic threats," he said.Scientists are now tracing potential evidence for population decline of the five newly discovered species, and any threats that they may be facing within their known ranges, in order to protect them from extinction."Several new species are often threatened even before they are formally named and known to science. Many of these may already be extinct before they are discovered."     "It is an unfortunate fate that scientists call as  the nameless extinction," said Sonali Garg, the lead author of the study. צ PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-new-species-of-shrub-frogs-found-in-western-ghats-220019

03-03-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear anticipatory bail plea of Amazon Prime Video’s India head on Thursday||The Supreme Court would hear on Thursday the plea of Amazon Prime Video’s India head Aparna Purohit challenging the Allahabad High Court order rejecting her anticipatory bail in connection with the FIRs lodged against her over web series ‘Tandav’.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy, which was to hear Purohit’s plea on Wednesday, listed it for consideration on Thursday as the bench was sitting till 1 PM only.     She has been accused of inappropriate depiction of Uttar Pradesh police personnel, Hindu deities and an adverse portrayal of a character playing the prime minister in the web series.Earlier, the apex court, on January 27, had declined to grant interim protection from any coercive action to Ali Abbas Zafar, Director of the web series, Purohit, producer Himanshu Mehra, the show’s writer Gaurav Solanki and actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub.It had said that they may seek bail from courts concerned in the FIRs lodged in connection with the web series.Now, Purohit has appealed to the top court against the Allahabad High Court’s February 25 order declining anticipatory bail to her.                A single-judge bench of the High Court had said that Purohit had not been “vigilant and has acted irresponsibly making her open to criminal prosecution in permitting streaming of a movie which is against the fundamental rights of the majority of citizens of this country and therefore, her fundamental right of life and liberty cannot be protected by grant of anticipatory bail to her in the exercise of discretionary powers of this court.” While rejecting the plea, the high court had said that the applicant was earlier granted interim protection from arrest by another bench in a similar case but she was not cooperating with the investigation.The high court had observed, “Western filmmakers have refrained from ridiculing Lord Jesus or the Prophet but Hindi filmmakers have done this repeatedly and are still doing this most unabashedly with Hindu gods and goddesses.”      “This tendency on the part of the Hindi film industry is growing and if not curbed in time, it may have disastrous consequences for the Indian social, religious and communal order,” the high court had observed.On January 19, 2021, an FIR was lodged on the complaint of one Balbir Azad of Raunija village under Rabupura police station of Greater Noida.           In the complaint, Azad alleged that the show depicted Uttar Pradesh and its police in a poor light. The complaint further alleged that the web series had deliberately denigrated Hindu gods and goddesses.     Several other FIRs have also been lodged in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Bihar and Delhi.             'Tandav', a nine-episode political thriller starring Bollywood A-listers Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, started streaming recently.

Now, it is the responsibility of all the academics, experts of every language, how the best content of the country and the world should be prepared in Indian languages. This is completely possible in this era of technology. National Language Translation Mission proposed in the Budget will go a long way in this regard,” he said while addressing a webinar on effective implementation of Budget provisions regarding the Education sector.The Prime Minister said that India does not have dearth of talent, but students among the poorer sections, and those in villages have faced language obstacles, and that the use of local languages for education will create a level playing field. “To build a self-reliant India, confidence of the youth of the country is equally important. Confidence comes only when the youth has complete faith in their education and knowledge. The confidence comes only when they realise that their studies are giving them the opportunity to do their work and also the necessary skills,” he said.The Prime Minister added that the Budget of 2021-22 gave an impetus to efforts aimed at connecting education with employability, and entrepreneurship, emphasising on innovation and research to take India’s education system to the next level.“The second biggest focus after health in this year’s budget is on education, skill, research and innovation,” he said, calling for a better synergy between colleges and universities of the country. Future, fuel and green energy are essential for India’s self-reliance on energy, he said, adding that “Hydrogen Mission” had been announced in the Budget and the country had also tested Hydrogen vehicle while calling for “concerted efforts for making hydrogen as a fuel for transport and to make ourselves industry ready for this.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/educationists-should-work-on-developing-world-class-content-in-indian-languages-pm-modi-220005

To date, more than 1.1 million doses have been delivered, with more than twenty more countries expected to receive hundreds of thousands of doses this week. I would like to thank SII for being the first to help deliver vaccines to AMC countries and for working around the clock to package and make vaccines available in record time, as well as to the Government of India for their immense support. We have a lot of work ahead of us,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.The COVAX leaders said, “The first round allocation outlines delivery of 237 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine – manufactured by AstraZeneca (AZ) and licensed and manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII/AZ) – to 142 facility participants through February-May 2021.”Vaccine doses have already arrived in West Africa and Asia with many more countries to follow in the coming days and weeks.“We’ve now seen Africa’s first vaccinations with COVAX doses in Ghana and Ivory Coast, in truly moving ceremonies in both countries yesterday,” Fore said as India pushed ahead with its vaccine diplomacy.A Philippines team is also arriving in India next week to sign supply agreements for SII and US-based Novovax-made Covovax vaccine and Bharat Biotech made COVAXIN if the Filipino FDA grants emergency use authorisation to COVAXIN. The authorisation has been pending since January 21.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unicef-thanks-india-sii-as-global-alliance-starts-equitable-vaccine-rollout-220003

03-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||247 million schoolchildren in India impacted by COVID induced school closures: Unicef||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 3COVID-19 induced school closures have devastated learning outcomes as schools for over 168 million children globally have been completely closed for almost a full year.The UNICEF on Wednesday urged governments to reopen schools on priority and reported that in India alone, closure of 1.5 million schools due to the pandemic and lockdowns in 2020 had impacted 247 million children enrolled in elementary and secondary schools.In addition, there are over six million Indian girls and boys who were already out of school even before the COVID-19 crisis began.“Online education is not an option for all as only one in four children in India has access to digital devices and internet connectivity. Pre-COVID, only a quarter of households (24 per cent) in India had access to the internet and there is a large rural-urban and gender divide,” UNICEF said today cautioning policy planners of a looming crisis for children’s wellbeing.Till date, in India only eight states and UTs have opened all classes from class 1 to class 12; 11 states have reopened classes 6-12 and 15 states have only opened classes 9-12.Three states have reopened anganwadi centers, with younger children losing out greatly on crucial foundational learning. “It has been nearly a year since the pandemic caused schools to close and disrupt the normal routine of children throughout India. We know that the longer children stay out of school, the more vulnerable they become, with less chances of returning to school. Any decision to reopen schools is made with the best interests of children in mind and as schools re-open in a staggered manner with children returning to their classrooms, we must strive to support them in catching up on the learning they have missed. This is especially true for those who were not able to access digital or remote learning opportunities. Further, the mental health and well-being of children is a crucial concern. Psycho-social support from teachers, parents and caregivers is a priority,” said Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India Representative.Worldwide, around 214 million children globally – or 1 in 7 – have missed more than three-quarters of their in-person learning. The analysis of school closure report notes that 14 countries worldwide have remained largely closed since March 2020 to February 2021.Two-thirds of those countries are in Latin America and the Caribbean, affecting nearly 98 million schoolchildren. Of the 14 countries, Panama has kept schools closed for the most days, followed by El Salvador, Bangladesh, and Bolivia.“As we approach the one-year mark of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are again reminded of the catastrophic education emergency worldwide lockdowns have created. With every day that goes by, children unable to access in-person schooling fall further and further behind, with the most marginalized paying the heaviest price,” said Henrietta Fore UNICEF Executive Director.She said we cannot afford to move into year two of limited or even no in-school learning for these children.“No effort should be spared to keep schools open, or prioritise them in reopening plans,” she noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/247-million-schoolchildren-in-india-impacted-by-covid-induced-school-closures-unicef-219998

03-03-2021||Vijay Mohan||Indian scientists develop low-cost telescopic gadget to view distant celestial objects||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 3Indian scientists have indigenously designed and developed a low-cost optical spectrograph that can locate sources of faint light from distant quasars and galaxies in a very young universe, regions around super massive black-holes and cosmic explosions.Such spectroscopes were so far imported at high costs. The Indian spectrograph, named Aries–Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ADFOSC), cost nearly Rs 4 crore, which is about 40 per cent of the price of the imported equipment.Designed and developed by Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, it is the largest of its kind among the existing astronomical spectrographs in the country. The spectrograph has been commissioned on the 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) located near Nainital, which is the largest in Asia.ADFOSC can locate sources of light with a photon-rate as low as about one photon per second and forms the backbone of DOT for observations of extremely faint celestial sources. It uses a complex arrangement of several lenses made of special, highly polished glasses to produce sharp images of the sky.Photons coming from distant celestial sources, collected by the telescope, are sorted into different colours by the spectrograph and are finally converted into electronic recordable signals using an in-house developed Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera cooled to an extremely low temperature of minus 120 degrees Celsius.The technical and scientific team that researched and developed various optical, mechanical and electronic sub-systems of the spectrograph and camera was led by Dr Amitesh Omar. The spectrograph is being used by astronomers from India and abroad to study distant quasars, which are massive and extremely remote celestial objects emitting exceptionally large amounts of energy, and galaxies, highly energetic gamma-ray bursts, young and massive stars as well as faint dwarf galaxies.Experts from various national institutes including the Indian Space Research Organisation and some micro-small-medium-enterprises were also involved to review and build parts of the ADFOSC.With this development, ARIES now plans to commission more complex instruments such as spectro-polarimeter and high spectral resolution spectrograph on the DOT in the near future, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-scientists-develop-low-cost-telescopic-gadget-to-view-distant-celestial-objects-219992

03-03-2021||New Delhi||As BPF snaps ties with BJP, things get tougher for ruling party in Assam||With the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) snapping ties with the BJP and formally joining the Congress-led ‘Grand Alliance’—which also has Left and other parties—the fight seems to be getting tougher for the ruling BJP in the run-up to the Assam elections. Saffron leaders, however, have dismissed the development, instead slamming the Congress for its alliances with Muslim parties in West Bengal, Kerala, and Assam. They said the Congress stood exposed over its “lack of ideology”.  An ally of the BJP in the outgoing state government, the BPF recently announced its decision to opt-out of the NDA. BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary said, “to work for peace, unity and development the BPF has decided to join hands with ‘Mahajath’ in the forthcoming Assam Assembly Election. We shall no longer maintain friendship or alliance with BJP.”The decision was seen as a big boost for the Congress, primarily because of the BPF’s potential in swaying sentiments in the Bodoland Territorial Region. In the 2016 Assam polls, it had won 12 of the 13 seats it contested. The outgoing government includes 60 members of the BJP, 12 of the BPF and 14 of the AGP (Asom Gana Parishad) with which the BJP is continuing its alliance. So far as Badruddin Ajmal is concerned, the perfume baron enjoys a large support base in Bengali-origin Muslims that may pose a problem for saffron candidates in community-dominated regions adjoining West Bengal and Bangladesh. The BJP has been facing opposition in the state over the CAA, which has given rise to regional parties like Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal who have also formed a pre-poll alliance, giving the upcoming polls a third front. BJP leaders say the “situation is well under control” and that the problems had been brewing with the BPF for long. The tensions became public after the BPF rejected the third Bodo Accord in January 2020 and followed it by contesting the BTC elections separately. “We knew of the pact between the BPF and the Congress-AIUDF etc and are well prepared to deal with it,” they said adding that “BPF joining the Mahajath is hardly an issue”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-bpf-snaps-ties-with-bjp-things-get-tougher-for-ruling-party-in-assam-219949

External injury marks were found on the victim's body. Her skin had peeled away. There were nail marks on her body. But a preliminary examination by a team of doctors who conducted the post-mortem did not find any internal injury. A forensic report will clear the picture."The vaginal and rectal swabs of the girl have been sent for forensic examination and the report is awaited.The police have registered an FIR under IPC sections 376 (rape), 302 (murder) and also under the POCSO Act against an unidentified person.The girl, who was living with her grandmother, used to accompany the old woman to the fields, but on that fateful day, the girl had gone out alone.According to the complaint, the girl left at around 11am to collect fodder for the goats at home."When she did not return after sunset, her family started looking for her. Later, a local spotted her body in a wheat field. Her clothes were scattered all around and it appeared that she had been sexually assaulted," the complaint said.The incident is strongly reminiscent of the Hathras incident in which a Dalit girl was found unconscious in a field in September last year with serious internal injuries. She died a fortnight later in a Delhi hospital.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dalit-girl-found-raped-murdered-in-aligarh-219939

Srivastava (judicial member) and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve (administrative member) passed the order on the application of the husband, but later substituted by the wife after his death.Allowing the application, the bench cautioned the Army to give effect to the order within four months otherwise default would invite interest of 8 per cent per annum till actual payment.Further, it ordered to provide the pension from 2008, the year the husband had died.It also said that arrears of the pension would be restricted to three years preceding the date of filing of the case before the tribunal in 2017.According to reports, Shailendra Singh was enrolled in the Indian Army on January 1, 1996 and was invalidated out of service on March 17, 2003, after having rendered more than seven years in low medical category P-5 due to disability 'Recurrent Anaplastic  Astrocytoma Left Temporo Parietal Region' (OPTD), a rare malignant brain tumour.The bench agreed to the plea of the wife that her husband was enrolled in the Army in medically and physically fit condition and there was no note in his service documents with regard to suffering from any disease prior to the enrolment and hence any disability suffered by her husband after joining the service should be considered as attributable to or aggravated by military service and she should be entitled for family pension.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-widow-to-get-pension-after-12-year-legal-battle-219938

A large secular front has been created in West Bengal, mainly to combat the BJP. Now, if one of the parties of that front, the CPM decides to give seats out of its quota to the ISF, the perspective becomes different from what is being suggested,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.Singhvi called confusion around the issue a BJP propaganda, saying, “The BJP despite the absolute hooligan level of politics it practices, claims itself as the true shining secular party and makes a joke by accusing others of communalism.” Hitting back at Sharma, Chowdhury said, “Your choice to call this decision communal is serving the polarising agenda of the BJP.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-anand-sharmas-poser-cong-defends-deal-with-isf-219772

In conversation with former chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu, currently professor at Cornell University, Rahul said he was all for internal democracy in the Congress, which fought for India’s independence and gave the nation its Constitution. TNS“It is an ideological battle. Here in Assam, we may not agree cent per cent with our allies on everything, but we do understand that we are fighting together to save Assam.

Absolutely, that was a mistake. And my grandmother (Indira Gandhi) said as much."Gandhi however later said there was a fundamental difference between what happened during the Emergency and what is happening now."The Congress at no point attempted to capture India's institutional framework and frankly, the Congress party does not even have that capability. Our design does not allow us that and even if we want, we cannot do it," Gandhi said accusing the RSS of “filling up the institutions of India with its people.”Gandhi said the infiltration of the institutions by the RSS was such that “even if the Congress defeated the BJP in elections, it would not be able to get rid of the people entrenched in institutions.”Indira Gandhi had imposed the Emergency between 1975 and 1977 for 21 months suspending all fundamental rights of people.Amid the ongoing friction in the Congress with members of the G-23 group demanding changes, Gandhi said “I am the one who pushed for elections at Youth Congress and NSUI levels but was criticized by our own people.”The former Congress chief in a virtual interaction also wondered why no one asked the BJP about internal democracy or the BSP and SP.“Congress is ideologically driven and so it is more important for us to be democratic…The Congress also has to be humble and that is not an easy transition. We have to fight the arrogance of BJP with humility and flexibility. After 2014 we are not fighting for power but fighting a battle for India,” Gandhi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/emergency-was-a-mistake-says-rahul-219583

Naturally scalability is an issue. Right now around 27,000 hospitals are being used to deliver vaccines. More will be added. The CoWIN portal is very simple and flexible and we will be able to scale it up,” Sharma said.The government reported a marginal rise in daily new cases in the last two weeks across India. Average cases per week over the last two weeks have been 248 in Chhattisgarh; MP 297, Gujarat 338, Karnataka 422, Punjab 434, TN 460, Kerala 3800 and Maharashtra 6479.“Overall case positivity is down to 5.1 pc which means we are very near to WHO threshold of declaring the disease in control. Maharashtra and Kerala account for over 70 pc of all COVID cases. Although certain states are seeing a surge in active cases the fact remains that recovered cases continue to be more than 97 pc and active cases continue to be less than 2 pc. States have been told to intensify precautions,” Bhushan said.He said Punjab has seen a consistent rise over the past two weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wedding-poll-season-fuelling-covid-rise-say-high-burden-states-219516
03-03-2021||---||OIC being misled by Pakistan at UNHRC on Kashmir: India||New Delhi, March 2India on Tuesday said the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was misled by Pakistan during its submissions at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).Exercising its right of reply to the statements made by Pakistan and the OIC, Indian diplomat Pawankumar Badhe rejected the reference to the UT of J&K in the OIC statement. The 57-member organisation, he said, has no locus standi to comment on matters related to J&K, which is an integral and inalienable part of India.He found it regrettable that the “OIC continues to allow itself to be exploited by Pakistan to indulge in anti-India propaganda”.On February 24, Indian diplomats had criticised the Pakistani statement and gave fresh evidence of Islamabad’s heavy hand against civil society activists.In September 2020, they recalled that UN human rights experts had condemned the enforced disappearance of Idris Khattak, a former consultant with Amnesty International and Human Rights watch.Khattak had himself worked on reports on enforced disappearances before disappearing in November 2019, “in a cruel twist of fate”. The UN human rights experts have called upon the Pakistani authorities to end Khattak’s secret detention at the earliest.India said the pandemic had changed the way the 46th Session of UNHRC is being conducted and accused Pakistan of deliberate misuse of the forum “for its malicious propaganda against India”, aimed at diverting the Council’s attention from its own serious violations of human rights, which has remained a constant. Recently, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the key suspect in murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, was allowed to go scot free.India also said Pakistan had provided pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists out of State funds and has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of UN-proscribed terrorists.India urged the UNHRC to ask Pakistan why the size of its minority communities has drastically shrunk since Independence and why some communities have been subjected to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution, blatant abuses and forced conversions.It said the holy and ancient sites of religious minorities in Pakistan are being attacked and vandalised daily.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oic-being-misled-by-pakistan-at-unhrc-on-kashmir-india-219507
03-03-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Unemployment high in India due to govt’s “ill-considered demonetisation decision”: Manmohan Singh||Attacking the Centre, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh on Tuesday said unemployment is high in the country and its informal sector is in shambles following the “ill-considered demonetisation decision” taken by the BJP-led government in 2016.He also criticised the central government for not holding regular consultations with the states.Inaugurating a development summit virtually organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies, an economic think tank aligned to the Congress ideology in poll-bound Kerala, Singh said temporary measures by the central government and the RBI to paper over the credit problem cannot blind us to the looming credit crisis ahead that could affect the small and medium sector.“Unemployment is high and the informal sector is in shambles, a crisis precipitated by the ill-considered demonetisation decision taken in 2016”, he said at “Pratheeksha 2030.”The summit was organised to launch a Vision Document, a framework of ideas for development of Kerala well in advance of the state elections.He observed that in Kerala and many other states, public finances were in disarray with states having to resort to excessive borrowing, which creates an intolerable burden on future budgets.“Federalism and regular consultation with states, which was the cornerstone of India’s economic and political philosophy as enshrined in the Constitution, no longer finds favour with the present Central government,” he said.Singh said while Kerala’s social standards are high, there are other sectors that need strong attention in the future.“There are many roadblocks ahead that the state has to overcome. The global downturn of the last two or three years, aggravated by the pandemic, has made the global interface of Kerala more fragile.“While the increased use of digital modes of work may keep the IT sector afloat, tourism has been hit badly and the rate at which the pandemic is galloping in Kerala poses challenges for this industry”, Singh said.Noting that the focus on health and education has enabled Kerala to take advantage of job opportunities elsewhere in the country and in all parts of the world, Singh said this has led to a growing stream of remittances from abroad which created a booming real estate sector and sharp growth of the services sector, led by tourism and information technology.The former PM also hailed the decision of the leadership of Kerala’s Congress-led UDF to incorporate “radical ideas” like “NYAY” in its Assembly election manifesto, saying the scheme outlined in the Congress manifesto of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, will provide direct benefit transfer to the poorest among us.He said this, together with other measures such as no- bill health care through more medical establishments and other measures to strengthen the social infrastructure will provide a framework for inclusive development, focused on the needs of the underprivileged.“This is the essence of Congress ideology, and it is a matter of gratification that all UDF parties think alike on this.”According to Singh, while providing support to the poor, such schemes will also kickstart the economy as demand will be stimulated, leading to more production particularly in the small and micro sector, in agriculture and in the unorganised sector, creating more employment opportunities and bringing the economy rapidly back to normalcy after the prolonged economic slowdown at the national level.“In the midst of all the gloom, I see the UDF’s steadfast adherence to planned growth with a clear sense of direction and concern for the common man a beacon of hope, not only for Kerala, but for the whole country”, he said.“When I presented the national budget in 1991 as Finance Minister, I quoted Victor Hugo, who had said, “Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.”     “I get the feeling that the unanimity and clarity displayed by the UDF on the road ahead will lead to Kerala’s ideal moment arriving this year”, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unemployment-high-in-india-due-to-govts-ill-considered-demonetisation-decision-manmohan-singh-219505
03-03-2021||New Delhi||People want to forget March 1, 2020 but it is seared into my memory: Delhi’s 1st COVID-19 patient||It’s a day most Delhiites would like to erase from their memories but March 1, 2020, the day the city reported its first case of COVID-19, is seared into Rohit Datta’s memory.There’s no erase button for the businessman, the National Capital’s first patient.From facing stigma in the initial days after the diagnosis to becoming “Googleable” and a popular subject on quizzing platforms now, Datta says life has come a full circle.“As I was the first case, initially there was lot of fear and guilt too. I would consider myself as the carrier of the virus as I had just returned from Italy after a work-related visit and found myself positioned in a scenario where the unpredictability of this new virus fuelled more fear and apprehensions among people,” he told PTI.A resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi, Datta had flown in from Italy on February 25 last year, and got a fever the same night. Next morning, he paid a visit to a local doctor and got some medicines, he recalled.February 28, 2020 was his son’s 12th birthday, and he hosted a small get-together at a luxury hotel in south Delhi. That night, he got a fever again.By February-end last year, the novel coronavirus had already wreaked havoc in China, where it was reported first globally in the city of Wuhan, and Italy too had been ravaged by it.“I then decided to go to RML Hospital, and my samples were taken on February 29 for a COVID test,” the businessman said.Datta, who turned 46 on July 5, was diagnosed with the infection on March 1. From RML Hospital, he was sent to the isolation facility at the Safdarjung hospital.“My test report had come positive on March 1, but I was told about it by doctors the next day, March 2. Initially, the plan was to keep me in isolation there for 28 days, but then it was revised to 14 days at the isolation facility and then 14 days of home isolation, where I fully recovered,” he said.Asked if these dates hold any significance for him, Datta, who had a quiet celebration on his son’s 13th birthday this February 28, said, “March 1 is like an anniversary for me, and I can never forget it.”     “After my case, Delhi saw a raging pandemic throughout the year, and mostly people would like to forget this period altogether, but these dates are seared into my memory now, forever, and in the minds of my family members,” he added.Delhi saw three major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the worst being the third one in November.The highest single-day spike in Delhi till date—8,593 case—was reported on November 11, while on November 19, the city recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.Delhi recorded 175 new COVID-19 cases on Monday (March 1), taking the city’s infection tally to over 6.39 lakh, even as the positivity rate rose to 0.44 per cent, according to data shared by the health department.The death toll due to the disease in the city stands at 10,911.Datta, a businessman who deals in leather, said he has always been fascinated by leap years, and now “February 29, 2020 is another unforgettable date for me”.“My sample was taken on this very date, and its anniversary will come after every four years now. It’s quite amusing. Sometimes I feel I was chosen by fate to be in this position,” Datta said, with a smile, adding that he has become “more religious” after his treatment.He reiterated his appeal to the masses to “not lower guard” even when the vaccination drive is underway, and urged people to observe all COVID-19 safety norms.Asserting his faith in the doctors and the scientists of the country, Datta said he would wait for his turn to get the vaccine shot.Of all the new vocabulary that has come in vogue amid the new normal in a pandemic-hit world, he said, “Quarantine is my favourite new word that is now a household term, like self-isolation and sanitisation”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-want-to-forget-march-1-2020-but-it-is-seared-into-my-memory-delhis-1st-covid-19-patient-219500

Commuters prefer to travel from Ghaziabad to Noida through this route.The road, which was shut post R-Day violence on January 26, was suddenly opened for traffic around 1:30 am.The decision left the volunteers—who patrol the stretch during the night—in a state of panic as the road suddenly witnessed traffic.However, the road was shut by noon again.“We opened the road to aid maintenance work being carried on the highway,” a police official said.The CISF personnel, who were manning the barricade, said that they were not aware about the sudden change of heart by the police.“We only come here by 2. The barricades were always there,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghazipur-border-closed-again-after-a-portion-was-opened-for-traffic-movement-219470
03-03-2021||New Delhi||Modi says $82 billion being invested in ports, invites global firms to be part of India's growth trajectory||India will invest USD 82 billion in port projects by 2035, raise share of clean renewable energy source in maritime sector, develop waterways, augment seaplane services and boost tourism around lighthouses, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday urging global players to make India a "preferred investment destination".As many as 400 projects with investment potential to the tune of USD 31 billion are ready for investors, who can be a part of India's growth trajectory, Modi said while inaugurating the Maritime India Summit."As many as 574 projects at a cost of USD 82 billion or Rs 6 lakh crore have been identified under the Sagarmala project for implementation during 2030 and 2035...We will encourage private investment in the port sector...India's long coastline awaits you. India's hardworking people await you."Invest in our ports. Invest in our people. Let India be your preferred trade destination. Let Indian ports be your port of call for trade and commerce," the Prime Minister said as he invited players to invest in Indian ports, shipyards and waterways.The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways is ready with a list of 400 investable projects with investment potential of USD 31 billion or Rs 2.25 lakh crore, Modi said, adding that this would further strengthen India's commitment of overall development of its maritime sector."Through this Maritime India summit, I want to invite the world to come to India and be a part of our growth trajectory. India is emerging as a leading blue economy of the world. Our leading focus area includes upgrading current infrastructure, creating next generation infra, boosting the reform journey. Through these steps we aim to give vision to our Aatmanirbhar Bharat," he said.Modi said, “Ours is a government that is investing in waterways in a way that was never seen before. Domestic waterways are found to be cost-effective and environment-friendly ways of transporting freight. We aim to operate 23 waterways by 2030."He said this would be done through infrastructure enhancement, fairway development, navigation aid and river information system provisions and focus would also be given on augmenting regional connectivity to Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar.New Maritime Infra will usher in ease of living through launch of roll-on, roll-off and other projects for harnessing rivers."Waterdromes at 16 locations are being developed to enable seaplane operations... River cruise terminal infra and jetty are being developed on five national waterways. We aim to develop domestic and international cruise terminals by 2023," the Prime Minister said.Asserting that the government is working towards holistic maritime development that is not in silos, he said plans had been drawn for developing tourism on land adjacent to 78 out of 189 lighthouses on Indian coastline."This with the objective of enhancing development of the existing lighthouses and its surrounding areas into unique maritime tourism landmarks," he said, adding that the government had also initiated holistic development of islands.Alongside, the usage of clean renewable energy in the maritime sector is being raised."We are in the process of installing solar- and wind-based power systems in all the major ports across the country. We aim to increase usage of renewable energy to more than 60 per cent of all energy by 2030 in three phases across Indian ports," he said.Modi said Indian ports had reduced waiting time for inbound and outbound cargo. "India is very serious about growing in the maritime sector and emerging as a leading Blue Economy of the world," he said.The government of India is also focusing on the domestic shipbuilding and ship repair market, he said, adding that to encourage domestic shipbuilding, a Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy for Indian Shipyards had been approved.Recalling India's rich maritime heritage, the PM said it brings together many stakeholders. "Together we will achieve great success in boosting the maritime economy. India is a natural leader in this sector. Our nation has a rich maritime history. Civilisations flourished on our coasts. For thousands of years. Our ports have been important trading centres. Our ports connected India to the world," he said.Emphasising on improving efficiency, he said as a result of steps in this direction, capacity of major ports which was 870 million tonnes in 2014, has increased to around 1,550 MT per annum at present."This productivity gain not only helps our ports but also boosts the overall economy by making our ports more competitive," he said.The Prime Minister also launched an E book -- Maritime India vision (MIV) 2030 -- that envisages over Rs 3 lakh crore investments in various port sectors generating over 20 lakh direct and indirect jobs.The MIV 2030 identifies five key areas to propel growth and deliver tangible benefits to agriculture, logistics, local manufacturing, recycling and tourism besides boosting Indian tonnage.It aims to make India a preferred global destination for investments in the sector.The Prime Minister also launched Sagar Manthan Mercantile Marine Domain that envisages receiving oceanic data among others.Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Mansukh Mandaviya said post enactment of Recycling of Ship Act 2019, India now aspires to grab at least 50 per cent of global ship recycling business.
