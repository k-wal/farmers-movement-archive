26-03-2021||---||SC reserves verdict on revisiting 1992 Mandal verdict on quota||New Delhi, March 26The Supreme Court on Friday reserved its verdict on referring to a larger Bench the 1992 verdict in the Indira Sawhney (Mandal) case, which fixed 50% ceiling for quota in government jobs and admission to educational institutions. A five-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan – which reserves its verdict after hearing rival arguments from several senior advocates for 10 days – will decide whether the Mandal judgment should be revisited in view of subsequent constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics.On Thursday, the top court had said all caste-based reservations may go and only those meant for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) may remain, even as it clarified that it was a radical idea and a policy matter to be decided by the government and Parliament.Noting that affirmative action was not limited to reservation alone, the top court had earlier said states should take additional steps to promote education and establish institutions for the upliftment of socially and educationally backward classes (SEBS).“Why can’t other things be done. Why not promote education and establish more institutes? Somewhere this matrix has to move beyond reservation. Affirmative action is not just reservation,”  it had noted.The Bench—which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat—had last week wondered if there was no limit to quota what would happen to the concept of equality. “What about the resultant inequality? How many generations will you continue...?” it had asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-verdict-on-revisiting-1992-mandal-verdict-on-quota-230848

26-03-2021||New Delhi||Lawyer’s office raid: Investigators can’t be prevented from collecting evidence, says court||Hands of investigators couldn't be tied to prevent them from collecting evidence, a Delhi court has said on a plea by an advocate seeking direction to police to retrieve only relevant information from his hard disk in a case of alleged tutoring of a witness in the northeast Delhi riots.Advocate Mehmood Pracha is representing some of the accused in the cases related to the riots that took place in the national capital in February last year.His office was raided by the Delhi Police in connection with an FIR alleging that the advocate tutored a witness to initiate a false riots case.He had moved the court seeking directions for retrieval of relevant information from his hard disk and raised concerns regarding protection of his client’s data.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pankaj Sharma said the court’s intervention in the case was not proper and an accused cannot dictate the investigating officer (IO) about the mode and manner for collection of evidence in an investigation.The court said the search warrant can be executed in accordance with law subject to the safeguards as per expert opinion.“The collection of evidence is intrinsic to the investigation and hands of the investigators cannot be tied to prevent them from collecting evidence. The collection of data from its source is done to ensure its admissibility during trial and it is imperative for the IO to collect the best form of evidence during investigation as per its own discretion,” the court said.“If the IO feels that ‘target data’ is to be retrieved from its source which is hard drive of the computer of the applicant for the purpose of investigation, the decision of the IO cannot be interfered with by the court nor accused can dictate him as to how evidence is to be collected, if it is clear that the other data can be protected from being interfered with by the IO,” it said in its order passed on March 25.Pracha moved the sessions court against the order, which will hear the matter on March 27.The magistrate court, in its order, noted the situation was different in the matter as the data was to be collected by the police on account of investigation in a criminal case and hence the plea for non-sharing data of other clients of Pracha was beyond the scope of section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act.“The court’s intervention is not proper and also accused cannot dictate the IO about the mode and manner for collection of evidence in an investigation. Accordingly, in the considered view of this court, the objections raised by the applicant (Pracha) are baseless,” it said.It also said expert opinion reflected that the “target data” can be stored/ copied/ retrieved in a pendrive/memory device without interference to other data stored in a hard disk.It further said according to the expert opinion, if the hard disk was submitted in the forensic lab, the “target data” can be retrieved without any alteration to the metadata associated with “target data” and without creating any evidential vulnerabilities as the data will be retrieved forensically.“Also, it will not affect the data stored in the hard disk relating to other clients of the applicant (Pracha),” the court said.“Through the use of forensic tools, it is possible to safely segregate the ‘target data’ from the other data without any interference/alteration while keeping its authenticity and integrity and at the same time ensuring the admissibility of the 'target data' without evidential vulnerabilities,” it said.The court had earlier stayed the operation of search warrants issued against Pracha.Pracha had said that a soft copy of the materials was as good as a hard copy under the Information Technology Act.He had further sought directions to the police for retrieval of data in the presence of a magistrate.“They want to threaten my clients. That’s their purpose. In the main Delhi riots cases, they say soft copy is equal to hard copy and we would not give hard copy of charge sheet. Here they don’t want a soft copy,” he had said.During the course of arguments, the advocate had also argued that it was clear from the video of the riots in question that his complaint was not false.“Larger issues are involved. Entire judicial system is involved. I’m willing to sacrifice myself to save the Constitution. Please protect my clients, Constitution and Evidence Act,” he had added.The Delhi Police had opposed Pracha’s plea, saying seizing the original hard disk was essential as it ought to be sent to a forensic science laboratory for examination and that a mirror hard disk can be put back into his computer.The application had alleged that the purpose of obtaining a search warrant was to yet again threaten, intimidate and frighten him.The police had claimed that it was searching for “incriminating documents” and metadata of the outbox of the official email id of his firm.The advocate had later moved the court seeking preservation of copies of the video footage of the raids conducted by the Delhi Police at his office on December 24.A court had directed the preservation of the entire video footage of the police raid at Pracha’s premises. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyers-office-raid-investigators-cant-be-prevented-from-collecting-evidence-says-court-230843
26-03-2021||Shillong||SC order to quash FIR against me upholds freedom of expression: Meghalaya journalist||Padma Shri awardee and senior journalist Patricia Mukhim on Friday said the Supreme Court order to quash an FIR lodged against her over a Facebook post gives hope to people across the country and upholds freedom of expression, which is important in a democracy.An FIR was lodged against the ‘Shillong Times’ editor last year for a Facebook post in which she had condemned an attack on non-tribal boys in Shillong. The complainant, a village council, had claimed that her comments might incite communal tension.The Meghalaya High Court had earlier refused to quash the police complaint and also ordered a thorough investigation.Mukhim was informed about the apex court’s judgment while she was trekking through the famous David Scott’s trail.“The enlightened and well-considered judgment gives hope to the people across the country that the Supreme Court respects freedom of expression which is very important in a democracy,” she told PTI.This ruling will be a precedent if anybody else falls under the same predicament, Mukhim added.The senior editor, whose house was attacked in April 2018 a month after the BJP-backed Meghalaya Democratic Alliance government was sworn-in, said the judgment is a victory for those who believe in free speech, especially journalists.“We are not living in easy times. We find that specifically journalists and social activists are booked under sedition and all kinds of intimidatory tactics are used against them. I take the judgment as a collective victory for all those who believe in free speech,” she said.Mukhim, who is being trolled after the Supreme Court judgment, said she is never intimidated by threats or legal actions, and will never stop putting her views on social media.“I believe that as a citizen of a democratic country, we should make our voices heard especially because we are in a position to speak for the voiceless masses.“If we are not bringing social issues to the table and making the government hear them, then we are not doing our jobs at all,” she said.Speaking on trolls, Mukhim said, “If we can’t bear the heat, we have to get out of the kitchen. This is inevitable in social media. We can block them or delete their comments but we shouldn’t stop thinking or speaking.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-order-to-quash-fir-against-me-upholds-freedom-of-expression-meghalaya-journalist-230840

It said both sides resolved to resolve the pending legacy issues through mutual dialogue and discussion.They also agreed to work constructively to resolve key outstanding bilateral trade issues and to take a comprehensive look at ways to expand the trade relationship.  Analysts have noted the weak economic pillar of Indo-US ties by pointing out that Quad has met a dozen times at various levels as compared to just one US-India Trade Policy Forum interaction in the last 18 months.Another key Indo-US two plus two—the US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue (S&CD)—is yet to be revived after it held its last meeting five years back involving then US Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker along with their counterparts Sushma Swaraj and Nirmala Sitharaman.Goyal also congratulated Tai on her appointment as USTR and the conversation also touched on consolidating the economic partnership between like-minded democracies upholding the principles of openness, transparency and fair trade.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-india-agree-to-revive-high-level-trade-talks-230839
26-03-2021||Daspur/ Debra(WB)||PM's growing beard inversely proportional to the state of country's economy : Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying his growing beard is inversely proportional to the state of the economy in the country.Banerjee, who was addressing poll rallies in Paschim Medinipur district, also accused BJP of being the "biggest fraud party" of the country.The TMC supremo, who is contesting election from the high profile Nandigram seat in Purba Medinipur district, said she would be remain put there till the end of polling in the constituency on April 1 as there are chances that BJP has "plans to loot votes by using goons from other states" and cautioned TMC workers in the state against complacency."The Indian economy has gone for a toss. There is no industrial growth. There is no growth except for the beard of Narendra Modiji. At times he dresses like Rabindranath Tagore and at time likes Mahatma Gandhi," she said mocking the prime minister.Keeping up her attack, Banerjee said "The day is not far off when the entire country will be sold and named after Narendra Modi ... BJP is trying to throttle democracy in the country."As we (opposition parties) are all busy with assembly elections in five states, the BJP government is passing laws to intrude into the constitutional powers of the elected government in Delhi by giving more powers to the lieutenant governor. This is shameful," she said.State polls will begin in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala from March 27.Recounting the cancellation of the visa of Bangladeshi actor Firdaus' visa for campaigning for her party candidates for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Banerjee wondered why the same should not be done for Modi for campaigning for former US president Donald Trump."If Firdaus' visa can be cancelled for campaigning in a foreign land then Modiji's visa should also be cancelled for campaigning for Donald Trump in America. Have you forgotten the slogan 'Ab Ki Bar Trump Sarkar'," she said.The Trump government aiming to woo the influential Indian-American voters in August 2020 had launched a video commerical containing clips of Modi's speches and former US president's historic address in Ahmedabad.The TMC supremo, who held three poll rallies in Paschim Medinipur district during the day, claimed that BJP has "roped in goons to threaten people"."These goons might visit households and ask women with folded hands to vote for them or face the threat of being herded out," she said."Don't be overconfident and suffer from complacency.BJP is the biggest fraud and janjal (garbage) party in the country. It can go to any extent to win the elections at any cost. Your duty is not over even after voting is over. You have to guard the EVMs," Banerjee told TMC workers said at a rally at Daspur.She alleged that police personnel from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, where the BJP is in power. "They are being brought to West Bengal to possibly influence elections in favour of the BJP"."They (police personnel) will act in favour of BJP. If you sense anything amiss, rise in protest. Mothers and sisters take the lead in such protests if you see any illegal conduct," she said."Be ready with utensils and broomsticks to chase away such elements if they issue a veiled threat," Banerjee told the women who had gathered at the meeting.She said people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had been arrested from Nandigram area on Thursday night and claimed that "Goons have been brought from other states to rig the polls"."They (BJP) think they can rig the polls. We will not allow that to happen. I will stay put in Nandigram from March 28 till the elections are over there. I will myself see how they loot votes," she said.The BJP has hired "borgis from outside to loot votes".Borgis were a category of Maratha empire's troops who indulged in large scale plundering during Maratha expeditions in Bengal in the 18th century .Alleging that EVM machines could be tampered to help the BJP win the election, Banerjee asked TMC polling agents to check them twice on poll days and guard the machines till May 2, the date of counting."If members of the central force ask you to leave, tell them that you respect them, but they should not work for Modiji," she said.The eight-phase election to the 294-seat West Bengal Assembly begins on March 27. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pms-growing-beard-inversely-proportional-to-the-state-of-countrys-economy-mamata-230835
26-03-2021||New Delhi||SC stays HC order reviving criminal cases against WB CM’s election agent||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the operation of a Calcutta High Court order that resulted in reinstitution of several criminal cases against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s election agent in connection with the Nandigram protests against land acquisition by the state government from 2007-09.A Bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and Krishna Murari said: “Since the order which affects the petitioner (election agent) herein was passed without hearing him, we deem it appropriate to pass an interim order staying the operation of the order dated March 5, 2021”.The petitioner, SK Supian, has challenged the order passed by the Calcutta High Court on two PILs against the withdrawal of prosecution in various criminal cases connected with the protests over the alleged improper acquisition of land by the state to create a special economic zone (SEZ) in Nandigram.Supian, represented by senior advocate Vikas Singh, has contended he was not made a party in the PILs and the reinstitution of the criminal cases has impaired his ability to discharge his functions as an election agent under the Representation of People Act 1951.Singh alleged that a PIL was “filed by a BJP person” in the high court which passed the interim order.“By an interim order, the case was revived,” he said, adding, “I (petitioner) am the election agent of the Chief Minister and because of this order, I am virtually disabled”.“It is unheard of. There is no question of revival of case,” Singh said, adding that his client was impleaded as a party in the matter before the high court, but after passing an interim order without hearing him.He said the cases relate to protests at Nandigram and later, the state government decided to withdraw these matters.“This high court order has to be stayed. Now, I (petitioner) have been impleaded as a party in the high court, I will go there and argue my case,” Singh said, adding the plea filed in the high court is “politically motivated”.Senior advocates A M Singhvi and Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the state, also opposed the high court’s interim order.Singhvi sought stay of the high court interim order and said it was passed on a PIL and that too, without hearing the person.“You must stay the order (of high court) completely,” Singhvi said.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for a caveator, said both the petitions—one filed by the state and the other by Supian—should be dismissed with exemplary cost as they have “lied to this court”.The caveator before the apex court is one of the persons who filed the PIL in the high court.Rohatgi, during the hearing, claimed that both the state and Supian have argued that only agitation cases were withdrawn but there were some cases, including those under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code also.However, the bench said that the plea filed by the state is not before it.Singh said in Nandigram protest, there were allegations that some people had died in police firing and in some cases, allegation of murder was there.Rohatgi alleged that there are six cases against Supian and he was absconding for 13 years.“This is a shocking case where cases are withdrawn in stereotype fashion,” Rohatgi said, adding the petitioners before the high court are practicing lawyers.Rohatgi said the apex court can ask the division bench of the high court to hear the matter on Tuesday.Supian, in his plea, has claimed that he was discharged or acquitted in various cases, in relation to the protests against the land acquisition, in February and June last year.The criminal cases had alleged that he had engaged in unlawful assembly and had participated in the violence in connection with the protests, his petition has said.He has claimed that he came to know the cases were reinstituted when the process to issue arrest warrants was initiated by the magisterial court on March 15.The magisterial court by its order of March 15 had also stayed its order of last year permitting withdrawal of the prosecution and reinstated the criminal cases.The matter was mentioned in the first half of the day before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde by senior advocate Vikas Singh.The apex court, during the mentioning, said that “anything can happen in a political rivalry” and that it will see whether a special bench can be constituted depending on availability.Later, the matter was listed for hearing in the post-lunch session. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-hc-order-reviving-criminal-cases-against-wb-cms-election-agent-230834
26-03-2021||Chandigarh||Soldiers start consuming alcohol at higher age than civilians, reveals Army study||A study by military medical specialists has found that the ‘age at first drink’ (AFD) in the Indian armed forces is markedly delayed as compared with that among the general population.This implies that those in uniform tend to begin to consume alcohol at a higher age than their civilian contemporaries.Terming it to be a novel finding, the specialists also held that contrary to earlier studies, there was no correlation between AFD and the severity of alcohol dependence at detection in the Indian armed forces.The study was undertaken by three psychiatrists at a large tertiary care multi-specialist hospital over a period of 24 months and has been published in the latest issue of the Medical Journal Armed Forces India.Alcohol dependence syndrome is a public health problem worldwide and AFD is among the factors that impacts its occurrence. AFD, according to the study, has been linked to early onset and increased severity of alcohol dependence.Pointing out that alcohol dependence among military personnel differs significantly from the general population, the authors state that checks and balances exist in the Indian military similar to that prevalent in other armies across the world.In units of the Indian armed forces, alcohol is not permitted to young recruits until a minimum number of years for service, thus providing for a minimum age for purchase of alcohol.In addition, there are several other checks in the unit such as officers and junior leaders sensitizing the “at risk” individuals about the consequences of risky drinking, peer intervention and an effective monitoring and reporting system that provides for an early detection of alcohol related problems.The study has highlighted the effectiveness of such measures among the Indian armed forces personnel which is reflected in lower severity of alcohol dependence and could possibly be due to late onset of drinking or early detection of alcohol related problems.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/soldiers-start-consuming-alcohol-at-higher-age-than-civilians-reveals-army-study-230828
26-03-2021||Gandhinagar||Bill penalising conversion by marriage to be tabled in Gujarat Assembly||A bill penalising forcible or fraudulent religious conversion by marriage with 3-10 years in jail and a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh is likely to be tabled in the Gujarat Assembly next week.The bill, which amends a 2003 Act, seeks to curb the “emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion” as per its “statement of object”.The copy of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill was made available in the Assembly on Friday.Similar laws have been enacted in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.The bill says it is necessary to prohibit “forcible conversion by marriage or by getting a person married or by aiding a person to get married,” and hence the amendment is being carried out.The Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, 2003, deals with religious conversion “through allurement, force or by misrepresentation or by any other fraudulent means”.“However, there are episodes of religious conversion promising better lifestyle, divine blessings and impersonation. There is an emerging trend in which women are lured to marriage for the purpose of religious conversion,” the bill says.The amendment also defines “allurement” as promising “better lifestyle, divine blessings, or otherwise”.“Forcible conversion by marriage, or by getting a person married” shall invite imprisonment of 3-5 years and up to Rs 2 lakh fine.If the victim is a minor, a woman, a Dalit or tribal, then the offenders may be punished with a jail term of 4-7 years and a fine of not less than Rs 3 lakh.If any organisation is found violating the law, the person in-charge can be sentenced to between three years and 10 years in jail and a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh can be imposed.Marriages solemnised for the purpose of such conversion will be declared void. Also, the burden of proof shall lie on the accused.Parents, siblings or any other person related by blood, marriage or adoption to the victim can lodge complaint.Offences will be non-bailable. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bill-penalising-conversion-by-marriage-to-be-tabled-in-gujarat-assembly-230827

26-03-2021||New Delhi||HC dismisses PIL against enhanced exam fees charged by CBSE||The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a PIL which said that poor children studying in classes 10 and 12 at government schools would not be able to afford the board exam fees and sought a direction to the AAP government to pay as it had done in the past.A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh said there was no right for full or partial waiver of examination fees and it was the government’s decision whether it can foot the bill based on the facts and circumstances of each year and the other priorities of the administration.The court said it was not inclined to direct the government to fully or partially waive the exam fees and saw no reason to entertain the petition.“With these observations, the petition is dismissed,” it said.The petition was filed by a society, Parents Forum for Meaningful Education, contending that the CBSE “arbitrarily” enhanced the exam fees in 2019-20 and was charging the same in 2020-21 too when everyone has been hit financially by the pandemic.In 2019-20, the Delhi government foot the exam fees of students studying in class 10 and 12 in its schools, and assured the parents that the matter would be sorted for the future, the society had said in its plea.The government had in another similar matter told the court that it cannot foot the bill in 2020-21 as it had done last year as the amount was over Rs 100 crore.The society had in its plea said that CBSE was charging Rs 1,500 as board exam fees for class 10 and 12 and the amount goes up to Rs 2,400 for science stream students as they also have practicals.The petition contended that in the prevailing situation, parents of children in government schools may not be able to pay such amounts in one go.“It has emerged that respondent 2 (Delhi government) has not only failed to sort out the matter as promised last year but this year it has declined to meet the steep fee obligation thereby abandoning lakhs of children in class 10 and 12 in its schools,” the petition claimed.The petition had also sought creation of an empowered committee to examine the fixation of exam fees by CBSE for students in schools run by the Delhi government and to ensure that such children “receive the minimum learning environment and opportunity for equal chances of success at the board examination”.

26-03-2021||Kolkata||BJP has become ‘Borrowed Janata Party’, TMC’s victory will herald change in 2024: Yashwant Sinha||Former Union minister and newly appointed TMC vice president Yashwant Sinha feels the BJP has become “Borrowed Janata Party” which is fighting elections with the hired leaders of other parties and said victory of Trinamool Congress in the West Bengal assembly polls will trigger a change in 2024 general election.Noting that BJP doesn’t have a credible face to counter Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal and is dependent on outsiders “Shah-Modi”,Sinha said the desperation to win Bengal is driven by the fact that it has slim chances of winning polls in Kerala,Tamil Nadu and Union Territory Puducherry and a victory in Assam, where it is in power, won’t be a big prize.He despised thinking that he joined TMC for the sake of getting Rajya Sabha membership, saying “it is a very cheap way to look at my decision”.Sinha, who served as finance and external affairs minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, commented the present-day BJP is controlled by “two-people”, who call the shots.“The BJP has turned itself into a Borrowed Janata Party in Bengal. They are fighting elections with leaders and workers from other parties. They don’t have their own leaders to match Mamata Banerjee in Bengal,” he told PTI in an interview.Talking about the Bengal elections, Sinha said the saffron party would bite the dust despite creating an unprecedented hype around the state assembly elections.“Four states-West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam- and Union Territory of Puducherry are going to the polls this time.“They are the ruling party in Assam already, so a win there won’t be a big prize. Therefore, the only real prize worth getting is Bengal, and that is why the BJP is putting most of its efforts there,” he said.Noting that the Bengal polls results will have national implications, Sinha said its a must to stop the saffron party for the sake of the country.“The BJP has created an unprecedented hype around the elections. They think they can overcome and overrun all the opposition in the country. But, despite all the noises they are creating, they don’t have a ghost of a chance in Bengal.“The win of TMC in West Bengal assembly polls will ring the changes in 2024 general elections and defeat the BJP. The entire country is looking at this election, it will unite the opposition,” Sinha said.The veteran politician, who started his political career with Janata Party in 80s, feels the BJP lacks a credible face as a challenger to Mamata Banerjee in Bengal.“The fact that BJP doesn’t have a credible face in Bengal to counter Mamata Banerjee itself keeps TMC ahead of the BJP,” he said.Speaking on the insider-outsider debate in Bengal, Sinha said this ought to come up as BJP is seeking votes by projecting Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.“Had the BJP projected any local leader as CM face, this narrative would not have come up in this election, as they could have easily said that they are here to assist the local leadership.“But the party is projecting Shah-Modi as its faces, and that is why they are termed as outsiders,” he said.When asked about he too being branded as an outsider in Bengal by the BJP leadership, he said, “I am not here to contest election neither I am projected as a face here. I am here to assist Mamata Banerjee and the TMC”.Sinha had joined TMC in mid-March to assist the feisty Bengal leader against the saffron party.The bureaucrat-turned-politician, a bitter critic of Modi and Shah, had left BJP in 2018.His son Jayant Sinha remains in the saffron party and is MP from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand.Speaking about BJP projecting 88-year-old “Metro man” E Sreedharan in Kerala, and a TMC turncoat Rabindranath Bhattacharya of the same age in Bengal, Sinha said, “it is complete violation of its own policy that all leaders above 75 years should retire from active politics”.“They made this rule of people of above 75 year of age not being fielded in polls to corner senior BJP leaders L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and likes of them.“So once this was done, now the rule is of no use, and it can be broken. They are doing the same,” the octagenarian leader said.When asked why he decided to join the TMC, Sinha said his decision was prompted by the country’s situation going from “bad to worse”.“In 2018, I had decided not to indulge in party politics and would only speak on issues related to national importance.But, then circumstances changed, and things have gone from bad to worse.“I thought I could make a greater contribution if I join a political party; then I looked around and saw the kind of hype BJP has created around Bengal elections and felt it is only Mamata Banerjee who can stop the BJP,” he said.The 83-year old veteran politician also said that the “tipping point” was the attack on Banerjee in Nandigram that prompted him to join her.When asked about speculations that he might be the party’s nominee for the Rajya Sabha seat, which has fell vacant after Dinesh Trivedi quit his post and party to switch over to the saffron camp, he said, “it is a very cheap way to look at my decision to join the TMC.“Let me tell you that I was offered Rajya Sabha seat a few years back by both the TMC and the AAP. I had declined both the offers”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-has-become-borrowed-janata-party-tmcs-victory-will-herald-change-in-2024-yashwant-sinha-230800
26-03-2021||New Delhi||SC reserves verdict on plea for immediate release of Rohingya refugees in Jammu||The Supreme Court on Friday reserved verdict on a fresh plea seeking immediate release of detained Rohingya refugees in Jammu and restrain the Centre from implementing any order deporting them to Myanmar.A bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian after hearing detailed arguments on the plea said: “We are closing it for order”. During the hearing, advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, said Rohingya children were subjected to killing, maiming and sexual exploitation and Military in Myanmar has failed to respect international humanitarian law. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said he is showing the problems which persists in Myanmar. Bhushan referred to verdict of International Court of Justice and said that it has said that Myanmar has not presented any concrete measures aimed specifically at recognising the rights of the Rohingyas to exist as a protected group. He said that Jammu and Kashmir administration has detained Rohingyas in Jammu, who have refugee cards and they will soon be deported. “I am seeking directions to not detain and deport these Rohingyas to Myanmar under Article 21 of the Constitution,” Bhushan said. Mehta said they are not refugees at all and this is the second round of litigation as this court had earlier dismissed an application filed by the petitioner, who is also a Rohinga.“There was a similar application for Assam earlier.They (petitioners) wanted that no Rohingya to be deported, we had said that we will follow the law. They are illegal immigrants. We are always in touch with Myanmar and when they confirm that the individual is their citizen, and then only deportation can take place”, he said.The bench said that can it be said that you (Centre) will deport only when Myanmar accepts.Mehta said yes, the government cannot send an Afghan national to Myanmar. The bench said that it is closing the matter for orders. On March 11, an interim plea was filed in a pending PIL, seeking immediate release of detained Rohingya refugees in Jammu, and sought restrain orders from the court to the Centre from deporting them.The plea also sought direction to Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) for Rohingyas in informal camps.The application filed by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee through advocate Bhushan, said that it is filed in public interest in order to secure and protect the right against deportation of refugees in India.The plea said that it is filed to protect rights guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 21, read with Article 51© of the Constitution, against the deportation of Rohingya refugees who have taken refuge in India after escaping widespread violence and discrimination against their community in Myanmar.“Release the detained Rohingya refugees immediately and direct the Union Territory government and the Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant Refugee identification cards through the FRRO for Rohingyas in informal camps,” it said.It sought direction to the Union Government to refrain from implementing any orders on deporting Rohingya refugees, who have been detained in the sub jail in Jammu.Violent attacks allegedly by Myanmar army men have led to an exodus of Rohingya tribals from the western Rakhine state in that country to India and Bangladesh. Many of them, who had fled to India after the earlier spate of violence, have settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-verdict-on-plea-for-immediate-release-of-rohingya-refugees-in-jammu-230798
26-03-2021||New Delhi||Centre plans to expand vaccination drive||The Centre is planning to widen the scope of the COVID-19 immunisation drive by bringing more population groups under its ambit, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday, days after everyone above 45 years was made eligible to get vaccinated from April 1.He said people have embraced the 'Made in India' vaccines, and it is due to this enthusiasm and trust that the country crossed the last one crore vaccination in just under four days.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers getting inoculated first and immunisation of frontline workers began from February 2.The next phase of COVID-19 vaccination has commenced from March 1 for those who are over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified comorbid conditions."A few days ago, the government announced that from April 1 all citizens aged 45 years and above, whether having any comorbidity or not, will be eligible to get vaccinated. The government is already planning to widen the umbrella of COVID-19 vaccine beneficiaries soon to cover other sections of the population," Vardhan said.He made these remarks during his keynote address on 'Reshape Tomorrow Summit' organised by The Economic Times, according to a health ministry statement."I have often called 2020 the year of science. A vaccine development process that used to take many years, often decades, has been condensed to about 11 months."Just in January last year, research started with a previously unknown virus and we now have not just one, but several vaccines that will be administered to millions of people before the end of the year with several other types of COVID-19 vaccines also on the way," the minister said.Both Covaxin and Covishield are being manufactured in India. But, Covaxin by Bharat Biotech has been developed in the country under the ambit of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India) showcasing the nation's remarkable scientific acumen and vaccine development capability to the world, he said."People have embraced our 'Made in India” vaccines, and it is due to this enthusiasm and trust, we crossed our last one crore vaccinations in just under four days," the minister was quoted as saying in a statement.Vardhan also described India's investment in the 'test, track and treat' strategy along with the behavioural change campaign as the bedrock of the country's highest recovery rate and minuscule fatality rate, it said.He praised Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's decision to allocate Rs 35,000 crore for the COVID-19 vaccination drive in the 2021-22 budget.  "On January 16, India started its national vaccination programme against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That day witnessed vaccination of the highest number of beneficiaries anywhere in the world on the first day. Back then, our priority was to use the COVID-19 vaccine as a shield to protect our healthcare and frontline workers."Within the first 34 days, we touched 1 crore vaccination, and in the subsequent weeks, we opened the vaccination to other priority groups. Throughout this vaccination drive, our focus has been on keeping the services as citizen-friendly as possible," Vardhan said.To speed up the pace of the vaccination drive, the Centre has lifted time restrictions and people can now get immunised round the clock according to their convenience across India, he said.Applauding the collaborative approach followed by India for planning and execution of the vaccination drive, Vardhan propounded the exercise as an excellent example of how the federal system can work in synergy to maximise the reach of a programme.The vaccination drive is being coordinated as a 'Jan Bhagidari Aandolan' involving many stakeholders like ministries, departments, professional bodies, medical colleges, NGOs, CSOs, media houses, private sector, youth and women volunteer groups, he added."In these trying times when the clamour for 'vaccine nationalism' is on the rise, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, being a champion of global cooperation and humanity, has led the way by example."His decision to extend help to our global family not only resonates well with our age-old virtues of 'Vasudhaivakutumbakam', exalting the entire world as one family but has also further cemented India's stature as a true leader in the comity of nations," the health minister said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-plans-to-expand-vaccination-drive-230794
26-03-2021||Palakkad (Kerala)||Rahul Gandhi attacks Centre, CPI(M)-led LDF govt||Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who began his second leg of the campaign for the April 6 Assembly polls, on Friday attacked the Central and the LDF governments over the "weak" economic condition.“The economic condition of the country and the state is weak and has become worse due to demonetisation and flawed GST. Both the governments have failed to revive the economy,” Gandhi said at an election meeting here in sweltering heat.The Congress leader arrived here by helicopter from Coimbatore on a two-day visit and will be addressing meetings in Palakkad and Malappuram districts.Taking a swipe at the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF, he said its attempt to revive the economy was like trying to start a car without filling petrol.“We need to inject money into the economy. When we tried to introduce a job guarantee scheme, many said it was a waste of money. But later they had to accept that it boosted the economy,” he said.He claimed the NYAY (minimum income guarantee) scheme will inject money into the economy, enhancing the purchasing power of the common people, thus boosting the production sector.“This will create new jobs,” he said.

26-03-2021||New Delhi||SC reserves verdict on bail plea of Gautam Navalakha in Bhima-Koregaon case||The Supreme Court on Friday reserved its verdict on a plea of activist Gautam Navalakha seeking bail in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case of Bhima Koregaon lodged in Maharashtra.A Bench of Justices U U Lalit and K M Joseph after hearing detailed arguments from senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Navalakha and Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, appearing for NIA reserved the verdict.The top court had on March 3 sought response from NIA on the plea of Navalakha seeking default bail in the case, saying chargesheet was not filed within the stipulated time period. According to police, some activists allegedly made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence at Bhima-Koregaon in the district the next day.The police have also alleged that the event was backed by some Maoist groups.The high court had said that “it sees no reason to interfere with a special court’s order which earlier rejected his bail plea”.Navlakha had approached the high court last year, challenging the special NIA court’s order of July 12, 2020 that rejected his plea for statutory bail.On December 16 last year, the High Court bench reserved its verdict on the plea filed by Navlakha, seeking statutory or default bail on the ground that he had been in custody for over 90 days, but the prosecution failed to file a charge sheet in the case within this period.The NIA had argued that his plea was not maintainable, and sought an extension of time to file the chargesheet.The special court had then accepted NIA’s plea seeking extension of 90 to 180 days to file the charge sheet against Navlakha and his co-accused, activist Dr Anand Teltumbde.Navlakha’s counsel had told the high court that the NIA was granted the extension to file its chargesheet.Sibal had said Navlakha had already spent 93 days in custody, including 34 days of house arrest, and that the High Court must count house arrest as a period of custody.While he was under house arrest, Navlakha’s personal liberties remained curtailed, Sibal had said. However, Raju, who appeared for the NIA, had argued that Navlakha’s house arrest could not be included in the time spent in the custody of police or NIA, or under judicial custody.Raju had argued that the Pune police arrested Navlakha in August 2018, but had not taken him into custody.He had said the accused remained under house arrest, and the Delhi High Court quashed his arrest and remand order in October 2018.The FIR against him was re-registered in January 2020, and Navlakha surrendered before the NIA on April 14.He spent 11 days in the NIA’s custody till April 25, and since then he in judicial custody in the Taloja jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai.Raju had argued that if the court “looked from the other angle, it would see that if he (Navlakha) was arrested on August 28, 2018, he should have been enlarged on bail”.“He was a free man till April 2020. He was neither on bail nor in custody. There cannot be a gap in the custody and detention period,” Raju had said.

It will also do its utmost to repeal this Act,” Singh said in a video recorded message released by the Congress on the eve of phase one elections in Assam tomorrow.He said the party had published a people’s manifesto to implement promises that are practical.“Five lakh unemployed youth will be provided jobs in the the public sector. Twenty five lakh unemployed youth will be provided jobs in the private sector. The daily wage of tea plantation workers will be increased to Rs 365. These workers will also receive other social security benefits. Every household will receive up to 200 units of free electricity, the former PM said seeking votes for the party.Singh said under the promised Grahini Samman scheme the Congress will provide every housewife a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 every month. “Your future and the future of your children is in your hands. I urge you to vote for the Congress Party and the Maha Jot,” he urged calling Assam his “second home”.Singh said he was deeply grateful for the trust and affections of the people of Assam and the friendship of late Hiteshwar Saikia and Tarun Gogoi. “The people of Assam enabled me to serve the country as finance minister 45 years and as prime minister of India for 10 years. Today I am speaking as one of you. The time has come again to cast your ballot. You must vote wisely,” said the former PM noting that the people of Assam had endured suffering due to to prolonged periods of insurgency.“Under the leadership of late Tarun Gogoi from 2001 to 2016 Assam made rapid progress on the path of development and peace but it is now facing very serious setback. The society is being divided on the basis of religion language and culture. The basic rights of the common man are being denied there is atmosphere of tension and off fear. Ill-conceived notebandi and badly implemented GST have weakened the economy,” said Singh attacking principal rivals and incumbents BJP in Assam.He said people and women have lost their livelihoods. “The youth are desperate for jobs. The rise in the prices of petrol coma diesel korma and cooking gas is making life difficult for the common man. The poor are becoming poor and COVID-19 is making matters words. You must vote for a government that upholds the constitution of India and the principles of democracy. You must vote for a government that will care for every citizen for every community. You must vote for a government that will ensure inclusive growth, a government that will put Assam once again on the path of peace and development,” urged Singh, a star campaigner for Congress who hasn’t been able to travel due to COVID restrictions.He said the Assam Congress is committed to protect the unique language history and culture and ensure the well-being of all communities. “We have brought out a people's Manifesto with promises that are are practical.

26-03-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain appeal of Sushant Singh's sister to quash FIR against her||The Supreme Court Friday refused to entertain the appeal of Sushant Singh Rajput's sister challenging the Bombay High Court order which refused to quash an FIR lodged against her on the complaint of actress Rhea Chakraborty, the late actor's girlfriend.A bench of Chief Justice of India S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed the appeal filed by Priyanka Singh, saying it was not inclined to hear the matter.Singh challenged the Bombay High Court's February 15 verdict, by which her FIR quashing petition was dismissed, saying the court overreached its power by examining allegations that were placed before the police through media reports.Chakraborty, in her complaint before the police on the basis of which the FIR was lodged on September 7 last year, had alleged that Rajput's sisters had conspired with Tarun Kumar, a doctor, to obtain a false prescription for administering banned medicines to the late actor.Singh, in her petition, said: “While, the investigating agency, that is, CBI, respondent no.3 herein, had also specifically held that registration of FIR was manifestly illegal and without any jurisdiction. The affidavit of respondent no.3 before the high court also records that as per observation of this court no second FIR could have been registered after the inquest proceedings by Maharashtra police was closed.“Despite the complainant as well as the prosecuting agency clearly stating that no case is made out, the high court has not quashed the second FIR which is without authority of law.” It said the high court had quashed the FIR against her sister Meetu Singh but kept the FIR alive against her in the case.The plea said the entire case of Chakraborty against her was based on media reports which do not have any credibility as to the source or authenticity of such reports. “The high court failed to observe that delay in present FIR is of 91 days and same has been registered without any preliminary inquiry as mandated by this court in Lalita Kumari...“This conduct of respondent no. 1 (State of Maharashtra) shows that present FIR was registered hurriedly on same day without any inquiry and smacks of malice and vengeance as respondent is herself accused in case of death of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput filed by father of petitioner in FIR…,” it said.The plea also said the high court has recorded observations against Tarun Kumar, who is a senior cardiologist working in RML Hospital in Delhi and was not before the Bombay High Court in the proceedings.“From our understanding, Dr Kumar had the requisite qualification and the authority to prescribe the alleged drugs. It is pertinent to mention that the prescription was provided in accordance with the MCI Regulations and Telemedicine Practice Guidelines and Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines, where it is permitted to the medical practitioner to prescribe medicine through teleconsultation and also through caregiver,” it said.The high court has failed to examine any of the issues raised and therefore, is causing prejudice to Singh, it said.Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed ''Kai Po Che'' seven years ago, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14, 2020.The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor's father K K Singh in Patna against Chakraborty and her family.The apex court had on August 19 last year upheld the transfer of the FIR, lodged at Patna against Chakraborty, to the CBI. It had said that Bihar government was competent to transfer the case to the CBI for investigation.The FIR in Patna was against Chakraborty and others for alleged offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 306 (abetment of suicide), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-appeal-of-sushant-singhs-sister-to-quash-fir-against-her-230779

The initiative aims at helping to check the accumulation of tons of plastic waste during the gathering, he added."While many bags have been made in the factories, around 500 women are also engaged to accomplish the task. Our target was to send 25,000 bags but now 30,000 bags have been dispatched and more shall be sent by April 11," he added.Small groups have been formed at local level under a leader who looks at the smooth running of the drive, he informed.Shrikant Gupta, heading a Nature Lover group in Jaipur said that the bags sent to Haridwar will be given to the visitors of the Kumbh and polythene will be taken from them.These polythenes will be used to make eco-bricks which will be then used to make roads, centre-tables, benches, etc., he said, adding that training is also being imparted to people to dump polythene in plastic bottles to make eco-bricks.Swadeshi further said that a competition is also being organised at a local level where the entry fee will be to bring one such eco-brick. "A total of 12,000 registrations have been made for this competition and we are hoping more to come," he added.Meanwhile, Gupta in his appeal to the people of the group, said, "May we all make the Mahakumbh in Haridwar polyethylene free Kumbh with our little cooperation in the national interest."Therefore, I humbly request you to cooperate in saving the environment and making a poly-free pillar by giving us cloth bags from your home according to your reverence." "A total of 20 crore people are likely to come to this Kumbh Mela; so the first installment of the bags have been dispatched to Haridwar. Whoever wishes to cooperate for the next installment, please deliver at the said address," he appealed.

Shops in Khan Market were also open.A senior Delhi Police officer said the situation is peaceful and remains under control, adding that no report of any untoward incident has so far been received.Farmers camping at the Ghazipur border blocked a carriageway of National Highway-9 from Delhi to Ghaziabad in the morning, but there was not much activity by the protesters in the city till afternoon.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had to briefly close the entry and exit gates of the Tikri Border, Bahadurgarh City and Brigadier Hoshiar Singh stations, but after a few minutes, the stations were opened for passengers.A farmer leader claimed that there were protests in Mayapuri and some other areas where people peacefully staged demonstrations.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the protesting unions, claimed that various farmer organisations, trade unions, student bodies, bar associations, political parties and representatives of state governments have supported the "Bharat Bandh" call.On Thursday, the SKM had said the "Bharat Bandh" would also be observed in the national capital.It had appealed to people to make its nationwide shutdown successful."All shops, malls, markets and institutions will remain closed under the complete Bharat Bandh. All minor and big roads and trains will be blocked."All services will remain suspended except for ambulance and other essential services. The effect of the Bharat Bandh will be observed inside Delhi as well," the SKM had said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) on their crops.So far, there have been 11 rounds of talks between the protesting unions and the government, but the deadlock continues as both sides stick to their stands.In January, the government had offered to suspend the farm laws for 12-18 months, which was rejected by the farmer unions. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-bandh-minimal-impact-in-delhi-metro-road-transport-markets-unaffected-230768

26-03-2021||Mumbai||Former RBI deputy governor KC Chakrabarty passes away||Former deputy governor of Reserve Bank KC Chakrabarty passed away following a heart attack on Friday. He was 68.Chakrabarty, a commercial banker-turned-central banker, died at his home in suburban Chembur, banking industry sources said.After his stint at state-run lenders like Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and Punjab National Bank, the outspoken Chakrabarty had joined the RBI as a DG in 2009 and resigned in 2014, three months before his term ended.Before banking, Chakrabarty had taught at Banaras Hindu University before entering commercial banking.At RBI, he handled a variety of departments including banking regulation and supervision as the DG.Following reports of an "RBI official" putting question marks over policy efficacy in tackling inflation, he was stripped of many responsibilities by the then Governor D Subbarao, and was left with only the Rajbhasha Department. Subsequently, his responsibilities were restored.At RBI, he had a reputation for sharp wit, humour and quick retorts. He frequently critiqued his former commercial banking colleagues for blaming rise in dud loans as 'system-generated NPAs', insisted on financial inclusion targets and had a very public spat with former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri over interest on cash reserve ratio.After his resignation, he had shifted base to London, where he was posted earlier in his career while working for Bank of Baroda.In 2018, his name cropped up as a suspect in two cases investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation, including one related to the Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines. He was also prevented from flying out to London because of a lookout circular against him. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-rbi-deputy-governor-kc-chakrabarty-passes-away-230762
26-03-2021||Mumbai||Noted journalist and author Anil Dharker dies||Noted journalist and author Anil Dharker died here on Friday, a former colleague said.Dharker (74) was the founder and director of the Mumbai International Literary Festival, held in November every year and was also the founder and director of Literature Live! which holds literary evenings throughout the year in the city.He underwent a bypass procedure at a Mumbai hospital on Thursday and died there Friday morning, the colleague said.Over a five-decade-long illustrious career, Dharker had been a columnist and writer, an architect, a member of the advisory committee of the film censor board and more.Dharker had been the editor of a variety of publications, starting with Debonair (a monthly), Mid-Day and Sunday Mid-Day (evening papers); The Independent, a morning broad-sheet from the Times of India group and The Illustrated Weekly of India.He was a columnist for The Indian Express newspaper and author The Romance Of Salt, a book on Mahatma Gandhis Dandi March. Dharker had also worked as a TV show producer and anchor, and head of a news television channel.He was a member of the Advisory Boards of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), Doordarshan, the Children`s Film Society of India and several film funds for the production of films in India. He was also a recipient of several awards for journalism.Expressing grief over Dharkers demise, columnist Bachi Karkaria tweeted: "Extremely saddened by the passing of the many talented Anil Dharker.

26-03-2021||New Delhi||No proof COVID 2nd wave due to virus variants, but it is possible: Virologist Shahid Jameel||There is so far no evidence that the second wave of COVID-19 in the country is due to variants of the virus, but it is possible, said noted virologist Shahid Jameel.He, however, stressed that the sharp rise in coronavirus infections seen recently is mainly because people have stopped following COVID-appropriate behaviour.In an interview with PTI, Jameel, who has won the coveted Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, said the rollout of vaccines has caused a false sense of security among people."But vaccines won't work unless we take them. As of March 25, only 8.1 million people have taken both doses, which is 0.6 per cent of India's population. Further, 46.4 million people or 3.3 per cent of India's population have taken only one dose, which gives weak or no protection," he said.Jameel further said there is so far no evidence that the second wave is due to variant viruses. "But this is possible"."The mortality rate in the second wave appears to be no different. In fact, it appears to be lower than what we saw in August and September 2020, during the first peak," said Jameel, who is presently the director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University.He said the second wave is mainly because there are enough susceptible people in the country and in the past four months most of the people have stopped following Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and avoiding crowded places."Further, all commercial and recreation activities are back to normal even as the pandemic is still there," Jameel said.Registering a steep spike in COVID-19 cases for the 16th day in a row, India on Friday saw 59,118 new coronavirus infections in a day, the highest single-day rise so far this year. The active caseload has breached the 4-lakh mark again after around three-and-half months.Asked whether a double mutant variant of the coronavirus is causing this surge in the number of infections, Jameel said not necessarily, but it can, depending on the properties of the new mutant viruses."As for the double mutant found in India, we don't yet know if it is responsible for the surge being observed in some states. Epidemiological correlation is required for that," he said.A double mutant variant is the coming together of two mutations in the same virus. In the Indian context, this refers to two mutations – L452R and E484Q – both within the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, coming together, Jameel explained.Spike proteins play an important role in how these viruses infect their hosts.It is common for mutants to combine, he said."The UK variant, for example, carries 23 mutations, of which eight are in the Spike protein. The South African variant has nine mutations of which six are in the Spike protein. The Brazil variant has 16 mutations of which 10 are in the spike protein," he said.Explaining the reason behind such mutations, Jameel said some of these mutations get 'selected' because they offer some advantage to the virus such as better infectivity, ease of transmission from one host to another, evasion of antiviral immunity.He said the effectiveness of current vaccines, Covaxin and Covishied, against the double mutant variant has not yet been tested.India has detected a new "double mutant" COVID-19 variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three "variants of concern"—first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil—that have been found in at least 18 states and union territories.The ministry, however, said it could not be sufficiently established yet if these variants were behind the recent spike in COVID-19 cases in some states. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-proof-covid-2nd-wave-due-to-virus-variants-but-it-is-possible-virologist-shahid-jameel-230760
26-03-2021||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to stay sale of electoral bonds||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 26The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the sale of electoral bonds ahead of the ensuing Assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry."Since the electoral bonds were allowed to be released in 2018, 2019 and 2020 without interruption, and sufficient safeguards are there, we do not see any reason to stay the issuance at this stage, a Bench led by CJI SA Bobde said, dismissing an application filed by Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking an interim ban on sale of electoral bonds.The Supreme Court had on Wednesday reserved its order on ADR's plea seeking to restrain the authorities from opening any further window for sale of electoral bonds in view of the ensuing Assembly polls.The Centre and the Election Commission had opposed the ADR’s plea even as the petitioner NGO’s counsel Prashant Bhushan demanded a stay on sale of anonymous electoral bonds, terming it legalised corruption which paved the way for shell companies to offer bribes.Expressing concern over possible misuse of electoral bonds, the Bench had asked the Centre to examine it. "If a political party gets Rs 100 crore worth bonds what is the control over the use of these bonds for illegal activities or purposes outside political agenda," it asked.On behalf of the Centre, Attorney General KK Venugopal had defended it saying that after the electoral bonds scheme was launched in 2018, black money in elections had been kept under check as these bonds could be purchased only through cheques or demand drafts.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, representing the Election Commission, had opposed the plea for stay on electoral bonds, saying it was one step ahead of unaccounted cash system. He, however, said the EC wanted transparency in the electoral bonds scheme.Citing ensuing Assembly polls, ADR had on March 9 moved the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing of its PIL challenging the Electoral Bonds Scheme for funding political parties.Contending that there was a serious apprehension that further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming state Assembly elections would further increase “illegal and illicit funding” of political parties through shell companies, the NGO demanded that no further opening of window for the sale of electoral bonds be allowed during the pendency of its petition.The PIL has been pending for the last two years and the RBI and Election Commission had said that illicit monies were being transacted, the NGO had submitted.A similar plea was filed by ADR in October last year ahead of the Bihar Assembly polls that were held in November 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-stay-sale-of-electoral-bonds-230758

Sivan, Secretary, Department of Space and Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).Sivan said: "The GISAT-1 launch slated for March 28 got slightly delayed as some technical issues were observed in the satellite and the rocket. The issues observed issues have to be addressed even if they are minute ones." The GISAT-1 will be the country's first sky eye or earth observation satellite to be placed in geostationary orbit.Originally the GISAT-1 was slated for launch on March 5, 2020 by Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-F10 (GSLV-F10).Hours before the start of the launch countdown, Indian space agency announced postponement of the mission owing to some technical glitch."The launch of GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-F10), planned for March 05, 2020, is postponed due to technical reasons. Revised launch date will be informed in due course," Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had said on March 4."Subsequently the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown delayed the mission. The rocket had to be dismantled and cleaned up," Sivan added.The Indian space agency had earlier said GISAT-1 would provide real time image of large area of region of interest at frequent intervals. It will also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic events and any short term events.The 2,268 kg GISAT-1 will also provide spectral signatures for agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow, glaciers and oceanography. The satellite will have payload imaging sensors of six band multi-spectral visible and near infra-red with 42 metres resolution; 158 bands hyper-spectral visible and near infra-red with 318 metres resolution and 256 bands hyper-spectral short wave infra-red with 191 metres resolution.A four metre diameter Ogive shaped payload fairing (heat shield) has been used in the rocket for the first time, ISRO had said.

26-03-2021||Dhaka||Bangladesh Liberation War martyrs devoted their lives ‘resisting injustice’, says Modi paying homage||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday paid homage to the martyrs of the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence against Pakistan and said they devoted their life towards “preserving righteousness and resisting injustice”.Army bugles played the Last Post as the Bangladesh national flag was hoisted at half mast in a ceremonial manner as Modi stood in solemn silence in front of the National Martyr’s memorial at Savar, about 35 km north-west of Dhaka, after placing a wreath. Also read: PM Modi hails Bangabandhu’s leadership, Indian Army’s contribution in Bangladesh’s Independence war“At the National Martyrs’ Memorial, paid homage to the valorous martyrs of Bangladesh. Their struggles and sacrifices are inspiring. They devoted their life towards preserving righteousness and resisting injustice,” the prime minister tweeted in both English and Bengali languages.“Also planted an Arjuna Tree sapling,” he added.Designed by structural engineer and architect Syed Mainul Hossain, the memorial at Savar comprises seven pairs of triangular-shaped walls—each representing a significant chapter in Bangladesh’s history, including the 1952 ‘Bhasha Andolan’ (Language Movement) -- through which Bangladesh became an independent nation from Pakistan.“I pay my heartfelt tribute to the patriotic martyrs of Bangladesh whose glorious sacrifices enabled the birth of this great Nation. May every visitor to this revered ground honour the sacred memory of the millions who were slain but not silenced. Their valour will continue to inspire future generations to fight injustice and defend the cause of righteousness,” Modi wrote in the visitor’s book at the memorial.“On behalf of the people of India, I pray that the eternal flame at Savar remains a lasting reminder of the noble victory of truth and courage over deceit and oppression,” he wrote.On reaching the memorial, Modi planted a sapling of the Arjuna tree “to commemorate sacrifices of the patriotic martyrs of Bangladesh”, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) tweeted.“This sapling has been planted as a mark of respect for the valorous martyrs of Bangladesh,” the Prime Minister’s Office tweeted.In another tweet, the PMO said, in the same complex, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had also planted a sapling during his Bangladesh visit in 1999. Vajpayee had planted a sapling of Cape jasmine that time.Sharing a picture of Modi laying the wreath at the memorial, the Ministry of External Affairs tweeted, “Prime Minister @narendramodi paying solemn tribute at the National Martyr’s Memorial to the brave-hearts of the Liberation War of Bangladesh, for their great sacrifices.”   Later, Modi met political leaders from the ruling Grand Alliance as well as the opposition parties.In a statement, the MEA said the prime minister, as part of his two-day visit to Bangladesh, met political leaders from 14 Party Alliance along with the Convener.“Discussions centred on diverse issues of bilateral relations were held during the meeting to strengthen ties between the two nations,” it said.The PM also interacted with opposition leaders from various political parties of Bangladesh. The engagement involved discussions on a wide gamut of issues pertaining to the two countries’ bilateral relations, the MEA said.Modi also met the community leaders, including representatives of minorities and ‘Mukhtijoddhas’—the fighters of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Eminent young achievers from different walks of life interacted with the prime minister in Dhaka.During his visit to Bangladesh, Modi will attend the celebrations of the golden jubilee of the country’s independence, the birth centenary of ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and hold talks with his counterpart Sheikh Hasina.Modi, who is visiting Bangladesh on his first trip to a foreign country since the outbreak of the coronavirus, was received by Prime Minister Hasina at Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport upon his arrival.A salute of 19 guns and Guard of honour were accorded to Prime Minister Modi at the airport. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-liberation-war-martyrs-devoted-their-lives-resisting-injustice-says-modi-paying-homage-230735

When fire alarms sounded, all patients were safely evacuated to the fire refuge area as the smoke was reaching the hospital.”    A civic official said the BMC had issued notice to the mall last year for allegedly flouting fire safety norms.Former NCP MP Sanjay Patil said he had written to the BMC commissioner last year drawing the civic body’s attention to the alleged flouting of fire safety norms there.President Ram Nath Kovind mourned the loss of lives in the hospital fire. “My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this tragedy. I pray for speedy recovery of the injured,” he tweeted.“Pained by the loss of lives due to a fire at a hospital in Mumbai. I pray that the injured recover soon,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.“Pained by the loss of lives in a fire incident at a COVID care hospital in Mumbai, Maharashtra. My condolences to the bereaved families & prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured,” Vice President Venkaiah Naidu tweeted.

Frustrated with the party for not helping him carve out from West Bengal a separate state for the Gorkhas, Gurung has thrown his weight behind his arch enemy Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and Chief Minister of West Bengal.When Gurung fled the hills following multiple cases slapped against him by the Mamata Banerjee-led state government, Anit Thapa and Binoy Tamang took over the reins of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) party, founded by Gurung.Party Committed to GorkhalandAfter Gurung’s return to Darjeeling following his deal with Mamata, Thapa and Tamang stayed away from him. As a result, the GJM now has two factions — one led by Gurung and the other by Tamang.This time, the TMC has decided not to field any candidate in the hills. Mamata said the three hill constituencies would be fought by her “friends”. She did not clarify which GJM faction she wanted her supporters to vote for.Both GJM factions have announced candidates for Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong. The BJP, which left the Assembly seats for the Gurung-led GJM in the past, won the byelection held for the Darjeeling Assembly seat in 2019 with Gurung’s backing. The GJM does mention the demand of Gorkhaland in its manifesto. The Gorkha leader will have to convince the voters that his commitment to the Gorkhaland demand has not got diluted by his recent bonhomie with Mamata.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/darjeeling-poll-litmus-test-of-gjms-popularity-230589

However, in terms of impact on the election scene, Sanjukta Morcha is trailing behind the two main players — TMC and BJP.A total of 191 candidates from various parties are contesting for the 30 constituencies going to the polls in the first phase in West Bengal.Leaving no stone unturned to secure its maiden victory in the state, the BJP on Thursday unleashed a battery of leaders in West Bengal for campaigning, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.Actor Mithun Chakraborty held roadshows in four constituencies — Jhargram, Saltora, Chhatna and Raipur.In Assam, polling is being held under the shadow of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The BJP, which has partnered with the AGP in Assam, is fighting to retain power in the northeastern state. Even though the BJP manifesto for Assam is silent on the CAA, the All Assam Students Union has accused the BJP of planning to implement CAA in Assam and has appealed to voters to shun BJP. The Congress has forged an alliance with parties like AIUDF, CPI, CPM, CPI (ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha and Bodoland People’s Front and mounted a challenge to BJP in Assam.Didi took WB back to 19th century: RajnathJoypur (WB): Accusing CM Mamata Banerjee of “taking back Bengal to the 19th century, with no development work undertaken in the past 10 years”, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the TMC dispensation, just like its predecessor, the Left Front, has wronged the people of the state.

However, I feel the revival of economic activity will continue unabated. —Shaktikanta Das, RBI Governor“Pan-India total cases in the second wave are expected in the order of 25 lakh. Considering the number of days from the current level of daily infections to the peak level during the first wave of the pandemic, India might reach the peak in the second half of April,” the SBI document notes.The report also places India at a better position compared to the world to address the second wave with vaccinations already gathering pace.The document says hastening the pace of inoculation is the only way to fight the pandemic. The report comes at a time when several states, especially Maharashtra, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, are returning to localised restrictions.The Prime Minister in his recent engagement with the CMs had also advocated imposition of micro containment strategy to break the chain of transmission of infections. Citing a study in respect of the Spanish flu of 1918, the SBI report says even the Great Pandemic Flu study findings revealed that accelerated implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, closure of schools, theatres can help reduce transmission but the viral spread will renew once the measures are relaxed.The report takes note of the top 10 highest active burden districts of India, nine of them in Maharashtra and one in Karnataka. The report also says bank credit and deposits have looked up in February 2021 after declines earlier this year.Brakes on Vaccine Maitri as cases rise The surge in infections and expanding the vaccine drive at home led South Block to put the brakes on its major diplomatic initiative Vaccine Maitri. However, India has so far maintained its commitment of supplying the vaccines to vulnerable sections with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar announcing the dispatch of two lakh doses for UN peacekeepers.

The demand had become stronger after Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla tested positive for Covid-19.After Question Hour in the Lok Sabha, Congress MP Ravneet Singh said, “The Budget session is going on… the entire country is watching.

Noting that the structures of Indian society have been created by males for males, the SC directed the Centre and the Army to remove the requirement of benchmarking the SSCWOs with the last male officer who had received permanent commission in their corresponding batches.Patriarchal systemThe structures of our society have been created by males and for males. As a result, certain structures that may appear to be harmless, are a reflection of the insidious patriarchal system. —SC Bench“We must recognise that the structures of our society have been created by males and for males. As a result, certain structures that may seem to be the ‘norm’ and may appear to be harmless, are a reflection of the insidious patriarchal system,” it noted.“A facially equal application of laws to unequal parties is a farce, when the law is structured to cater to a male standpoint,” the Bench said.The verdict came on petitions filed by women officers seeking compliance of its 2020 directions to the Centre for grant of permanent commission, promotions and consequential benefits to them.“It is not enough to proudly state that women officers are allowed to serve the nation in the Armed Forces, when the true picture of their service conditions tells a different story. A superficial sense of equality is not in the true spirit of the Constitution and attempts to make equality only symbolic,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/systemic-bias-in-criteria-for-womens-permanent-commission-says-sc-230416

26-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai ex-CP Param Bir moves HC against Deshmukh, raises ‘corruption in transfers’ issue too||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court seeking a CBI probe against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who he claimed asked police officer Sachin Vaze to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.The PIL also raised the issue of alleged corruption in police transfers and postings in the state.The IPS officer had earlier this week approached the Supreme Court, which on Wednesday termed the matter as quite serious but asked him to approach the High Court.Read also: Vaze’s NIA custody extended till April 3; says he was made scapegoatThe criminal Public Interest Litigation reiterated the allegations Singh had made earlier and sought an “immediate, unbiased, impartial” probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation against Deshmukh, an NCP leader.Singh sought an HC direction to the CBI to secure CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence from earlier this year before it was “destroyed,” and to the state government to produce all records of communication received from IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in March 2020.In February last year, Shukla had levelled allegations of malpractises in police postings and transfers against Deshmukh and also informed her superiors about it, but soon afterwards she was transferred, alleged the PIL.The court should pass directions to ensure that in future police officials are not transferred on account of “pecuniary benefits to any politician”, it said.Opposition BJP earlier this week alleged that Shukla, when she was state intelligence commissioner, had intercepted phone calls and gathered evidence of corruption in police transfers.The PIL claimed that last month Deshmukh had asked some police officials including Vaze (who was later arrested in the Ambani security scare case) to collect Rs 100 crore every month, including Rs 40-50 crore from around 1,750 bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Singh had made this allegation first in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Deshmukh has denied the allegation.The PIL also alleged that Deshmukh interfered in investigations and pressurised him to implicate BJP leaders in the case of alleged suicide of Dadra Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar.The former Mumbai police commissioner also accused Deshmukh of indulging in “corrupt malpractices” in transfers and postings of police officers.Singh apprised chief minister Thackeray of these allegations, but “immediately thereafter, on March 17” he was shunted out to the Home Guards Department without allowing him to complete the “minimum fixed tenure of two years”, he said.Later Desmukh said in an interview that Singh’s colleagues made serious lapses in the investigation of the recovery of explosives-laden vehicle near Mukesh Ambani’s house.However, there were five other senior officers between him and assistant police inspector Vaze who were also handling the probe, and all necessary assistance was given by his office, Singh claimed.He filed this PIL as these issues have a direct bearing on the administration, the petition said.The PIL is likely to be taken up for hearing by a bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta next week.

26-03-2021||Mumbai||‘Second Covid wave to peak in mid-April, to see 25 lakh cases’: SBI report||With the nation under the grip of the second wave of COVID-19 infections since last month, a report on Thursday called for faster vaccination as a more effective way to beat it and not lockdowns as was done last year.Lockdown is ineffective and mass vaccination is the only hope as localised lockdowns have not resulted in controlling the spread of infection. Therefore, increasing the speed of vaccination is the only way to win the battle against the pandemic, SBI’s Group Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in the report.Total cases in the second wave across the country will be around 25 lakh, he said. Considering the number of days from the current level of daily new cases to the peak level during the first wave, we may peak in the second half of April and the entire duration of the second wave may last up to 100 days beginning February 15, he said.When the whole nation was locked down this day last year, the total number of cases was not even 500 and as the lockdowns were extended, the number of infections just soared.Citing the example of many states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, he said lockdowns were not effective. Studies on the Great Spanish Flu of 1918-19 show that rapid implementation of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions, including closure of schools, churches, and theatres, can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will only be renewed on relaxation of such measures.Similarly, in none of the most affected districts across the major states, the lockdowns failed to contain either infections or the death rates.Also, Google Mobility data shows that mobility has declined in many states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh after new localised lockdowns were clamped, but the infection level has only gone up in these states.He also predicts that this will be end of the pandemic as the vaccination gathers speed and sees the total cases in the second wave across the country to be around 25 lakh, citing the infection trends till March 23.On Wednesday, close to 53,500 new infections were reported across the nation. In just two days the count topped 1 lakh, taking the total caseload to 1.18 crore since late last January when the first case was reported in Kerala.Considering the number of days from the current level of daily new cases to the peak level during the first wave, we may peak in the second half of April and the entire duration of the second wave may last up to 100 days beginning February 15, he said.Calling for faster and increased inoculations, the report notes that Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala, Uttarakhand and Haryana have vaccinated over 20 per cent of their elderly population (above 60 years), while several states with higher elderly population like Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bengal have vaccinated much less.Assuming more number of people are willing to take the shots and the daily inoculation jumps to 40-45 lakh from the current 34 lakh, then with this capacity the population above 45 years can be vaccinated in four months from now, the report said.Citing the presence of the vaccines, he also discounted the second wave of infections which so far has been more intense and fatal in most countries as these are caused by many mutated strains of the coronavirus.Though the second wave is much higher in intensity than the first wave, the presence of vaccine makes the difference currently. Thus, we will be able to manage the situation better, he said.Caseloads have again started increasing in top 15 districts, mostly urban, while the spread in rural districts is mostly stable and cases are largely localised and concentrated.

26-03-2021||New Delhi||Caste-based reservations may go, but it's for Parliament to decide: SC||All caste-based reservations may go and only those meant for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) may remain, the Supreme Court said on Thursday even as it clarified that it was a radical idea and a policy matter to be decided by the government and Parliament.On the ninth day of hearing on revising the 1992 Mandal case, advocate Shriram P Pingle submitted before a five-judge Constitution Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan on behalf of SCBC Welfare Association that an endeavour should be made to remove caste-based reservations in a phased manner because the issue was getting politicised.“That is for Parliament and the legislature to consider. It is a welcome idea... When the Constitution was enacted, the object was a caste-less, egalitarian society…Your thoughts are very radical and good. But it is for the government to take a decision that caste and reservations should go,” the Bench said.It said, “Mr Pingle you may be right. This may be a beginning, all reservations may go and only EWS (reservation) may remain. But these are policy matters,” it noted.Noting that affirmative action was not limited to reservation alone, the top court had on Monday said states should take additional steps to promote education and establish institutions for the upliftment of socially and educationally backward classes (SEBS).“Why can’t other things be done. Why not promote education and establish more institutes? Somewhere this matrix has to move beyond reservation. Affirmative action is not just reservation,” it had noted.The Bench—which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat – had last week sought to know if there was no limit to quota what would happen to the concept of equality. “What about the resultant inequality? How many generations will you continue...?” it had asked.The Bench is considering whether the nine-judge Bench verdict in the Indira Sawhney (Mandal) case which fixed 50% ceiling for quota in government jobs and admission to educational institutions should be revisited by a larger Bench in view of subsequent constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/caste-based-reservations-may-go-but-its-for-parliament-to-decide-sc-230408

So far it had restricted vaccination to those above 60 and those above 45 with co-morbidities besides frontline workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-maitri-under-scanner-but-india-to-meet-un-commitments-230405
26-03-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Chicago city resolution against caste crimes in India falls||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 25Some spirited footwork by Indian-American businessmen and diplomats from the Indian consulate in Chicago stemmed the tide of resolutions criticising the Modi Government’s policies being passed by city councils in America.A proposed resolution expressing the Chicago City Council’s solidarity with its South Asian community “regardless of religion and caste” failed on Wednesday.The proposal fell by a 26-18 vote with several abstentions, which US analysts said was a tight call for a nonbinding resolution.Several American cities, including Riverdale (Illinois), San Francisco, Seattle, Albany (New York), and St Paul (Minnesota), passed resolutions last year condemning the state violence in India.The resolution, introduced by Maria Hadden, led to both sides of the Indian-American community getting involved in vigorous lobbying and reports said there was active assistance from Indian diplomats posted in the US. The US Ambassador to India Taranjit Sandhu is an old American hand having served there for over a decade in several postings.Haddin hinted at the involvement of Indian diplomats. “There were some concerns, hinted at by the Consul General, that maybe this would damage some relationships with the city. I’m uncertain if this has happened before but it’s not typical,’’ she said.The resolution meant to condemn violence against certain castes and religious minorities in India.But some Chicago council members, including George Cardenas, did not want to get involved in matters 8,000 miles away. “If we take this on, why not take on the Chinese ethnic cleansing debate? We are a global city, I consider us a global city. But we have many pressing issues here at home that need our attention,” asked Cardenas.Earlier, the Seattle City Council had passed a unanimous resolution criticising the CAA and NRC. Introduced by Kshama Sawant, an Indian-American member of the City Council, it had called upon Parliament to uphold the Constitution by repealing the CAA. It has also urged India to press the stop button on the NRC and come to the aid of refugees by taking the United Nations route and ratifying the relevant treaties.In both instances the opponents had said such resolutions needlessly sow division within Chicago’s Indian-American community. The supporters argued that the latest resolution was a symbol of solidarity “with Chicago’s South Asian community regardless of religion and caste”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chicago-city-resolution-against-caste-crimes-in-india-falls-230402
26-03-2021||New Delhi||'Bharat Bandh': Rail, road transport likely to be affected in parts of country||Rail and road transportation services are likely to be affected and markets may remain closed in parts of the country on Friday as farmer unions protesting against the three agri laws have called a complete 'Bharat Bandh', even as it will not be observed in four poll-bound states and Puducherry.According to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the nationwide shutdown will start at 6 am, and it will be in force up to 6 pm across the country on March 26 which marks four months of the farmer agitation on Delhi's three borders—Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri.Senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said that road and rail transport will be blocked, claiming that markets will also remain closed.The Morcha, which is an umbrella body of protesting farm unions, said that the 'bandh' will also be observed in the National Capital.Rajewal said that trade unions from organised and unorganised sectors, and transport and other associations have extended their support for the 'Bharat Bandh' call of farmer organisations on March 26."Farmers will block rail tracks in various places. Markets and transport services will be closed during 'Bharat Bandh'," Rajewal told PTI.He said that however, emergency services like ambulance and fire will be allowed during the nationwide shutdown.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for the minimum support price on their crops.Also read: Farmers prepared for a long haul, will relent only when demands met: Rakesh TikaitConfederation of All India Traders, which claimed representation of eight crore traders in the the country, said that markets will remain open on March 26 as it is not participating in the 'Bharat Bandh'."We are not going to participate in 'Bharat Bandh' tomorrow. Markets will remain open in Delhi and other parts of the country. The ongoing deadlock can be resolved only through a dialogue process. There should be discussions on amendments to the farm laws that can make existing farming profitable," CAIT's national general secretary Praveen Khandelwal told PTI.Farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar, who is also senior member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, said that the major impact of the 'Bharat Bandh' will be felt in Haryana and Punjab.Kohar said that farmers have appealed to trader associations to close their shops during the nationwide shutdown as the three new agri laws will also affect them indirectly.The farmer leader said that in poll-bound Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Puducherry, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has appealed to people to not observe 'Bandh' there.So far, there have been 11 rounds of talks between the protesting unions and government, but deadlock continued as both sides stuck to their stand.In January, the government had offered to suspend the farm laws for 12-18 months, which was rejected by the farmer unions. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-bandh-rail-road-transport-likely-to-be-affected-in-parts-of-country-230371

26-03-2021||New Delhi||Parliament adjourned sine die two weeks ahead of schedule due to assembly elections||The Parliament was on Thursday adjourned sine die with the Budget Session cut short by 14 days on the account of assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Puducherry.The second leg of the session which started on March 8 was scheduled to end on April 8.In view of the ongoing campaign for assembly elections in four states and the Union Territory of Puducherry, floor leaders and members of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha had urged the government to curtail the sittings of the session.The demand had become more vociferous after Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla tested positive for COVID-19.Interestingly today, soon after the Question Hour got over in the Lok Sabha, Congress’ Ravneet Singh raised the issue related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, telling the Treasury Benches “aap pradhan mantriji ke darshan karva dijiye”.  “I want to ask two things…the Budget Session is going on…the whole country is watching. Should we meet the prime minister in a West Bengal rally? Number two, we have passed so many Bills in this session but there has been no discussion on (LPG) cylinders, roofs for the poor…reducing the price of oil (petrol/diesel),” he said amid objections from the members of the ruling party. Meanwhile, as Minister of State of Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal was telling Ravneet Bittu that this was “not correct as the prime minister had been attending” the proceedings, the prime minister walked in the House. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and several Cabinet ministers were present during the valedictory speech.In his valedictory speech, presiding officer in Lok Sabha, Bhartruhari Mahtab said 18 Bills were passed and 17 introduced in the House.Important legislations like Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill 2021, Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021, Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021, National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill 2021, Marine Aids to Navigation Bill, 2021, National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Bill, 2021, Finance Bill 2021, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill 2021 among others were passed.The productivity of the Lok Sabha stood at 114 per cent during the Budget Session, members worked till midnight to dispose off important matters and 146 MPs participated in the discussion on the Union Budget, he said.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the Upper House functioned for a total of 104 hours as against the total scheduled time of 116 hours.“Against a total of 33 sittings scheduled, from January 29 to April 8, we are concluding it after having 23 sittings,” he said. The Budget Session provided the members of this House an opportunity to deliberate issues concerning economic growth and recovery particularly in the post COVID-19 phase, Naidu said.In a media briefing, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi later said the session was curtailed due to demands raised by the members due to the ensuing major elections in various states.The Budget Session was highly productive due to the cooperation of parliamentarians from all parties, he said, adding that 18 Bills were passed by both the Houses. While the Lok Sabha cleared 18 Bills, the Rajya Sabha gave nod to 19 legislations. As many as 20 Bills were introduced in both the Houses. Three Bills had been sent to the Standing Committee for further deliberation. They include the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Bill 2021, the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-adjourned-sine-die-two-weeks-ahead-of-schedule-due-to-assembly-elections-230304
26-03-2021||---||Grant permanent commission to women officers within a month, SC tells Army||New Delhi, March 25The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Army to consider granting permanent commission to women officers within a month and allow permanent commission for those eligible within two months after following the due process.It said all women officers fulfilling the grade of 60 per cent shall be entitled to grant of permanent commission subject to medical criteria.Rejecting the existing benchmarking formula, it also tweaked the medical criteria.The Army's benchmarking for ACRs was discriminatory and arbitrary as it worked to the disadvantage of the women officers opting for permanent commission, it noted.Delivered by a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud, the order is likely to benefit more than 150 women officers."The structures of our society has been created by males for males, equality is a farce if this doesn't change and women get equal opportunity," Justice Chandrachud said."These women officers don't come to this court for a charity but implore to give them the right to equality," said the top court, noting that its 2020 judgment for grant of permanent commission to women officers hasn't been implemented properly by the Army.Women officers who were excluded in November 2020 based on Shape 1 Fitness are entitled to continue as Permanent Commissioned force till they fulfill the fitness criteria needed for continuance in service, the top court said.Most of these woman officers were denied permanent commission on the ground of fitness standards.It held that applying the Shape 1 Fitness rule to women officers would be arbitrary."Superficial face of equality will not be in consonance with the principles enshrined in the Constitution," the top court said.It said women officers who were excluded from permanent commission in November 2020 based on non-compliance with Shape 1 Fitness standards are entitled to continue as permanent commissioned force till they fulfill the Fitness criteria needed for continuance in service."Army says medical category has been applied by taking age related factors into account. However, discrimination and exclusion is there in this application. When similarly, aged male PC officers do not have to maintain SHAPE 1 Fitness now when granted PC earlier," it said.It rejected the Centre's contention that such additional standards were set since the usual upper limit of 250 permanent commissions a year was not followed this time in view of its landmark judgment delivered last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/grant-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-within-a-month-sc-tells-army-230291
