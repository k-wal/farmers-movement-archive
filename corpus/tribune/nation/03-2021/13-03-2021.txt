13-03-2021||New Delhi||Quad summit may kill visions of `Asian Century'||The Quad may or may not gravitate to a higher calling in joint cooperation such as emerging technologies but it may have snuffed out the visions of an “Asian Century” envisaged by non-western leaning strategists in Asia. Proponents of this outlook suggest that the era of Western domination since the 19th and 20th centuries is ending and the time has come for the resurgence of AsiaOptimists like Kishore Mehbubani still hold the view that the pandemic will consolidate Asia’s dominance in world affairs and the global economy and their deference to Western societies will be replaced by respect for East Asia and India. But with India and China now pulling in different directions after the Galwan Valley clash of June 15, the part of Asia extending eastwards of India may be at the mercy of external powers.With the impressive economic growth of China, India and that of Southeast Asian countries, scholars had started talking about 21centruy as an Asian century, agrees Dhanajay Tripathi, an expert on international relations at South Asia University.“The Quad Summit is the first concrete step in killing the dream of the ‘Asian Century’—strategic competition in Asia as of now appears unavoidable.  Although the key is still with India and China, provided both are willing to resolve their bilateral issues peacefully,” he observes.The Asian Century is about a united Asia dominating world politics.  In the past, both India and China showed a willingness to strengthen their ties. While trade between the two improved over the years, the border dispute remained unresolved. Moreover, the Chinese aggressive posture towards India last summer broke the illusion that there will only be healthy competition between the two.“When India-China political relations remain tense, the Quad summit brings India close to powers interested in checking China’s rise. With India- China going in different directions and most likely entering into a strategic competition, the dream of the Asian century is difficult to see the light of the day. With Western powers again getting involved in Asia, the concept of the Asian century will lose its attractiveness,” he observes.Quad has a hard task at hand convincing other world community members that its exertions are in the right direction. Of the 10 ASEAN nations directly impacted by the China-US tussle in South China Sea, over three-fourths have opted to sit on the sidelines. One of the items in the Quad’s bucket-list after the advent of the new US administration is the task of ‘promoting democracy’. This would make some of these countries more wary as this term has in the past been the code for removing inconvenient autocrats in different parts of the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-summit-may-kill-visions-of-asian-century-224739
13-03-2021||London||India’s role as world’s pharmacy phenomenal, says UK Foreign Office minister||The role that India has played during the course of the coronavirus pandemic as the pharmacy of the world has been phenomenal, UK minister Lord Tariq Ahmad said as he prepared for a five-day, five-city tour of India starting on Monday.Lord Ahmad, the minister for South Asia in the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), highlighted the close collaboration between the two countries on ensuring supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, which benefits countries across the globe through the United Nations-led COVAX facility.“The role that India has played as the pharmacy of the world has been phenomenal,” said Lord Ahmad, during a pre-visit virtual interview on Friday.“Our relationship with India is not just one of bilateral importance, it’s also about how these two countries are working together and there’s no better illustration than the current COVID-19 pandemic which grips us. The strong collaboration we have seen between the UK and India in responding across the world, including through the COVAX facility which is helping the more vulnerable countries in the world,” he said.“Equally, we are looking forward to further cooperation with India in its tenure as a Security Council member. Environment and climate change, healthcare, technology – the relationship between the UK and India is an important one across all these sectors and more,” he added.Lord Ahmad’s visit kicks off with ministerial meetings in Delhi and then covers Chandigarh, Chennai and Hyderabad before he flies back to the UK following trade and investment talks in Mumbai.The minister said the tour would very much be “touching upon the important matters” of the planning for the visit of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which is expected in the coming weeks to finalise the much-anticipated UK-India Enhanced Trade Partnership.Johnson’s visit to India is set to be followed up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the UK in June for the G7 Summit in Cornwall, where India is one of the guest countries invited by host-nation Britain.“My very intensive and full programme reflects the incredible diversity that is India, and all its fantastic and incredible states and reflects the wide nature of the relationship and the bilateral engagement we have with one of our close partners,” said the minister, whose father’s roots trace back to Punjab and mother’s to Rajasthan.The visit will also coincide with the release of the UK’s major foreign policy statement in the form of an Integrated Review next week, which is widely expected to confirm Britain’s decisive Indo-Pacific tilt in a post-Brexit era.“It can be taken as read in as much as government policy is concerned, there is a very strong belief and focus on the Indo-Pacific tilt and it’s right we do so. When you look at the countries within that part of the region, India is foremost in our minds,” Ahmad said.Though the visit comes against the backdrop of a UK parliamentary committee room debate on the issue of farmers’ protests against India’s agricultural reforms earlier this week, the minister ruled out the issue in any way overshadowing his itinerary because the British government’s longstanding stance on the matter has been clear.“We’ve always been consistently clear on matters such as these protests, it’s an internal matter,” he said.India had strongly reacted to the debate as “gross interference in the politics of another democratic country”, after which foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had even summoned British High Commissioner to the UK Alex Ellis, a meeting Lord Ahmad described as “very cordial”.“Our position as a government is that the protests have been taking place for several months now and India as a democracy has totally guaranteed and secured the right to protest, which we fully acknowledge… There have been occasions where people have sought to disrupt those protests and that should be dealt with in accordance with the rule of law,” he said.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.The Indian government has denied allegations that it was trying to put an end to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the ‘mandi’ system. Multiple rounds of talks between the government and farmer unions have been held in order to try and resolve the deadlock.India has maintained that the protests by farmers must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity.

Saturday was the first day. He dwelt on the nuances of the Rules and norms, protocols, formats relating to both the ‘Starred’ and ‘Unstarred’ questions, which are legislative instruments to make the executive accountable to the legislature in a functional democracy.His tutelary lessons were pepped up with narration of his practical experiences of situations, which were lateral and not available in the Rule Book of Procedure.Dwelling on the dissuasive tactics resorted to by ministers, Gujral said they would preface the answers by appreciating the questions.He said that there have been instances in the long past of Cabinet Ministers landing at the residence of Members early morning of the day their questions were listed in the Question Hour urging them to absent themselves from Parliament."Many reputations have been made and unmade by the nature of questions," Gujral said. “Ministers have lost their jobs because they could not answer the questions well.”He advised new MPs to have a sense of humour, which would add more punch and finesse to their style and diction of their questions.He urged them never to disrupt proceedings as it distracts and impinges on the time of the precious Question Hour."Question Hours is the liveliest part of Parliamentary proceedings."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naresh-gujrals-message-to-new-mps-dont-be-taken-in-by-ministers-224722

Many more nations are seeking the vaccines, and these are not little-known nations...Canada, Brazil and other developed countries are using Indian vaccines with a great zeal,” he said.“More than half a dozen vaccines are going to come up,” he said.“Till Saturday morning, 1.84 crore vaccine shots have been given in the country and 20 lakh people were inoculated yesterday,” the minister added.He was speaking while inaugurating the new green campus of the National Institute of Research in Environmental Health near here.Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to create a new India to turn it into a ‘vishwa guru’ (world leader), he added.“Respect science. There is a need to end politics over it (vaccine) given that it is a scientific fight not a political one. That is why we should work unitedly,” Vardhan said.The efforts of our scientists are praiseworthy as due to their labour we have achieved all this. Year 2020, apart from being a COVID-19 year, will be remembered as the year of science and scientists, he added.He said that initially there was only one laboratory in India for COVID-19 testing. “But we have 2,412 testing facilities now,” he added.“We were the first in the world to isolate the coronavirus. We isolated its mutation. And our scientists helped the ICMR in vaccine. People have praised it (vaccine).Some people tried to create confusion, but truth is unbeatable,” he said.Talking about the rising infection cases, the minister said this “disturbing trend” was due to the carelessness and misunderstanding.“People think that as the vaccine has come and all is well now,” he said, while urging them to follow the COVID-19 rules for protection against the virus. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-six-covid-19-vaccines-in-offing-in-india-harsh-vardhan-224698

It’s our country. We may have political differences. We oppose each other. But at the same fine when the country is concerned we should not do anything or talk anything which will damage the country’s image which our enemies will use and say this has been said in Indian parliament,” Naidu said as new MPs, including Congress’ Shakti Sinh Gohil, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, BJD’s Sasmit Patra among others listened.The Vice-President said MPs shouldn’t give such scope to enemies with their utterances because “unity, integrity, safety and security of nation is vital for all and not concerned with the ruling or opposition parties.”Naidu also said that in Parliament the MPs should not take recourse to religion, region, caste, colour and shouldn’t try to bring divisions on these lines.Taking a swipe at the Oxford University where an Indian student leader had to step down from the position of Oxford University Union Presidency Naidu said “a student leader had to resign from Oxford University position due to racial discrimination. These things are happening in mature democracies. We must avoid these things.”He told MPs that they can argue for justice for different sections but should always remember that irrespective of recourse to caste, creed, sex, religion and region we are Indians.“We are Bharatiyas. We must remember that and act accordingly. There is nothing wrong in championing the cause of region or language, nothing wrong in pointing out injustice in a particular religion and nothing wrong in speaking in a particular language but these divisions should not be brought to Parliament,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shouldnt-say-anything-that-damages-nations-reputation-that-enemies-can-use-naidu-tells-new-mps-224679

The outcome of this fight will determine if a common man, who can't afford high-profile lawyers and is scared of walking into a police station will get justice against these white-collar robbers," Kaul said."In this New India, propelling on self-reliance and the prime minister's vision and call of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, justice will be done and not delayed. The law shall see the accused appropriately sentenced for their crimes," Kaul said.Kaul said he had sent an email about the storyline of his book to Kangana, and she used some part of the story in a tweet while announcing her movie without his permission."Is it believable by any stretch of imagination that a story and a book are usurped by a renowned actor-turned-social activist?" he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-ranaut-in-legal-trouble-again-as-author-files-cheating-case-against-her-over-copyright-violation-224678

This will apply to all government - central, state, UT, PSUs, municipal bodies & autonomous bodies," the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways said in a tweet.The development comes close on heels of the voluntary vehicle scrapping policy announced in the Union Budget on February 1 for 2021-22 which provides for fitness test after 20 years for personal vehicles while commercial vehicles would require it after the completion of 15 years.Notification of the draft rules has been issued to this effect on March 12 by the ministry seeking comments, objections and suggestions from the stakeholders within thirty days.The certificate of registration shall not be renewed after the laps of 15 years for government vehicles, it said.Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 had announced vehicle scrapping policy.Road, Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gadkari had said that initially one crore vehicles will go for scrapping and the policy will lead to new investments of around Rs 10,000 crore and create as many as 50,000 jobs.These old vehicles are estimated to cause 10-12 times more pollution than the latest vehicles.The government had earlier said it plans to impose green tax on old polluting vehicles soon in a bid to protect the environment and curb pollution while vehicles like strong hybrids, electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol and LPG will be exempted. The revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution.Under the scheme, transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10-25 per cent of road tax, as per green tax proposal sent to states for consultations after cleared by the ministry.

13-03-2021||New Delhi||May not be new wave yet, vaccination plus Covid protocol key to quell surge in cases: Scientists||With India recording the highest number of daily novel coronavirus cases in 83 days on Saturday, the country could be heading towards a new wave that scientists say can be quelled by vaccinating the maximum number of people and following COVID-appropriate behaviour.The Union Health Ministry reported 24,882 fresh COVID-19 infections, up from 23,285 the day earlier and in keeping with a graph steadily inching upwards. This is the highest daily rise since December 20 when 26,624 new infections were recorded.As red flags went up, the jury was out on whether it constituted a new wave of the pandemic. Scientists grappled with the why and how of the surge in cases but were agreed that adherence to COVID-19 protocols and escalating the vaccination drive to cover more people were necessary to control the rising trajectory of the disease.Anurag Agarwal, director of the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said scientists at his institute are trying to understand if the rise in cases is due to more-transmissible variants of the virus or due to a lapse in precautionary measures followed by people. Though there is no clarity if a new wave of the pandemic is currently underway, some things are certain."COVID appropriate behaviour and vaccination remain our best ways to stop the pandemic," Agarwal told PTI.There could possibly be a silver line somewhere. According to Monica Gulati, senior dean and head of faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, India's rising curve is not very high unlike other countries where new strains have been found, indicating that the prevalent strain is not very infectious.She also said the current rise in reported coronavirus infections could be due to the spread of new variants as well as the casual attitude of the general public.          Gulati explained that the current surge in cases "is very well separated and shows a less steep rise from the previous ones indicating a change in the causative factor"."While in countries where the new strains are found to be more lethal than the original strains, the new wave is much steeper and higher as compared to the previous one. In India, the slope of the rising curve is not very high as yet which may be attributed to a number of factors, including a break in the propagation chain due to high rate of vaccination and low infectivity of the prevalent strain," Gulati told PTI.           Other scientists took a grimmer view of the situation.The seven-day average of new cases of infection has risen by 67 per cent in India -- from 10,988 cases a day for the week leading to February 11, to 18,371 average daily cases for the week ending on Wednesday.     The positivity rate, which is the fraction of coronavirus tests conducted across the country that are positive for infection, has also been steadily increasing over the last month.        ‘While it was only 1.6 per cent for the week leading to February 14, currently 2.6 per cent of all tested samples are positive for the coronavirus infection -- a rise by one whole percentage point within a month.Rakesh Mishra, director of the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB), warned that there could be a new wave if the current trends continue and new homegrown variants of the virus may emerge."There is a possibility of another wave. Right now this is happening already in a couple of states, including Maharashtra, in a major way. But this is avoidable with exceptional advisory and continuation of COVID appropriate behaviour," Mishra told PTI."Currently the rise in cases is happening in multiple cities, across states, and it doesn't look like a new variant is responsible for all these surges but one common feature in all these places is lack of COVID appropriate behaviour. And if this continues, it may even lead to new variants emerging in India," he added.Virologist Upasana Ray concurred that it may be too early to say if a second wave is currently underway but said the trends definitely point to a localised surge.        "Although it may or may not turn out to be a second wave, we should consider it a potential concern and be prepared for the worst," Ray, a senior scientist with CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, told PTI.          "We hear about new variants. Whether or not any of them is responsible, that part is not established yet. However, keeping an eye on home grown mutants would be important," she added.Ray said there is widespread pandemic fatigue, due to which people are no longer following COVID-19 appropriate behavior like masking up, social distancing, and maintaining hygiene as they did earlier.The need of the hour is to revisit compliance with safety measures at all public places, she said. "Then comes expediting vaccinations so that the immunity is achieved faster in the population and localised surges could die off due to decreased transmission rate. Also, rigorous screening and isolation are still important for keeping a check," the virologist added. Till 7 pm Thursday, over 2.6 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered across the country. These included 72,16,759 (72.16 lakh) healthcare workers (HCWs) who have taken the first dose and 40,48,754 (40.48 lakh) HCWs who have taken the second dose, according to the Union Health Ministry.Given the current rate of vaccination, Agarwal said, it would take a while for the country to build herd immunity, which is when a significant portion of the population builds immunity against the coronavirus and stops its chain of transmission.The need of the hour, Gulati said, is to dispel fear and scepticism among the general population with regard to vaccination.   "As the vaccines being administered in India have been found to be both safe and effective, people must demonstrate their willingness to get vaccinated, especially the vulnerable groups," she added."Since vaccination is voluntary and available at the rate of Rs 250 per jab, the onus is now on people to voluntarily get vaccinated to break the vicious cycle of infection."         In her view, the current focus should be on ensuring that the maximum number of eligible people are vaccinated and to continue to observe all the precautionary measures till herd immunity is established.The Health Ministry's data notes that six states -- Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu -- continue to report a high number of fresh COVID-19 cases and together account for 85.91 per cent of daily new cases in the country.Expressing concern over the rise in active COVID-19 cases in these states, the Centre has advised people to be "careful and watchful" and not to lower their guard.NITI Aayog member V K Paul earlier this week described the coronavirus situation, especially in Maharashtra, as "worrisome". Paul advised that in districts where COVID-19 cases are seemingly on the rise, vaccination of eligible individuals should be intensified and prioritised.

13-03-2021||San Francisco||Sundar Pichai vs Satya Nadella: Google, Microsoft at 'odds' over digital news industry||Sundar Pichai-run Google has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft, accusing the Satya Nadella-run enterprise of willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.The attack came as Microsoft President Brad Smith, who on Friday issued a testimony to the House Committee on the Judiciary looking into antitrust and commercial aspects of competition for a free and diverse press, and slammed Google for hampering the growth of news organisations."News organisations have ad inventory to sell, but they can no longer sell directly to those who want to place ads," Smith said in a statement."Instead, for all practical purposes, they must use Google's tools, operate on Google's ad exchanges, contribute data to Google's operations, and pay Google money. All this impacts the ability of news organisations to benefit economically even from advertising on their own sites," Smith noted.Kent Walker, Google's head of global affairs, hit back late on Friday, saying this latest attack marks a return to Microsoft's long-time practices."It's no coincidence that Microsoft's newfound interest in attacking us comes on the heels of the SolarWinds attack and at a moment when they've allowed tens of thousands of their customers to be actively hacked via major Microsoft vulnerabilities," Walker said in a statement."They are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival. And their claims about our business and how we work with news publishers are just plain wrong," he added.Google and Microsoft are at odds over whether publishers should have more control over a digital ad industry dominated by the search giant and Facebook.In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia in response to the News Media Bargaining Code that would force the company to pay news publishers for their content.Australia passed the law last month and Microsoft is out in full support of the law, slamming both Google and Facebook.Walker said that Microsoft is the second-largest company in the US but "their track record is spotty"."They have paid out a much smaller amount to the news industry than we have. And given the chance to support or fund their own journalists, Microsoft replaced them with AI bots," he argued."Microsoft's attempts at distraction aside, we'll continue to collaborate with news organisations and policymakers around the world to enable a strong future for journalism".On Friday, a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the way Google and Facebook distribute news, and a new bill introduced earlier this week has already found Republican support. It's one of the biggest legislative threats to tech that's come out of the years-long antitrust debate, and much of its political force comes from the precarious state of local journalism."The crisis in American journalism has become a real crisis in our democracy and civic life," Cicilline said in his opening remarks Friday.The fight between two tech giants came as the US is debating a new bill, introduced earlier this week, that would allow news organisations to collectively negotiate with platforms like Facebook and Google the terms in which their content is distributed online. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sundar-pichai-vs-satya-nadella-google-microsoft-at-odds-over-digital-news-industry-224644

13-03-2021||Washington||US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Rajnath Singh to discuss ways to operationalise major defence partnership: Pentagon||US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh next week in India and discuss ways to operationalise the major defence partnership that the two countries have, according to a top Pentagon official.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years and in June 2016, the US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner”.The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.Austin will be in India next week, after his stops in Japan and South Korea. This is for the first time that a US defence secretary is travelling to India on his maiden overseas trip. It will also be the first in-person visit by a top official of the Biden administration to India.“In India, he'll meet with Minister Rajnath Singh and others to discuss operationalising the major defence partnership that we have with India, including through enhanced information sharing, regional security cooperation, defence trade, and cooperation in new domains,” Acting Assistant Secretary of Defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs David F Helvey told reporters during a conference call.  In New Delhi, the Ministry of Defence said US Secretary of Defence Austin will visit India from March 19 to 21.India, he said, is an important strategic partnership that involves cooperation with like minded nations committed to protecting the rules-based international order.Helvey said that the travel to India, will provide an opportunity for exchange of views early on with key allies and partners about how they can work together and expand cooperation to support a rules-based international order, and continue developments of these critical relationships which enable them to do that.Austin's visit to India will take place a week after the maiden virtual Quad summit between US President Joe Biden, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.The four leaders in a joint statement on Friday said that they brought diverse perspectives and were united in a shared vision for the free and open Indo-Pacific. "We strive for a region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion," the statement said.The Biden administration has made clear the criticality that attaches to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond through engaging with and investing in alliances and partnerships; and strengthening our foundation at home to maintain our innovation edge and to rebuild the industrial base, Helvey said.India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region. The Chinese military is also actively eying the strategic Indian Ocean region to step up Beijing influence.China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea.In 2017, India, Australia, Japan and the US gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the 'Quad' or the Quadrilateral coalition to counter China's aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region.“The upcoming trips by the Secretaries of State and Defence signal the importance of our alliance and partner relationships, which are a real force multiplier in advancing our shared interests in the United States commitment to a rules-based international order, an order that places all nations on a level playing field and holds them responsible for preserving the principles that underpin it,” he said.The Department of Defence, he said, is committed to upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific region where all nations, large and small, are secure in their sovereignty and pursue economic opportunity, resolve disputes without coercion, and have the freedom to navigate and fly consistent with international rules and norms.“At a time when the region is facing mounting pressure from People's Republic of China and the continued threat from North Korean nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, this trip sends an important signal of resolve to work with allies, partners, and like-mindeds to promote a peaceful, stable, and resilient order that benefits us all,” he said.Austin will be joining Secretary Tony Blinken for the Security Consultative Committee meeting, or 2+2, in Japan, the highest platform for alliance management that we have with Japan.“Our alliance is the cornerstone for peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.  In addition to the 2+2, Secretary Austin will meet with Minister Kishi and other officials to discuss the continued transformation of this critical alliance and deepen our interoperability,” he said.“Austin, likewise, will join Secretary Blinken for a 2+2 meeting in the Republic of Korea.  Our alliance with South Korea is the linchpin of peace and stability not only on the Korean Peninsula but across the region,” Helvey told reporters. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-and-rajnath-singh-to-discuss-ways-to-operationalise-major-defence-partnership-pentagon-224638

Even if he was a customer and acquaintance of the deceased, no motive can be attributed to the applicant from the bare reading of the FIR," it said.The ATS, which is probing the case, has recorded Waze's statement earlier this week.Waze, in the plea, said he was questioned extensively by senior officers of the ATS on March 8, during which he said that he was in south Mumbai at the relevant time (when Hiran was allegedly killed)."On March 4 (entire day) the applicant was in South Mumbai.Thereafter during the intervening night between March 4 and 5, the applicant had been in Dongri area.The said fact is duly corroborated from the contemporaneous records such as Station Diary Entries of Dongri Police Station," the plea said."There is a virtual witch-hunt in news and social media casting speculative aspersion regarding the applicants involvement on the basis of half-baked information without proper research, and pre-judging his guilt or innocence," it added.Waze said he was cooperating with the investigation and hence should be protected from arrest.Waze, who was crime branch's Assistant Police Inspector, has been transferred to the Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) unit of Mumbai police.On February 25, a Scorpio was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in south Mumbai with explosives and a threat letter inside.Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV, had claimed that it had been stolen a week earlier, but the case got murky when he was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5.Hiran's wife had claimed that her husband had given the SUV to Waze in November, which the officer returned in the first week of February.During his questioning by the ATS, Waze has denied using the SUV that was in possession of Hiran. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hiran-death-case-cop-sachin-waze-files-pre-arrest-bail-plea-alleges-witch-hunt-224636
