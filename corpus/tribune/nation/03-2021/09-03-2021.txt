09-03-2021||New Delhi||Popular names in science & technology call for ending stereotyping of women||Eminent women leaders in science and technology underlined the need for a change in the mindset of people to end stereotyping of women and give them due respect and recognition.Several panel discussions were held by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) to mark International Women's Day on Monday.Speaking at one such panel discussion, Anita Gupta, Adviser and Head, National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB) urged the women to take charge of their lives.She observed that girls have good secondary school results, but the leaking pipeline at later stages is mainly because of the mindset and attitude towards women.Maan Singh Sidhu, Science, Technology and Higher Education Counsellor, Royal Norwegian Embassy in India, highlighted that women were the half population of the world, and they cannot be out of the science technology ecosystem.“Leadership development programmes, changes in curriculum to attract girls and policy for gender balance in research are some of the ways that could help increase the number of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), and we have implemented these programmes for improvement,” he said.On problems faced by women while breaking into the STI (Science, Technology, Innovation) ecosystem, Tonya Blowers, Programme Coordinator, Organisation for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD), said though efforts are being made at various levels, a lot still needs to be done to encourage women in this field.In another webinar, experts highlighted the need to address the challenges faced by women to increase their participation in science and technology.“Gender inequality is an international issue and needs to be voiced in the larger multilateral and plurilateral platforms. The United Nations theme of this International Women's day – Women in Leadership – needs to be understood both in its context and content,” Sanjay Kumar Verma, Ambassador of India to Japan said.Comparing gender inequality to a bicycle which cannot run on one wheel, Secretary DST, Ashutosh Sharma, said participation of both women and men are necessary for development and progress of the country and society.“Our focus is on creating next-generation role models for women and encouraging women leadership in science, technology, and innovation.“We have launched Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions (GATI), which would help make systemic change at institutional level. We want to create an environment where academia, industry, and R&D labs provide confidence and opportunity to women, encourage women in innovation, start-ups and help them explore their full potential,” he added.In another webinar, former ISRO scientist Anuradha T K shared her journey from a humble middle-class family, being schooled in her mother tongue from a village school to reaching the position of a senior-most female scientist at India's space agency.She talked about the importance of teaching basic principles, including self-respect and freedom of choice, in decision-making.“If you have the passion, you can achieve, but for achieving greater goal, you have to give up on small things. It is only you who can pursue your dreams, nobody else is going to achieve them for you,” she added.     PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/popular-names-in-science-technology-call-for-ending-stereotyping-of-women-222887
09-03-2021||Jajpur (Odisha)||Minor gangraped in Odisha, 4 held||A 17-year-old tribal girl was allegedly gang-raped in Sukinda Chromite valley area in Odisha’s Jajpur district, police said on Tuesday.Four persons have been arrested in connection with the crime, they said.Though the incident took place on Sunday night, the matter came to light on Monday when the girl lodged a complaint at Kaliapani police station.One of the accused has been identified as a cook employed with the Odisha Industrial Security Force (OISF), police said.The minor, a Class-12 student of Duburi, had gone to Brahmanipal area with a male friend to collect scholarship money from a private organisation on Sunday, a police officer said.While they were taking a walk in Kalarangi village on Sunday night, four persons came on two motorcycles, overpowered the girl’s friend and raped her at a nearby spot, he said.She later managed to escape and approached a woman home guard for help, who informed the police about the incident.On the basis of the girl’s complaint, police registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC and the POCSO Act, and arrested the four accused, he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/minor-gangraped-in-odisha-4-held-222886
09-03-2021||New Delhi||Classification for COVID-19 vaccine based on vulnerability to infection: Centre to HC||The Centre on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court that classification of citizens for the purpose of COVID-19 vaccination is based upon most rational and non-arbitrary criteria depending upon their vulnerability to the disease either due to age or nature of work or co-morbidity health situation and it may not be desirable to create a separate class consisting of lawyers and others below 45 years of age.The Centre made the submission in its affidavit filed in response to a PIL initiated by the high court to examine the demand to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers, as “frontline workers” so that they could receive COVID-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition.The government said any specific classification either based upon the nature of trade, profession or otherwise is neither possible nor advisable.                                  It said that in order to achieve the first objective of protecting India’s healthcare and pandemic response system, NEGVAC has prioritised healthcare workers, front line workers (personnel for state and central police department, armed forces, home guard and civil defence organisation including disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, poll officers in election bound states), persons aged 60 years and above and those aged between 45 to 59 years with identified 20 co-morbidities for COVID-19 vaccination.National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) has been established by the government to provide guidance on all aspects of COVID-19 vaccination.The Centre, in its affidavit filed through Central government standing counsel Anil Soni, said the decision to include individuals above 50 years and 60 years in the priority list is based on vulnerability and the mortality risk of this age group for COVID-19 disease.It added that a look at prioritisation criteria for vaccination from World Health Organisation (WHO) and other countries showed that a step-wise layered approach is advisable.The high court is scheduled to hear the matter on Wednesday.Regarding the issue of export of vaccine to other countries, the Centre said once an epidemic takes form of a pandemic, its management has to be done keeping the entire globe as unit and in most circumstances it is not possible to take either states-specific or country-specific approach.“…Hence, export of COVID-19 vaccine which facilitates global action to vaccination is important to simultaneously protect the high-risk population in all the countries of the world, thereby breaking the chain of transmission and minimising chances of import of COVID-19 cases from foreign countries as well as neighbouring countries to India,” it said.On the demand for treating lawyers as frontline workers, the government said any specific classification either based upon the nature of trade, profession or otherwise is neither possible nor advisable.“Though the government has tremendous respect for the profession and the discharge of duties by these professionals for and on behalf of citizens of India and as part of administration of justice, those lawyers and other associates staff who are either above 60 years or between the age group of 45 to 60 years and are having any of the almost exhaustive list of co-morbidities would, in any case, be covered by the on-going vaccine drive,” it said.It added that it may not be desirable to create a separate class consisting of lawyers and others below 45 years of age and discriminating other similarly situated citizens engaged in other professions.“The term ‘frontline workers’ is used only for those citizens who are required to be directly exposed to the COVID-19 infected patients. Thus, it may not be appropriate to discriminate them as against a separate class of lawyers as both are doing their respective duties towards the citizens under similar circumstances,” it said.The high court had on March 4 asked the Centre to explain the rationale behind keeping strict control over class of persons who can be vaccinated against COVID-19 currently as under the present system those above the age of 60 years or with comorbidities can receive vaccination.It had said the two institutes which have developed the vaccines COVISHIELD and COVAXIN—Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech—have more capacity to provide the vaccines but it seems that their full capacity is not being exploited.It had also directed the two institutes to file separate affidavits on their capacity to manufacture the vaccines on per day/ week/ month basis and also the current optic of the vaccines and how much unused capacity is lying.The high court was hearing a PIL initiated by it to examine the demand of Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers as “frontline workers” so that they could receive COVID-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/classification-for-covid-19-vaccine-based-on-vulnerability-to-infection-centre-to-hc-222882

A lockdown won’t be effective in such a situation,” the official said.Officials have, however, warned that if citizens do not follow the COVID-19 protocol, the civic body may be forced to take stringent steps.Speaking to media persons, a senior BMC official said nearly 60 per cent beds are available for COVID-19 patients at city hospitals.The civic body has undertaken the third sero survey in Mumbai and 12,000 samples will be collected from 24-civic wards for this, the official said, adding that a report is expected in two weeks.The COVID-19 immunisation drive is underway at 67 centres, including 24 civic hospitals, four state-run hospitals and 38 private hospitals, the official said.The civic body is planning to increase the number of the vaccination centres to 85, he said.Meanwhile, Mumbai Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh on Tuesday said if COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the city, the possibility of a night curfew or partial lockdown cannot be ruled out.Shaikh said local authorities have been empowered to take a decision on lockdown as and when necessary. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-immediate-lockdown-in-mumbai-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-civic-officials-222872
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Mansukh Hiran’s wife suspects cop’s role in his death, seeks probe||Vimla Hiran, wife of auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran who died mysteriously last week, has alleged in her statement to the ATS that Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze might have killed her husband.On Tuesday, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis also cited her statement in the Maharashtra Assembly and demanded that Vaze be arrested.The police officer did not offer comment immediately on the allegations.After a Scorpio with explosives was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in south Mumbai on February 25, Hiran, a Thane resident, had claimed it had been stolen from his possession a week earlier. Hiran himself was found dead in Thane creek on March 5.Vimla Hiran recorded her statement before the state Anti-Terrorism Squad, which is probing the case, on March 7.According to the statement, the Scorpio, owned by Dr Peter Newton, was in the possession of the Hiran family for the past three years with Dr Newton’s consent.Her husband knew API Vaze, who was a regular client of Mansukh’s car decor business, she said.In November 2020, he had given the Scorpio to Vaze to use, Vimla Hiran said, adding that the police officer returned it on February 5, 2021, through a driver. Her husband had then told her that the steering of the SUV was hard, she said.On February 17 Mansukh left for Mumbai in the SUV for business-related trip, but as the steering got jammed, he left it after crossing the Mulund toll plaza and took a cab, she said.The next day when he returned to the spot with one of his employees, it was missing, so he lodged a complaint of car theft at Vikhroli Police Station, she said.On February 25, when the SUV with gelatin sticks was found near Ambani’s house, her husband got a call from an ATS inspector, she said. Mansukh and their son Lucky then went to meet the officer near their building, she told the police.The officer showed him a picture of the SUV and Hiran identified it. He later told her that he went with Sachin Vaze to the Mumbai police’s crime branch the next morning for inquiry and returned around 10.30 pm with Vaze.He showed her a copy of his recorded statement that also bore the name and signature of Vaze, Vimla told the ATS.On March 2, Mansukh told her that he had gone to Mumbai with Vaze, and on his insistence filed a complaint addressed to the Chief Minister, Home Minister, and police commissioners of Mumbai and Thane about the harassment faced from the media and police, her statement said.She asked him if he had been tortured and Mansukh denied, but said he was constantly getting calls.On March 3 he told her that Vaze had asked him to get arrested in the case and assured that he (Vaze) will get him out on bail within 2-3 days, the statement claimed.She advised him against doing any such thing and he seemed tensed, she told the ATS.On March 4, her husband called his brother Vinod Hiran and said he needed a lawyer to apply for anticipatory bail as he feared arrest, Vimla said in the statement.He returned home early the same day, and said he had to go out again as a police officer named  Tawde wanted to meet him, she said.He was going to Ghodbunder Road to consult the police who were their well-wishers, he assured her.Mansukh left in an auto rickshaw and after 11 pm his phone became unreachable, so she called Vinod Hiran. Vinod called Vaze who advised him to wait till morning, she said.Next day Vinod filed a missing person complaint and around 3.30 pm her son informed her that Mansukh’s body has been found in the creek, she told the ATS.Her husband was a good swimmer so he could not have drowned in the creek, she stated.She suspected that her husband might have been killed by Sachin Vaze, Vimla Hiran said in the statement, demanding a thorough probe.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai on Tuesday, API Vaze said he would go through her allegations and only then respond. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-mansukh-hirans-wife-suspects-cops-role-in-his-death-seeks-probe-222871
09-03-2021||---||SC says e-committee to decide on hybrid mode of court hearing across country||New Delhi, March 9The Supreme Court on Tuesday said its e-committee will take a call on resumption of physical hearing of cases alongside the ongoing virtual mode in all courts and tribunals across India.“We will keep this pending. Our e-committee is deciding something. We will circulate it to you as well,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told petitioner advocate ML Sharma who sought hybrid mode of hearing in which litigants and lawyers would be free to choose the mode of hearing.The top court – which is scheduled to commence hybrid physical hearing from March 15 and it has already issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for it – said it would take up the matter after four weeks.As Sharma said “so many tussles are going on” on the issue of resumption of physical hearing and  we are at the mercy of registry (of top court),” the Bench replied, “We are not worried about the tussles.”The Supreme Court has been hearing cases through video-conferencing since March last year due to COVID19 pandemic and the subsequent national lockdown. Bar bodies, including the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) have been demanding resumption of physical hearings.SCBA had on Monday moved the top court seeking the quashing of the SOP, contending it was framed without consulting the Bar.SCBA has also sought a direction to the court’s Registry not to issue “any circular without consulting the Bar”.“On an experimental basis, and as a pilot scheme, the final hearings/regular matters listed on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays may be heard in the hybrid mode, as may be decided by the bench, considering the number of parties in a matter as well as the limited capacity of the courtrooms; all other matters, including those listed on Mondays and Fridays, shall continue to be heard through video/tele-conferencing mode,” the SOP read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-says-e-committee-to-decide-on-hybrid-mode-of-court-hearing-across-country-222865

09-03-2021||---||SC rejects PIL against ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans, 8-phase polls in West Bengal||New Delhi, March 9The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a PIL seeking to bar the BJP and its leaders from using ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan during West Bengal Assembly election campaign.“We don’t agree with you,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told petitioner advocate ML Sharma who had also challenged the Election Commission’s decision to conduct West Bengal Assembly elections in eight phases.“You are asking for prosecution. How can we pass such an order? The only power is with the High Court and that too in election petitions,” the Bench told Sharma who cited a 1978 verdict on the point.On February 26, the Election Commission had announced the schedule for Assembly elections to be held in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. While the Assembly polls in West Bengal will be held over eight rounds from March 27-April 29, polling in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry will be held in one phase on April 6 and in Assam over three phases.Sharma wanted the top court to stop the EC from conducting eight-phase elections in West Bengal, alleging that it violated Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.He also urged the court to direct the CBI to register an FIR into the alleged chanting of religious slogans during poll campaign in West Bengal.The chanting of “Jai Shri Ram, other religious slogans are creating disharmony” and is an offence under the Indian Penal Code and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, Sharma submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-pil-against-jai-shri-ram-slogans-8-phase-polls-in-west-bengal-222859
09-03-2021||---||PM Modi inaugurates 'Maitri Setu' between India and Bangladesh||New Delhi, March 9A fortnight ahead of his visit to Dhaka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tueday inaugurated the ‘Maitri Setu’ (Friendship Bridge) between India and Bangladesh.Maitri Setu spans 1.9 km and connects Sabroom in India with Ramgarh in Bangladesh over Feni River.The flurry of activity coincided with March 9, marking the completion of three years of the BJP government in Tripura. Tuesday is also the last day of filing nomination papers for the first phase of Assembly polls in West Bengal and Assam.Sources said the inauguration of the bridge was slated during PM Modi’s Dhaka visit on January 26 but the event was brought forward at South Block’s request.As a result, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina could not be present real-time when PM Modi was inaugurating the bridge. Instead, a tape recorded address by Hasina was inserted.“This is a historic moment as we are creating a new era in South Asia by providing connectivity to India. Political boundaries should not become physical barriers to trade,” she said.At the same time, Hasina said the project was conceived by an earlier Chief Minister (Manik Sarkar of CPM) who had then approached her to facilitate various clearances. The Chief Minister, she said, had also assured that his side would take care of the financing.PM Modi said the developmental activity was a result of “a double engine government, BJP at the Centre and BJP in Tripura”.Tripura is witnessing progress as there is no commission or corruption at different levels of the government. Tripura has moved past its 'hartaal culture' and now has ease of doing business, Modi declared."The bridge is poised to herald a new chapter for trade and people to people movement between India and Bangladesh. With this inauguration, Tripura is set to become the ‘Gateway of North East’ with access to Chittagong Port of Bangladesh, which is just 80 km from Sabroom,’’ read a statement from the Prime Minister's Office shortly after PM Modi had virtually inaugurated the bridge.The Prime Minister also laid the foundation stone for setting up an integrated check post at Sabroom which will be built at an estimated cost of about Rs 232 crore.He also laid the foundation stone of a highway in Tripura, 40,978 low income houses and a multi-level car parking and commercial complex at Old motor stand in Agartala.The PM also virtually inaugurated “integrated command and control centers” for Agartala to identify the use of digital technology to integrate different service networks such as police, power, water and sanitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-inaugurates-maitri-setu-between-india-and-bangladesh-222855
09-03-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks direction to Centre to not open any further window for sale of electoral bonds||A plea was Tuesday filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre and others to not open any further window for sale of electoral bonds during the pendency of a case pertaining to funding of political parties and alleged lack of transparency in their accounts.The application filed by an NGO in the pending petition has claimed that there is a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming Assembly elections, including in West Bengal and Assam, would further “increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies”.It alleged that as per data on electoral bonds declared by political parties in their audit reports for 2017-18 and 2018-19, the “ruling party had received more than 60 per cent of the total electoral bonds issued till date”.While seeking a direction to the Centre not to allow any further sale of electoral bonds during the pendency of matter, the application claimed that so far more than Rs 6,500 crore worth of electoral bonds have been sold with the majority of donations going to the ruling party.“There is a serious apprehension that any further sale of electoral bonds before the upcoming state elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Assam would further increase illegal and illicit funding of political parties through shell companies,” said the application filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan.The NGO, ‘Association for Democratic Reforms’, has also filed a separate application seeking an urgent listing of the matter saying it was last listed for hearing on January 20, 2020.On January 20 last year, the apex court had refused to grant interim stay on the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme and sought responses of the Centre and the Election Commission on an interim application by the NGO seeking stay on the scheme.The government had notified the Electoral Bond Scheme on January 2, 2018.As per provisions of the scheme, electoral bonds may be purchased by a person, who is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India.An individual can buy electoral bonds, either singly or jointly with other individuals.Only political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and which secured not less than 1 per cent of votes polled in the last general election to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State, are eligible to receive electoral bonds.As per the notification, electoral bonds shall be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with an authorised bank.In its fresh application, the petitioner said it had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue of corruption and subversion of democracy through illicit & foreign funding of political parties and lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties.“The petitioner is filing the instant application seeking a direction restraining the respondents from opening any further sale windows for issuance of electoral bonds during the pendency of the instant writ petition,” it said.It said that the electoral bonds scheme has opened the “floodgates to unlimited corporate donations” to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy.It said the Election Commission and the Reserve Bank of India had in 2017 “objected to electoral bonds and had advised against the issuance of electoral bonds as a mode for donation to political parties”. It alleged that almost 99 per cent of the electoral bonds purchased are of value one crore and 10 lakh denominations which shows that it is not individual citizens but large corporations which are purchasing these bonds with a view to receive kickbacks from the government.It had earlier claimed that certain amendments made in Finance Act, 2017 and earlier Finance Act, 2016, both passed as money bills, have opened doors to unlimited political donations, even from foreign companies and thereby legitimising electoral corruption at a huge scale, while at the same time ensuring complete non-transparency in political funding.The Election Commission had last year told the apex court that it has received status of filing of electoral bonds from various political parties, including the BJP and the Congress, in a sealed cover.The EC had filed an affidavit in the top court in pursuance to the April 12, 2019 direction asking the political parties to furnish all details of funds received through electoral bonds to the poll panel in a sealed cover.The apex court had in April 2019 declined to stay the Centre’s Electoral Bond Scheme 2018 and made it clear that it would accord in-depth hearing on the pleas as the Centre and the EC have raised “weighty issues” having “tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country”.The Centre and the EC had earlier taken contrary stands in the court over political funding, with the government wanting to maintain anonymity of donors of bonds and the poll panel batting for revealing names of donors for transparency. —

09-03-2021||New Delhi||HC to hear in April plea to declare PM CARES Fund a ‘State’ to ensure transparency in functioning||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said it will hear in April, a plea seeking to declare the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund) a ‘State’ under the Constitution to ensure transparency in its functioning.A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh said it will hear this petition along with another pending petition filed by the same petitioner seeking to declare PM CARES a ‘public authority’ under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.                           The court, which listed both the petitions for hearing on April 23, said it was not inclined to issue notice on this plea as the Centre was already represented through counsel and said they may file their written submissions.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said the issue requires proper hearing and the same petitioner has filed another related petition and both the pleas be heard together.Petitioner Samyak Gangwal, represented through senior advocate Shyam Divan, sought to declare PM CARES Fund a ‘State’ under Article 12 of the Constitution and to direct the fund to disclose its audit reports on the PM CARES website periodically.It also sought direction to the fund to disclose every quarter, on the PM CARES website, the details of the donations received by it which shall include each donor’s names.“Further, the details ought to be classified under the following heads – total donations received from individuals, private companies, Public Sector Undertaking, proprietorships, political parties, NGOs, Trusts and so on,” the plea said, adding that quarterly details of utilisation of the funds be also disclosed on the website.In support of his contention that the PM CARES Fund is a ‘State’, the petitioner said it was formed by the prime minister on March 27, 2020 for a noble purpose, that is, to extend assistance to the citizens of India in the wake of the public health emergency—the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.The trustees of the fund are the prime minister, defence minister, home minister and the finance minister and immediately after the formation of the fund, the Centre through its high government functionaries represented that the fund was set up and operated by the Government of India.“The representations also included the use of government resources such as- use of ‘.gov.in’ domain name, State Emblem of India and the name ‘Prime Minister’ and its abbreviation on the PM Cares Fund website and in other official and unofficial communications.“Further, the official address of the PM CARES Fund was stated to be the Prime Minister’s Office South Block, New Delhi…,” it said.Based on these representations, huge donations were received by the PM CARES Fund and as per the information provided on its website during the financial year 2019-20, an amount of Rs 3076.62 crore was collected merely within four days.The petitioner said he believes that the reliefs sought by him will ensure transparency and accountability in the fund’s functioning and will ensure that monies received by the PM CARES Fund are only used for the noble causes for which they were donated.“The petitioner is not attributing or even alleging any wrongdoing whatsoever on the part of the present Ex-Officio Trustees of the PM CARES Fund. However, since the PM CARES Fund’s Trustees are high government functionaries, it is essential that checks and balances envisioned in Part III of the Constitution are put in the place on the functioning of the fund to extinguish any chance of an allegation of ‘quid pro quo’,” the plea said.In his alterative prayers, Gangwal has sought to direct the Centre to publicise that the PM CARES Fund is not a fund of the Government of India and to restrain PM CARES from using ‘Prime Minister of India’ or ‘Prime Minister’, including its abbreviations its name, on its website, Trust Deed and other official or unofficial communications and advertisements. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-to-hear-in-april-plea-to-declare-pm-cares-fund-a-state-to-ensure-transparency-in-functioning-222840

I am amazed. I was born and brought up in the neighbouring Birbhum district, and the person who is calling me an outsider was also not born here. Today I have become an outsider, and those coming from Gujarat have become insiders in Bengal,” she said.Adhikari has often called himself “bhoomiputra” (son of the soil) while seeking to get back at the TMC supremo who has been targeting the BJP with the “party of outsiders” barb.Accusing Adhikari of trying to incite communal passions, Banerjee said,”Those who have sold their souls to the outsiders are insulting the Nandigram land acquisition movement by playing the communal card.”“Some people are talking about 70:30 ratio (of Hindu- Muslim population). Those doing that are insulting the sacred Nandigram movement which people of both communities fought together. People of Nandigram will make BJP ‘April fool’ on April 1 when polling is held,” she asserted. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-rejects-outsider-tag-in-nandigram-222836
09-03-2021||Mumbai||Appear before cops on Wednesday, Bombay HC tells activist Sharjeel Usmani||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked activist Sharjeel Usmani to appear before Pune police for questioning in connection with an FIR lodged against him for hate speech at the Elgar Parishad conclave held this year.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale asked the police not to take any coercive action against Usmani till March 16 when the court will hear his plea seeking to quash the case.Usmani’s counsel Mihir Desai on Tuesday told the court his client had been summoned by the police on Wednesday.“He is willing to appear for questioning but he should not be arrested,” Desai said.The court then asked Usmani to appear before police on Wednesday and asked Additional Public Prosecutor J P Yagnik to inform police to not take any coercive action against Usmani till March 16.The HC also directed Usmani to implead the complainant in the case as a respondent to the petition.An FIR was registered on February 2, 2021, against Usmani (23), an alumnus of the Aligarh Muslim University, by the Swargate police station in Pune under section 153(A) of the Indian Penal Code (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race and so on.The FIR was lodged based on a complaint by one Pradeep Gawade against Usmani for alleged offensive statements against the ‘Hindu community’, ‘Indian Judiciary’ and ‘Parliament’ during the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on January 30, 2021.Usmani has sought for the FIR to be quashed, claiming there was no disharmony or violence at the conclave before or after his speech.“The FIR is frivolous, baseless and was registered on the basis of certain select statements taken out of context from the speech of the petitioner. The petitioner in his speech has only identified a problem in the social construct of this day and has concluded with a solution to that problem,” the plea said.It added that the speech in totality appeals for a combat against the hatred in the society without any ill will or enmity against any religion, caste or community.

It is shameful how leaders of the party, whose government led by Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, gave Ashok Chakra to late Mohan Chand Sharma, hounded the Delhi Police,” Union Minister Ravi Shakar Prasad claimed.Prasad said at the time of the incident, the BJP was in the Opposition and that many Delhi Police officials approached them. “They requested to save them as there was a concerted effort to label them as murderers,” Prasad said.“Congress leader Salman Khurshid had said pictures of the Batla House encounter case had brought tears to the eyes of Sonia Gandhi. Will she now apologise to the country, will Mamata Banerjee say sorry to the nation,” Prasad said, calling Monday's conviction in the Batla House encounter “a triumph of India’s judicial process, a validation of the courage shown by the Delhi Police officials in containing terrorism and a closure to the rampant vote bank politics which happened in the past 12 years”. “The verdict shows how in issues related to country’s security the Congress and some other parties stood in favour of terrorists and tried to shatter the morale of the Delhi police. Ariz Khan was a serial killer and a terrorist who was caught in 2018 from Nepal during the regime of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is how this trial could take place,” he said. Quoting senior Congress leaders Salman Khurshid and Digvijaya Singh, the BJP leader said, “Deliberate attempts were made to cast doubts over the encounters and to support terrorists for vote bank politics.” He also quoted late Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and TMC leader and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee who together demanded a judicial probe into the incident."What do you have to say now," he said, questioning Mamata, Salman Khurshid and Digvijaya Singh. “They made it a national issue, can you weaken the fight against terrorism for vote bank politics,” he said, also questioning AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for similar demands.A Delhi court on Monday convicted Ariz Khan for killing Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma in the Batla House encounter, which took place in the national capital on September 19, 2008.Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav ruled: “The evidence adduced on record by the prosecution leaves no matter of doubt that the prosecution has proved the case beyond all reasonable doubt and that the accused is liable to be convicted.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-after-batla-house-verdict-bjp-slams-congress-trinamool-sp-aap-for-supporting-terrorists-for-vote-bank-politics-222806

09-03-2021||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha adjourned for second day over record high fuel price||The Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the second straight day on Tuesday after the opposition again pressed their demand for a discussion on fuel price hike, which was rejected by the chair.Congress deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, objected to the government's move to take up bills, saying, "This House has a tradition that until the pending matters are resolved, no government business can be undertaken." Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad then requested the opposition to allow a discussion on the Arbitration Bill, but the Leader of Opposition, Mallikarjun Kharge, insisted that the issue is important since it concerns the common people, as everyone is affected due to the rise in the prices of auto fuel and LPG cylinders.He said the prices of essential commodities have gone up due to the hike in diesel prices.Deputy Chairman Harivansh on Tuesday adjourned Rajya Sabha till 12 noon and then until 2 pm after slogan shouting by opposition members demanding a discussion on the issue of fuel price hike.The House started its sitting at 11 am, reverting to the old timing which was changed in the wake of the pandemic. Instead of 11 am to 6 pm, the timing was changed to 9 am to 2 pm. From Tuesday onwards the House was slated to go back to its old routine.However, twenty minutes into the proceedings—once the formality of laying various papers in the House was over—ruckus started over the issue of fuel price hike.Harivansh acknowledged that he had received notices from Satish Kumar Misra of BSP, Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress and Leader of the Opposition Priyanka Chaturvedi of the Shiv Sena and another MP for suspension of business under Rule 247 to discuss the issue of fuel price hike.The Deputy Chairperson said Chairperson Venkaiah Naidu had turned down on Monday the notice given by Mallikarjun Kharge under 247 and he had no authority to overturn the ruling.While Harivansh asked for the zero hour proceedings to start, opposition members resorted to shouting of slogans to press their demand.Sasmit Patra of the BJD and Ramnath Thakur of the JD-U spoke during the zero hour but their voice was drowned in the din created by opposition members.Tiruchi Siva of the DMK got up and urged the Chair to take steps to bring back order in the House.“We cannot hear what the members are saying,” he said.Bhupender Yadav of BJP stood up and said Tiruchi Siva was a senior member. While the notice for discussion on fuel price hike was given under Rule 247, the agitating members should also read Rule 248, Yadav said and added that according to Rule 248, a ruling given by Chairman cannot be changed by Deputy Chairman.Oil marketing companies (OMC) kept fuel prices unchanged for the tenth consecutive day across the four metros on Tuesday.

09-03-2021||Meerut||Cow slaughter bad, but stray cattle menace bigger problem: Farmers in Western UP||On a sunny afternoon in Western Uttar Pradesh, a common sight at barren lands alongside highways is quintals of sugarcane loaded on tractor-trollies and some old men keeping guard there to keep the crop safe from stray animals always on the prowl to pull away their share.Jumma, 72, is one of those old men sitting near a quaint weighing scale along the Ganga canal in Meerut district, constantly keeping a watch on the sugarcane load he has been protecting from stray cattle waiting to be weighed before being sent off to a mill. And the stray cattle population is an ever-increasing one, which many locals across religious lines blame on a ban on their slaughter in the state.The septuagenarian is aware that a farmers’ movement has been underway on the borders of Delhi, less than 100 kms away, for more than 100 days over three contentious central laws.He is also concerned that there is no law to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, another key issue before protesting farmers, in case some big corporate buyers of agri-produce decide to monopolise the market and decide to throw peanuts before farmers to gobble their crops.The landless farmworker easily gets involved in discussions over the agitation—which has had ripples in the region that is known for sugarcane—but is not much amused.His concerns, like that of Akbar Ali, who also has been hired to guard crops against stray animals, go beyond the issues being highlighted in the ongoing stir and the job at his hand gets the maximum priority.The problem of stray animals damaging crops looms large in the sugarcane-yielding district of Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh where men hired to guard the fields are hoping for better aid for their community from the government.Jumma said he worked for a central government warehousing corporation where his job largely kept him away from home and around a decade ago he returned to Meerut upon realising that he no longer had the capacity to perform the duty his previous job required him to do.“Here at my village, I got hired by Nanglamal sugar mill along with some other locals to guard farms and farm produce from stray animals. Initially, it seemed like a fine work that kept me engaged and provided some money too,” he told PTI.There are five to six private weighing scales around Jani Khurd village where one guard is deployed at each facility to keep a watch on the yields against animals like nilgai, cow, buffalo and wild boar.There are dozens of sugar mills and hundreds of weighing scales in Meerut and adjoining districts of Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat, according to locals.These guards, Jumma said, are paid Rs 4,500 per season and the job entails guarding the crop at all times – be it scorching sunlight, chilling winters or rains.He said all he wants is a round-the-year engagement by the sugar mill, a pay hike and some sort of pension from the government.Around 50 kilometres from Jani Khurd is Satheri village in Budhana tehsil of Muzaffarnagar, a key district vis-a-vis sugarcane production in north India. Here also, many farmers believe the menace of stray animals and a low-profit margin in agriculture are issues much bigger than those being highlighted in the media about the ongoing protests.The cost of cultivation—which involves tillage, seed sowing, irrigation and use of fertilisers—is very high now, said Ramesh Chandra (55), a government servant and farm owner in Satheri village.Labour cost too is a vexing issue.Landowners say they pay Rs 10 per ‘pully’ (a local word for a bunch of sugarcane crop that is cut off the ground and tied together before being kept aside for loading) to labourers working on fields and the rate goes up to Rs 15 per ‘pully’ during the peak season.But the menace of stray animals, whose slaughtering has been banned in the state by the BJP-led government, trumps all other woes.Chandra said farmers in the region have to ensure the protection of their crops from animals themselves. Many farmers collectively hire a guard, while those unable to afford it, have to do it on their own.“Those who do it on their own stand guard at their fields all the time with a stick in their hand for safety,” Chandra said, claiming that stray animals destroyed high brother’s seven bigha land where he had sown wheat.Rajkumar Harian (52), who has 40 bigha land among four brothers, said, “People from our village leave their non-productive animals in other villages and vice versa. There is a ban on slaughtering such animals because of which farmers are facing this trouble.”             Chandra said, “As far as Hinduism is considered, I am against slaughtering cattle but if you look at the condition of farmers, they cannot even afford fodder for productive animals, so how will they keep the non-productive ones. For all the damage done to crops, I do not find slaughtering of non-productive animals unreasonable.”    Rajpal Singh (57), another farmer whose wheat crop was damaged by stray animals, said, “If farmers had enough to afford fodder, why would they leave their cattle stray in the first place?”           Talking at dusk on a narrow road outside Satheri with sugarcane fields on both sides, Chandra, Harian and Singh resented that there was no solution in sight for the stray animal menace.“There are claims of gaushalas being made where stray animals are kept but all these claims are only in words. Nothing is happening on the ground,” Chandra claimed.Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Meerut unit vice president Subhash Singh said local public representatives and authorities are aware of the issues but nothing could be done so far.“We, as farmers’ representatives, have time and again highlighted these problems, but it is still not a priority for the government. Sugarcane rates remain unchanged for three years while prices of all other items have risen,” he said.Thousands of protestors, mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, are camping at Delhi’s three borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.The government, however, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cow-slaughter-bad-but-stray-cattle-menace-bigger-problem-farmers-in-western-up-222782

Their stories must also be told. There would hardly be a corner of India where someone or the other did not martyr for national cause. These tales will become a source of inspiration for new generations. We have to also highlight the contribution of all sectors of society and celebrate people who are working selflessly for India. We have to associate citizens with their work. The country does not become big by denying the contributions of some. We must accept everyone's contribution and celebrate them. That’s what makes the country big,” said the PM adding that people’s participation would be the hallmark of the celebrations of the event.The PM also said that broadly five pillars had been identified for the celebration of 75 years of freedom. “These are Freedom Struggle, Ideas at 75, Achievements at 75, Actions at 75 and Resolve at 75. All these should include the ideas and feelings of the 130 crore Indians,” he noted remarking that the festival of 75 years should be one wherein the spirit of freedom struggle is reflected, one that pays tributes to martyrs and also serves us to take a pledge to create a new India; one that embodies glimpses of the Sanatan Bharat and the glory of modern India; and imbibes the teaching of saints as well as the discoveries of scientists.The PM said such a celebration would guide the country when it celebrates the 100th year of freedom in 2047. Congress president Sonia Gandhi skipped the event, which was attended by her nominee Mallikarjun Kharge. Sources said Kharge today asked why India’s first prime minister Jawahar Lal Nehru was not listed among leaders to be celebrated. “Subject to verification of whether Pt Nehru’s name is on the list of leaders to be celebrated, I want to say that everyone who contributed to freedom must be saluted irrespective of political affiltations.”The government’s March 6 circular on India@75 event mentions organising exhibitions on Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose but not JL Nehru.Kharge also asked for exhibitions to be held on the emergence of India as a functional and adaptive democracy when the world had dismissed it as weak and predicted its disintegration. The Congress veteran added, “In future we would request advance notice for such an important meeting.”Celebrations of “Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav” will commence 75 weeks prior to Independence Day 2022 and extend up to Independence Day 2023. The PM will launch the celebrations – a 25 day event – on March 12, the anniversary of the launch of Dandi March, from Gujarat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-about-nehru-kharge-asks-pm-at-india75-meet-222770

The 39-year-old former American actress, who is pregnant with her second child, revealed that how the palace decided that their first-born, Archie, could not be a prince and would therefore have no security. She alluded to “concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”. “Who is having that conversation?” asked a stunned Winfrey.Meghan replied: “That was relayed to me from Harry.”Harry, who is still sixth in line to the British throne, also spoke of his hurt at his father Prince Charles not taking his calls after the couple decided to step back as frontline royals last year.They have since moved to California after formally stepping down from royal duties in March 2020. — PTISimi calls Meghan ‘evil’, gets trolledIndian actress-TV host Simi Garewal was trolled for her tweet on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. “#OprahMeghanHarry I don’t believe a word Meghan says.

The pandemic has sent out a message that we have to return to the Vedic lifestyle," Thakur said."Mix ghee (clarified butter) made out of cow milk with rice.
