There are names we have cleared but the Law Ministry has not cleared yet,” the top court said.As Supreme Court Bar Association President and senior counsel Vikas Singh urged the Bench to consider lawyers practising in the top court while making recommendations for judicial appointments, the Bench said bar bodies of high courts were opposed to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-frowns-upon-govt-sitting-over-collegiums-recommendations-230403
25-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court irked over police not maintaining files in FIR registered more than a year ago||A court here was irked on Thursday over non-maintenance of files by Delhi Police in a case relating to the alleged burning and desecration of “Madina Masjid” during the north-east Delhi riots in February last year.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said the case diaries have not been maintained as per section 172 (diary of proceedings in investigation) of Criminal Code of Procedure (CrPC).According to section 172 CrPC, every police officer conducting an investigation should day by day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary, with the time at which the information reached him, the time at which he began and closed his probe, the place or places visited by him, and a statement of the circumstances ascertained through it.The court also noted that the statements of the witnesses were probably recorded after the last date of hearing in the matter which was registered more than a year ago.It also posed doubt on whether the statements of the witnesses were recorded on the date mentioned by the investigating officer (IO) because while the statements appeared to have been recorded on computer, they bore his physical signature.“The case diaries have not been maintained in terms of section 172 CrPC. The bound volume, as mandated by CrPC, has not been maintained. The statements of witnesses have probably been recorded after March 17, 2021, i.e. the last date of hearing.“As the statements appear to have been recorded on computer and are digital documents, but the same bear physical signatures of the IO rather than the digital signatures because of which it is not possible to ascertain as to whether the same were recorded on the date mentioned against the signatures of IO,” it said in its order.The court directed the police to file a status report on the investigation in the case and put up the matter for further hearing on April 7.During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Nitin Rai Sharma, appearing for the police, said the investigation regarding the original complaint of alleged mosque attack was in progress and appropriate steps be taken against the accused persons.The court had on March 17 pulled up the police for “apparent absurdity” in clubbing a man’s complaint about alleged burning down of his house during the north-east Delhi riots last year with another one and later arresting him in the same matter—making him both a complainant and the accused.It had also said there was nothing on record about the investigation conducted in the FIR registered in February last year in the case of alleged burning and desecration of “Madina Masjid” during the riots in Shiv Vihar area.It had directed the DCP (north-east) to file a report on the status of investigation in the case by March 25.The court’s observations had come while hearing an appeal by the state against a magistrate court’s order on February 1 for registration of an FIR on a complaint by Haji Hashim Ali regarding alleged desecration of the mosque.Ali had also made a complaint regarding the burning of his house allegedly by the rioters which was clubbed by the police with the complaint of one Naresh Chand.The police had registered a common FIR and later arrested Ali in the case. Ali is out on bail in the matter.“It is really strange that the complaint with regard to burning of house of respondent no 1 (Ali) was clubbed with the complaint of one Naresh Chand, being case FIR No 72/2020, PS Karawal Nagar and later on the respondent no 1 was arrested in the same matter, meaning thereby that he is not only complainant in the matter, but also an accused, which is an apparent absurdity,” the court had said.It had noted that the police did not inform the magistrate court that an FIR had already been registered in the mosque case on February 26, 2020.It said: “A perusal of the impugned order dated February 1, 2021, passed by Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) clarifies that the issue involved in the matter is with regard to burning and desecration of “Madina Masjid”, Shiv Vihar, Delhi on February 25, 2020.  As per the version of police, already an FIR No 55/2020, PS Karawal Nagar has been registered in this regard on February 26, 2020, but no such averment was made by the police before the MM.”          During the hearing, advocate MR Shamshad, appearing for Ali, had submitted that according to the police the FIR in the mosque attack case was registered in February last year but they had filed various status reports in the last six months before the magistrate court without disclosing it.Shamshad had alleged that various wrong status reports were submitted before the magistrate court and the police disclosed the fact about the FIR exactly a year later.“If it is the case of the police that FIR was registered one year before, they would have filed the detailed status of investigation/trial,” he had said.Shamshad had further alleged that FIR 55/2020 was set up at this stage without naming any accused.“This entire process appears to be unreasonable, shady and mala fide to somehow give a predetermined closure to the brutal attack on the religious place of the Muslims in the area,” he had alleged.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

25-03-2021||Gandhinagar||Gujarat Assembly: Congress MLA reprimanded for Savarkar remark||Gujarat Congress MLA Rutvik Makwana was on Thursday reprimanded by Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi for a “controversial statement” on freedom fighter and Hindutva ideologue VD Savarkar.Makwana had made the statement on Thursday last week and the Speaker had, at the time, asked him to either apologise or bring evidence to support his claim.As evidence, Makwana produced some articles, a write- up by a former RBI governor and a book on Savarkar by author Jaywant Joglekar, etc.However, Speaker Trivedi told the House “the controversial statement made by the MLA, which I do not want to repeat here, does not get support from the evidence produced by him”.“This is because these are mere personal opinions of the writers, and these personal opinions cannot be counted as authentic evidence,” Trivedi added.Reprimanding the MLA, Trivedi said Makwana should not make such allegations in the future against the country’s respectable individuals.Trivedi added that, in case any member wanted to make such comments in the future, he will have to take the Speaker’s prior permission with authentic evidence in support.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Paresh Dhanani said he had authentic evidence on the issue and added that the opposition was ready for a discussion.The Speaker requested him to not stretch the issue or else he will also be counted as supporting Makwana’s statement.

25-03-2021||New Delhi||Majority of smokers don’t support proposal to ban sale of loose cigarettes, smoking areas: Survey||An overwhelming majority of smokers do not support the proposal to ban the sale of loose cigarettes and designated smoking areas under the amendments in the law on cigarettes and other tobacco products, according to a study.A survey conducted across 14 cities, including Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Guwahati and Vadodara, interviewing 1,986 people by non-commercial entity PRAHAR also found that 78 per cent of respondents do not support an increase in age for tobacco consumption from 18 years to 21 years.“The survey found that 87 per cent of the participants do not support the proposal to ban the sale of loose cigarettes. They believe that this decision to reduce tobacco consumption may instead force smokers to buy full packs which will make cigarettes readily available in their hands leading to an increase in consumption of tobacco,” PRAHAR (Public Response Against Helplessness and Action for Redressal) said in a statement.Further, 57 per cent of consumers buy loose cigarettes “as it helps them to smoke less”, while only 19 per cent go for it because it is cheaper.“Only 7 per cent of respondents felt that a ban on the sale of loose cigarettes will make them smokeless,” it said adding 82 per cent of respondents did not support the ban of designated smoking areas.On disallowing branding of tobacco products at the point of sale, 76 per cent of respondents said they do not support this proposal, with 55 per cent of the opinion that it would “limit their fundamental right to make an informed decision as branding is a reinforcement of the legality of the product they are buying”.“This is particularly relevant because the market is flooded with illegal and smuggled products. 25 per cent of the consumers feel that the move will encourage unscrupulous retailers to promote products that give them more margin,” PRAHAR said.When it comes to increasing the age for tobacco consumption from the current 18 years to 21 years, 78 per cent of respondents said that they do not support the move and 37 per cent believed that it is their fundamental right to decide whether to consume tobacco or not.“Around 8 per cent also felt that this ban will make younger people below 21 years buy illegal products from underground sources,” it added.Commenting on the findings of the survey, PRAHAR President and National Convenor Abhay Raj Mishra said, “Consumers believe that the proposed provisions significantly curtail their fundamental rights and freedom to make informed choices and in certain cases will even cause harassment and subject consumers to mental cruelty.”           He further said, “COTPA (Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act) 2020 proposed amendments are self-defeating as instead of serving tobacco reduction goals, they will distort the market structures and lead to an increase in the growth of illegal and inferior products. What we need is a sustained awareness programme to achieve the goals of tobacco control instead of coercive policy measures.”    The COTPA Amendment Bill 2020 proposed by the Ministry of Health disallows the retail sale of loose sticks of cigarettes, prohibits the sale of tobacco products to persons below 21 years, put controls on in-shop advertising and promotion amongst others.Menon said it is an established principle that before framing any law which affects a class of stakeholders, the views of the affected party must be sought. However, in the course of framing and seeking public response to the provisions of COTPA Amendment Bill 2020 no attempt was made to seek the views of the consumers and actual users of tobacco products.“Unlike other groups, consumers are not cohesively represented by any associations or bodies. Therefore, PRAHAR took it upon itself to collect the views of the users and table it for the consideration of the policymakers,” he added.

The Indian Army has been pitching for a faster disengagement process in areas like Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang to bring down tension in the mountainous region.At present, China and India have disengaged front-line troops in the Pangong Lake area and both countries have positively commented on the current moves, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of National Defence said at an online media briefing.“Thanks to the joint efforts made by China and India, the situation in the border area has been eased distinctly,” he said.Both sides have agreed to maintain communication through military and diplomatic channels to promote the settlement of other issues in the west section of the China-India boundary, Ren was quoted as saying by the Chinese military-run China Military Online portal.Ren was responding to a question on reports quoting the External Affairs Ministry spokesman asking China to complete its military withdrawal at the remaining friction points along the LAC.China hopes the two sides can value the hard-won results, follow the important consensus reached by the leaders of both countries, maintain dialogue and communication and stabilise the situation against relapse, gradually coming to solutions that can be accepted by the two countries to jointly maintain peace in the border area, he said.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake area and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.

25-03-2021||Guwahati||Campaign for first phase poll in Assam ends||The high-pitched campaign for the first phase of poll in Assam in 47 assembly constituencies slated for March 27 came to an end on Thursday evening.The poll on Saturday will decide the fate of 247 candidates.Implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 was the central issue in the state, which was rocked by violence and protests against it, but BJP, which had steered the central legislation in Parliament maintained a studied silence on it. The issue did not find place in the campaigning by the party nor in its manifesto.However, party president J P Nadda’s comment that it is an act of Parliament and will be implemented saw protests across the state by political parties students union AASU.The Congress on the other hand assured that if voted to power, it will bring a legislation in the assembly so that the act is not implemented in Assam.The hectic campaigning for the first phase was marked by poll meetings by several national leaders of the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress, who criss crossed the state to garner support for their respective parties.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had led the campaign brigade for BJP and its alliance partner, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). The other BJP leaders who wooed the voters in Assam were BJP President J P Nadda, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar, who is also partys state in-charge.The others leaders from outside to hold campaign rallies were Textile and Handloom Minister Smriti Iraniand chief ministers Yogi Adityanath and Shivraj Singh Chouhan.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and BJP state unit President Ranjeet Kumar Dass and North East Democratic Alliance convenor and state minister Himanta Biswa Sarma campaigned in the constituencies which are spread across upper and central Assam.The highlight of the opposition Congress campaign was the visit of its top leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in the tea belt, besides Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, who is in charge of the party’s campaign in Assam.Other leaders who campaigned for Congress included former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan, AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and Gaurav Gogoi, the chairman of the manifesto committee.The Congress in its campaign presented its ‘five guarantees’. These are five lakh government jobs to youths in five years, 200 units of free electricity for every household, increasing the daily wages of the tea garden workers to Rs 365 and Rs 2000 per month to homemakers, besides the legislation against the implementation of the CAA.The newly floated political parties Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal relied mostly on door-to-door campaigns and street corner meetings.With ‘Rongali Bihu’, the popular spring festival of the Assamese about a fortnight away, supporters of the political parties were seen dancing the ‘jhumur’, the folk dance of the tea tribes or swaying to their election songs which have become particularly popular among the voters.Prominent among those whose fates will be decided in the first phase are Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami, ministers Atul Bora, Keshab Mahanta, Ranjit Dutta, Naba Kumar Doley, Sanjoy Kishan and Nazir Hussain.The others are Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Ripun Bora, Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia, AICC secretary Bhupen Borah and former ministers of the party Bharat Narah, Pranatee Phukan and Rakibul Hussain.The fates of jailed Raijor Dal president Akhil Gogoi and Assam Jatiya Parishad president Lurinjyoti Gogoi along with his party general secretary Jagadish Bhuyan will also be decided in the first phase.BJP is contesting in 39 of the 47 seats while its alliance partner the AGP in 10, including two where it is in friendly contest against the saffron party. The Congress is contesting in 43 seats and its allies AIUDF, RJD, Anchalik Gana Morcha (as independent) and CPI-ML in one seat each.Assam Jatiya Parishad is contesting in 41 seats while the Raijor Dal is contesting in 19 seats as independents.

25-03-2021||New Delhi||Builder held for poisoning wife, her family members with thallium||A Delhi-based builder has been arrested for allegedly poisoning his wife and other family members by mixing a toxin called thallium in their food, police said on Thursday.A senior police officer said the accused—Varun Arora—was inspired by articles related to the toxin and its use by former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and used it to kill his mother-in-law and his sister-in-law.His wife, who was also poisoned, is on ventilator support at a hospital, police said.       Arora mixed the toxin in their food to take revenge from his wife and her family members for helping her abort their child without his consent, police said.On Monday, police received information that a woman named Anita Devi Sharma who was a resident of Inder Puri here, had been declared dead at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The doctors had opined that the death was caused due to poisoning by thallium which had been detected in her blood and urine, a senior police officer said.On enquiry, it was found that Sharma’s daughter Divya was also admitted in the ICU of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and she too was undergoing treatment for thallium poisoning. She was on ventilator support, the officer said.Sometime later, it was also revealed that Priyanka, Sharma’s younger daughter had died during treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15 and doctors had detected symptoms of thallium poisoning in her like hair loss and burning feet syndrome, police said.Sharma’s husband Devendra Mohan was also found to have symptoms of thallium poisoning while the maid, who was working at their house, also had undergone treatment at RML Hospital for similar symptoms, the officer said.Investigations revealed that the deceased woman’s son-in-law Arora had visited them in January and brought cooked fish for them.“After we registered the case, Arora was interrogated in which he admitted to have procured thallium and also administering it to his mother-in-law Anita, wife Divya, father-in-law Devender Mohan and sister-in-law Priyanka to take revenge from them. Arora said he had been humiliated by his in-laws,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Urvija Goel said.Thallium was recovered from his house at Greater Kailash, the DCP said.During interrogation, Arora told the police that during the time when his father died, his wife had also gotten pregnant, leading him to believe that his father had come back to his family in the form of the child, police said.However, when his wife underwent some tests, the doctors told them that there may be some complications during child birth and her life may be in danger. She consulted Arora and also opined that she should abort the child, but Arora refused, police said.Arora’s wife, however, discussed the matter with her parents and aborted the baby with their help. When Arora came know about it, he planned to take revenge from them, police added.

25-03-2021||New Delhi||LoC silent in March; terror infrastructure in Pak remains intact: Army Chief||The Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir has been silent for the first time in around five to six years as not a single shot was fired in March, Army Chief Gen M M Naravane said on Thursday referring to the recent commitment by Indian and Pakistani militaries to observe ceasefire in the region.The Army Chief, however, said the terror infrastructure, including terrorist launch-pads on the Pakistani side remained intact, asserting that it cannot be business as usual unless the neighbouring country stops supporting terrorism.Speaking at the India Economic Conclave, Gen Naravane said he was optimistic that the ceasefire will hold as the Pakistan Army was on board.“I am glad to inform that in the whole month of March, we have not had a single shot fired at the Line of Control (LoC) barring an odd incident. It is for the first time in about five or six years that the LoC has been silent. That really bodes well for the future,” he said.Last month, the Indian and Pakistani armies recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire agreement on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir. The return to the ceasefire was agreed upon by the director generals of military operations of the two countries.“Our core issue is that they have to stop support to terrorism. Unless they stop that it cannot be business as usual,” Gen Naravane said at the conclave organised by Times Network.Asked what could have prompted Pakistan to suddenly agree to the ceasefire, Gen Naravane said the duels between the two sides had not resulted any forward movement and that Islamabad has its own internal problems.“I feel that they have their own problems internally and from time-to-time, you have to also see whether a strategy that you are following is actually paying any dividend,” he said.“Over so many years, they would have also realised that it is time to make a change and that would have prompted them to extend this olive branch,” he added.To a question, the Army Chief said he was optimistic that the ceasefire will hold and even made an apparent reference to recent comments by Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.“I would say we are very optimistic especially with the comments which have been made recently and the very important point is that the agreement is between the DGMOs of both the sides,” Gen Naravane said.“So obviously the Pakistan Army is on board and if the Pakistan Army is on board then there is every reason to be quite optimistic of the outcome,” he said.On India-Pakistan ties, Bajwa recently said it is “time to bury the past”.Gen Naranave also talked about terror infrastructure on the Pakistani side, saying India has intelligence inputs about them.“The terror infrastructure and launch pads remain in place. We have detailed intelligence of each of those camps, locations and likely strength of terrorists awaiting and who have undergone training and are present there, perhaps waiting for an opportunity to cross over,” he said.Asked whether Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire under compulsion, the Army Chief said, “Yes, that’s quite possible.”“We will have to wait and see. Once the snow melts and passes open, if the situation still remains normal then there is a good prognosis for the future, we have to wait and see,” he said.When pressed further to explain the possible compulsions of Pakistan, Gen Naravane mentioned the situation in Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan as well as pressure on that country to comply with recommendations of the anti-terror watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF).“One is of course the situation on their western border with Afghanistan. Things are not very rosy there as far as they are concerned,” he said.“The second is the threat of the FATF which hangs over their head. They are still in the grey list. Probably they would like to show that they are making some efforts to not support terrorism and third of course is their domestic compulsions,” he said.

25-03-2021||New Delhi||Chidambaram’s direction to INX Media to help Karti important step in money laundering: ED||Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram’s direction to former INX Media promoters for “helping” business interests of his son is “one of the important steps of the scheme of money laundering” devised by the senior Congress leader, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has alleged in its charge sheet.The central probe agency claimed that the 75-year-old Congress leader was “very much involved” with his son and MP Karti Chidambaram in the process of money laundering and was “involved” in the working of the companies beneficially owned by the latter, some of which have also been made accused in the case.The ED claimed it has recovered emails from seized digital devices that disclosed that Karti used to consult his father regarding matters related to a company “beneficially owned” by him in the past—Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL).A special court here, empowered to try cases under the criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), had on Wednesday taken cognizance of the ED charge sheet and issued summons to all the 10 accused, including the father-son duo, for April 7.The court had said there was sufficient material to proceed against the Chidambarams, Karti’s chartered accountant S Bhaskararaman, former CEO of INX Media Pratim or Peter Mukerjea and six firms, including INX Media and INX News.The senior Chidambaram, while denying all the charges, has said that summoning of the accused was a routine process.“The mails and averments reveal that P Chidambaram was involved in the working of companies of Karti P Chidambaram. Apart from his son, he was closely in touch with Bhaskararaman who was managing all the affairs of illegal transactions of Karti P Chidambaram,” the ED claimed in the chargesheet.Bhaskararaman and P Chidambaram were also arrested by the ED in this case earlier and later they were granted bail.“In fact, the direction to help Karti Chidambaram is one of the important steps of the scheme of money laundering devised by P Chidambaram along with his son and close confidants,” the ED alleged in the charge sheet accessed by PTI.Describing the “evidences” that claim the senior Chidambaram’s alleged “involvement” in the case, the prosecution complaint said: “People used to approach Karti Chidambaram and his associates for the work to be done through his father P Chidambaram, in lieu of which he used to get illegal gratification in the companies not directly owned by him, but through his close confidants.”     “This way he (Karti) was trying to hide his direct link with the illegal gratification received by him. Mails also suggest that Karti P Chidambaram used to consult his father regarding the matters of ASCPL.”  “The illegal gratification received was invested in properties abroad by Karti Chidambaram and the mails suggest that he was also consulting his father regarding purchase of properties abroad,” the ED alleged.This all shows, it added, that P Chidambaram “was very much involved along with Karti Chidambaram in the process of money laundering and showing the proceeds of crime as untainted property.”Karti Chidambaram (49), a sitting Congress MP from the Sivaganga Lok Sabha seat in Tamil Nadu, told the ED in his statement recorded under the PMLA that as he was the son of P Chidambaram, it was “natural” for him to take up these issues with him.Talking about the INX Media money laundering case, the ED said Karti got the “illegal gratification” from INX Media Pvt Ltd in the companies “beneficially owned” by him in the past, in lieu of getting FIPB approval for them from the Finance Ministry which was headed by his father.The Chidambarams have been questioned by the ED multiple times in this case in the past. Karti was also arrested by the CBI in this case in 2018.The ED stated in its charge sheet that the alleged money laundering instances began with INX Media promoters Peter Mukerjea, his wife Indrani Mukerjea and journalist and the then CEO of INX News Pvt Ltd Vir Sanghvi meeting the then Union finance minister (P Chidambaram) at his office sometime in March, 2007 purportedly for “seeking blessings” of the minister for Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIBP), that is now scrapped, approval for FDI in their media group.“During the said meeting, P Chidambaram had asked Pratim (Peter) Mukerjea to take care of the business interests of his son Karti Chidambaram and make possible overseas payments.”“FIPB approval was thereafter accorded. This has been stated by both Pratim Mukerjea and Indrani Mukerjea in their statements made under the PMLA and Vir Sanghvi and P Chidambaram also accepted this meeting but denied asking any favor,” the ED said.“...However, INX Media Pvt Ltd, contrary to the approval, received excess FDI without seeking a valid approval from the FIPB unit of the Ministry of Finance, which was a pre-requisite as per the policy guidelines, unilaterally made an indirect foreign investment/downstream investment to the tune of Rs 46.41 crores in INX News Pvt Ltd.,” the ED said.This FIPB approval, it claimed, was in contravention to the existing law.“In the year 2008, discrepancies were noticed in the FIPB approval of INX Media Pvt Ltd and Peter Mukerjea and Indrani Mukerjea again met Karti  Chidambaram to sort out the discrepancies in Hyatt Hotel, New Delhi,” the agency alleged.Karti Chidambaram, it claimed, demanded USD 1 million to sort out the issue using influence his father, who was the Union finance minister then.“The proceeds of crime generated in this case were laundered by his (P Chidambaram’s) son and other co-conspirators and was invested in immovable and movable properties” and several shell companies were formed for this purpose, the ED claimed.

The BJP government at the Centre is feeling insecure because Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is emerging as an alternative to Narendra Modi. Therefore, this bill has been pushed to undermine the elected government,” Sisodia told a press conference.“We are taking legal opinion on the issue to decide future course of action,” he added. Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 despite uproar and walkout from the Opposition. The bill, commonly known as the NCT Bill, was passed by Lok Sabha on March 22.This bill seeks to give more powers to the Delhi Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) compared to the elected government and will make it mandatory for the Delhi government to take the opinion of the L-G before taking any executive action, a move that the Delhi government says will undermine the people’s mandate and the elected government of the national capital.Apart from this, the bill also makes it clear the “government” in Delhi means the “Lieutenant Governor”.

He was produced before the court after his earlier remand expired.The NIA, which has invoked the stringent provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against Vaze, sought his custody for another 15 days.“I have been made a scapegoat and have nothing to do with the case,” Vaze told judge P R Sitre during the hearing.“I was investigating officer of the case for one and a half days, and did whatever I could in that capacity. But there was suddenly change in some plan somewhere. I went to the NIA office on my own and was arrested,” the police officer said, adding he had not confessed to anything.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, the NIA lawyer, told court that everybody was shocked to find that a policeman was involved in the crime.During the probe, the NIA recovered 62 bullets from his house and it needed to probe why they were kept there, Singh said. The police department had issued Vaze 30 bullets of which only five were recovered, and the rest were yet to be found, the ASG added.The murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran—who had claimed that the SUV found near Ambani’s house had been stolen from his possession—was a connected case, and the NIA got the custody of two other accused arrested in that case from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad only the day before, Singh said.They need to confront Vaze with the other accused, he added. The NIA has taken over the Hiran case too.However, the judge extended the custody only till April 3.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vazes-nia-custody-extended-till-april-3-says-he-was-made-scapegoat-230364

25-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra leaders warn of action against officers for ‘helping’ Centre against MVA||Senior leaders of the ruling NCP and the Congress in Maharashtra on Thursday warned of strict action against some IPS and IAS officers, who allegedly secretly helped the BJP-led Centre against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.Their warning comes in the wake of allegations that a senior IPS officer had illegally tapped calls of several politicians who were against the BJP, while the opposition party said that the phone tapping was done after due permission, and claimed that it revealed a “transfer scam”.Speaking to reporters, state Deputy Chief Minister and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar said, “No officer will be spared if found guilty. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has also asked the chief secretary to prepare a detailed report on whether some officials have erred or not. If they are found involved, they will face action.”NCP leader Jitendra Awhad had on Wednesday alleged that the then Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla had intercepted calls without permission from then Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sitaram Kunte.Permission was sought for intercepting the calls of certain persons, but actually the calls of some other persons were tapped, he had claimed.BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis had alleged that the MVA government had suppressed Rashmi Shukla’s report, which said that as per the intercepted phone calls, some police officials and politicians were allegedly involved in a transfer scam in the state home department.Pawar said, “Phone calls are generally tapped only for preventing some serious action. It is done with the permission of additional chief secretary of home department. Current chief secretary of Maharashtra Sitaram Kunte was ACS (home) then. He is known as a very straightforward officer. The CM has asked Kunte to prepare a detailed report on the allegations levelled by Fadnavis.”Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, while addressing a press conference on Thursday, alleged that there are some IAS and IPS officers in the Maharashtra cadre, who have been secretly helping the BJP-led Union government and all of them will face action as they have breached the oath of secrecy.“We have come to know that there are some IAS and IPS officers who have been secretly helping the BJP-led Centre against the MVA government. They have breached the oath of secrecy, and hence they will face action,” he said.Reacting to Fadnavis’ allegation, Patole said, “He is clearly misleading the people and maligning the image of the state at the national level...”The BJP has been targeting the Maharashtra government ever since it lost power, he alleged.When asked whether the MVA government is shielding Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in the wake of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegation of corruption against him, Patole said, “We are setting up an inquiry into the charges levelled by Singh in the letter. When Fadnavis was the chief minister, he used to give clean chit to his minister on his own.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-leaders-warn-of-action-against-officers-for-helping-centre-against-mva-230354
25-03-2021||Mumbai||ICICI-Videocon PMLA case: Bombay HC grants bail to Deepak Kochhar||The Bombay High Court on Thursday granted bail to Deepak Kochhar, husband of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, in a money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Kocchar had approached the high court after a special court in the city rejected his bail plea in December last year.Justice P D Naik of the high court, while granting bail to Kochhar on Thursday, directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs three lakh.The high court also directed Kochhar to surrender his passport before the special court in the city hearing the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cases, and asked him to co-operate with the probe.Kochhar was arrested by the ED in September last year under the PMLA in the alleged ICICI Bank-Videocon money laundering case.The ED had registered the money laundering case following an FIR by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against the Kochhar couple, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, and others for allegedly causing loss to the ICICI Bank by sanctioning loans to the Videocon Group of companies in contravention of the policies of the ICICI Bank.Kochhar had argued that the ED had taken note of all the alleged proceeds of the crime in the case, so there was no chance of him creating any third party rights or interfering with the probe if out on bail.He had also said in his bail plea that the entire case against him was based on documentary evidence, which was already in the ED’s possession, and hence there was no question of him tampering with the evidence when out on bail.The detailed order of the high court in the case is awaited.

Then it was Didi who chased away automobile industry from Bengal. She has failed to generate employment.“If you want schemes, you vote for Modiji and if you prefer scams, then vote for incompetent TMC. It is for you to decide,” he said while addressing an election rally here.Accusing the TMC of running a “corrupt dispensation”, Shah said the BJP will end “cut money” culture in Bengal.Noting that the TMC government has neglected the adivasis (tribals) and Kurmi caste voters, Shah said if voted to power, then every Kurmi and adivasi families will get one job each.“We will provide jobs to each adivasi and Kurmi families of the state. The adivasis dont get MSP for their produce; we will include their produce in the list of crops so that they also qualify for MSP,” he said.“We will also ensure that the children of Kurmi family can get education till Class X in their language and that too free of cost,” he said.Stressing on the need for pure drinking water in the area, Shah said the TMC government had forced Purulia natives to consume “fluoride contaminated water”.“We have will come up with Rs 10,000 crore clean drinking water project in Purulia. Didi has forced you to drink fluoride contaminated water,” he said.Highlighting prevalence of dengue and malaria in the area, the senior BJP leader said, “if you want to get rid of dengue and malaria, you have to defeat Didi in the elections.“She has a special affinity with dengue and malaria, and that is why she has done nothing to address the problem here.

We called up the woman's son and asked him to take his mother home," Dr Shubhangi Shah from that hospital said."However, to our surprise, her family members refused to take her home. When we asked her son where we should send his mother, he asked us to leave her on the streets. We were baffled by his response," she said.Dr Shah said that she then called the Sinhagad police station and sought their help."With the help of the police, the woman was taken to her home. However, when they reached there, the house was locked. Her family members were contacted again, who told them that they would come by 8 pm," she added.As it was difficult for the police to keep the woman alone outside her home, they took her back to the hospital, where she stayed overnight."On Wednesday, the police counselled her family members and the woman was reunited with her family," she said.Devidas Gheware, senior police officer from Sinhagad Road police station said that the daughter-in-law of the woman told them that they could not take her home as her father had passed away on Tuesday, and she was not in a state to reply."The family members said they were tense and could not understand how to respond.

Haven't seen anyone draping a saree in such a way. "If she has to display her leg for viewing, she can very well wear bermuda shorts. That will help to have a better view," the BJP MP was purportedly heard stating."Earlier, women's hips were like number '8'. When they carried kids, they used to sit comfortably on hips." He claimed that after drinking foreign cows' milk, "women have become balloons", adding, "If they hold a child, it slips away because they have become like a barrel."Sharply reacting to the purported comment by the BJP leader, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) said in a twitter post in Bengali, "We can expect such distasteful comments only from Dilip Ghosh."His deplorable comments about a woman chief minister proves Bengal BJP leaders don't know how to show respect to women."Mothers and sisters of Bengal will give a befitting reply to such insults to Mamata Banerjee on May 2." Trinamool Congress MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said in a tweet, "It now appears that the role of @BJP4Bengal State President has been merely reduced to that of venom-spitting.From scathing attacks towards the CM of Bengal to violence towards @AITCofficial workers - he has conveniently crossed all limits. Shocking words, once again!"TMC MP Mahua Moitra's tweet on Dilip Ghosh's remark said "@BJP WB Pres asks in public meeting why Mamatadi is wearing a saree, she should be wearing Bermuda shorts to display her leg better"And these perverted ... (people) think they are going to win Bengal?BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya told PTI, there was no need to create a controversy over the remark."I think such comments should not be taken seriously.The chief minister makes many intemperate remarks against the BJP and our leaders at public meetings. Dilip Ghosh is a generous person. Even if he made such a comment at a rally, it has to be kept in mind that many things are said at election meetings which should not be always considered seriously."Ghosh has great respect for the chief minister. So no controversy should be created," Bhattacharya said.Ghosh who was campaigning in Purulia district on Tuesday could not be reached for his reaction.The BJP state president has earlier been in the midst of controversies for his comments which ranged from claims that `desi' (Indian) cows milk have gold content to demands that Balakot-like surgical strikes be carried out on Jadavpur university to drive out communists.His purported comment triggered protest on Facebook too with some women expressing outrage."Dear Dilipda. If men can go out in public in bermuda shorts baring their legs, women hope you shouldn't have any issue with them wearing bermudas as well."It is very comfortable for both genders. And certainly the CM can wear it if she wishes," Chaitali Biswas, a Facebook user, posted in her timeline inviting many likes.The chief minister sustained injuries on her left leg, hip, forearm, neck and shoulder at an incident in Nandigram soon after filing her nomination papers on March 10. She had alleged that the BJP hatched a conspiracy to prevent her from campaigning by organising an attack, a charge denied by the saffron camp.The Election Commission had concluded that the chief minister had suffered injuries following an accident, due to a security lapse. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-saree-mamata-should-wear-bermuda-shorts-to-show-injured-leg-bengal-bjp-chief-dilip-ghoshs-remark-sparks-outrage-230335

So now I will not call the RSS as Parivar (family)."According to reports, the incident took place last week when the nuns were travelling on the Haridwar-Puri Utkal Express. On March 19, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had accused the nuns of carrying out religious conversions.They were allowed to proceed only after an inquiry at the railway station established there was no conversion involved.The ABVP is the students wing of the RSS, the ideological mentor of the BJP. A 25-second video from the train compartment shows the women surrounded by some men, some of whom appear to be policemen.Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi has attacked the RSS on the issue, "The attack in UP on nuns from Kerala is a result of the vicious propaganda run by the Sangh Parivar to pitch one community against another and trample the minorities. Time for us as a nation to introspect and take corrective steps to defeat such divisive forces."

He said this in the context that India has already suffered adversely and was lagging behind economically advanced countries in absence of a robust institution to finance infrastructural projects.He said that the nationalised and traditional banks are not the right forum for lending long term loans. They are for the retail sector given their position of liquidity and cash-flow model.He said that infrastructural projects have long gestation periods, and the banks are not in a position to park their liquidity for such a long span period.Elaborating the issue further, he said it had been the bane of India for long in the past that banks were made to lend loans through influential interferences even for long term projects, and even ill-advised which were not sustainable. The loans were sanctioned without conducting feasibility reports.Such loanees were not able to pay up the interests, or return the principal sum to the banks. Consequently, there was  ballooning of NPAs, and financial crisis to banks- a legacy of the UPA government  which was inherited by the Narendra Modi governmentHe said the proposed institution in the Bill will help the country garner funds available galore in international markets. International investors are also looking for assured investments in infrastructure projects. India is at a vantage point for a leap of faith, and leapfrogging in development of infrastructure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to make the country modern, and infrastructure-heavy."India has a dream, and leader in Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to make the country a USD 5 trillion economy. Investment in infrastructure will help it make possible," Zafar Islam said.Criticising the UPA regimes for having left a legacy of depressive economic affairs, he said the present government has made things look up, and bullish."Huge opportunity beckons India, and this is the best time to have such a platform proposed in the Bill," Zafar Islam said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/zafar-islam-defends-govt-nbfid-bill-in-rajya-sabha-230318
25-03-2021||Agartala||Inspired by Himachal’s Hariman Sharma, 2 tribal youths grow apples in Tripura||Hit by the financial crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, two tribal youths in Tripura have scripted a 'fruitful' story hither to unheard in the northeastern state– growing apples of a different variety.Mujesh Debbarma (29) and his relative Samaresh Debbarma (41) have cultivated four varieties of apple on a hilly terrain measuring a little over one hectare in Borkur Bari tribal village in western Tripura's Sepahijala district.Mujesh said that the apples from their gardens are expected to hit the market for the first time in June-July this year."If we are able to do some business, we would extend the apple cultivation to more areas," Mujesh told IANS.Mujesh and Samaresh first started cultivating the HRMN-99 variety of apple during the lockdown last year. Subsequently, they procured saplings of three more varieties from Kolkata by spending around Rs 2 lakh.Unlike most apples which grow in areas that receive substantial snowfall, the HRMN-99 variety, a special type of apple developed by the 'Apple Man' of Himachal Pradesh, Hariman Sharma, can be grown in low altitudes and is suited to a relatively warm climate. Still, growing apples in the northeast remains a rare phenomenon.According to the officials of the Tripura Horticulture Department, the duo's efforts have unfolded a new chapter in apple cultivation, not just in Tripura, but in the entire northeastern region comprising eight states."During the lockdown, we saw some videos on YouTube of growing hybrid varieties of apple in Rajasthan. Then we thought if apples can be grown in Rajasthan in high tropical atmosphere, why not in Tripura?"We then contacted Hariman Sharma over phone, and he guided us on a number of occasions on how to go about with apple cultivation. Sharma Sir even couriered us 50 saplings last year, for which he didn't charge a single penny," Mujesh said.After tasting success with HRMN-99, Mujesh and Samaresh are now also growing other varieties of apples, such as Anna, Dorsett and Golden, after procuring saplings from Kolkata.Mujesh said that so far they have spent over Rs 5 lakh in planting around 250 apple trees of four varieties after developing the suitable shape in their land comprising small hillocks and a valley in the Borkur Bari tribal village, around 40 km south of Agartala.Like thousands of other tribals in the region, Mujesh and Samaresh were involved in rubber plantations before switching over to apple farming.Appreciating the enterprising efforts of the duo, Anjan Sen Gupta, a senior scientific officer at the Biotechnology Department of Tripura government, said that the first ever apple cultivation in Tripura is a unique and pioneering initiative taken up by the two tribal youth."Amtali near Borkur Bari, where the duo is cultivating apples, is a government-sponsored bio village. We have provided the duo with bio-fertilisers and other materials for their orchards, which are helping them a lot," Sen Gupta told IANS.Officials from the Biotechnology Department have helped the growers through regular monitoring and guidance on a range of issues, including prevention of pest infestation.Sen Gupta said that of the 250 trees planted by Mujesh and Samaresh, some 40-60 have blossomed and around 15 have bore fruits, two weeks after flowering."Due to the different types of apple varieties and climatic conditions, sweetness of the fruit might be a tad less," the official pointed out.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/inspired-by-himachals-hariman-sharma-2-tribal-youths-grow-apples-in-tripura-230316
25-03-2021||Washington||US needs to understand that India has long-standing relationship with Russia: American admiral||The US needs to understand that India has had a longstanding relationship with the Russians for security cooperation and military equipment, a top American admiral told lawmakers, indicating that he would push for encouraging New Delhi to move away from Moscow rather than taking the route of sanctions for the purchase of major defence equipment.Admiral John Aquilino, during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to be the next commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command or INDOPACOM, was responding to a question from Senator Jeanne Shaheen on India’s decision to purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia.“Should we sanction India if they acquire the S-400?” Shaheen asked.“I think I would leave that to the policymakers to determine... I think we certainly should understand where we are with India and I think potentially the encouragement angle in providing alternatives might be a better approach,” Aquilino replied.“India is really a terrific partner and as we’ve seen from the recent Quad discussions, I think the importance of India and the rest of the nations in the Quad will increase. We’re at a balance. However, India has had a longstanding relationship with the Russians for security cooperation and for military equipment,” he said.“... if confirmed, I would work to continue to encourage India to look at and consider US equipment. Number one, it’s the best. Number two, it generates interoperability and makes it easier to work together and I think we should encourage India to do that through all the elements of national power and see where that goes,” the US admiral told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee.Responding to another question from Senator Debra Fischer, Aquilino said the work, or the effort that India has taken on to protect its northern border amid a standoff with China is noteworthy.“The fact that the PRC has decided to instigate that skirmish on the northern border is noteworthy to all of us,” he said.“So, the strength of multilateral operations with India and with all allies and partners is certainly a mechanism to add to our deterrents in the region,” he added.“The deadly skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops underscored the high level of tension along the border and China has made no secret of its ambition to encircle India with military and economic influence. As INDOPACOM commander, how would you approach this dynamic and what do you see as the future of the US-India military cooperation?” Senator Fischer asked.“The work with India, the Quad, as well as all the allies and partners in the region, continues to be the strength and it highlights our ability to ensure that the entire force, the entire region understands the cooperation and the alignment with international norms, standards, rules and laws,” the admiral said.Aquilino said the goal of the Chinese is to supplant US security leadership in the region, be it in the South China Sea or on the northern border of India, and change international rules beyond what the nations agreed to under the 1982 UNCLOS Treaty to their benefit.The US admiral further said, “We need to engage with every aspect of national power to be able to compete against the PLA.”    Be it diplomacy, science or information, every aspect has the ability to generate deterrence, extend cooperation with allies and partners. And that’s one example from the military perspective this last year, he said.Senator Josh Hawley said the Quad appears to be forming the basis for a regional coalition to stand up to Chinese aggression.“How do you see the Quad contributing to deterrence in the Indo-Pacific now and in the future?” he asked.“It is extremely important when you look at India as the world’s largest democracy, combined with three other nations (that) have shared values and beliefs. When an organisation of that magnitude comes together, it would generate concern for anyone with an opposite opinion,” Aquilino said.Quad countries—the US, India, Australia and Japan—held their first virtual summit on March 12 during which President Joe Biden told leaders of the coalition that a “free and open” Indo-Pacific is essential to their countries and that his country was committed to working with its partners and allies in the region to achieve stability.

25-03-2021||Colombo||Sri Lanka Navy arrests 54 Indian fishermen, seizes 5 trawlers||The Sri Lankan Navy has arrested at least 54 Indian fishermen and seized five trawlers for allegedly poaching in the country’s territorial waters, an official statement said here on Thursday.The Navy arrested the fishermen on Wednesday off the coast of northern and northeastern areas.“Having considered the impact of foreign fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters on the local fishing community and the sustainability of fishery resources of Sri Lanka, the Navy is conducting regular patrols to curb illegal fishing activities in Sri Lankan waters”, the Navy said in the statement.The Navy nabbed a large Indian fishing vessel with 14 personnel on board, about 3 nautical miles off the coast of Kovilan in Jaffna.Two more Indian fishing vessels with 20 personnel for engaging in trawling were arrested about 7 nautical miles off Pesalai, Mannar and 5 nautical miles off the Iranativu Island, the statement said.Two more Indian fishing vessels with 20 personnel were arrested about 7.5 and 8.5 nautical miles off Mullaitivu. The two vessels had trespassed into Sri Lankan waters about 62 nautical miles, crossing the International Boundary Line (IMBL) when the apprehension was made, the Navy said in a statement.The Navy said it had previously informed the Indian authorities when similar incidents of trawling by Indian fishermen were reported.“The illegal entry of foreign fishermen into Sri Lankan waters and the use of prohibited fishing methods like bottom trawling to catch even very small fish has seriously threatened the marine ecosystem and endanger the livelihood of fishermen in the northern part of the island”.Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other’s waters. The fishermen issue has become a major irritant in bilateral ties.In January, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited Sri Lanka, he met with Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda and raised the fishermen issue and reviewed bilateral cooperation in fisheries.“We look forward to the early return of our fishermen from Sri Lanka,” Jaishankar had said.Later, a three-member committee was appointed by the Sri Lankan government which will make recommendations on measures to stop poaching by Indian fishermen inside the country’s waters after four people were killed when an Indian trawler capsized after colliding with a Sri Lankan Navy vessel.On January 18, the Sri Lankan Navy said that they seized Indian fishing trawlers allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters, trespassing the IMBL. The Navy said one of the Indian fishing trawlers, with aggressive manoeuvres attempted to evade the scene and collided with the Naval craft in operation and ultimately sank at sea having lost its stability.India also lodged a strong protest with Sri Lanka over the death of four fishermen in a collision between their vessel and a naval craft of the island nation.Also, During his five-day visit to India in February last year, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi agreed to resolve the long-festering fishermen issue with a “humane approach”.

However, for some of the core technologies, India looks up to its friends like the US. The United States has these technologies, however, the high cost of labour does not make it cost-effective."There is a strong case for us to work together with the advantage of cutting-edge technology of the US and India's cost-competitive skilled labour," he said during his address at a webinar on 'Shipbuilding Opportunities in India'."We urge industries on both sides to make full utilisation of the strategic trade authorisation licence exemption granted by the US to India in 2018, as well as the bilateral Industrial Security Annex Agreement signed in 2019. Together we can reach out to the global markets and make for the world," Sandhu said."With our joint efforts we can produce some of the world's finest and most economical platforms for our partners and friendly nations," he said.Organised by the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum in partnership with Mazgaon Dock Ltd, the first ever high-level industry interaction on opportunities for increased US-India collaboration on shipbuilding, repair and maintenance was also addressed by Raj Kumar, secretary of Defence Production in India's Defence Ministry.Discussions during the virtual conference focused on greater collaboration between US and Indian industry leaders across defence and commercial shipbuilding sectors.

This is clearly a proof of misuse of central agencies by the party in power at the centre,” the letter said. He alleged the actions by the central agencies against TMC leaders were designed to influence the voters in the state by showing TMC in a bad light.The letter further alleged a battery of BJP heavyweights, including the Prime Minister, Home Minister, other central ministers and CMs of BJP-ruled states, had been using their official transport and other government paraphernalia while visiting West Bengal for election campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-central-agencies-targeting-candidates-230109

Hence, we are walking out,” Leader of the Opposition in the House Mallikarjun Kharge said after the discussion on the Bill was completed.Earlier, the House witnessed heated exchanges between Opposition and ruling party members.The SAD, TDP, YSRCC, BJD, TMC, RJD and AAP were among the regional parties that opposed the Bill during the discussion, saying it encroached upon powers of the state governments and was against federalism.Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy tried to allay Opposition members’ apprehension that the Bill would make irrelevant the elected government in the NCT Delhi.Sad day for democracy: KejriwalNew Delhi: Soon after the passage of the GNCTD Bill, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said it was a sad day for democracy. “The RS passes GNCTD Bill. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he added.

While 10 states have achieved 100 per cent coverage of health workers with the first dose, Punjab, despite adequate vaccine supplies, has not been able to cover even the identified groups. Likewise, only 63 per cent of the health workers have received the first shots in Chandigarh,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. The Centre will meet district magistrates and health officials of Punjab’s most affected districts — Jalandhar; SAS Nagar, Ludhiana, Patiala and Hoshiarpur — for a review on Saturday.In another major development, the government disclosed that the apex genome sequencing consortium had detected 771 Covid variants of concern (VOCs) in 18 states. Of these, 736 were positive for the UK variant; 34 for the South African and one for the Brazilian variant. Of the 771 VOCs, 336 are in Punjab alone and all are UK strains.Asked if the surge was linked to the mutations, Member, Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul said the variants were not in enough numbers to be linked to the surge some states like Maharashtra, Kerala and Punjab were witnessing. Both Indian-made vaccines were effective against UK and Brazil strains and studies on the South African variant were underway.“Mutations of the virus are natural and there is no cause for panic. But we need to be cautious,” Paul said, adding that India had not seen any case of blood clotting due to Covishield.“There is no inadequacy in the availability of vaccines. The systems are ready. But we must expand using private facilities,” said Paul.In Punjab, only 38.48% of all Covid vaccine centres are private and in Haryana 21.24%.Mutants detected across 18 statesSpike in infections not due to mutations: Government||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-flags-rapid-surge-slow-vaccine-pace-in-punjab-230119

It also appears that a lot of material which has come in public domain is a consequence of the personas falling out.”“He (Param Bir) is making some allegations and the minister is also making some allegations. I don’t see a point why you should not move the high court,” Justice Kaul said.“If investigation by an independent agency is being asked for, it will also be granted by the high court which has wider powers under Article 226 of the Constitution,” the Bench said.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi appearing on behalf of Param Bir said: “This is a matter of serious public interest. The entire state is rocked… Police reforms have not taken place.”Justice Kaul pointed out: “That’s the case (police reforms not taking place) with all states…Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh not just Maharashtra.”“It appears that none wants to give up… the control of police transfers or implement measures that would insulate the police machinery from performing its role without any uncalled for interference,” the Bench said.NIA slaps UAPA against WazeThe NIA has slapped charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against Mumbai cop Sachin Waze, who was arrested on March 13 in connection with the recovery of an SUV with 20 gelatin sticks and a threat note, parked near Antilia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-ex-top-cop-issue-serious-but-move-bombay-high-court-230123

Ingale directed the ATS to hand over to the NIA all the case papers pertaining to the Hiran death case, as per the Centre’s directives.After hearing all sides, the CJM said in her order: “In the present case, the police officers of ATS shall not proceed with the investigation in this crime and transmit all relevant documents and records to the concerned NIA officer without delay.” The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh who submitted to the Court that the Union Home Ministry had directed the Central agency to take over the case from the ATS on March 20.Representing the ATS, Additional Public Prosecutor Anita R. Supare-Deotale argued that the Maharashtra government has not issued any directions on the transfer of the probe to the NIA so far.The ASG, however, contended that the Centre had sent a letter on March 22 to the state Director General of Police who, in turn, informed the state government on March 23 about the transfer of the ATS case to the NIA, which was also confirmed by the ATS Investigating Officer.

25-03-2021||Kolkata||Bengal BJP chief’s ‘Wear Bermudas’ remark sparks outrage||A video of BJP state president Dilip Ghosh apparently suggesting West Bengal Chief Minister should wear bermuda shorts to display her injured leg has triggered controversy with the ruling TMC slamming it as a “distasteful comment” and women expressing outrage over the remark in social media.While no one was named in the purported speech by Ghosh, known for his controversial comments in the past, most commentators took the comments to be directed at Banerjee.In the video, veracity of which could not be confirmed by PTI, Ghosh was seen stating at an election meeting in Purulia on Monday that after the cast was taken off and the foot was bandaged, she is displaying the leg to everyone.“She is wearing saree with one leg covered but kept another kept open for viewing. Haven’t seen anyone draping a saree in such a way,” he’s heard saying in the video. “If she has to display her leg for viewing, she can very well wear bermuda shorts. That will help to have a better view,” the BJP MP was purportedly heard stating.Sharply reacting to the purported comment by the BJP leader, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) said in a Twitter post in Bengali, “We can expect such distasteful comments only from Dilip Ghosh. His deplorable comments about a woman chief minister prove Bengal BJP leaders don’t know how to show respect to women”.“Mothers and sisters of Bengal will give a befitting reply to such insults to Mamata Banerjee on May 2.”Trinamool Congress MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said in a tweet, “It now appears that the role of @BJP4Bengal State President has been merely reduced to that of venom-spitting”.From scathing attacks towards the CM of Bengal to violence towards @AITCofficial workers—he has conveniently crossed all limits.Shocking words, once again!”TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s tweet on Dilip Ghosh’s remark said “@BJP WB Pres asks in public meeting why Mamatadi is wearing a saree, she should be wearing Bermuda shorts to display her leg better.“And these perverted... (people) think they are going to win Bengal?”BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya told PTI, there was no need to create a controversy over the remark.“I think such comments should not be taken seriously. The chief minister makes many intemperate remarks against the BJP and our leaders at public meetings. Dilip Ghosh is a generous person. Even if he made such a comment at a rally, it has to be kept in mind that many things are said at election meetings which should not be always considered seriously,” Bhattacharya said. “Ghosh has great respect for the chief minister. So no controversy should be created.”Ghosh who was campaigning in Purulia district on Tuesday could not be reached for his reaction.The BJP state president has earlier been in the midst of controversies for his comments which ranged from claims that ‘desi’ (Indian) cows milk have gold content to demands that Balakot-like surgical strikes be carried out on Jadavpur university to drive out communists.His purported comment triggered protest in Facebook too with some women expressing outrage.“Dear Dilipda. If men can go out in public in bermuda shorts baring their legs, women hope you shouldn’t have any issue with them wearing bermudas as well.“It is very comfortable for both genders. And certainly the CM can wear it if she wishes,” Chaitali Biswas, a Facebook user, posted in her timeline inviting many likes.The chief minister sustained injuries on her left leg, hip, forearm, neck and shoulder at an incident in Nandigram soon after filing her nomination papers on March 10.She had alleged that the BJP hatched a conspiracy to prevent her from campaigning by organising an attack, a charge denied by the saffron camp.The Election Commission had concluded that the chief minister had suffered injuries following an accident, due to a security lapse. — PTI@BJP WB Pres asks in public meeting why Mamatadi is wearing a saree, she should be wearing “Bermuda” shorts to display her leg betterAnd these perverted depraved monkeys think they are going to win Bengal?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-bjp-chiefs-wear-bermudas-remark-sparks-outrage-229910

25-03-2021||Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh)/Kottayam (Kerala)||Nuns heckled in UP train, Shah vows action||Members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), who allegedly heckled and forced two nuns and two novices to get off a train in Jhansi district, are now in the midst of a major controversy.Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday assured that strict action would be taken against all those involved.He said this while addressing an election rally of former Union Minister of Tourism and presently BJP Rajya Sabha member KJ Alphons, who is contesting from his home turf, Kanjirapally, a constituency which he represented as a Left Independent candidate between 2006 and 11 as well.“Our government is always concerned about the minority communities and I assure you that there will be strict action against those who harassed the nuns in Uttar Pradesh,” said Shah.He went on to point out that the state government in Uttar Pradesh is one of the strongest governments in the country where the rule of law is imposed strictly. “I assure all of you that all those who are guilty of harassing the nuns would be brought before the rule of law and the maximum punishment would be given,” added Shah.The Kerala unit of the BJP gave a memorandum on the harassment suffered by the nuns to Shah when he arrived in the state last night for Wednesday’s day-long election campaign.Shah’s announcement came after Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to the MHA seeking strict action in the matter.On March 19, the ABVP members had accused the nuns and novices of carrying out religious conversions.The four were allowed to proceed only after an inquiry at the railway station established there was no conversion involved.The ABVP is the student’s wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the BJP.“Those involved in the Jhansi nuns’ harassment incident will be brought before the law,” Amit Shah told reporters in Delhi on Wednesday.According to reports, the incident took place last week when the nuns were travelling on the Haridwar-Puri Utkal Express.A 25-second video from the train compartment shows the women surrounded by some men, some of whom appear to be policemen.“Go get your luggage. You will be sent home if what you are saying is correct,” a man is heard saying while another is heard saying, “Why are you indulging in netagiri?” “Arre what netagiri. Chaliye madam. Jaldi uthao samaan,” the third man is heard saying.Naeem Khan Mansuri, the Superintendent of Railway Police in Jhansi in a detailed statement said: “There were some members of the ABVP who were returning from a training camp in Rishikesh on board the Utkal express to Jhansi.“Four Christian ladies were travelling on the same train from Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi to Rourkela in Odisha. Two of them were nuns and two were under training. These members of the ABVP suspected that these two nuns were taking the other two women for conversion because the nuns were speaking to the other ladies.“They informed the Railway Protection Force that then informed the railway police. These ABVP members also gave a written complaint about conversion. I reached the spot and made inquiries. These inquiries revealed that the two other women were from Odisha’s Rourkela and were under training.“We checked their certificates and both had 2003 baptism certificates and this proved both women by birth were Christian and that no conversion was involved. After this we sent all four women onwards to their destination in Odisha.” When contacted on Wednesday, the SP, however, did not respond to calls.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nuns-heckled-in-up-train-shah-vows-action-229872
25-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||771 Covid variants of concern in India but not enough to cause surge: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 24The government on Wednesday said apex genome sequencing body had detected 771 Covid variants of concern but not in enough numbers to be linked to the surge some states like Maharashtra, Kerala and Punjab are witnessing.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a grouping of 10 National Laboratories that was established by Ministry of Health, has been carrying out genomic sequencing and analysis of circulating Covid-19 viruses, and correlating epidemiological trends with genomic variants.Genomic variants of various viruses are a natural phenomenon and are found in almost all countries.With daily Covid surge continuing the government on Wednesday said since INSACOG initiated its work, 771 variants of concerns (VOCs) had been detected in 10,787 positive samples shared by states and UTs.“These include 736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage; 34 samples were found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage and one sample was found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage. The samples with these VOCs have been identified in 18 states of the country.”Genome sequencing and analysis have been carried out on samples from arriving international travellers, contacts of those positive for VOC and community samples from most of the states at INSACOG partner laboratories which are 10 in number.“The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. These mutations have been found in about 15-20 per cent of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs. These have been categorised as VOCs but require the same epidemiological and public health response of “increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases and contacts as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol by the states and UTs.”From Kerala 2,032 samples (from all 14 districts) have been sequenced.The N440K variant that is associated with immune escape has been found in 123 samples from 11 districts. This variant was earlier found in 33 per cent of samples from Andhra Pradesh, and in 53 of 104 samples from Telangana.“This variant has also been reported from 16 other countries, including the UK, Denmark, Singapore, Japan and Australia. As of now, these can at best be said to be variant under investigation. Though VOCs and a new double mutant variant have been found in India, these have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish or direct relationship or explain the rapid increase in cases in some states. Genomic sequencing and epidemiological studies are continuing to further analyse the situation,” said the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/771-covid-variants-of-concern-in-india-but-not-enough-to-cause-surge-govt-229850
25-03-2021||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to entertain Param Bir Singh’s plea against Maharashtra minister; asks him to go to Bombay HC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 24Refusing to entertain former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh’s petition seeking an "unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair" CBI probe into his allegations of corruption against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, the Supreme Court on Wednesday asked him to approach the Bombay High Court.A Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul wondered why Singh didn’t approach the Bombay High Court and why the person against the petition has been filed (Deshmukh) was not made a party to the case.“This is a matter of serious public interest for the whole nation. A police officer is transferred citing administrative grounds but the Home Minister himself said on TV that it’s not an administrative transfer… The entire State is rocked. Police reforms have not taken place,” senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi submitted on behalf of Singh.“The point is simple. He (Singh) is making some allegations and the Minister is also making some allegations. I don't see a point why you should not move the high court,” Justice Kaul said, adding high courts have wider powers under Article 226 of the constitution.As Rohatgi said the top court had entertained petitions under Article 32 on much lesser important issues,” the Bench shot back, “If you give a list of cases entertained under 32, I can also give cases we have relegated back to high courts.”While agreeing with Rohatgi that it’s a serious matter, the top court said, “The high court can deal with it.”On the issue of police reforms, Justice Kaul pointed out “That’s the case with all states – Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh... Not just Maharashtra.”The Bench said, “We have no doubt matter is quite serious affecting administration at large. In view of it, liberty to approach the high court is granted.”Singh -- who had written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray accusing Deshmukh of "interfering" in investigations – had sought directions to the Maharashtra Government, the Centre and the CBI to immediately take into custody the CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence.Rohatgi said Singh’s petition would be filed in the high court on Wednesday itself. He requested the top court to issue a direction to the high court to take up the matter on Thursday as CCTV evidence was involved.“The request is to be made before the high court,” said the top court.Terming the March 17 order transferring him from the post of Mumbai Police chief before completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years as “arbitrary” and “illegal”, the 1988 batch IPS officer had said it was more of a politically influenced move by certain political parties aggrieved by the revelation of the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the Chief Minister."He had also urged the court to protect him from any further coercive steps apprehended in retaliation for laying bare Deshmukh’s alleged misdeeds.While denying Singh’s allegations, Deshmukh had issued a press release threatening to initiate defamation proceedings against him.He had accused Deshmukh of interfering in various investigations and instructing the police officers to conduct the same in a particular manner as desired by him.“Deshmukh had been holding meetings in February, 2021 at his residence with police officers including Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai and Sanjay Patil, ACP Social Service Branch, Mumbai, bypassing their seniors and had instructed them that he had a target to accumulate Rs 100 crore every month and had directed to collect money from various establishments and other sources,” Singh had alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-param-bir-singhs-plea-against-maharashtra-minister-asks-him-to-go-to-bombay-hc-229838
