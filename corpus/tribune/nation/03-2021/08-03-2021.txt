08-03-2021||New Delhi||Batla House encounter: Politics of polarisation, controversies and Bollywood||On September 19, 2008, a week after serial blasts tore through the capital, police stormed into a house in Batla House locality searching for terrorists.What followed has been written into contemporary history as the ‘Batla House encounter’ that polarised the city, caused a media frenzy and was even cinematically recreated in Bollywood.On Monday, the much-debated Batla House gunbattle in which one Delhi Police officer lost his life, two of his colleagues injured and two terrorists were killed was back in focus with a court convicting alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) member Ariz Khan.Read also: Indian Mujahideen man Ariz Khan convicted in Batla House encounter caseKhan, who was arrested on February 14, 2018 after being on the run for a decade, was held guilty for the murder of inspector Mohan Chand Sharma of Delhi Police’s Special Cell and other offences in connection with the encounter. He faces a maximum punishment of death while the minimum sentence is life imprisonment.The case stirred a political storm, raised questions from rights activists on the actions of Special Cell officers, divided public opinion and became a raging controversial topic in the media that continues till date.Karnal Singh, then chief of the Special Cell, recapped many details of the police operation that fateful day at house number L-18 in the Batla House locality of Jamia Nagar in south Delhi in his book “Batla House: An Encounter that Shook the Nation”.Fake news and “street rumours” were picked up by a section of politicians, activists and media to paint the 2008 Batla House encounter of IM terrorists as staged, he had said last year while talking about his book.Six days earlier, on September 13, 2008, a series of five blasts in the national capital killed at least 30 people and left over 100 injured. Karnal Singh spearheaded a probe into the blasts as the head or joint commissioner of police of the elite Special Cell that was raised specifically to undertake counterterrorist operations.The gunfight that broke out is viewed by many to be among the most politicised police encounters in the country. It saw sparring between the Congress and the BJP with many leaders of the former raising questions over the encounter and those from the saffron party accusing their Congress counterparts of appeasing minority community and going soft on terrorism.Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s reported remarks that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi cried seeing the encounter images also resulted in a political firestorm with the BJP accusing the Congress of playing appeasement politics.According to political observers, elections in Delhi till then were about development issues when it came to wooing voters but the Batla House encounter changed that. The politics of polarisation became part and parcel of the political landscape of the national capital after that.Political commentator and senior journalist Rasheed Kidwai said there were earlier some kind of undercurrents of polarising politics in the capital, which has been like a melting pot of the country, but it became very pronounced after the Batla House encounter.The incident gained traction in political discourse because it was a matter involving national security and politicians used polarising language which made matters worse.The encounter also formed the basis of an action thriller film by the same name directed by Nikkhil Advani. John Abraham and Mrunal Thakur starred in the movie.On Monday Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav convicted Khan and said “the evidence produced by the prosecution duly proved the case beyond reasonable doubts”.After the encounter of September 19, 2008, protest rallies were organised against it by teachers and students of Jamia Millia Islamia University.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which had conducted an inquiry in the case on the direction of the Delhi High Court, gave a clean chit to Delhi Police.Two suspected terrorists, Atif Ameen and Mohammad Sajid were killed while two other suspects—Mohammad Saif and Zeeshan were arrested earlier.

Also, present was Kisan Morcha’s Legal Cell member Vasu Kukreja, who suffered a swollen eye.ABVP, however, claims that the clash was started by the organisers. “DUSU was organising a self-defence clinic today. And these people, majority of which were outsiders, were holding a meet outside the Conference Centre of Arts Faculty,” ABVP State Secretary Siddharth Yadav said.“When DUSU joint secretary Shivangi and few others came out they objected to a few posters that were showing our forces in bad light. On finding that these people had no permission to hold the event an argument happened. Someone grabbed her chunni and then scuffle broke out,” he explained.Yadav also said that the police then intervened and few persons from both the sides were detained. However, Sangeeta Geet claimed that the brawl was started by the ABVP supporters.“They began tearing our posters down. Some of them, including Shivangi Kharwal were abusing us and the police just looked the other way,” Geet said.“My clothes were torn, Nodeep was dragged away. Advocate Kukreja suffered an injury. Comrade Ravinder and a few SFI activists were detained while ABVP got away,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/womens-day-turns-ugly-nodeep-kaur-others-involve-in-scuffle-with-abvp-222422
08-03-2021||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel shows ‘serious displeasure’ on low health budget||The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health on Monday questioned the government for hyping up sector allocations and said only 32 per cent of the wellbeing budget was actually meant for health department.In a report on Monday, the committee said government expenditure on health research including for ICMR was a meagre 0.02 per cent of the GDP, which was grossly insufficient for a department leading research in COVID times.The panel added that the 137 per cent increase in the health outlay from  Rs 94,452 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 2,23,846 crore in 2021-22 did not compensate the inadequate funds allocated to both the  Departments of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of AYUSH.“This Rs 2,23,846 crore outlay on Health and Well Being includes the budget for the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health Research, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of AYUSH, Package for Vaccination, Nutrition and Finance Commission Grants for Water and Sanitation and Finance Commission Grants for Health. Thus effectively, the budgetary allocation for health is just 32 per cent of the much-hyped Rs 2,23,846 crore funds,” said the panel.It expressed “serious displeasure” over health budget allocations remaining consistently low.“Projected demands of the Department of Health and Family Welfare were Rs 1,21,889.55 crore in budget estimates 2021-22. It has been allocated  Rs 71,268.77—only 58.48 pc of projected demands leading to a shortfall of Rs. 50,620.78 crore,” the panel said recommending urgent and massive investments in health as evidenced by COVID 19.“The Covid pandemic clearly exposed the fragility and inadequacy of healthcare infrastructure,” said the panel, recommending that the government increase health expenditure to 2.5 pc of GDP in the next two years and to 5 per cent by 2025.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-shows-serious-displeasure-on-low-health-budget-222415
08-03-2021||Satya Prakash||‘Should Mandal verdict be reconsidered by a larger Bench?’ SC to examine||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 8Almost three decades after a nine-judge Bench put a 50 per cent ceiling on reservation in government jobs and education, the Supreme Court on Monday decided to examine if its 1992 verdict in the Mandal case (Sawhney versus Union of India) needed to be examined afresh.“Whether judgment in case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India needs to be referred to larger bench or require re-look by the larger bench in the light of subsequent Constitutional Amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics of the society etc.?” read one of the questions framed by a five-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan for its consideration.While upholding the reservation for OBCs, a nine-judge Constitution Bench had put a 50 per cent ceiling on quota in government jobs and declared reservations in promotions unconstitutional. It had also made it mandatory to exclude the creamy layer among OBCs while giving the benefit of reservation to them.On Monday, while dealing with the issue of Maratha reservation, it asked all states to put forth their views on a question of "seminal importance" as to whether legislatures were competent to declare a particular caste to be socially and educationally backward for grant of quota.Fixing March 15 for commencement of hearing, it asked the states to file their brief written submissions on the issue after Attorney General KK Venugopal said states should be heard as they might be affected by the decision on interpretation of the 102nd amendment.The Bench – which also included Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice S Abdul Nazeer, Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice S Ravindra Bhat -- would examine if a state legislature is competent enough to declare a particular caste to be socially and educationally backward for grant of quota.The top court had on September 9 stayed the implementation of the legislation and referred to a larger bench the batch of pleas challenging the validity of law, but made it clear that status of those who have availed of the benefits would not be disturbed.The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, of Maharashtra was enacted to grant reservation to people of the Maratha community in the state in jobs and admissions.The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June 2019, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.The high court had said that the 50-per-cent cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.Now, the top court has decided to examine the 102nd amendment to the Constitution dealing with reservation to a particular community, named in the list prepared by the President. The 102nd Constitution amendment Act, 2018 inserted Article 338B (deals with the structure, duties and powers of National Commission of Backward Class) and 342A (power of the President to notify a particular caste as Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) and the power of Parliament to change the SEBC list.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/should-mandal-verdict-be-reconsidered-by-a-larger-bench-sc-to-examine-222414

I probably wouldn't have got it had Sachin not resigned."Similarly, when I became BCCI president, I didn’t know the minute before I would be the BCCI president. That's the way my life has been...So we will see where it goes," he said.According to him, opportunities need to be considered factoring in various aspects of someone's life."Opportunities come and you get influenced by a lot of things, your family, lifestyle, work, health, we will see where it goes," he didn't give away anything despite saying a lot of things.He laughed off the attention that he gets in his home city Kolkata, crediting it to his friendly demeanour."I am fortunate to get so much attention. I don't seek it and I go about doing my job. I lead a normal life in this city. I speak to people, talk to them and that's my nature."I am a very friendly sort of a person with no hang ups. I don't take to heart what people say. Because I am a popular person, I don't believe that I have to be unreachable."I lead my life because at the end of the day it's life and that's why people are fond of me over here."           Crowds in IPL    Ganguly said allowing crowd in the IPL would have been a bigger logistical issue compared to letting in limited fans during the recently-concluded Test series versus England.The BCCI has announced that no crowds will be allowed at the venues – Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad – where the matches will be played with no home games for any franchise."We have planned it well and we are doing it in clusters. There will be three chartered flights (at the max) for every team. Hopefully, we will be able to manage."During England tour, teams have only two domestic chartered flights (Chennai to Ahmedabad and next will be Ahmedabad to Pune)," said Ganguly."The numbers are much less but fingers crossed as it's a huge tournament, the BCCI did it successfully in Dubai and hopefully, we can do it this time as well," he added.He didn't say when the BCCI would consider having crowds back for the IPL."Don’t know yet, depends on situation. Dubai also was the same," he said referring to the 2020 IPL in the UAE."It's slightly different from bilateral. If you open up for crowd (in IPL) with teams practising outside the stadiums, you expect crowds to get closer to practising teams during IPL, so that could be a risk," he said with a note of caution.

YSRCP is misusing the police force to favour its own candidates”.Showing confidence over his party nominees, Owaisi said they will give the fight to the political stalwarts and win. “I want to tell everyone that my party candidates cannot be won over by any pressure or allurement,” he said.He said the YSRCP was misleading the people, adding: “ITI college for minorities was built with the funds of the central government, but the state government is not starting the classes. The state government is also planning to demolish an Eidgah in Adoni town. This decision should be withdrawn”. The AIMIM leader said that the government was trying to convert the local Jama Masjid into a parking lot. The construction of the Urdu college and school building that was started in 2019 is yet to be completed—if the AIMIM candidates win they will prevail upon the government to complete the unfinished project besides seeking 4 per cent reservation for Muslims in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisi-accuses-ysrcp-of-attempting-to-buy-over-candidates-222410

08-03-2021||New Delhi||Serum Institute seeks govt’s intervention over import of COVID vaccine raw material from US||Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, has sought the central government’s intervention so as to enable the firm import essential raw materials from the US for uninterrupted manufacturing and supply of COVID-19 vaccines.In a letter to Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Pune-based SII, Prakash Kumar Singh said the US government has invoked the Defence Production Act because of which the firm is facing difficulties in importing necessary products like cell culture medias, raw material, single-use tubing assemblies and some specialty chemicals from the US.He said in the letter that Covishield vaccine manufactured by the SII is being widely used in India and across the globe and millions of people have been vaccinated with it.Singh further said the Serum Institute is working on many other COVID-19 vaccine projects in technical collaboration with various Institutions i.e. Novavax (US), Codagenix (US) etc. for which it depends on import of many necessary products like raw materials, consumables and components from various foreign manufacturers, especially from the US.“Through the Defence production Act, the US government has established two prioritising systems, Defence Priorities and Allocations System Program (DPAS) and Health Resources Priority and Allocations System (HRPAS). The HRPAS has two principal components i.e. priorities and allocations. Under the priority component, certain contracts between the government and private parties or between private parties for the production or delivery of industrial resources required to produce COVID-19 vaccine will be given priority over other contracts to facilitate expedited delivery in promotion of the US, National defence,” he said in the letter.This essentially means that if the orders from US manufacturers are rated/prioritised under the above-mentioned systems they take precedence over orders of manufacturers of other countries, Singh stated.He said the whole world is depending on mass manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccine at an uninterrupted speed and scale to end the pandemic. “But if we cannot get timely supplies of these essential products from the US, it is going to be a serious limiting factor resulting in acute shortage of COVID-19 vaccines as their manufacture depends on uninterrupted supply of these raw materials, consumables and components etc,” Singh said in the letter dated March 6.“I humbly request for your kind intervention to resolve this matter in larger public interest. This will enable us to import these essential products soon from the US for uninterrupted manufacturing and supply of COVID-19 Vaccines in India and globally,” he said.

The venue has been shifted keeping in mind the existing Covid situation in Maharashtra.The meeting will see “elections” for the important post of the RSS general secretary – the Sangh sarkaryavah. Whether there will be a new sarkaryavah, remains to be seen. Incumbent, Suresh ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi, has been in the position for almost 12 years now.Meanwhile, sources said discussions would be held on connecting and linking new social/welfare organisations, with whom RSS volunteers came in touch during their social work in the Covid pandemic, with the Sangh circle .Issues related to agriculture and farmers and plans and programmes to mark 75 years of Independence will also be discussed. However, ongoing farmers’ agitation is not a part of the agenda, they said.    "Punjab contributed almost Rs 100 crore towards Ram Mandir construction. We faced no questions on the agitation during the fund-raising drive, including in rural areas.  At the social level, farmers’ agitation is not an issue. It is a political matter. We will discuss how agriculture and farmers' welfare can be made a constructive movement,” they said.While the Sabha has around 1400 to 1500 members, this year, due to Covid protocols, around 500 to 600 members will be present in the meeting.The Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha is considered the most important meeting as organisational changes are made in it. Organisational issues and training camps/activities scheduled for the year are also discussed during the meeting.“In Covid times we managed to increase our social outreach and our circle has increased. We aim to bring the new contacts into the circle,” said the sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-day-rss-meet-in-bengaluru-from-march-19-222403

Most often without intending to harm, people make comments which are patronising. They don’t realise the implicit gender bias in those utterances made as humour. The language of communication has to be gender sensitive. In Indian languages there are ways to make women related references light heartedly, references like ‘choodiyaan nahi pehni hain’ that reinforce anti-women stereotypes. We have to gently ask for avoidance of such remarks,” said ther FM.As someone who breached a male bastion to lead the finance ministry, Sitharaman said the terms of engagement for men and women leaders should not vary.“I don’t want anyone to be more accommodative of me because I am a woman. I am an MP, you are an MP. Let us all be MPs. Similarly, talk to me like you would talk to male ministers. Terms of engagement should not change if I am wearing a saree and someone else is wearing pants and suits,” said the minister.Acknowledging that she was a beneficiary of the 33 per cent reservation the BJP gave to women in party organisation, the FM asked: “We must probe ourselves and ask whether reservations would be all or whether we need to do something beyond that”,Speaker Om Birla later said the percentage of women voters had constantly risen from the first General Election in 1952 until on Monday.“This is a marker of the confidence of women and this helps strengthen democracy.

The e-auctions have started in the state with over 7,000 such shops following the process as of now.Going with the new rule, the bidding at a wine shop in Hanumangarh started at 11 am in the morning which ended after midnight and that too, after the highest bid was over Rs 500 crore.The bidding started at Rs 72 lakh in the morning and it went on for the entire day and after midnight, it ended at 2 am with the highest price quoted at an astronomical Rs 510 crore. Ever since the new policy has been implemented, the e-auction of wine shops in Rajasthan is witnessing an average of over 30 per cent higher bidding than the base price, said officials.Excise officials said that the e-auction for the wine shops started three days ago. Under the same process, one Kiran Kanwar from Nohar got the wine shop in Rs 510-crore bid which is around 708 times more than the base price."As per the rule, a demand notice needs to be sent to the bidder who has to deposit two per cent of the bidding amount in the next three days or else his allotment gets cancelled. If the bidder fails to deposit the money, then the security deposit of over Rs 1 lakh shall be forfeited," said officials.Besides Nohar, a wine shop in Churu district has been sold in a bid of Rs 11 crore and another shop in Jaipur's Sanganer has been sold in an e-auction for Rs 8.91 crores.In fact many shops in Sujangarh, Churu and Hanumangarh are earning crores in auction although the base price of these shops has been between Rs 1-2 crores only, officials added.However, some wine traders are citing competition for the high bidding for getting wine shops.As per the new excise policy of the government of Rajasthan, now liquor shop allotment is being done through e-auction instead of the earlier system of a lottery.Former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had abolished the system but under Ashok Gehlot, the bidding system has started again.As per the state excise policy for 2021-22 declared recently, beer has been made cheaper and will be available at a lower price from April 1.The new excise policy announced a reduction in additional excise duty and MRP on beer, which will reduce its price by Rs 30-Rs 35. Also, there will be no more Covid surcharge on all excise items, except Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and bottled-in-origin (BIO) or imported liquor.Further, there will be no special vend fees on IMFL and beer.

08-03-2021||Bhopal||MP Assembly passes bill penalising fraudulent conversions||The Madhya Pradesh Assembly on Monday passed a bill that penalises religious conversion through marriage or any other fraudulent means and provides for a prison sentence of up to 10 years.While the opposition Congress questioned the need for a new law, Home Minister Narottam Mishra said unlike the 1968 legislation, the present act provides for annulment of marriage and a harsher sentence.The act also provides for fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.It replaced an ordinance promulgated by the BJP government on January 9. A similar law has been enforced in the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh. The ordinance barred religious conversion by “misrepresentation, allurement, use of threat of force, undue influence, coercion, marriage or by any other fraudulent means”.After the ‘Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill 2021’ was passed by a voice vote, some BJP MLAs chanted “Jai Shri Ram”.Replying to the debate before the bill was passed, Home Minister Mishra said the government would not tolerate “Rafiq becoming Ravi” for “Love Jihad”.The government was not “averse to love but is against Jihad”, he said.The Congress objected to the bill, just as it had opposed in Parliament the Citizenship Amendment Act, the law banning triple talaq and abolition of Article 370, he said.“There is peace in the (Kashmir) valley now,” he added.Mishra also accused the Congress of instilling fear among Muslims and claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister, indulged in “politics of division”.Congress members Vinay Saxena and others objected to this remark and said it should be expunged.Acting Speaker Laxman Singh said the House should focus on the bill.Mishra further said the bill provides for annulment of marriage solemnised through unfair means, makes fraudulent conversion a non-bailable offence with punishment upto 10 years and puts the onus of proving innocence on the accused.It also penalises NGOs or other groups that organise and fund unlawful marriages, the home minister said.Under the earlier 1968 Act, there was no provision of annulling marriages, and conversion was a bailable offences with maximum sentence of two years, Mishra noted.After the ordinance came into effect, 23 cases were registered within a month, he informed.Neither Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan nor Congress leader and Leader of Opposition Kamal Nath were present in the House during the debate and voice vote.Opposing the bill, senior Congress leader Govind Singh said there was no need for a new law as the MP Dharm Swatantra Adhiniyam, 1968, was already in place.The bill will not benefit people in any way and was only a political stunt, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-assembly-passes-bill-penalising-fraudulent-conversions-222389
08-03-2021||New Delhi||Every day 4 child victims of sexual abuse denied justice due to insufficient evidence: Study||Every day four child victims of sexual offences are denied justice due to closure of their cases by police because of insufficient evidence, according to a new study.The ‘Police case disposal pattern: An enquiry into the cases filed under POCSO Act, 2012’ by Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation (KSCF), is an analysis of pattern of disposal of POCSO cases by police from 2017 to 2019 and is based on the data and information published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).The study has been released on the occasion of International Women's Day."It has been observed that between 2017 and 2019, there has been an increase in the number of cases that have been closed by the police after investigation without filing the chargesheet," the study pointed out.As the data shows, sexual crimes are increasing in the country over the years."While the government recognised the need for a special law and introduced a special legislation to deal with crimes against children viz., Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO), it is disappointing to see its poor implementation on the ground," the study noted.As many as 3,000 POCSO cases registered and investigated fail to reach court for a fair trial every year and four child victims of sexual abuse are denied justice every day due to the closure of their cases by police because of insufficient evidence or lack of a clue, the study said."It has further been revealed from the NCRB data that in a large number  of POCSO cases (two-fifths) which were disposed-off/closed by the police without chargesheeting the reason cited was 'cases true but insufficient evidence, or untraced, or no clue'," it said.In 2019, 43 per cent of cases were closed by police on this ground as per the final reports filed in court, the study said."This is higher than 2017 and 2018. Amongst other reasons, false reporting was the second most prominent reason for closure of POCSO cases, however closure of cases on this ground has reduced over the years from 40 per cent in 2017 to 33 per cent in 2019," the study said.Also, another analysis of the POCSO cases for the same period ( 2017 to 2019) by KSCF reveals that there is an urgent need for courts to expedite the justice delivery mechanism as victims of as many as 89 per cent of the cases of child sexual abuse were awaiting justice at the end of 2019."The backlog of cases pending investigation is also increasing from year to year as the number of cases whose investigation is completed in a year is lesser than the number of cases in which chargesheets are filed. This gap demonstrates that police are not devoting adequate resources to deal with these grave crimes," it said.The study has revealed 51 per cent of cases under the POCSO were registered in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi."This brings out the need for social interventions in these states for better protection of children both within their homes and the society," it said.The conviction rate in the POCSO cases in these states is between 30 per cent and 64 per cent, which needs improvement through better presentation of cases in courts as effective detection and conviction are the measures for prevention of a crime, it said.One of the important facts is that in cases where the victims belong to the poor and marginalised communities, their chances of turning hostile during the trial and resiling from the facts in the FIR are high as such victims are subject to both coercion and inducements, the study noted.This happens especially in the cases where the accused is either a family member or a rich and powerful person, it said.“To fill the gaps and address the challenges in implementation of the POCSO Act effectively, it is recommended that all the cases registered under the POCSO must be closely supervised by the District Superintendent of Police and/or Deputy Commissioner of Police,” it said.“At this point of time, there is also a need for a dedicated unit in each district/Police Commissioner for investigating cases relating to sexual offences committed against children," it added.The study recommended that police officers posted in this unit should be specially trained and sensitised and have the correct psychological bent of mind needed to deal with the trauma that women and child victims face."There is also a need for more Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) exclusively to try POCSO cases in view of the huge pendency of these cases in courts across the country," it said.

08-03-2021||New Delhi||SC ends extension of limitation period, says country returning to normalcy||Observing that country is “returning to normalcy”, the Supreme Court Monday decided to end the extension of limitation period which was granted for filing appeals in March 2020 to litigants due to COVID-19 pandemic situation.The apex court had on March 23 last year invoked its plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution to extend the limitation period of appeals from courts or tribunals on account of the pandemic with effect from March 15, 2020.A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat had been extending the limitation period by interim orders and finally decided to put an end to this keeping in mind the improved situation in the country and the fact that courts have started functioning.“Though, we have not seen the end of the pandemic, there is considerable improvement. The lockdown has been lifted and the country is returning to normalcy. Almost all the Courts and Tribunals are functioning either physically or by virtual mode.“We are of the opinion that the order has served its purpose and in view of the changing scenario relating to the pandemic, the extension of limitation should come to an end,” the apex court said in its order.It considered suggestions of Attorney General K K Venugopal and issued a slew of directions regarding future course of action on filing of appeals.“In computing the period of limitation for any suit, appeal, application or proceeding, the period from March 15, 2020 till March 14, 2021 shall stand excluded,” it said.Consequently, the balance period of limitation remaining as on March 15, 2020, if any, shall become available with effect from March15, this year, it said.“In cases where the limitation would have expired during the period between March 15, 2020 till March 14, 2021, notwithstanding the actual balance period of limitation remaining, all persons shall have a limitation period of 90 days from March 15, 2021.“In the event the actual balance period of limitation remaining, with effect from March 15, 2021, is greater than 90 days, that longer period shall apply,” it said.The apex court said its order would applicable in cases including those under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the Commercial Courts Act and the cheque bounce cases under the Negotiable Instruments Act.The bench asked the Centre to amend the guidelines for containment zones and to say: “Regulated movement will be allowed for medical emergencies, provision of essential goods and services, and other necessary functions, such as, time bound applications, including for legal purposes, and educational and job-related requirements.”Due to the onset of pandemic, the top court had taken a suo motu cognizance of the situation arising from difficulties that might be faced by the litigants across the country in filing cases within the limitation period and had passed the order.Now, the court decided to dispose of the plea.Earlier, Venugopal urged the Supreme Court that litigants be given 90 more days as the limitation period for filing appeals as the earlier order on the issue which was passed due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation has been lifted.In its March 23 last year order, the apex court had said, “This court has taken suo motu cognizance of the situation arising out of the challenge faced by the country on account of COVID-19 virus and resultant difficulties that may be faced by litigants across the country in filing their petitions/applications/suits/ appeals/all other proceedings within the period of limitation prescribed under the general law of limitation or under Special Laws (both Central and/or State).”“To obviate such difficulties and to ensure that lawyers/litigants do not have to come physically to file such proceedings in respective courts/tribunals across the country including this court, it is hereby ordered that a period of limitation in all such proceedings, irrespective of the limitation prescribed under the general law or special laws whether condonable or not shall stand extended w.e.f. March 15, 2020 till further order/s to be passed by this court in present proceedings,” it had said.

The case is also being probed by the local police, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said.“The accused were produced before a PMLA court in Mumbai for obtaining ED custody. The court was pleased to grant ED custody of the four accused persons for five days till March 11,” it said in a statement.The ED had conducted raids in this case in and around Pune in January after it filed a criminal case against Anil Shivajirao Bhosale and others based on a Pune Police FIR against them.The agency, quoting the police FIR, said the alleged irregularities in the bank came to the fore after a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) audit was conducted at its premises in April 2019.“The RBI noticed various discrepancies in records and books of accounts of the bank. As per RBI directions to the statutory auditor of the bank for verification of cash record, it was noticed that the entry of cash of Rs 71.78 crore was kept pending at the bank’s head office (in Pune) in their cash book,” the ED said.“It was gathered that Anil Shivajirao Bhosale who was the director of Shivajirao Bhosale Co-op Bank Ltd had misused his position and conspired with the co-accused and siphoned off the amount from the bank and its branches for personal gains,” it alleged. The agency said that its probe found “connivance of all accused in the report submitted by the bank auditor in the offence of money laundering by cheating, defrauding and siphoning off public funds available in Shivajirao Bhosale Cooperative Bank Ltd, which was deposited by small investors”.“It was further revealed that the said deposits had been sanctioned as loan to different companies as well as entities comparatively more than their re-payment capacity resulting in most loan accounts becoming NPA (Non Performing Assets), creating loss to the said bank and corresponding gains to themselves,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-arrests-ncp-politician-his-3-aides-in-pune-co-op-bank-fraud-case-222384

Considering the seriousness of the crime, there is a need for thorough investigation and for that sufficient police custody is required,” the judge observed.Police have invoked relevant sections of IPC as well as the Prevention of Corruption Act.So far, six persons have been arrested, including three Army personnel, for the leak that took place on February 28.

08-03-2021||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha members demand women reservation in Parliament, state assemblies||Several Rajya Sabha members on International Women’s Day on Tuesday pushed for at least one-third reservation for women in Parliament and state assemblies, saying this will ensure they get adequate representation.The demand comes in the backdrop of a bill which sought to give 33 per cent reservation to women in Lok Sabha and state assemblies lapsing a few years ago.Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on the occasion appreciated the services rendered by women members of the House for the country’s development and prosperity.“We need to ensure an environment that allows women to express themselves to their full potential in the form of both words and deeds,” he said and wished them more strength and power.The chairman also acknowledged the contribution of women citizens to the development of the nation.Congress member Chhaya Verma recalled that the government of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had given reservation to women in local bodies.Similar provisions should be made for women in state assemblies, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, she said.BJP member Saroj Pandey said the government has taken various measures to empower women and highlighted the law against triple talaq.She also said that the sex ratio of the country has improved because of the government’s ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’ campaign.However, Congress’ Phulo Devi Netam alleged that though the government has given the slogan ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’, women are not secured anywhere.Nominated member Sonal Mansingh made a case of celebrating ‘international men’s day’ on the line of women’s day.Shiv Sena member Priyanka Chaturvedi was of the opinion that as women form around 50 per cent of the country’s population, their representation in Parliament and state assemblies too should be in the same proportion, and not merely 33 per cent.Fauzia Khan of the NCP said the beginning could be made by bringing the legislation on the 33 per cent reservation for women in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.She noted that many women heads of state and leaders were widely recognised and appreciated for their promptness and effectiveness in handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.Congress member Amee Yajnik claimed that 90 per cent of women in rural or urban areas are not aware that a day has been specially carved out for them.“They do not know that there has to be a celebration on this day,” the MP said.“I wish that all women get access to all schemes, all rights that have been given by the Constitution, and that every empowered woman see to it that another woman gets empowered,” Yajnik said.BJP member Seema Dwivedi said women are excelling in all fields.Sampatiya Uikey of the BJP said that there are 78 women members in Lok Sabha and 27 in Rajya Sabha.She also said women are getting opportunities in all spheres of life.

There was speculation earlier that she might join the BJP as she did not get the seat she had desired.The party replaced her with Pradeep Baskey in the morning.A number of sitting TMC MLAs, including ministers, have joined the saffron camp in recent months.The BJP also took control of the 38-member Malda Zilla Parishad after its 22 members changed sides.Bengali actor Tanusree Chakraborty also joined the BJP.Assembly elections in the state will be held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29.

08-03-2021||New Delhi||5 countries including India account for about half of total child brides in world: UNICEF||Five countries, including India, account for about half of the total child brides in the world, according to a new analysis released by the UNICEF said on the occasion of International Women's Day.According to the analysis 'COVID-19: A threat to progress against child marriage', 10 million additional child marriages may occur before the end of the decade, threatening years of progress in reducing the practice.Worldwide, an estimated 650 million girls and women alive today were married in childhood, with about half of those occurring in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, and Nigeria, according to the analysis.To off-set the impacts of COVID-19 and end the practice by 2030 – the target set out in the Sustainable Development Goals – progress must be significantly accelerated, it said.“One year into the pandemic, immediate action is needed to mitigate the toll on girls and their families. By reopening schools, implementing effective laws and policies, ensuring access to health and social services – including sexual and reproductive health services – and providing comprehensive social protection measures for families, we can significantly reduce a girl's risk of having her childhood stolen through child marriage,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore.With 25 million child marriages averted in the last decade, UNICEF warned on International Women's Day that these gains are now under serious threat.Quoting its previous report, UNICEF said one in three of the world's child brides live in India.The UN body said persistence of child marriage remains a potential challenge to India achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 by 2030 even as its progress has been one of the strongest among countries in South Asia during the last decade.The analysis said findings from NFHS surveys between 1992-93 and 2015-16 show the percentage of young women who married in childhood has halved (from 54 to 27 per cent), and the pace of decline has increased in the last decade."The decline has been led by urban areas, which only had 18 per cent of women in the age group of 20-24 reporting (in 2015-16) – as compared to 32 per cent in rural areas – having got married before the age of 18," it said. Noting that a girl's risk of getting married before the age of 18 has a direct correlation with their background characteristics, the analysis said, girls in rural areas or from poorer households are at greater risk, and a higher proportion of child brides are found among those with little or no education.“To end child marriage in India, we need to continue to focus on the poorest and most vulnerable girls and their families. It is critical that child marriage elimination efforts are integrated into the COVID-19 response and recovery plans, and a prevention approach is strengthened that also addresses negative impact on health, education, and child protection," said Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India Representative."The drive to end child marriage needs to consider the entire lifecycle of a child, especially by addressing persisting negative social norms and ensuring that girls stay in school and learn, and have access to life skills and career opportunities to succeed and thrive,” Haque said. ---  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-countries-including-india-account-for-about-half-of-total-child-brides-in-world-unicef-222378
08-03-2021||New Delhi||Jyotiraditya Scindia once decision-maker in Cong, now BJP backbencher: Rahul||Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a jibe at his once close friend and former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, saying "who earlier was counted among 'decision makers' in his former party, now only gets to enjoy from the back seat as a spectator ever since he crossed over to saffron pastures".The former Congress chief's remarks came during a two-day national executive meeting of the Indian Youth Congress here that started during the day earlier.According to party sources, Gandhi said he used to tell Scindia "to work hard, so that he could be a Chief Minister".“He (Scindia) had decision making powers in our party and he always remained with me. But he left the party and joined the BJP, and look where he is sitting today. He is sitting among the backbenchers," the source quoted Gandhi as saying.Scindia was one of those Congress leaders who could call on Gandhi at any time. He had a free pass to the former Congress President's home. However, Scindia left the party in March last year orchestrating the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh.Scindia was made a Rajya Sabha member by the BJP. He had lost the 2019 Lok Sabha polls to K.P. Singh Yadav despite contesting from his traditional seat of Guna, which was considered a family bastion of the Scindias in Madhya Pradesh.To a question by a youth leader, about turncoats, who have returned to the party-fold, the source quoted Gandhi saying, "The Congress is like a sea. Here everyone following the ideology of the party is welcome. And those who do not follow the ideology of the party can leave anytime." When pressed hard on how turncoats returned to top posts in the party, Gandhi asserted that they had to work really hard to return to that high post.After the Youth Congress meet, Gandhi tweeted: "Met with IYC colleagues and discussed national issues. At every step, we have to wage a non-violent struggle against the RSS mentality - so that India's diversity and culture does not come under fire." The National Executive of the Youth Congress is being organised in the national capital in which several top leaders of the youth wing are participating.

08-03-2021||Mumbai||Something fishy: Thackeray on NIA taking over probe of vehicle laden with explosives being found near Ambani’s residence||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said the NIA taking over the case of a vehicle laden with explosives being found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai suggests something was “fishy”.Talking to reporters here, Thackeray said governments come and go, but the official administrative machinery remains the same and one needs to trust it.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case following orders from the Ministry of Home Affairs, an official spokesperson said on Monday.The agency is in the process of re-registering the case, the spokesperson added.On Sunday, the Maharashtra Anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) registered the FIR against unidentified persons on the order of the state home department under IPC Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 120(b) (criminal conspiracy).Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said in the Assembly on Monday that state police were capable of solving the case of auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran’s death and the recovery of the explosives-laden car near Ambani’s residence.Hiran, the purported owner of the vehicle, was found dead in a creek in neighbouring Thane on Friday.Thackeray said, “We had handed over the case of the vehicle laden with explosives and the mysterious death of Mansukh Hiran to the ATS. The NIA taking over the case shows something was fishy.”The ATS will continue to conduct its probe into Hiran’s death, the CM said.He said the opposition does not have faith in the state machinery and wanted to show it doesn’t function.“If that is so, why is it demanding that the state government reduce taxes on fuel?” the chief minister asked.Thackeray also said the state police will conduct probe into the alleged suicide of Lok Sabha member Mohan Delkarand and punish the guilty.Delkar (58), a seven-term MP from the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Union Territory, was found dead at a hotel on Marine Drive in south Mumbai on February 22.“A Union Territory is governed by the Centre. We will take the case to its logical end. I wonder how the opposition here is quiet on the issue of the seven-term MP ending his life,” Thackeray said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/something-fishy-thackeray-on-nia-taking-over-probe-of-vehicle-laden-with-explosives-being-found-near-ambanis-residence-222373

If a legislator is asking a question and supplementary questions, then let the concerned minister answer the question. Why are you interrupting the House until their question and supplementary questions followed by answers of the minister are completed,” Kumar said.Subodh Rai also argued with Nitish Kumar and said: “When ruling parties legislators ask supplementary questions you cannot say anything to them but when RJD legislators ask questions, then you become angry.”  The entire incident was triggered after RJD MLC Mohamad Farukh asked a question about the bad roads of Bihar and rural development minister Jayant Raj was answering it.While interacting with the media, Subodh Rai said: “The old age of Nitish Kumar affected him. He is frequently getting angry these days.” Sharawan Kumar, a JD-U leader and former parliamentary affairs minister said: “The law is equal for all. The House is run following certain guidelines that come under the law. No one can justify an act like that of the RJD MLC.” Rai was involved in an argument with Nitish Kumar 10 days ago as well when he asked a question on the worsening law and order situation in Bihar. The chief minister angrily asked him to sit down. “You do not know anything,” Kumar said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-kumar-loses-his-cool-again-in-bihar-legislative-council-222357
08-03-2021||New Delhi||US, UK, 3 other courts confirm $1.4 bn arbitration award against India||Courts in five countries, including the US and the UK, have given recognition to an arbitration award that asked India to return USD 1.4 billion to Cairn Energy plc — a step that now opens the possibility of the British firm seizing Indian assets in those countries if New Delhi does not pay, sources said.Cairn Energy had moved courts in nine countries to enforce its USD 1.4 billion arbitral award against India, which the company won after a dispute with the country’s revenue authority over a retroactively applied capital gains tax.Of these, the December 21 award from a three-member tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Netherlands has been recognised and confirmed by courts in the US, the UK, Netherlands, Canada and France, three people with knowledge of the matter said.Cairn has started the process to register the award in Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Cayman Islands, they said.The registration of the award is the first step towards its enforcement in the event of the government not paying the firm.Once the court recognises an arbitration award, the company can then petition it for seizing any Indian government assets such as bank accounts, payments to state-owned entities, airplanes and ships in those jurisdictions, to recover the monies due to it, they said.So far the government has not directly commented on honouring or challenging the Cairn arbitration award, but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had last week indicated of going in for an appeal.Cairn’s shareholders, who include top financial institutions of the world, want the company to go for enforcement action should New Delhi fail to pay it.While the company spokesperson wasn’t reachable for comments, Cairn had on Sunday stated that it will “begin meetings this week with shareholders in the UK and US, with the international arbitration award high on the agenda”.               “The company met the Government of India last month and is taking all the necessary steps to protect their shareholders’ interests,” it had said.The tribunal had on December 21 ruled that the government breached an investment treaty with the UK and was therefore liable to return the value of shares it had seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund stopped to adjust a Rs 10,247 crore tax demand.Cairn in its filings to the courts in the nine countries is seeking “to confirm this final and binding award under the New York Convention and commence enforcement proceedings to recover the losses caused by (India’s) unfair and inequitable treatment of their investments”.After losing in the Supreme Court a case against levying tax on capital gains made in the 2007 sale by Hutchison of its India business to Vodafone for USD 11.2 billion, the government had in 2012 enacted legislation that gave it powers to tax such deals retrospectively.Thereafter, the tax department raised demands on Vodafone as well as Cairn over alleged capital gains it made on reorganising its India business prior to its listing.But unlike Vodafone where no enforcement action was taken, it seized and sold Cairn’s residual stake in the India unit, confiscated dividends due from such holding, and stopped tax refund due to it.The Hague panel found that a 2012 law passed by the Indian Parliament was a new tax, not a clarification of prior law that could be applied to earlier years.Formally, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United Nations-backed document requires courts of contracting states to allow private agreements for arbitration and to recognize and enforce resulting awards from other contracting states.The US and other courts have the authority to enforce arbitration agreements under the convention.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on March 5 indicated the government’s intent to appeal against the award when she said it is her “duty” to appeal in cases where the nation’s sovereign authority to tax is questioned.But the December 21 ruling specifically made clear that the basis of the judgment was not a challenge to the 2012 law, which gave the government powers to tax deals retrospectively, or India’s sovereign right to tax.“The issue at stake is thus not a matter of domestic tax law; it is rather whether the fiscal measures taken by the State, valid or not under its own tax laws, violate international law,” the tribunal had said.Sources said the award is final and the merits cannot be appealed, and under Dutch law, the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award are extremely narrow. These grounds include no valid arbitration agreement, rules for composition not being observed, tribunal exceeding its mandate, an award not signed or not reasoned and the order being contrary to public policy or public morals.The Cairn award was unanimous with all three judges, including one appointed by the Indian government consenting. The 582-page order gave detailed reasoning on the very point of the challenge brought by the Indian government, including the point that taxation did not form part of the bilateral investment treaties. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-uk-3-other-courts-confirm-1-4-bn-arbitration-award-against-india-222355

The debate is also on the contribution of women in this movement,” said Kuruganti, who is also a member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha.She added that the participation of women has increased significantly with the arrival of “thousands of women”.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points for over 100 days, demanding the repeal of farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.International Women’s Day is celebrated across the world on March 8 and it is a day when women are recognised for their achievements, according to the United Nations.This year’s theme—‘Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world’—celebrates the tremendous efforts by women in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the pandemic, and highlights the gaps that remain, the UN Women stated. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-farmers-take-centre-stage-at-protest-sites-on-international-womens-day-222344
08-03-2021||New Delhi||SC seeks states’ response on quota to specific class||The Supreme Court sought responses from states on Monday on a question of “seminal importance” whether legislatures were competent to declare a particular caste to be socially and educationally backward for grant of quota.The top court will examine the question of interpretation of the 102nd amendment to the Constitution dealing with reservation to a particular community, named in the list prepared by the President.The 102nd Constitution amendment Act of 2018 inserted Article 338B (deals with the structure, duties and powers of National Commission of Backward Class) and 342A (power of the President to notify a particular caste as Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC)) and the power of Parliament to change the SEBC list.The issue of interpretation of 102nd amendment arose before a five-judge Constitution Bench while examining a batch of pleas on the validity of the Maratha reservation law and the legal issue of whether a state legislature is competent enough to declare a particular caste to be socially and educationally backward for grant of quota.The Bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said it would also hear arguments on the issue of whether the landmark 1992 judgment in the Indira Sahwney case—also known as the Mandal verdict, which caps the quota at 50 per cent—should be re-looked and referred to a larger Bench.The Bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, said it would commence the hearing from next Monday and asked the states to file a brief note of written submissions on the issue.“We have considered the submission of different parties and are of the view that the interpretation of 102nd amendment of the Constitution is of seminal importance and, therefore, notice has to be issued to the states,” the Bench said.“Notices be served on the standing counsel of each state and brief notes of submissions be filed,” it added.It noted the submission of senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Kapil Sibal and P S Patwalia, appearing for Maharashtra government, the verdict on the question of interpretation of the 102nd amendment might be affecting the federal structure of the states and, therefore, they needed to be heard.Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for Centre, said the states might be affected with the decision of the court on interpretation of the 102nd amendment and it would be better if notices were issued to all the states.Some of the parties opposed the issuance of the notice, saying the question of interpretation did not concern them and it might delay the process.The top court had said on February 5 that it would hear from March 8 in a hybrid manner—a combination of physical and virtual hearings—the pleas pertaining to the 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs.It had fixed the schedule for hearing of the matter and said it would try to wrap up the hearing on March 18 itself. On January 20, the Maharashtra government had told the bench that a case of this nature should be heard once physical hearing commences.On December 9, the apex court had said that issues pertaining to the 2018 Maharashtra law, granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs, requires “urgent hearing” as the legislation had been stayed and the “fruits accrued” were not reaching to the people.The apex court had on September 9 stayed the implementation of the legislation and referred to a larger Bench the batch of pleas challenging the validity of law, but made it clear that status of those who have availed of the benefits would not be disturbed.The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, of Maharashtra was enacted to grant reservation to people of the Maratha community in the state in jobs and admissions.The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June 2019, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.The high court had said that the 50-per-cent cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-states-response-on-quota-to-specific-class-222343

08-03-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat in Delhi, meets Nadda, Baluni||Amid speculations surrounding his future, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat met senior BJP leaders in Delhi on Monday.Though Rawat termed his Delhi’ visit a routine one, a series of meetings, apparently on the prevailing political situation in the hill state, were held in the national capital on Monday.  Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and general secretary organisation BL Santosh are believed to have also separately discussed the issue.Rawat was spotted at the residence of Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni, the BJP’s media national media in-charge and one of the names doing the rounds in speculations that the leadership was aiming at “change” in Uttarakhand before he drove to meet Nadda. Though a section of the BJP claims “Rawat is safe”, there are reports of BJP MLAs being asked to reach Dehradun for a meeting tomorrow. A legislative party meeting is also been planned, a state leader said, adding that the central leadership has taken a “serious view” of the feedback by the party vice-president Raman Singh. A point of view also is that Rawat had been called to Delhi to give “message” to adversaries, some of whom are also camping in Delhi in the hope of meeting senior leaders. Since the state is due for Assembly elections next year, the leadership is trying to “calm down the situation” through “other ways”, sources here said.  Amid speculations over the next CM, names of union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, MP Anil Baluni, state cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj, Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar MP Ajay Bhat and general secretary of Uttarakhand BJP Suresh Bhat are doing the rounds, senior leaders say that “all options are open”.  That the  BJP leadership is “worried” about “continuing discontent” against Rawat can be gauged over the way Raman Singh, general secretary in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam and others were suddenly dispatched to talk to MLAs and state leaders over the state-of-affairs on Saturday. Apparently, there were apprehensions about all of it “spilling out in the open” amid the ongoing Assembly elections, a reason why they were sent in a hurry to “handle” the situation. Apart from the “general discontent” about Rawat’s way of functioning, it seems members of the Sangh parivaar too are upset over some decisions of his government. Meanwhile, a few Congress imports in the BJP are also threatening to jump ship ahead of Assembly polls next year, spelling trouble for the ruling BJP in the face of the “growing influence” of Aam Aadmi Party in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-in-delhi-meets%C2%A0nadda-baluni-222340

08-03-2021||New Delhi||Remarks on rape case ‘completely misreported’, says Supreme Court||A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Monday said its observations during the hearing of a rape case last week were “completely misreported” and added that it has the “highest respect for women”.The comments — on International Women’s Day — come in the wake of recent criticism against the Supreme Court that it had purportedly asked a rape accused whether he would marry the victim, who was a minor when the crime was committed.“We (had) asked are you going to marry? We didn’t order (him to) ‘marry’,” the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said. It also said the reputation of the judiciary was in the hands of its lawyers.Editorial: Rape and marriageA rapist can’t be ‘incentivised’ by allowing him to marry victimThe observations by the bench were made while it was hearing another case — that of a 14-year-old pregnant rape survivor seeking permission to abort the foetus of almost 26 weeks.In the proceedings conducted through video conferencing, it referred to a provision of the Evidence Act and said the query was posed in the context of the records but the issue was “completely misreported”.It was earlier stated that the Apex Court’s query asking a rape accused whether he would marry the victim was based on ‘judicial records’ containing an undertaking from the man that he would marry the minor girl, a relative, after she turns 18 years of age.CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat had written to the chief justice asking him to withdraw his remarks reportedly made during the March 1 hearing on the anticipatory bail plea of the accused.Several women’s rights activists, eminent citizens, intellectuals, writers and artistes had also penned an open letter to the chief justice demanding an apology and retraction of the remarks.Referring to the earlier case, the bench said on Monday: “We do not remember any case of marital rape was before us...We have the highest respect for women.” “Our reputation is always at the hands of bar,” the top court observed.The view was endorsed by lawyers appearing in the case.Lawyer VK Biju, appearing for the petitioner in the case listed on Monday, said a section of the people was tarnishing the institution and some kind of mechanism is needed to deal this.The Bar Council of India had backed the Supreme Court and asked activists who had written to the CJI to withdraw his remarks to not “scandalise” the highest judiciary and take “political mileage” of its proceedings.In the March 1 observations, the bench headed by Bobde was hearing a plea filed by the accused, serving as a technician in Maharashtra State Electricity Production Company Limited, who had moved the Apex Court against a Bombay High Court February 5 order cancelling his anticipatory bail.The man’s lawyer said the accused was initially willing to marry the girl but she had refused, and now he was married to someone else.

We have done five ponds now and keep getting calls to do others.”CatcH2o’s successes has come just ahead of the harsh Indian summer which, as climate change strengthens, is increasingly associated with parched cities and a worsening drinking water crisis across the country.A government think-tank report in 2018, when India suffered what was called the worst water crisis in its history, predicted that at least 40% of India’s 1.3 billion population will have no reliable access to drinking water by 2030.Changing that will likely require not just government efforts to shore up water security but community ones, conceived and carried out by residents, climate adaptation experts say.The transformation of Goa’s village ponds coincided with a new plan by the western state’s wetland authority to encourage people to protect their own ecosystems.Launched in February, the Shram Shakti se Jal Samrudhi (water security through hard work) programme for the first time allots funding for people to carry out projects they develop, as well as to join up the work of different government agencies.“The idea is to preserve, revive and restore water bodies,” said Pradip Sarmokadam of the Goa State Biodiversity Board.“We will provide the technical assistance, but want people to own these water bodies.”GENERATING JOBSIn southern Tamil Nadu state, more than 1,000 women from 21 villages in Vellore district four years ago cooperated to build rainwater harvesting structures to boost the lagging flow of the nearby Naganadhi river.Those structures include recharge wells, which trap rainwater runoff, including from roofs and roads to help boost the water table, and check dams, which slow down water flow on rivers or streams.“When we first heard the idea, we scoffed,” said Vidya Bhaskaran, one of the women from Salamanatham village who worked on the recharge wells.“We were dependent on borewells, which were giving us muddy water only and thought it was impossible to find water again.But I am glad we were eventually convinced and worked on it.” Today Chandrasekaran Kuppan, the man behind efforts to rejuvenate the Naganadhi, is now collaborating with district officials to take his model to 300 more villages, training 20,000 women in the process.In a rare collaboration, the government pays the women via its rural employment guarantee scheme, while the humanitarian Art of Living Foundation bankrolls technical studies and Kuppan’s charity oversees much of the execution.“The idea is simple,” Kuppan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “When people in my village first mentioned the water crisis to me, I sat down with them to understand what could be done to resolve it.”The answer was to combine the traditional knowledge of villagers with technical advice from geologists, Kuppan said.Such efforts to consult with and source solutions from local people is seen as key to ensuring the success of work to build resilience to climate threats.In Goa, CatcH2o achieved its successes with similar efforts to combine skills and knowledge.After getting technical experts on board, local people recruited migrant workers stranded at home during lockdown to provide labour to revive the pond in Saligao.With plenty of labourers - who were paid the minimum wage - the group managed to avoid using heavy machinery, which could have damaged the pond’s ecology.“The results are there to see,” Kuppan said.“The dry villages have good groundwater now, the idea to work with communities is being used across the state and in the process employment is being generated.”ONLY WAY OUTIn recent years, many city residents also have come together to clean lakes, better harvest rainwater and increase water storage capacity at home.But tens of thousands are still dependent on deliveries by water tanker trucks, paying for each litre of clean water they need.Many areas in Goa, including tourism spots, struggle with providing drinking water, with chief minister Pramod Sawant telling reporters last month that the state faced a shortage of 76 millions litres a day.“Traditionally Goans have not had any water storage mechanisms, given the great rainfall in the state and open wells,” Sarmokadam said. “But things have changed and therefore fresh efforts are needed.”Bhaskaran, who helped revive water supplies in Salamanatham, couldn’t agree more.“Making recharge wells was hard work but we sang songs, chatted and got it done,” said Bhaskaran.“Now we have drinking water available all 24 hours rushing out of taps in every home. And we have set an example for others.” —Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/preserve-revive-restore-indian-ponds-spring-back-to-life-222322
08-03-2021||Muzaffarnagar (UP)||Farmers’ protest: Sugarcane price, diesel rates, stray cattle menace bigger issues for many in India’s ‘Sugar Bowl’||Emergence of Naresh and Rakesh Tikait may have brought western Uttar Pradesh to the centre of farmers’ protest at Delhi borders, but the farming community of the region known as the ‘sugar bowl of India’ have a long list of other and even bigger problems—stagnant sugarcane price, ever-rising diesel rates and the menace of stray animals, to name a few.At the same time, ever-changing caste and societal equations are making the landscape much more difficult to predict in this politically-important region, which many political pundits believe would play a key role in the assembly elections next year and in the Lok Sabha polls of 2024.Raj Kumar, a Rawa Rajput from Satheri village in Muzaffarnagar district, says sugarcane prices have not been raised for the past several seasons, whereas companies have reduced the size of urea and DAP (Diammonium phosphate, a popular phosphatic fertiliser) bags, making the manure costlier and the agriculture “unsustainable”.“In this region, our elders earlier used to say, ‘Uttam kheti, beech vyapaar, neech naukri’ (Agriculture is best to earn a livelihood, followed by business and then doing a job), but the sequence has turned upside down now,” he said.Muzaffarnagar, a western Uttar Pradesh district, is not very far from Delhi which has seen its three border points turn into tent cities as farmers protesting against the three new central agricultural laws, which open up the sector for private players, have been camping there for over 100 days now.Asked about the contentious farm laws, Kumar said he doesn’t know much about them but he has been supporting the protesting farmers as agriculture has become “unsustainable”.Echoing similar sentiments, Roshan Lal, a Saini by caste and a small-scale farmer, said more than the three farm laws, it is the delay in sugarcane payment and rising diesel prices, along with the problem of stray cattle, that have made their lives miserable.“More than farm laws, these local issues have broken our back,” Lal said, standing by Kumar.“All this has forced us to raise their voices for farmers’ issues,” he said.Sohan, a Kashyap (Jhimir) by caste from Ganshampura village who owns less than one-acre land and uses his crop mostly in his jaggery workshop, said the jaggery price would also remain stagnant until and unless sugarcane prices are increased.“Yahan to eenkh hi sab kuchh hai… uska daam badhega, to gud ka daam bhi badhega, warna mazdoori bhi bachaani mushkil hai (Here sugarcane is everything. If its prices increase, the prices of jaggery will also go up. Otherwise, it would be difficult to pay even wages),” he said.Sohan said he has heard about the farm laws but doesn’t know much about them. He also flagged the issue of stray cattle.Many other farmers and traders in the area underlined the importance of sugarcane prices and timely payments to farmers, even as they sounded apprehensive about the three farm laws, saying their information is mostly based on what has been told to them by farmer leaders.However, opposition to these laws becomes louder and more visible as one moves towards Jats-dominated areas in western Uttar Pradesh.In the Shoram village, which is seen as the headquarters of Khaps (caste councils) of the Jat community, a mere mention of farm laws evokes a strong response.“These laws are not only against the farmers but against the country... Those who are guarding the borders are our sons and behind their back, you are trying to snatch the rights of their brothers who are into farming,” said Bhupender Choudhary, a villager.Choudhary, a middle-aged farmer, said the sentiment against the farm laws became more pronounced after people in the region saw Bhartiya Kisan Union Leader (BKU) Rakesh Tikait crying on TV channels.Tikait, himself a Jat, hails from Sisoli village in Muzaffarnagar district.The protest will continue till the government takes back the farm laws, said Vipin Balyan, a 35-year-old farmer from the Shoram village.“The proponents of these black laws will pay heavily in coming elections,” he claimed.Bhupender and Vipin also expressed their concerns about what they called the stagnant sugarcane prices, the delay in payments to sugarcane farmers and the havoc caused by stray cattle, saying all these are damaging farmers economically.Many farmers in the region also said they are receiving annual Rs 6,000 government assistance under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme started by the Centre.The entire western Uttar Pradesh has been witnessing a number of Mahapanchayts organised either by khaps or farmer leaders or political parties against the farm laws.The sugarcane crop, the mainstay of the farmers in the region, is cultivated on more than 80 per cent of the arable land in the districts of western Uttar Pradesh.As per the data provided by All India Sugar Traders Association, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane was at Rs 255 per quintal for 2017-18 season and increased to Rs 285 per quintal in 2020-21 season.Whereas the Uttar Pradesh government’s State Advisory Price (SAP) is fixed at Rs 315 per quintal for the last four seasons from 2017-18.There are nearly 50 sugar mills in the region besides a large number of jaggery workshops. Several sugar mills have not cleared farmers’ dues of last season, according to farmers.Agriculture experts say a farmer cultivates on an average 900 quintal of sugarcane in one hectare of land in one season which is of about nine months.The farmer spends on average around more than Rs 2 lakh per hectare including all its expenses during a season on sugarcane crop. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-sugarcane-price-diesel-rates-stray-cattle-menace-bigger-issues-for-many-in-indias-sugar-bowl-222320

08-03-2021||New Delhi||Parliament to go back to regular working hours from Tuesday||Parliament will go back to its normal working hours—from 11 am to 6 pm —from Tuesday. Until now Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have staggered sessions—with the upper house meeting in the morning and the lower house in the evening—in an attempt to adhere to social distancing protocol. Both houses will now get back to their own chambers from Tuesday, unlike currently, when they sit spread across both houses. Seating arrangements will be notified in the evening, officials said. NCP member Vandana Chavan, who was on the chair, made the announcement in Rajya Sabha before she adjourned the house at 11 am. The announcement was greeted with cheers on a day that saw protests on the issue of fuel price hike leading to multiple adjournments.In Rajya Sabha, legislative business listed for the day consisted of three bills, including one regarding amendment of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. None of the bills could be taken up due to the disruptions.“On the request from many members from various parties, the Chairman has decided that from Tuesday, the sitting of Rajya Sabha will commence from 11 am to 6 pm as usual timings of the House. Members will sit in Rajya Sabha chamber and gallery only,” Vandana Chavan, who was in the Chair, said. The house adjourned soon after reconvening after protests from the opposition regarding rising fuel prices.Lok Sabha adjourned for an hour after obituary references to two sitting and seven former members.The two sitting members who died recently are Mohan Delkar (58) and Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan (68).Delkar, a seven-term MP, allegedly ended his life on February 22. His body was found in a Mumbai hotel.Chauhan, a six-term MP, was suffering from COVID-19. He was airlifted to Medanta Hospital in Gurugram last month in a serious condition. He died on March 2. As the House convened on Monday after recess, Speaker Om Birla paid respect to the departed members on behalf of the Lok Sabha.The House also paid its respects to former Lok Sabha members Rajendra Kumar Sharma, Sarat Kar, M R Kadambur Janarthanan, M Deiveekan, Mahavir Bhagora, Captain Satish Sharma and D Pandian.Meanwhile, sources said, that the Budget session is likely to be cut short and may conclude before the first phase of elections on March 27.Several parties had requested that the session, which was originally scheduled to continue till April 8, be curtailed due to the five assembly elections being held in eight phases till April 29. A final decision on curtailment of the session will also be taken by Birla, who met floor leaders of various parties on the matter earlier in the day.— With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-to-go-back-to-regular-working-hours-from-tuesday-222301
08-03-2021||---||TMC seeks adjournment of Parliament session, cites elections in 5 states||New Delhi, March 8The Trinamool Congress leaders in both Houses of Parliament today wrote to presiding officers asking for adjournment of the proceedings on account of elections in West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.In his letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, TMC leader in the house Derek O’Brien said: “Because of the declaration of elections in five states, we urge you to consider the adjournment of the ensuing Parliament session.”“The Election Commission of India, on February 26, 2021, had announced election dates in five states, including West Bengal. Due to the ongoing intensive election preparations in the state, the Members of Parliament from the All India Trinamool Congress would find it difficult to attend the second part of the Budget Session beginning from March 8, 2021.”Also read: Rajya Sabha adjourned till 1 pm amid uproar by Opposition membersAttend Parliament, observe debates: Naidu to MPsAttendance of Rajya Sabha members in DRSCs’ meetings improves, while of Lok Sabha declinesO’Brien cited two precedents, where under the Parliament sessions were adjourned in view of upcoming polls in multiple states.The first precedent cited was the 222nd Session which commenced on February 21, 2011, was scheduled to conclude on April 21, 2011. However, due to the state Assembly elections announced in five states — Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, the House was adjourned sine die on March 25, 2011.The second was the 214h Session which commenced on October 17, 2008, which was adjourned early on October 24, 2008, to meet again on December 10, 2008.

I will vote there. She will watch on TV that she is losing”. The main speaker at the rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had not yet arrived when Suvendu addressed the gathering.The Nandigram electoral contest between Mamata and Suvendu is set to be a high-voltage fight. Suvendu, who was originally a voter of Haldia, has got himself enrolled as a voter of Nandigram recently.Much like Mamata is doing at the state level to dissuade the voters from supporting BJP, Suvendu has made the outsider tag against Mamata his chief weapon. Nandigram is a three-hour drive from Kolkata but TMC has been forced to hire accommodation in Nandigram so that Mamata can stay there and fraternise with the local people.Cricketer Manoj Tiwari, given a ticket by TMC for the Shibpur constituency, is also facing protest on the same ground. Outraged Trinamool activists have claimed that Tiwari is an “outsider” and demanded former mayor of Howrah municipality Vibhas Hazra as a candidate. Some of the other TMC aspirants also, on being denied ticket by the party, are complaining about “outsiders” given preference over local candidates in the distribution of tickets by party supremo Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/outsider-issue-boomerangs-on-mamata-222295
08-03-2021||New Delhi||West Bengal elections: Satyajit Ray fans want date of vote counting changed as it coincides with his birth centenary||At a time when the BJP and the TMC are competing with each other about who represents Bengali culture better, the hollowness of the rivals’ claims has been exposed by their missing out on an occasion that means a lot in West Bengal.May 2, the day chosen by the ECI for counting votes for the assembly elections in four states, including West Bengal, is the birthday of filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Ray was born in Kolkata on this day in 1921. This year would be the hundredth birth anniversary of the maestro who, besides making films that give inspiration to others with directorial dreams like Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Shyam Benegal, also created fictional characters like the private detective “Felu-da” and the inventor “Professor Shonku”, who have become part and parcel of everyday lives of Bengalis.“Ray’s birth centenary would have been the right occasion to look at the history of film making in India and its future in the context of films made by Ray. Unfortunately, ECI has announced that May 2 would be the day when the assembly elections results would be announced. I would like to request the ECI to fix some other date for counting of votes so that it does not come in the way of Ray’s 100th birthday celebrations,” said Somnath Roy, who has co-edited a book of Ray’s media interviews.Subhasish Chakraborty, a Ray fan from Ashoknagar, North 24 Parganas, said the birth anniversary of Ray could not be celebrated last year owing to the pandemic. “If parties like TMC and BJP truly respect Bengali culture, they should also urge the ECI to announce some other date for counting of votes,” Chakraborty said.Ray’s son Sandip, who is also a filmmaker, however, is yet to say anything on the overlapping of his late father’s birth centenary with the day of the counting of votes.Ironically, both TMC and BJP have been trying to cash in on Ray to win the elections. “Banglar Gorbo Mamata” (“Mamata is the pride of Bengal”), a Facebook group created by TMC’s political strategist Prashant Kishore, this morning posted a clip from “Apur Sansar” movie directed by Ray.Conversations between the characters in the clip were changed to make the husband (played by Saumitra Chatterjee) a victim of retrenchment by BSNL and the wife (played by Sharmila Tagore) resorting to using coal stove for cooking since the family cannot afford to pay the high price of an LPG cylinder any more.Last month, BJP leader and I&B minister Prakash Javadekar, with an eye to the assembly polls in West Bengal, announced that an award would be instituted in the same name of Satyajit Ray which would be equivalent to the prestigious “Dadasaheb Phalke Award” given to members of the film fraternity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-elections-satyajit-ray-fans-want-date-of-vote-counting-changed-as-it-coincides-with-his-birth-centenary-222294

India last saw 18,855 infections in a day on January 29. Maharashtra witnessed 10,187 daily new cases over the past 24 hours, followed by Kerala (2,791) and Punjab (1,159). Karnataka (580), Gujarat (571) and Tamil Nadu (562) were close behind.So far as fatalities go, 100 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. Six states account for 87% new deaths. Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (47), followed by Kerala (16) and Punjab (12). The Health Ministry had yesterday sent teams to Maharashtra and Punjab and the teams have started probing the causes behind the surge although preliminary data suggests the reasons are inappropriate Covid behaviour - marriages, elections, super-spreading events and greater dependence on the antigen test rather than the standard RTPCR test.Antigen tests are prone to showing false negative reports and the Centre has mandated a negative antigen test report to be cross-checked with an RTPCR test. "That is not happening in many cases and there is a lack of fear of the disease seeing the infections decline. But this can prove costly," a ministry official said. As the share of active cases in total cases rose to 1.65% today, the Centre said 8 states were displaying an upward trajectory in daily new cases. These include Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, MP, Haryana, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-recovery-rate-dips-punjab-sees-12-fatalities-222130

The 7,500th store was opened in Shillong today.After interacting with the beneficiaries of the government’s generic medicine push through the Jan Aushadhi kendras, the PM noted the stores had helped the poor and middle-class families save Rs 3,600 crore per year so far, on account of providing low-cost drugs.“To promote the scheme, the incentive under it has been increased from Rs 2 lakh to 5 lakh with additional incentive of Rs 2 lakh for Dalit, tribal women and people of the northeast,” he said after scheme beneficiaries and people related to running the stores shared experiences about helping people access inexpensive generic drugs.Beneficiaries called the kendras “Modi ki dukaan.” The PM lauded how Indian traditional medicines and Covid vaccines had acquired worldwide reputation. “There was a time people thought millets and whole grains were the foods for the poor, but that is changing . The UN has decided to declare 2023 the International Year of Millets,” the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/working-to-build-one-medical-college-for-every-3-ls-seats-prime-minister-narendra-modi-222057

The recent loss of government in Puducherry is another factor that weighed against the Congress in talks with the DMK.As part of the deal, the DMK has also given the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha segment to the Congress to contest.TN Congress incharge Dinesh Gundu Rao said the DMK-led alliance would “win big” and unseat the AIADMK.WB: ISF nominee to take on MamataThe Sanyukta Morcha has decided to field Indian Secular Front (ISF) nominee from the Nandigram seat to contest against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee (TMC) and Suvendu Adhikari (BJP) in West Bengal.

08-03-2021||---||On Didi’s turf, Prime Minister Narendra Modi vows ‘poriborton’||New Delhi, March 7Claiming Bengal was in the DNA of the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday vowed “ashol poriborton” (real change) in the state if the party was voted to power.Addressing a massive election rally at Kolkata’s iconic Brigade Ground, Modi said the Congress, from which Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee broke away to form the Trinamool Congress (TMC), was founded by a foreigner. The communists also took inspiration from Marx, Lenin and Mao. On the other hand, the BJP was founded by drawing inspiration from “the great son of Bengal Syama Prasad Mukherjee,” he said.Actor Mithun joins saffron partyA highlight of the rally was actor Mithun Chakraborty joining the BJP. Mithun, who was sent to the Rajya Sabha by the TMC in 2014 but resigned two years later citing health reasons, said he was like a “venomous cobra”.The Prime Minister, addressing his first rally in West Bengal after the announcement of the Assembly elections, was countering TMC propaganda that the BJP was a “party of outsiders”.Hitting out at the TMC supremo, the PM said “her remote control is somewhere else”, adding she was not doing justice to the ideals of Bengali icons such as Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Swami Vivekananda, Tagore and Netaji.Narendra Modi, PMShe Chose nephew over peopleBengal chose you in role of ‘Didi’, but you preferred being aunt to your own nephew, ignoring millions of nieces and nephews across the state. “Bengali thinking is at the core of BJP’s ideology. The party is indebted to Bengal. That debt can never be repaid, but we can try to set it on the course of development,” said Modi.Taking Mamata to task for coining the expression “khela hobe” (we will play the game) to describe electoral contests, Modi said the TMC leaders were indeed “experienced players”.“They know how to play games and have played so much that not much is left. There have been so many scams in Bengal. Even relief sent for people hit by Cyclone Amphan was misappropriated,” said Modi.“TMC ka khela khatam, vikas shuru (TMC’s game is up, it’s time for development)... What game have you not played with people of Bengal? Extortion, corruption... you even played with the lives of people,” said Modi.The BJP will bring about “real change” if elected to power, said Modi, adding by real change he meant jobs and educations for youths, attracting investments for the state, creating good infrastructure, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-didis-turf-prime-minister-narendra-modi-vows-poriborton-222117

08-03-2021||Milkha Singh Aulakh||Farm Laws: Half-baked policies can be counterproductive||THE three farm laws enacted by the Union Government last year could have an enormous impact on the livelihoods of various sections of society as well as food security of our highly populated country. Policy-makers often cite the examples of developed countries to justify the need for such reforms in India to liberalise and open up the farm sector to private players. However, when we compare the social security net, insurance cover and market options available to farmers in India and developed countries, the disparity is striking.Farmers and farm labourers constitute a smaller proportion of the population in developed countries (2-5 per cent) as compared to India (60-70 per cent). In the US, 897 million acres of agricultural land is cultivated by 2 million farmers; in India, only 350 million acres are cultivated by 145 million farming families. A majority of the farmers in developed countries have large-sized farms. The average farm size in the US is 448 acres, way above India (2.5 acres). Their farmers have the capacity and capability to store their products for long periods after each harvest; they also own transportation facilities. Their farmers are usually involved in decision-making policies that could impact their livelihood. In addition to a much larger cash and commodity support than in India, the government provides them social security, including old-age pension, health services and education to their wards (schoolbuses pick up and drop their wards at their on-farm residences). For example, the farmers of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta provinces in Canada have farms varying from 500 to 2,000 acres, along with modern machinery and infrastructure. They produce mainly wheat, barley, pulses and edible oilseeds that are exported to other countries. After each harvest, farmers often store grains in on-farm silos and transport them only when they get good prices.Farmers on boardThe Canadian Wheat Board was constituted in 1935 with representatives of the government and the farmers. Its functions include identification of markets, negotiations for best prices and delivery of agri products. Accordingly, the farmers grow those crops and transport their produce to allocated railway yards to upload it in containers for onward transport to seaports for export. If and when some fields are left fallow due to lesser demand of agri products, the government compensates farmers for their fallow acreage.Contract farming under India’s new agri laws would lead to the establishment of large farms and the development of state-of-the-art infrastructure by clubbing landholdings of small, marginal and poor farmers, who have less than five acres and constitute 86 per cent of the farmers. However, such large farms would render rural people unemployed, who account for 60-70 per cent of our population. Keeping in view the joblessness of a significant proportion of the urban population, the movement of people in large numbers from rural areas to cities would aggravate unemployment. In order to avoid unnecessary glut of one agri product or the other and maintain equilibrium between their production and requirements, the state governments and farmers’ cooperatives could be allowed to export their agri products, including fresh vegetables and fruits, directly to other countries.Insurance schemesIn India, several crop insurance schemes have been formulated, implemented and withdrawn from time to time. In 1999-2000, the government introduced Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana. In recent years, four insurance schemes were launched: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Weather-based Crop Insurance Scheme, Coconut Palm Insurance Scheme and the Pilot Unified Package Insurance Scheme. However, none of these schemes has become popular among farmers because their premium rates are quite high, and they have several inbuilt bylaws for calamities and other factors that are mostly unfavourable to the farmers. For example, while more than 11 lakh policies were purchased by farmers in 2017, only 3.08 lakh were indemnified. Other reasons for their non-acceptance are the complicated procedures involved, lack of education and awareness among farmers, and most importantly, the incapability and affordability of poor farmers to pay the annual premium in advance.In contrast, the farmers of developed countries are in a better position in several ways and capable of paying premium. A variety of insurance policies are available at competitive rates, which cover personal liability of farmers and their co-workers, their farmhouses and possessions, machinery and livestock, and stored-on-farm agri products, besides the insurance for crops that witness a loss in yield, whether it is due to an insurable cause of loss in the quality or quantity of the insured crop. Governments co-pay substantial premiums; for instance, in British Columbia province of Canada, the government pays up to 45 per cent of the crop insurance premium. Moreover, the system is transparent and farmers use insurance policies to cover the risk and make a profit.MSP shieldThe Union Government introduced the MSP (minimum support price) regime to guarantee a minimum profit for the farmer for his harvest if the open market offers a lesser price than the cost incurred. Although the MSP is announced for 23 farm-produced crops, the Centre does not assure that all these agri products are purchased at or above the MSP. The Centre purchases mainly paddy (unmilled rice), wheat and a few pulses through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state government agencies for their distribution among poor people through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This leaves the farmers at the mercy of corporates (including private buyers), who may purchase all remaining agri products at whatever price they offer, and farmers have no option but to sell their produce.As the MSP holds the key to farmers’ security and the nation’s self-sufficiency, the provision of its legal status is a necessity so that no one can swindle, fleece or force poor farmers, who are already in a pitiable condition, to sell their agri products at much lower than economically viable rates. This would also encourage crop diversification so as to avoid a glut of wheat and rice, and reduce imports of pulses and edible oils.In a nutshell, we should either adopt reforms of developed countries in totality, including liberalisation in agriculture and agri-marketing, social security and crop insurance, as selective actions can distort our well-established system and prove counterproductive, or try to frame our own viable and dynamic agricultural policies that will provide economic and ecological sustainability and protect the interests of various sections of the population.The author is former Dean, College of Agriculture, PAU, and founder V-C, BandaUniversity of Agriculture and Technology, UPSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-half-baked-policies-can-be-counterproductive-222121
08-03-2021||---||US for Indian role in Afghan peace process||New Delhi, March 7US Secretary of State Tony Blinken has suggested that the involvement of India in a UN-convened conference to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan, the Afghan media has reported.Blinken, in a letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah, has made several suggestions to accelerate the peace process.On top of the list is a UN-convened meeting of foreign ministers from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan. This may not be a closed list because Blinken suggests Turkey could host a senior-level meeting of the Ghani government and the Taliban to finalise a peace agreement.US envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad would share with Kabul and the Taliban written proposals “aimed at accelerating discussions on a negotiated settlement and ceasefire”.These proposals basically seek to address the three areas that need to be sorted out between the warring parties—the foundational principles that will guide Afghanistan’s future constitutional and governing arrangements; a roadmap to a new, inclusive government and the terms of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.For the immediate, the US has prepared a revised proposal for a 90-day reduction in violence that would prevent a spring offensive by the Taliban.On maintaining its armed forces in Afghanistan, Blinken said the US has not ruled out any option. “We are considering the full withdrawal of our forces by May 1st, as we consider other options,” he said.Calling on Ghani to work with the US, Blinken said even with the continuation of the US financial assistance to Afghan forces after an American withdrawal, the security situation may worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-for-indian-role-in-afghan-peace-process-221987
08-03-2021||Beijing||China & India should not 'undercut' each other; must create ‘enabling conditions’ to resolve border issue: Chinese FM Wang||China and India should stop “undercutting” each other, shed mutual “suspicion” and create “enabling conditions” by expanding bilateral cooperation to resolve the border issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday.Calling the boundary dispute as not the “whole story” of the China-India relationship, Wang said that both countries were friends and partners but they should shed their suspicion of each other.Answering a question at his annual press conference on the current state of India-China relations following the tense standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year and how Beijing viewed the relationship going forward, he said it is important that both countries manage their disputes properly and expand bilateral cooperation.“The boundary dispute, an issue left from history, is not the whole story of the China-India relationship.  It is important that the two sides manage disputes properly and at the same time expand and enhance cooperation to create enabling conditions for the settlement of the issue,” Wang said at the virtual press conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People’s Congress, China’s Parliament.In his lengthy answer, Wang, who is also a State Councillor, did not touch upon the recent disengagement of troops from the most contentious north and south banks of the Pangong Lake area in eastern Ladakh after the 10th round of military-level talks between the two sides.Wang’s comments on the border issue came days after he held a 75-minute telephonic conversation with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during which the latter emphasised that the disengagement of troops at all friction points is necessary to bring peace and tranquillity on the border and for the development of bilateral relations.Also on Friday, India’s Ambassador to China Vikram Misri met Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui and called for completing the disengagement of troops from all areas in eastern Ladakh, saying that it would help restore peace and tranquillity at the border and provide conditions for progress in bilateral ties.In his remarks, Wang pointed out that the world expects both China and India to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries and advance multipolarity in the world.“On many important issues, our positions are the same or close due to similar national realties, therefore China and India are each other’s friends and partners, not threats or rivals,” the foreign minister said.“The two sides need to help each other to succeed instead of undercutting each other. We should intensify cooperation instead of harbouring suspicion at each other,” he said.Without directly referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff, Wang said, “the right and wrongs at what happened at the border area last year are clear, so are the stakes involved”. “We are committed to settling the boundary dispute through dialogue and consultation. At the same time we are resolved to safeguard our sovereign rights”, he said, reiterating China’s stance on the border standoff.Wang said it falls on both sides to solidify the existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication and improve the various management mechanisms to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquillity in the border areas.On how China looks to move forward its relations with India after the border standoff, Wang said, “In the year ahead we hope India will work with China to truly deliver on the important common understanding reached by our leaders that the two countries are not threats to each other but opportunities for each other’s development”.          “Together we can bring greater benefits to the 2.7 billion people in China and India, make greater contributions to the advent of the Asian Century” he said.He said the China-India relationship is essentially about how the world’s two largest countries get along and pursue development and rejuvenation together.“As two ancient civilisations, next door to each other and as two major emerging economies with each over one billion people, we have broad common interests and tremendous potential for cooperation”, he said.At home, both countries face the “historic mission” of bettering lives, accelerating growth, Wang added.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake area and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.Subsequently, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in over four decades. Eight months after the confrontation, China admitted that its four soldiers were killed in the fight. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-india-should-not-undercut-each-other-must-create-enabling-conditions-to-resolve-border-issue-chinese-fm-wang-221958

Before elections, it is Ujjwala and post polls it turns into ‘jumla’. How much money changed hands during the corrupt practises under Ujjwala Yojana? The entire country knows about the Modi-Shah syndicate,” Banerjee said, countering the BJP’s allegations that her dispensation had institutionalised a “cut-money culture” in the state.Crude oil prices have dipped all over the world but in India, fuel rates had touched the roof, the TMC supremo noted.“You have made many empty promises. People will not accept your falsehood every day. We demand you make LPG cylinder affordable for every citizen of the country. You have made LPG cylinders inaccessible for the common man,” Banerjee stated during her address.Listing her government’s achievements in Bengal, she said: “The state has undertaken several development projects, built metalled roads connecting major thoroughfares. The Centre, on its part, has done nothing.”Referring to Modi’s dig at her over TMC’s ‘Khela Hobe’ poll slogan, she said: “It means we are ready for your challenges. And we are...A game (khela hobe) will be played before the elections. I am open to face-to-face debates.”The Prime Minister, during the mega rally in Kolkata, accused Banerjee of “betraying” the people of the state who trusted that she would bring about a change after the Left rule.“Bengal chose you in role of ‘Didi’ (elder sister) but you preferred being ‘bua’ (aunt) to your ‘bhatija’ (nephew Abhishek Banerjee),” he said.Contending that the Prime Minister addressed an empty ground in Kolkata during the day, Banerjee said: “When Modi starts delivering his address in programmes like ‘Mann Ke Baat’, people feel scared that he will put them in trouble by announcing another anti-people move, like the 2016 notebandi.”“He gives speech in Bangla but the script is always written in Gujarati and kept under a transparent sheet of glass before him. He just pretends that he is speaking in Bangla without any help,” she said.The Chief Minister also rebutted Modi’s claim that crimes against women were on the rise in the state, and said: “He has little idea about the ground situation. In Bengal, women can move around freely at 10 pm, unlike Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh (both BJP-ruled states).”She insisted that the saffron party knew nothing about Bengal and its culture.“Your party had vandalised Vidyasagar’s bust. Your party dishonoured Birsa Munda. Your party wrongly said Rabindranath Tagore was born in Santiniketan. This shows your depth of knowledge about Bengal and its culture,” she said.Asking everyone to raise their voice against the “riot-mongering BJP”, Banerjee said: “People of Bengal, who had been living in peace casting aside barriers of community and language, would come under grave threat if a divisive force such as the saffron party comes to power in the state.”Lashing out at Prime Minister Modi for “including his photo in COVID-19 vaccination certificates”, Banerjee further pointed out that Modi never flew down Bengal when the pandemic hit, “and was sitting at home in fear. But I travelled to different areas, visited hospitals”. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-peddling-lies-to-mislead-voters-mamata-221942
08-03-2021||Kolkata||'I'm a pure cobra', says actor Mithun Chakraborty after joining BJP||Veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty on Sunday joined the BJP at Brigade Parade Ground here ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mega rally.Chakraborty was welcomed into the fold by BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and state president Dilip Ghosh among others.The National Award-winning actor, after being handed the saffron party flag by Ghosh, said he had always wanted to work for the underprivileged, and the saffron camp has given him a platform to fulfill his aspiration.He also asserted that he was proud to be a Bengali."I always wanted to do something big in life, but had never dreamt of being a part of such a huge rally which is to be addressed by world's most popular leader Narendra Modi. I wished to work for the poorer sections of our society, and that wish will now be fulfilled," he said.Amid huge cheers from supporters, Chakraborty, borrowing a dialogue from one of his films, said, "Ami joldhorao noi, bele borao noi... ami ekta cobra, ek chobol-ei chobi (Don't mistake me for a harmless snake, I am a cobra, can kill people in one bite)," he said.Vijayvargiya, who visited Chakraborty at his residence here on Saturday evening, had announced that he would be participating in the rally.Last month, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat met the actor at his Mumbai bungalow over breakfast, setting off speculation that he might join the BJP.Chakraborty, who earlier maintained close ties with Mamata Banerjee, was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by the TMC in 2014.He, however, quit the Upper House seat in 2016 citing health reasons, after his name surfaced in the Saradha ponzi scam. — PTIActor Mithun Chakraborty joins BJP at PM Shri @narendramodi's rally at Brigade Parade Ground, Kolkata.#ModirSatheBrigade pic.twitter.com/gvIMfmmNFb||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/im-a-pure-cobra-says-actor-mithun-chakraborty-after-joining-bjp-221914

We will do whatever it takes to show our ‘nararzgi’ (anger),” he said. Yudhvir Singh said the movement has got a very good response from Rajasthan and they are considering a panchayat in Jaipur on the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. “We will hold meetings/panchayats in Bengal on March 12, 13, and 14, Madhya Pradesh on March 14 and 15, Odisha on March 19, and Karnataka on March 20, 21, and 22.

08-03-2021||Kolkata||We promise to bring ‘asol parivartan’, says PM Modi at Kolkata rally||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a blistering attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of “betraying and insulting” the people of the state who trusted she will bring about a change after the Left rule.The Prime Minister also accused her of nepotism by choosing to play the limited role of “bua” (aunt) to her “bhatija” (nephew) instead of becoming “Didi” (elder sister) to the people.Addressing a massive BJP rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds, his first in West Bengal after the announcement of assembly polls, Modi hit out at his detractors who accuse him of favouring a handful of his businessmen friends.“You have betrayed and insulted the people of Bengal who trusted that you will be the harbinger of change after the end of the Left rule. You smashed to smithereens their hopes and dreams,” he said, excoriating the TMC supremo.Also read: Modi peddling lies to mislead voters: MamataActor Mithun Chakraborty joins BJP ahead of PM's rally in KolkataActor Mithun Chakraborty joins BJP at PM Shri @narendramodi's rally at Brigade Parade Ground, Kolkata.#ModirSatheBrigade pic.twitter.com/gvIMfmmNFb  He alleged Banerjee promoted nepotism while neglecting the people who fondly called her ‘Didi’.“Bengal chose you in role of ‘Didi’ but you preferred being ‘bua’ to your ‘bhatija’,” he said.The BJP has been accusing Banerjee of trying to install her nephew and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek as the next chief minister.Hitting back at rival leaders such as former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Banerjee, who often accuse him of favouring his industrialist friends, Modi said given his humble background, he valued friendship.“All 130 crore people of India are my friends, I work for them. I gave 90 lakh gas connections to my friends of Bengal. I have special affinity with tea, and the tea-garden workers of Bengal are my friends for whom I have implemented a social security scheme,” he said.Modi has often spoken about how he used to sell tea at a railway station and on trains as a small boy.He also attacked Banerjee for triggering the insider- outsider debate.“When those believing in Marx and Lenin and a party like the TMC, an offshoot of the Congress, are parties of insiders, how the BJP, for whose foundation Syama Prasad Mookerjee was the source of inspiration, can be a party of outsiders,” he said.The Prime Minister said he was committed to bringing about “asol parivartan” (real change) in West Bengal where all sections of people progress but nobody was appeased, and infiltration was stopped.“Be it North Bengal or South Bengal, ordinary people or refugees....all will progress but nobody will be appeased. Infiltration will be stopped completely,” he asserted, reaffirming his commitment to the Mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas’.Accusing the TMC government of destroying the democratic system, he alleged that ‘loktantra’ (democracy) was replaced with ‘lootantra’ (systematic plunder) in the 10 years of its rule.“Lotus is about to bloom in Bengal because of the ‘kichad’ (muck) created by you, Didi,” the Prime Minister said.

08-03-2021||Jhajjar||Hisar farmer ends life by hanging from tree at Tikri border, blames three farm laws||A 48-year-old farmer died by suicide as he hung himself from a tree at the Tikri-Bahadurgarh border on Sunday. He left a note blaming the three contentious farm laws for the extreme step.The deceased, who was actively participating in the farmers' agitation, has been identified as Rajbir from Hisar district.A suicide note recovered from the spot said the three farm laws were responsible for him taking the extreme step.The incident came to light when fellow farmers spotted his body hanging from the tree near the Kasar village turn and informed the police.In a suicide note, Rajbir called upon the farmers to go back home only after the three farm laws are repealed and the minimum support price (MSP) is guaranteed. He also demanded the Union Government fulfil his last wish and repeal the laws.“The government demands sacrifice hence I sacrifice on behalf of farmers,” stated the suicide note.Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) Haryana has expressed a deep sense of grief on the tragic incident."The note left behind by the deceased shows the extent of anguish among the protesting farmers as a result of utter insensitivity of the Modi government," said Inderjeet Singh, a leader of the SKM.He claimed these sacrifices shall not go to waste and the people would "severely punish the BJP and JJP".Last month, a farmer from Jind in Haryana who was also supporting the agitation against the Centre’s farm laws had allegedly hanged himself from a tree, merely two kilometres from the Tikri border protest site.Earlier, another farmer from Haryana had allegedly consumed a poisonous substance at the Tikri border. He had died during treatment at a Delhi hospital later.In December last, a lawyer from Punjab had allegedly killed himself by consuming poison a few kilometres away from the protest site at the Tikri border.Earlier, Sikh preacher Sant Ram Singh had also allegedly ended his life near the Singhu border protest site, claiming that he was “unable to bear the pain of the farmers”.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since November last year at Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the Centre has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture. —with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hisar-farmer-ends-life-by-hanging-from-tree-at-tikri-border-blames-three-farm-laws-221860
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Poet-activist Varavara Rao discharged from hospital in Mumbai||Poet-activist Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, has been discharged from Nanavati Hospital here, sources said.The 82-year-old activist, who was granted interim bail for six months on medical grounds by the Bombay High Court on February 22, was discharged from the private hospital late Saturday night, they said.Rao, arrested in 2018, was admitted to the medical facility in November last year due to ill-health.The HC had last month directed that he be released immediately on bail after being discharged from the hospital.While granting him bail, the high court had asked Rao to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and two solvent sureties of the like amount.Rao later requested the court that he be allowed to furnish cash surety as the process of submitting solvent sureties was taking time.The court last Monday allowed Rao to furnish a cash surety of Rs 50,000 and gave him time till April 5 to submit the two solvent sureties of the same amount.The case is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The HC while granting him bail imposed various conditions on his release, including a direction to remain in Mumbai, within the jurisdiction of the NIA court here.After the six-month period, Rao will have to either surrender before the trial court or approach the HC for an extension of the bail period.The case pertains to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the 'Elgar Parishad' conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.The police have claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.
