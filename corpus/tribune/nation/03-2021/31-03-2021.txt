My heartfelt gratitude to all the well-wishers who have supported me during the struggle,” the former police officer posted on social media.A decision by the Uttar Pradesh government was taken on December 20, 2017, to withdraw such lawsuits allegedly inspired by politics.In this sequence, the CJM court withdrew the case against Shailendra Singh, CM’s aide Shalabh Mani Tripathi told PTI.Singh received the copy of the order on Tuesday, an official release said.The development came on a day when Ansari, who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was on Wednesday produced before a Mohali court in Punjab in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion matter. The court fixed April 12 as the next date of hearing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-government-orders-withdrawal-of-case-against-former-dsp-who-slapped-pota-on-mukhtar-ansari-232727

31-03-2021||Mumbai||NFAI says it has acquired rare footage of Meena Kumari’s ‘Pakeezah’||The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) on Wednesday said they have obtained a rare footage of Meena Kumari-starrer “Pakeezah”, including visuals of the popular song ‘Inhin Logon Ne’.NFAI said they have added a rare 18-minute footage in 16mm of the making of Kamal Amrohi’s iconic film to the archives. The footage has visuals of the 15-year long journey of “Pakeezah”, from its inception to release.Also featuring Raaj Kumar and Ashok Kumar, the romantic musical drama revolves around a courtesan (Kumari) and her forbidden love.“This is a very rare addition to the NFAI collection. The preliminary inspection reveals the condition of the film is heavily scratched and colour faded. We are trying our best to salvage the material so that it can be made accessible to the audience”, Prakash Magdum, director, NFAI, said in a statement here.One of the highlights is the visual of the popular song ‘Inhin Logon Ne’ shot in black and white in the early period of the shooting of the film, in which young Kumari is seen dancing.This was one of the first sequences to be shot and the clapper board shows the date as 16th July 1956, the NFAI said in a release on the 49th death anniversary of Meena Kumari.The footage also contains a Mohammed Rafi’s qawwali number ‘Jaye Toh Jaye Kaha, Ab Ye Tera Deewana’, which was not included in the released film, it said.Ghulam Mohammad, best known for scoring music for “Mirza Ghalib”, “Shama”, had composed the music of “Pakeezah”, to lyrics penned by several poets, including Kaifi Azmi, Majrooh Sultanpuri and Kaif Bhopali.The other visuals include scenes from the premiere of the film, which was held at the Maratha Mandir in Bombay on February 4, 1972, the release said.Amrohi and Meena Kumari had married in 1952, but their relationship soured later.The film went on floors in 1956 and reportedly took about 16 years to arrive on the big screen. “Pakeezah” opened to wide acclaim upon its release on February 4, 1972. It is now considered a Hindi cinema classic.Weeks after the release of “Pakeezah”, Kumari died on 31 March 1972 at the age of 39 due to liver cirrhosis.Known as the tragedy queen of Bollywood, Meena Kumari made her debut as a child-artist in 1939 with “Leatherface” and mesmerized the audiences with her performance in films like “Bachchon Ka Khel”, “Baiju Bawra”, Parineeta, “Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam”, “Kaajal”, “Pakeezah”, “Mere Apne”, “Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai” and “Dil Ek Mandir”.

31-03-2021||New Delhi||CRPF suspends chief sports officer; coach after internal probe finds them guilty of sexual harassment||The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) on Wednesday suspended its chief sports officer Deputy Inspector General Khajan Singh and coach Inspector Surjit Singh after a preliminary probe found them guilty of sexual harassment of women personnel, official sources said.They said a committee headed by CRPF Inspector General Charu Sinha based in Srinagar has found the charges of sexual harassment levelled against them by a 30-year-old woman constable prima facie valid.“Deputy Inspector General Khajan Singh and Inspector Surjit Singh have been suspended following the recommendations of the preliminary probe conducted by the force,” a senior officer said.Khajan Singh, the chief sports officer of the country’s largest paramilitary force, had won a silver medal at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games in the 200m butterfly event, which was India’s first medal in swimming at the event since the 1951 edition.Khajan Singh had earlier denied the allegations and said these charges were “absolutely false and this was done just to spoil his image”.In a complaint filed at Baba Haridas police station in Delhi in December last year, the woman constable accused the duo of raping her and alleged that they had sexually harassed women constables as well and later used them as “their accomplices”.The woman, who joined the CRPF in 2010, was stated to have later retracted her allegations during police probe.Sources had said in December that the woman had recorded her statement before a magistrate under CrPC section 164 where she allegedly retracted her allegations against the two CRPF sports officers.Former CRPF Director General Anand Prakash Maheshwari, who retired in February, had told reporters during a press conference in January that all due legal processes would be followed in this case and anyone found guilty would be punished based on the recommendations of the committee.The CRPF, an about 3.25 lakh personnel strong force, first inducted women in combat ranks in 1986 and it has six all-women battalions at present with an overall strength of about 8,000 personnel in them.It also has women personnel in sports and other administrative wings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crpf-suspends-chief-sports-officer-coach-after-internal-probe-finds-them-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-232722

31-03-2021||---||LPG price cut by Rs 10 per cylinder||New Delhi, March 31After raising cooking gas prices by Rs 125 per cylinder last month, state-owned oil firms on Wednesday announced a Rs 10 per cylinder cut in LPG rates on softening international oil prices.A 14.2-kg LPG cylinder—both for subsidised and market price users—will cost Rs 809 from April 1 as against Rs 819 currently, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said in a statement.The price cut, which traditionally is announced on the day the change is effective  -- four times the rates went up in a span of one month—was announced a day ahead of the second phase of voting in West Bengal. The politically-crucial Nandigram constituency from where state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is taking on her once-trusted aide Suvendu Adhikari, who is contesting on BJP ticket, is also going for polls on Thursday.“Prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the international market have been on a constant uptrend since November 2020. As India is largely import-dependent on crude oil and the prices are market-linked, the increase in international prices resulted in an increase in the domestic price of petroleum products,” IOC said.However, due to growing worries about rising COVID cases in Europe and Asia and concerns over the side effects of the vaccine, prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the international market softened in the second fortnight of March 2021.“Accordingly, oil companies have reduced the retail selling price of diesel and petrol by 60 paise per litre and 61 paise per litre, respectively, at Delhi market over the past few days. There was a corresponding reduction in prices at other markets during this period,” it said.This reduction has come as a relief to motorists and transporters across India.“Further, with a view to give relief to domestic LPG consumers, the price of domestic LPG cylinder has been reduced by Rs 10 per cylinder from Rs 819 to Rs 809 per cylinder at Delhi effective April 1, 2021. The same reduction has been carried out in other markets,” it said.LPG prices had gone up by Rs 125 per 14.2-kg cylinder since the beginning of February, price data from state-owned oil marketing companies showed.LPG is available only at one rate, market price, across the country. The government, however, gives a small subsidy to select customers.However, this subsidy has been eliminated in metros and major cities through successive price increases over the past couple of years. So, in places like Delhi, there is no subsidy paid to customers since May 2020 and all LPG users pay the market price, which has now been reduced to Rs 809.An oil company official said a small subsidy is paid to customers in remote and far-flung areas to make up for the higher price arising from freight charges.LPG prices were hiked first by Rs 25 per cylinder on February 4, followed by a Rs 50 per cylinder increase on February 15 and a Rs 25 raise on February 25 and March 1.After three reductions in one week, petrol now costs Rs 90.56 per litre in Delhi, down from a record high of Rs 91.17, and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 80.87.Despite bouts of rate freeze, prices had gone up by a record Rs 21.58 per litre for petrol since the government raised excise duty in March last year. Diesel prices had increased by Rs 19.18 a litre.“Driven by the vigorous thrust of the government on making accessible clean energy to all Indians, LPG has emerged as the preferred kitchen partner for almost every Indian. LPG penetration in India has improved from 55 per cent in 2014 to more than 99 per cent today,” IOC said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lpg-price-cut-by-rs-10-per-cylinder-232709

31-03-2021||London||Indian national arrested in UK for immigration offences||An Indian national is among four others arrested from a lorry in eastern England as part of a National Crime Agency (NCA) led investigation into organised immigration crime.While a 38-year-old man was detained on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration and is now being questioned, the Indian national and three Bangladeshi nationals were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences, to be dealt with by the immigration authorities as suspected illegal migrants.“People smuggling networks operate in both directions across the UK border, with the same organised crime groups often involved in bringing migrants in and moving them out,” said NCA branch operations manager Ian Truby.“This poses an obvious threat to the security of both the UK and our neighbours. Those being moved out of the UK in this way may be in the country illegally, they could be trying to evade law enforcement, or they might be being trafficked against their will. We are determined to do all we can to disrupt and dismantle the gangs who put lives at risk and threaten security,” he said.NCA said its officers, supported by the local Hertfordshire Police, moved in after witnessing a Romanian registered lorry being broken into at South Mimms services, or petrol station, on the M25 highway in the early hours of Tuesday morning.NCA investigators believe they would have attempted to leave the UK in the lorry, without the driver being aware.

The east and northeast divisions comprise the Gangetic West Bengal, Sikkim and sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Assam while the extreme north India comprise the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.The IMD also said currently, moderate La Niña conditions are prevailing over equatorial Pacific and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are below normal over central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The latest forecast indicates warming of SSTs during the coming season and there is a possibility of transition of La Niña conditions to ENSO neutral conditions during the forthcoming hot weather season.El Nino is associated with the heating of the Pacific waters while La Nina is linked to cooling of the cooling of Pacific waters. Both have an impact on the Indian subcontinent, especially the monsoon.Several parts of the country saw temperatures crossing 40 degrees Celsius in March.This is the second summer forecast by the IMD. Earlier this month, it had issued a forecast for March to May.It said during March to May, day temperatures are likely to be above normal in north, northeast, parts of east and west India.

31-03-2021||New Delhi||Indo-Pak ‘peace-mongers’ join hands||Taking heart from attempts at rapprochement between New Delhi and Islamabad, peace activists from both sides have decided to float a South Asia Peace Action Network (SAPAN) to bring “peace-monger” groups and individuals under one umbrella.A virtual brainstorming session between Indian and Pakistani peace activists across time zones on March 28 resolved that SAPAN will urge both governments to reduce hostility, enable people to people contact by easing the visa regime and cut down on military expenditure.With the recent announcement of a ceasefire by both armies and the meeting of the Indus Water Commissioners last week, a thaw between the two nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours does not seem impossible, said a statement at the end of the interaction.“There is conflict reporting, but we haven’t placed enough emphasis on peace journalism,” said Raza Rumi, editor Naya Daur, about the role of the media in fuelling tensions between both countries.Activists hoped the current thaw in India-Pakistan relations will lead to more exchanges between the countries. Over the past five years, cultural exchanges as well as people-to-people contact between the two countries has almost come to a halt with very few visas being granted.The participants included artist Salima Hashmi, former Planning Commission member Syeda Hameed, labour activist Karamat Ali, author Urvashi Butalia, women’s rights activist Sheema Kermani, Vijayan M.J., Sanjoy Hazarika of CHRI, Sandeep Panday, editor Kashmir Times, Anuradha Bhasin Jamwal, and former Indian Navy chief Ramu Ramdas besides several prominent Rotarians from both sides.“We need to broaden the peace constituency by bringing people together, learning from each other on issues that affect us and that have potential to change our future,” said Ravi Nitesh, co-founder of the youth group Aaghaz-e-Dosti.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-pak-peace-mongers-join-hands-232696
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||After 132 years of supplying milk to troops, Military Farms formally close down||Almost a century-and-a-half after they were established to produce and supply fresh milk as well as milk products for troops, the Army’s Military Farms have finally been closed down.The move comes about three years after the Ministry of Defence cleared a proposal to shut 39 Military Farms across the country in a bid to rationalise resources and cut manpower and reduce costs.A formal ceremony was held at Delhi Cantonment today in which the Military Farm’s regimental flag was lowered for the last time and laid to rest with full military honours.“After 132 years of glorious service to the Nation, curtains were drawn on Military Farms on 31 Mar 2021. All Officers & Staff have been redeployed within the Ministry of Defence to continue providing service to the Nation,” a tweet on the Army’s official handle said.In August 2017, the Defence Ministry had announced a series of reform measures for the Indian Army which included shutting down certain logistical and static elements such as Military Farms and local workshops.The Army was spending about Rs 300 crore annually on the operations and maintenance of these farms. These supplied more than 3.5 crore litres of milk and 25,000 metric tonnes of hay annually to the Army, accounting for 14 per cent of the total requirement. The remaining requirements were sourced through local commercial purchase.Occupying around 20,000 acres of defence land across the country, the Military Farms held about 25,000 head of cattle. The animals will be transferred to other government departments or dairy cooperatives at a nominal cost.Military Farms in India were established by the British Army and the first such farm was set up on February 1, 1889 at Allahabad. Thereafter, a large number of Military Farms were set up, which at the time of partition numbered over 100 units mostly in the present Central, Southern and Western Command.With the formation of the Eastern Command and Northern Command additional Military Farms units were established.A quasi-commercial organisation, the role of Military Farms included supply of fresh milk and butter to troops in peace, field and high-altitude areas at their location on daily basis as well as production, procurement, transportation and issue of baled hay to animal transport units as per demand.In India, Military Farms are pioneers in introduction of Artificial Insemination in cattle in 1925. The dairy development in the organised sector in the country is also attributed to Military Farms. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the apex body on animal sciences, identified Military Farms as the largest cattle holding department in the country.ICAR also had a collaborative project with Military Farms, Project Frieswal, to evolve a national cross-bred cattle breed for the country.The Defence Research and Development Organisation also joined hands with Military Farms for large scale plantation of Jatropha for the production of bio-diesel as an alternative, eco-friendly source of energy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-132-years-of-supplying-milk-to-troops-military-farms-formally-close-down-232692
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab's coronavirus testing rate higher than national average, CM Amarinder responds to Centre||Taking strong exception to the Centre's criticism of the COVID-19 management in Punjab, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said the state's rate of tests per million was higher than the national average and claimed the situation would have been better if the central government had not "delayed" the vaccination process.Had the central government acceded to the state's request for allowing vaccination of all 50-plus category population earlier, instead of delaying it by almost two months to include those aged above 45, the situation would have been better than present, he said.Singh was reacting to the Centre's charge that Punjab was not doing enough coronavirus testing and isolating infected people.In a statement on Wednesday, the chief minister said his government had put severe restrictions on social gatherings and closed all educational institutions, with night curfews imposed from 9 pm to 5 am in the severely affected 11 districts.Singh also said a decision on stricter restrictions will be taken after a review of the situation in the state on April 8.The chief minister's warning to impose harsher restrictions if the situation does not improve by next week comes amid a surge in COVID-19 cases and fatalities in the state.He said the state government had been repeatedly requesting the Centre in writing as well as in meetings attended by the chief secretary that the current strategy of immunisation needs review.Vaccination in a campaign that covers all age groups in selected areas will lead to better outcomes than the periodic cycles of vaccination targeting a small section of the population at each cycle, he stressed, underlining the need for such approach in any area where weekly testing shows a doubling of positivity rate.He reiterated his demand for permission for occupation-based immunisation for school and college students and teachers, judges, bus drivers and conductors, panches/ sarpanches, mayors, MLAs, MPs, etc. everywhere.He also took note of the delay in receiving reports of genome sequencing.Of the 874 samples sent, only 588 reports had been received so far, of which 411 samples were found positive for B.1.1.7 (the UK variant) and two samples for N440K.The implication of presence of the UK variant mutant needs to be looked into and appropriate advice is required to be shared with the state, Singh said.The chief minister said that during the first peak in September 2020, the positivity rate was around 10 and the state was testing 30,000 samples per day.Now, when the positivity is over 7 per cent, the state is testing around 40,000 samples per day. The state is consistently testing around 90 per cent RT-PCR and about 10 rapid antigen tests and its per million testing is 1,96,667 while the national average is 1,82,296, he said.The state had very limited capacity of testing RT-PCR when this pandemic started.It was about 40 samples per day and within a very short span of time, the capacity was ramped up to more than 25,000 tests per day, he said.The state is consistently utilizing its optimal RT-PCR capacity. The government of India's institutions like IISER, IMTech, PGIMER are supporting the state to the extent of only about 100 samples per day, the chief minister said, adding that the state can increase RAT testing to any level if there is need to do so.During the first peak in September 2020, Punjab had increased contact tracing to 10 contacts per positive case. Now, during the second peak, “we are tracing more than 15 contacts per positive case,” he added.Punjab has been neither conducting adequate number of tests nor been able to promptly isolate COVID-19 positive people, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjabs-coronavirus-testing-rate-higher-than-national-average-cm-amarinder-responds-to-centre-232691
31-03-2021||New Delhi||Farmers to march to Parliament on foot in May: Samyukt Kisan Morcha||Announcing their plans for the upcoming two months, farmers, who have been protesting against the new farm laws at the Delhi borders, said they will march to the Parliament on foot in May, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said on Wednesday.“The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha met yesterday, and decided that the farmers will be undertaking a march to the Parliament. The date for the march is yet to be decided.“It will be joined not just by farmers, but also by women, and unemployed individuals, and labourers who have been supporting the movement,” farmer leader Gurnaam Singh Chaduni said.Addressing a press conference, he said that the march would be carried out in a “peaceful” manner, and special care would be taken that “what happened on January 26 is not repeated”.The leaders also shared their plans of forming a committee to control protesters if there is police action in Parliament march.“We will form a committee to let the protesters know what to do in case there is police action during the march.“It will also be made clear to them that SKM condemns all kinds of violence. So, the protestors will know that if there is any damage of property by them, they will have to serve the penalty,” a farmer leader said.Farmer leaders also announced their plans to block the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway for 24 hours on April 10.“We will be blocking the KMP expressway on April 10 for 24 hours, that is from 11 am on April 10 to 11 am on the next day.“We will be doing this because the government has not been listening to us. It has been sleeping. This is to wake up the government,” another farmer leader said.An event to honour the farmers who have lost their lives during the agitation will be organised on May 6.“Soil from different parts of the country will be brought to these borders and a memorial will be created for all our brothers who have lost their lives while participating in this movement,” a farmer leader said.Separate events will also be organised to commemorate Ambedkar Jayanti and Labour Day.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

31-03-2021||---||After record surge, petrol, diesel and LPG prices to fall||New Delhi, March 31After a record increase in rates, petrol, diesel and domestic cooking gas (LPG) prices are likely to fall in the near term as international oil prices have softened, a top official said Wednesday.While petrol and diesel prices have already been cut thrice in one week, cooking gas (LPG) price too will see a reduction in the near future, the official, who did not want to be identified, said.“International oil prices, which are the benchmark for deciding retail rates, have softened over the past few days. Though there had been some firming up of prices on Tuesday, overall the trend has been of a decline, which should reflect in domestic retail rates as well,” he said.Petrol and diesel prices touched an all-time high last month while LPG prices too had been increased by Rs 125 per cylinder in recent weeks.But since the end of February, petrol and diesel prices have remained static because of international prices being range-bound. They have been cut by 60-61 paise a litre in three reductions in one week after global prices softened.“The trend indicates that there will be no increase in prices in the near term. In fact, we may see a further reduction,” he said.Petrol now costs Rs 90.56 per litre in Delhi, down from a record high of Rs 91.17, and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 80.87.LPG price, which is benchmarked to Saudi LPG rates, too, will see a downward trend in coming weeks, the official said.While petrol and diesel prices are revised daily based on a 15-day rolling average of benchmark fuel in the international market, LPG rates are decided on the 1st of every month.The official said LPG prices will not go up any further. “In fact, the current price of Rs 819 is lower than the Rs 858 price witnessed during the same time last year,” he said, adding that LPG prices have come down internationally and the same should also reflect in domestic rates soon.LPG price had touched a record high of Rs 939 per cylinder in November 2018.International oil prices fell on the prospect of speedy recovery in consumption getting clouded by the second wave of COVID-19 cases, which has forced renewed lockdowns in parts of Europe.Ahead of the assembly elections in five states, including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, fuel prices had become a political issue with the opposition trying to corner the BJP-led government at the centre for doing little to ease consumer burden.Petrol crosses the Rs 100 mark in some cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra last month but with the fall in international oil prices, retail rates have come down.Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor too expressed optimism on retail prices coming down with softening international rates.“We are hoping that international prices would remain stable and would not go up. The benefit of any softening in rates will be passed on to the consumers promptly,” he said.India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs.Despite bouts of rate freeze, prices had gone up by a record Rs 21.58 per litre for petrol since the government raised excise duty in March last year. Diesel prices had increased by Rs 19.18 a litre. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-record-surge-petrol-diesel-and-lpg-prices-to-fall-232685

31-03-2021||Mumbai||RBI extends timeline to comply with directions on recurring online transactions||The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday extended the timeline by six months to comply with its guidelines related to recurring online transactions with Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA), but reprimanded players that the non-compliance is a “serious concern”.RBI had directed all banks including RRBs, NBFCs, and payment gateways to comply with AFA for automatic recurring payment by March 31, 2021, in order to make digital transaction safe and protect customers from fraudulent transactions.However, some of the players failed to meet the deadline and approached the RBI seeking extension of the deadline.“It is, however, noted that the framework has not been fully implemented even after the extended timeline. This non-compliance is noted with serious concern and will be dealt with separately. The delay in implementation by some stakeholders has given rise to a situation of possible large-scale customer inconvenience and default,” RBI said in a statement.To prevent any inconvenience to the customers, Reserve Bank of India has decided to extend the timeline for the stakeholders to migrate to the framework by six months, i.e., till September 30, 2021, it said.“Any further delay in ensuring complete adherence to the framework beyond the extended timeline will attract stringent supervisory action,” RBI cautioned.In August 2019, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued a framework for processing of e-mandates on recurring online transactions. Initially applicable to cards and wallets, the framework was extended in January 2020 to cover Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions as well.The statement said the requirement of AFA has made digital payments in India safe and secure.In the interest of customer convenience and safety in use of recurring online payments, the framework mandated use of AFA during registration and first transaction (with relaxation for subsequent transactions up to a limit of Rs 2,000, since enhanced to Rs 5,000), as well as pre-transaction notification, facility to withdraw the mandate, etc, it said.“The primary objective of the framework was to protect customers from fraudulent transactions and enhance customer convenience. Based on a request from Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) for an extension of time till March 31, 2021, to enable the banks to complete the migration, Reserve Bank had advised the stakeholders in December 2020 to migrate to the framework by March 31, 2021. Thus, adequate time was given to the stakeholders to comply with the framework,” it said.Commenting on the decision of RBI, Anshuman Verma, Director at Bridge Inventions, said this is a welcome step by the central bank and industry players have got the final grace period.Industry will ensure compliance of the RBI directive in the interest of safe and secure digital transactions, he added.

31-03-2021||Nandigram||Bengal set for second phase polling in 30 seats, all eyes on Nandigram||The stage is set for the second phase of assembly poll in West Bengal on Thursday when more than 75 lakh voters will decide the fate of 191 candidates in 30 seats as eyes are set on the high profile Nandigram constituency where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is pitted against her protégée turned adversary Suvendu Adhikari. All 10,620 booths where polling will be held this phase have been declared as sensitive by the Election Commission, which has deployed around 651 companies of central forces to provide security, officials said. Besides, the state police will also be deployed at strategic locations during the polling which will begin at 7 am, they said. A total 199 companies of Central Armed Police Force will be deployed in Purba Medinipur, 210 companies in Paschim Medinipur, 170 in South 24 Parganas and 72 in Bankura, the sources said.TMC and BJP are contesting in all the 30 seats, while CPI (M) is in the fray in 15 and its alliance partners of Sanjukta Morcha the Congress and ISF are competing in 13 and two seats respectively. Polling will take place amid strict COVID-19 guidelines in nine seats of Paschim Medinipur, eight in Bankura, four seats in South 24 Parganas and nine in Purba Medinipur—the home ground of TMC turncoat and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. Nandigram falls in Purba Medinipur district.   The agrarian constituency which shook the foundations of the mighty Left regime over the anti-land acquisition movement in 2007, has now turned into a battleground of titans with Banerjee suddenly deciding to switch from her Bhowanipur seat to the constituency held by Adhikari, her former lieutenant who has switched loyalty to the BJP.  For Adhikari it is a battle for political survival as a defeat would be a devastating blow and might also put a question mark on his political graph in his new party  the BJP. Similarly, a victory would not only establish him as one of the tallest leaders in Bengal but would also push him few miles ahead of others in the Chief Ministerial race in case the BJP is voted to power.  For Banerjee, who is running for the third successive term as chief minister, a victory is a must to lead the government and keep together her party, which is faced with exodus. For the Congress-Left-ISF alliance candidate Minakshi Mukherjee of CPI-M, the challenge is to regain her party's lost ground. While Banerjee had been camping in Nandigram for the last four days, BJP fielded its 'big guns', including Home Minister Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and superstar Mithun Chakraborty to defend Adhikari's turf, which he had won in 2016 and take on `Didi' (as Mamata is popularly called).Apart from identity politics and Bengali sub- nationalism, the demand for jobs, inclusion of Hindu backward communities in the OBC category and setting up of agro-based industry have emerged as main poll planks in the second phase of polls.  lOf the 30 seats which will see voting on Thursday, 23 were won by TMC in the 2016 assembly elections, five by Left Front  and Congress and BJP one each. The political equation in the state had changed in 2019 when BJP made massive inroads in the tribal-dominated Janga Mahal region and Medinipur belt by sweeping all the five Lok Sabha seats. The TMC, however, has been able to maintain its dominance in  South 24 Parganas district, where there is sizeable minority population.  A prominent seat going to the poll in the second phase is Sabang, where TMC has fielded its Rajya Sabha MP Manas Bhunia. He is up against TMC turncoat and BJP leader Amulya Maity.  Bhunia, a former state Congress president, had held the seat from 1982 to 016 as Congress nominee before switching over to the TMC in September 2016.TMC has fielded actor Sayantika Banerjee, a popular face in the Bengali silver screen, from  Bankura seat against BJP's Niladri Sekhar Dana. The Sanjukta Morcha has fielded Congress candidate Radharani Banerjee.In Debra seat, two former IPS officers will cross swords. One is BJP candidate Bharati Ghosh who is contesting against TMC's Humayun Kabir.  Both had resigned from their senior police  posts to join active politics. Banerjee, who is in a wheelchair since her accident early this moth, crisscrossed the majority of the constituencies going to the polls in the second phase. TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee toured the rest asserting that TMC will not let Bengal to be ruled from Delhi or Gujarat in an apparent reference to the battery of central BJP leaders and ministers camping in the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J P Nadda had led BJP's campaign from the front addressing rallies at Kanthi, Bankura and Nandigram and urging the electorate to vote for BJP to usher in 'ashol poriborton' (actual change) to build  'Sonar Bangla' (prosperous Bengal). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-set-for-second-phase-polling-in-30-seats-all-eyes-on-nandigram-232681

It will also cover various establishments under the AQEES to gather data on employment situation and change in employment situation.These surveys will provide crucial data for policy formulation in the field of labour and employment.The AQEES survey holds the objective of collecting employment data on the quarterly basis. It is designed to be Establishment based Employment Survey which would provide on a quarterly basis the employment estimates for establishments employing 10 or more workers and for the establishments recruiting 9 or less workers.This will address a major data gap in the biggest segment of the Indian labour market.On a similar vein the Migrant Worker Survey is the first focused survey on studying the socio-economic and working conditions of migrant workers. It will also assess the impact of COVID19 on migrant workers in India.Due to lack of adequate data, the Centre and the state governments were handicapped with regard to drawing up relief and rehabilitation plans for migrant workers affected during the Covid-19 generated national lockdown.  “These surveys will prove highly useful in providing Government crucial data on migrant workers and the employment situation in formal and informal enterprises” Labour Bureau of India’s Director General DP Negi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/labour-ministry-begins-field-work-for-surveys-on-migrant-workers-employment-232677

31-03-2021||New Delhi||North Indian plains to get some reprieve from heatwave; another heatwave likely from April 3||The north Indian plains which have been reeling under a heatwave are likely to get some relief over the next two days with temperatures expected to fall by 3-5 degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday. The relief will, however, be short. The IMD said another heatwave is likely over the plains by April 3.Over the last 4-5 days, the mercury has touched over 40 degrees Celsius in several parts of north India, especially Rajasthan. The National Capital reeled under a "severe" heatwave on Monday as the maximum temperature shot up to 40.1 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest day in March in 76 years.IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohaptra said there was pressure variation between the area stretching from the Gujarat coast to Haryana. Plus, there was a transfer of heat from Rajasthan which was already reeling under the heatwave. This led to the heating of plains.Naresh Kumar, senior scientist with the IMD who specialises in heatwaves, said the transfer of heat was also from Pakistan. He said one of the weather stations in Pakistan also recorded 45 degrees Celsius during the same time. There was also a western disturbance, but it did not bring moisture to the plains, thus raising the temperatures, Kumar added. "Maximum temperatures are very likely to fall by 3-5 degrees Celsius over the plains of northwest India during the next 2 days leading to abatement of heat wave conditions over Rajasthan from today (March 31)," the IMD said in its forecast.Dust raising strong surface winds (speed reaching 30-40 kmph) are very likely to prevail over Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, north Madhya Pradesh, east Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal during March 31 to April 1, the IMD said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-indian-plains-to-get-some-reprieve-from-heatwave-another-heatwave-likely-from-april-3-232671

31-03-2021||---||Doctors fear Bengal is heading towards severe outbreak of second wave of coronavirus||Kolkata, March 30As West Bengal heads into elections, doctors in the state fear the state is staring at a second wave of severe COVID-19 outbreak.The state is in the middle of assembly elections. Doctors fear that political rallies that are daily affairs before elections and the frequent flouting of COVID-19 protocols in these events could lead to steep rise in infection numbers of the state.Doctors in Kolkata fear that if protocols continue to be flouted, infection numbers could go back to the 2020 levels.Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, in-charge of the post-COVID follow-up clinic at the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital, which was a designated COVID-19 hospital, foresees a “severe outbreak” of contagion the state in the near future.Sisir Naskar, the superintendent of M R Bangur Hospital, another designated coronavirus hospital,  blamed the laxity of the common people for the recent spike of COVID-19 cases in the state.“In the case of any pandemic, second and third waves are inevitable as per the law of the nature. These will eventually go away but there cannot be a careless attitude. In our state, the laxity of the common people in fighting the disease is the primary reason behind the rise in the incidences of the disease,” he said.Bandopadhyay said the chances of more people being affected by the contagion is high in the state as more and more of them are participating in political rallies and meetings without wearing masks.Chances of virus transmission are higher in rallies because more droplets come out from the mouths of leaders when they address rallies and people surrounding him shout slogans - most of them without masks. This puts people near them to risk, he said.“It is quite a risky situation. We are seeing large number of people participating in rallies and meetings by political parties in West Bengal and not bothering about the norms which should be followed during this pandemic,” he said.We are heading towards a severe outbreak of the disease here in West Bengal and it may happen even before the elections are over. And if this happens, there will be another crisis in the state in which the hospitals may not be able to accomodate many of the affected,” city-based obstetrician- gynecologist Hiralal Konar told PTI.The eighth and the last phase of election in West Bengal is slated for April 29.According to Konar,  the second wave of the dreaded coronavirus, which has already hit the state, could have been delayed by another two to three months had the common people followed the precautionary measures.He blamed the lackadaisical attitude of the common people like not wearing proper masks and not maintaining physical distancing norms for the recent spike in the number of infections.Konar also blamed the political leaders of irresponsible attitude for organising campaign rallies putting to risk the lives of the common people participating in them.“The casual attitude of the people is quite dangerous.We have seen this sudden spike in the number of coronavirus over the last fortnight. The situation is aggravated by holding political rallies and meetings where norms are violated by everybody.“If the situation deteriorates further and there is only a caretaker government due to the election, the common people will face a very difficult situation,” he cautioned.The principal of ID&BG Hospital Anima Halder echoed Konar and blamed the casual approach of the people for the sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal.She said, “You cannot blame the political parties alone. I have seen people doing away with their masks and violating the physical distancing norm since Durga Puja last year. They sit and chat in tea stalls, participate in social gatherings and weddings, celebrate Holi.“The rise in coronavirus incidences is therefore inevitable. We cannot shrug off our responsibilities. The situation is grim and will deteriorate,” Mondal said when contacted.“We cannot take things lightly thinking that there are vaccines now. There are people, who after being vaccinated are randomly violating the safety protocols without understanding the gravity of the situation,” she added.Senior physician Syamasis Bandyopadhyay said that there is no data to support that the recent surge in the state is due to political rallies. “It is the complacency of the people which led to this situation,” he said when asked.“The COVID-19 situation deteriorated in Maharashtra though there was no political rally nor any election there at the time. There is no data to prove that the situation worsened in West Bengal because of the political rallies and campaigning. It is the people who are at fault,” he said.In the past 30 to 40 days, West Bengal has witnessed a four-fold surge in COVID-19 cases.On Sunday the state saw 827 new cases of the infection, the highest so far this year, a bulletin released by the state health department said.The maximum number of  292 cases was registered in the city and another 193 in adjacent North 24 Parganas district, it said.In October 2020 during the Durga Puja festival in the state, the daily COVID-19 infection rate had risen beyond 4000. It had dropped to 130 in February this year.Incidentally, when the state was witnessing a surge in the COVID-19 cases last year, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had blamed political rallies and the protests for it.The prevalence of the disease was then highest among the police who were deployed to maintain law and order and were among the frontline warriors against the disease.All the medical experts stressed on enhancing testing facilities and expediting vaccination to control its spread.“We must increase the number of tests daily which is the only way to ascertain the number of people contaminated.Besides, we need to raise the awareness level of the people to make them wear masks and maintain physical distancing,” Konar said.Mass scale vaccination will be the best way to tackle the COVID-19 surge, Syamasis Bandyopadhyay said.“Since, we have the vaccines now we must quickly inoculate people. The more the people are vaccinated, the stronger will be our fight against COVID-19. Not only this, we also need to continuously message people to raise their awareness on wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing,” he said.--- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-fear-bengal-is-heading-towards-severe-outbreak-of-second-wave-of-coronavirus-232665

Ansari's wife said she is frightened because of the past actions of some officers of the Uttar Pradesh government and is deeply concerned about the safety of his life."If my husband is sent to Uttar Pradesh without fixing responsibility for the safety of his life, then surely he would be killed by creating a false story. Therefore, it is a plea to the President to order that my husband is protected," Afshan Ansari said in the letter.Also read: BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari produced in Mohali court in extortion, criminal intimidation caseShe also urged that if it is required to produce Ansari in court, the President should order the government to arrange central security force personnel "to accompany him from prison to court and back".Mukhtar Ansari has been in judicial custody since October 25, 2005 in a number of criminal cases.Alka Rai, the legislator wife of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai who was killed allegedly at the hands of the Mukhtar Ansari gang in 2005, had demanded that Ansari be transferred to a jail in Uttar Pradesh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mukhtar-ansaris-wife-writes-to-president-seeking-security-for-him-during-transfer-from-punjab-jail-to-up-232656
31-03-2021||New Delhi||Centre-State, political relations never been as bad in history of independent India as now: Mamata||Facing a cutthroat poll battle in West Bengal, the TMC on Wednesday said its supremo Mamata Banerjee has written to non-BJP leaders, including Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, flagging the BJP’s “assault” on democracy and alleging the Centre-state relations were at its worst since independence.Banerjee’s letter is being seen as an attempt to portray her as a rallying point for all parties opposed to the BJP which has mounted an aggressive campaign to dislodge her from power in West Bengal after a 10-year rule. Before the TMC, the state was ruled for over three decades by the Left Front, which has now joined hands with the Congress to challenge both Banerjee’s party and the BJP.“I am writing this letter to you, and to several leaders of non-BJP parties, to convey my serious concerns over a series of assaults by the BJP and its government at the Centre on democracy and constitutional federalism in India,” Banerjee said in the letter which was released by the TMC on Wednesday.Referring to the passage of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill by the two Houses of Parliament, she said that it is an “extremely grave” development.“With this law, the BJP government at the Centre has snatched away practically all the powers of the democratically elected government of Delhi, and vested them in the hands of the Lt Governor, a nominee of the Centre. The Lt Governor has been made the undeclared Viceroy of Delhi, acting as a proxy for the home minister and the prime minister,” she said.The three-page letter has been addressed to Congress chairperson Sonia Gandhi, NCP’s Sharad Pawar, DMK’s MK Stalin, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray,JMM’s Hemant Soren, AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal, BJD’s  Naveen Patnaik, YSR Congress’ Jagan Reddy, NC’s Farooq Abdullah, PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti and CPI(ML)’s Dipankar Bhattacharya.In her letter, she also said that despite losing to the AAP in both 2014 and 2019, the BJP was “unwilling” to accept the people’s mandate.“The BJP has chosen to govern Delhi by making the chief minister subservient to the Lt Governor. The National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act is a direct attack on the federal structure of the Indian Republic, as enshrined in the Constitution. It also makes a mockery of the letter and spirit of democracy since it disempowers the people of the national capital.”“You will also agree that what the BJP has done in Delhi is not an exception, but is increasingly become a rule,” she said.She also alleged that the BJP government has been “brazenly and vindictively misusing” the CBI, ED and other institutions against leaders and functionaries of non-BJP parties for its own partisan political ends.Citing the examples of both West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where Assembly elections are now underway, she accused the government of “unleashing” the ED to conduct raids on functionaries of the All India Trinamool Congress and DMK.“Predictably, these institutions target only non-BJP leaders, and never those belonging to the BJP,” she alleged.The chief minister, who is fighting the Assembly election in West Bengal from the Nandigram seat which goes to polls on April 1, also accused the government of “deliberately” withholding transfer of funds to state governments, especially those ruled by non-BJP parties.“So that we face problems in implementing our development and welfare schemes to benefit common people,” she alleged.Banerjee also said that the move by the government of disbanding the National Development Council, Inter-State Council and the Planning Commission, and replacing it with NITI Ayog, is to “deactivate” every single platform where state governments used to traditionally place their legitimate demands, needs, concerns and views before the central government.“The BJP has amassed unlimited resources from questionable sources, which it is using to topple duly elected non-BJP governments and to engineer defections in non-BJP parties.“The Modi government’s policy of reckless and wholesale privatisation of the nation’s assets is also an attack on democracy because these assets belong to the people of India,” she said.Banerjee also highlighted how there is a “clear pattern” and purpose behind these developments and alleged that the BJP wants to make it impossible for non-BJP parties to exercise their constitutional rights and freedoms.“It wants to dilute the powers of state governments and downgrade them to mere municipalities. In short, it wants to establish a one-party authoritarian rule in India.“Overall, the Centre-state relations, and also relations between the ruling party at the Centre and opposition parties, have never been as bad in the history of independent India as they are now, and the blame for this rests squarely with the prime minister’s authoritarian conduct,” she said.In the letters, she has urged the opposition parties for a “united and effective” struggle against the BJP’s attacks on democracy and the Constitution.“As the chairperson of All India Trinamool Congress, I shall work wholeheartedly with you and all other like-minded political parties in this battle. We can win this battle only with unity of hearts and minds, and by presenting a credible alternative to the people of India.“After the conclusion of the ongoing Assembly elections, I suggest that we deliberate on these issues and chart a plan of action,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-state-political-relations-never-been-as-bad-in-history-of-independent-india-as-now-mamata-232655
31-03-2021||New Delhi||Government defers labour codes implementation; employees’ take home pay, cos’ PF liability to remain same for now||The four labour codes will not come into effect from April 1 as states are yet to finalise the relevant rules, which means that there will be no change in take home pay of employees and provident fund liability of companies for now.Once the wages code comes into force, there will be significant changes in the way basic pay and provident fund of employees are calculated.The labour ministry had envisaged implementing the four codes on industrial relations, wages, social security and occupational health safety & working conditions from April 1, 2021.The ministry had even finalised the rules under the four codes.“Since the states have not finalised the rules under the four codes, the implementation of these laws are deferred for the time being,” a source told PTI.According to the source, a few states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttarakhand had circulated the draft rules.Since labour is a concurrent subject under the Constitution of India, both the Centre and the states would have to notify rules under the codes to bring those into force in their respective jurisdictions.Under the new wages code, allowances are capped at 50 per cent. This means half of the gross pay of an employee would be basic wages.Provident fund contribution is calculated as a percentage of basic wage, which includes basic pay and dearness allowance.The employers have been splitting wages into numerous allowances to keep basic wages low to reduce provident fund and income tax outgo.The new wages code provides for provident fund contribution as a prescribed proportion of 50 per cent of gross pay.In case the new codes had come into effect from April 1, the take home pay of employees and provident fund liability of employers would have increased in many cases.Now the employer would get some more time to restructure salaries of their employees as per the new code on wages. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-defers-labour-codes-implementation-employees-take-home-pay-cos-pf-liability-to-remain-same-for-now-232650

He re-emphasized that there was no value in conserving vaccines for the second dose and that states must promptly supply vaccines to all government and private hospitals where there is a demand, the statement stated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-holds-review-meet-with-states-uts-ahead-of-opening-up-covid-vaccination-to-people-above-45-232648

31-03-2021|| Mumbai||Why you didn't approach police against Deshmukh? HC asks Param Bir Singh||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh why he did not lodge a police complaint against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh if he was aware of an alleged wrongdoing being committed by the minister.Singh recently claimed Deshmukh asked police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.The minister has denied any wrongdoing.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni asked Singh why he did not lodge a complaint with the police first, and said without an FIR the HC cannot intervene or direct for an independent agency like the CBI to carry out an investigation."You (Singh) are a senior police officer. You are not a layman. You were duty-bound to register a complaint against any wrongdoing. Despite knowing that an offence is being committed by your boss, you (Singh) remained silent," Chief Justice Datta said.The HC was hearing a criminal public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the HC on March 25 by Singh, seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh.The bench further noted that Singh cannot convert the HC into a magistrate court."The proper and appropriate course of action would be for you (Singh) to first lodge a complaint with police. If the police do not lodge an FIR, then you have the option of filing an application before the magistrate," the court said.Singh's counsel Vikram Nankani said his client wanted to avoid this "chakravyuh" (labyrinth).The HC, however, noted this was the procedure laid down in law."Are you saying that you are above the law?" Chief Justice Datta asked.Nankani argued that he did not have any other option than to approach the HC, as the complaint and allegations were against the "very head of the state administration".The court further asked Nankani if any statement, as alleged by Singh in the petition against Deshmukh that he had asked police officers to extort money, was made by the Home Minister in Singh's presence."Was any of these statements made by the Home Minister in Singh's presence? Otherwise, this is nothing but hearsay," the court said.The HC further said there is also no affidavit submitted by any of the police officers who were allegedly called by Deshmukh to his residence, supporting the allegations levelled by Singh.The bench said without an FIR it cannot pass an order directing an independent agency to investigate the matter."Our prima facie opinion is that without an FIR, this court cannot order an investigation. Your prayer seeking a direction to the CBI to investigate appears to be harsh in the absence of an FIR," Chief Justice Datta said.The court further asked if a PIL is maintainable when the issue pertains to a service matter.Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the Maharashtra government, sought dismissal of the petition with an exemplary cost and claimed the plea was filed with a personal vendetta."The PIL is not filed in public interest, but is riddled with personal grievances and interests. The petitioner has come to this court with dirty hands and dirty mind," Kumbhakoni said.Singh in his petition claimed Deshmukh had asked police officers, including suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, to collect Rs 100 crore each month from bars and restaurants.Waze was arrested earlier this month by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the case of bomb scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence in Mumbai.The PIL filed by Singh also raised the issue of alleged corruption in police transfers and postings in the state.Singh was shifted from the post of Mumbai's Commissioner of Police to the Home Guards department on March 17.

31-03-2021||New Delhi||Facebook steps up efforts to curb hate speech amid Assembly elections||Facebook is taking several measures, including reducing distribution of content deemed to be hate speech, as part of its efforts to curb spread of misinformation during Assembly elections in four Indian states.Facebook will also temporarily reduce the distribution of content from accounts that have recently and repeatedly violated the company's policies, the social media giant said in a blogpost on Tuesday."We recognise that there are certain types of content, such as hate speech, that could lead to imminent, offline harm...To decrease the risk of problematic content going viral in these states and potentially inciting violence ahead of or during the election, we will significantly reduce the distribution of content that our proactive detection technology identifies as likely hate speech or violence and incitement," it added.This content will be removed if determined to violate Facebook's policies, but its distribution will remain reduced until that determination is made, the blog noted.Facebook has drawn flak in the past for its handling of hate speech on the platform in the country. India is among the biggest markets for Facebook and its group companies, WhatsApp and Instagram. According to government data, India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 41 crore Facebook users, and 21 crore users of Instagram.The US-based company said it has invested significantly in proactive detection technology to help identify violating content more quickly.In its blog, Facebook said based on lessons it has learned from past elections in India and globally, it is taking steps to enhance civic engagement, combat hate speech, limit misinformation and remove voter suppression amid elections across Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry."We also continue to closely partner with election authorities, including to set up a high priority channel to remove content that breaks our rules or is against local law after receiving valid legal orders," it said.Facebook pointed out that under its existing Community Standards, it removes certain slurs that it determines to be hate speech."To complement that effort, we may deploy technology to identify new words and phrases associated with hate speech, and either remove posts with that language or reduce their distribution," it added.Outlining the steps, Facebook said its policies prohibit voter interference, defined as objectively verifiable statements such as misrepresentation of dates and methods for voting (for example text to vote)."We also remove offers to buy or sell votes with cash or gifts. Additionally, we also remove explicit claims that you will contract COVID-19 if you vote," it explained.In 2019, led by industry body IAMAI, Facebook had set up a high priority channel with the Election Commission of India (ECI) for Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, to receive content-related escalations.The Voluntary Code is applicable for this election as well, the blog said."We believe Facebook has an important part to play in creating an informed community, and helping people access all the information they need to take part in the democratic process. We also remind people to exercise their democratic right to vote," it said.The company will offer Election Day reminders to give voters accurate information and encourage voters to share this information with friends on Facebook and WhatsApp."...WhatsApp specifically rolls out public education campaigns and digital literacy trainings to build awareness about refraining from forwarding frequently forwarded messages, turning on group permissions to help decide which groups to join, reporting or blocking a suspicious contact or number, and prohibiting bulk or automated messages," the blog said.The company also works with third-party fact-checkers around the world, including eight partners in India, to provide people with additional context about the content they're seeing on Facebook.In addition to English, these eight partners fact-check in 11 Indian languages including Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam and Assamese.When a fact-checker rates a story as false, such content is labelled and shown lower in News Feed, significantly reducing its distribution.This stops its spread and reduces the number of people who see it, Facebook said.

Alongside, he will also be visiting temples, gurdwaras and Gandhi Ashram. Tikait has been meeting groups of supporters from Gujarat and Maharashtra at Ghazipur where he has been camping along since November, lastRecently, Gujarat Forest and Tribal Affairs Minister Raman Patkar too was  quoted as saying that “environment is conducive for early polls in Gujarat at a time when the BJP is winning everywhere”.“The party won 90 per cent seats in the local bodies polls, as well as all six municipal corporations, 75 out of 81 municipalities, all 31 district panchayats and 196 out of 231 taluka panchayats,” he said.Preparing for elections, the Gujarat unit of AAP has also launched a state-wide "sadasyata abhiyaan".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-politics-heats-up-in-poll-bound-gujarat-farmer-leader-rakesh-tikait-sets-course-for-the-state-232625
31-03-2021||Ahmedabad||CBI court discharges 3 cops in 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case||A special CBI court here on Wednesday discharged police officers GL Singhal, Tarun Barot and Anaju Chaudhary in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case.Special CBI Judge VR Raval allowed the discharge applications of Singhal, Barot (now retired) and Chaudhary."The CBI has not mentioned anything specific against the sanction order (in which the Gujarat government declined sanction to prosecute the three accused) which also leads to believe the act of applicants/accused was in discharge of official duties," the court observed.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 20 conveyed to the court that the state government had declined sanction for prosecution of the three accused.The court in its October 2020 order observed that they had "acted in their official duties", so the probe agency was required to obtain sanction for prosecution.Under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, sanction is required for prosecuting government servants for anything done in the discharge of official duty.Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra near Mumbai, along with Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar, was killed by Gujarat Police in an ‘encounter’ near Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004.The police claimed that the four were terrorists who were planning to assassinate the then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.However, a high court-appointed Special Investigation Team concluded that the encounter was fake, after which the CBI registered a case against various police officials.Inspector General of Police Singhal, retired police officers Barot and JG Parmar, and Chaudhary had filed applications before the court seeking dropping of proceedings for want of the requisite sanction to prosecute them.Parmar died during the course of hearing in the case.On Wednesday, the judge said when this court earlier observed that the act of the accused was while discharging official duties, nobody challenged the order."Not only that, but the Central Government and the Government of Gujarat have also believed that the act of the applicants/accused is while discharging the duties and, therefore, the government was moved for sanction and the sanction is refused also," the court observed.There is nothing on record, even prima facie, to suggest that the victims were not terrorists and the IB inputs were not genuine, the court said in its order."The CBI has not mentioned anything specific against the sanction order which also leads to believe the act of applicants/accused was in discharge of official duties," it said.The court also refused to accept the argument put forth by Special Public Prosecutor for the CBI, RC Kodekar, that the govermnent order declining sanction to prosecute the three applicants was issued without the application of mind.The CBI had named seven police officers - PP Pandey, DG Vanzara, NK Amin, Singhal, Barot, Parmar and Chaudhary - as accused in its first chargesheet filed in 2013.In 2019, the CBI court dropped proceedings against former police officers Vanzara and Amin, after the state government refused sanction to prosecute them.Earlier, in 2018, former in-charge Director General of Police PP Pandey was discharged from the case.The court on Wednesday discharged Singhal, Chaudhary and Barot from offences under IPC Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 341, 342, 343 (all for wrongful restraint), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement kidnapped or abducted person), 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence).They were also discharged under Sections 25(1)(e) and 27 of the Indian Arms Act.

31-03-2021||New Delhi||India slips 28 places, ranks 140 among 156 countries in WEF's gender gap index||India has slipped 28 places to rank 140th among 156 countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2021, becoming the third-worst performer in South Asia.According to the report, India has closed 62.5 per cent of its gender gap till date.The country had ranked 112th among 153 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index 2020.Noting that the decline also took place on the economic participation and opportunity sub-index, albeit to a lesser extent, the report said India's gender gap on this dimension widened by 3 per cent this year, leading to a 32.6 per cent gap closed till date.Most of the decline occurred on the political empowerment sub-index, where India regressed 13.5 percentage points, with a significant decline in the number of women ministers (from 23.1 per cent in 2019 to 9.1 per cent in 2021)."Among the drivers of this decline is a decrease in women's labour force participation rate, which fell from 24.8 per cent to 22.3 per cent. In addition, the share of women in professional and technical roles declined further to 29.2 per cent. The share of women in senior and managerial positions also remains low: only 14.6 per cent of these positions are held by women and there are only 8.9 per cent firms with female top managers," the report said.Further, the estimated earned income of women in India is only one-fifth of men's, which puts the country among the bottom 10 globally on this indicator, it said.Discrimination against women is also reflected in the health and survival sub-index statistics. With 93.7 per cent of this gap closed to date, India ranks among the bottom five countries in this sub-index.Wide gaps in sex ratio at birth are due to the high incidence of gender-based sex-selective practices. In addition, more than one in four women has faced intimate violence in her lifetime, the report said."Conversely, 96.2 per cent of the educational attainment sub-index gender gap has been closed, with parity achieved in primary, secondary and tertiary education. Yet, gender gaps persist in terms of literacy: one third of women are illiterate (34.2 per cent) compared to 17.6 per cent of men," it added.Among India's neighbours, Bangladesh ranked 65, Nepal 106, Pakistan 153, Afghanistan 156, Bhutan 130 and Sri Lanka 116.Among regions, South Asia is the second-lowest performer on the index, with 62.3 per cent of its overall gender gap closed."Within the region, a wide gulf separates the best-performing country, Bangladesh, which has closed 71.9 per cent of its gender gap so far, from Afghanistan, which has only closed 44.4 per cent of its gap."India is the third-worst performer in the region, having closed 62.5 per cent of its gap. Because of its large population, India's performance has a substantial impact on the region's overall performance," the report said.In South Asia, only Pakistan and Afghanistan ranked below India.The report stated that India, home to 0.65 billion women, has widened its gender gap from almost 66.8 per cent one year ago to 62.5 per cent this year.In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the income of an average woman is below 16 per cent of that of an average man, while in India it is 20.7 per cent, it said.As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be felt, the global gender gap has increased by a generation from 99.5 years to 135.6 years, the report noted.Now in its 15th year, the report benchmarks the evolution of gender-based gaps in four areas: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. It also examines the drivers of gender gaps and outlines the policies and practices needed for a gender-inclusive recovery.For the 12th time, Iceland is the most gender-equal country in the world. The top 10 most gender-equal countries include Finland, Norway, New Zealand, Rwanda, Sweden, Ireland and Switzerland.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze drove car that followed explosives-laden SUV: Official||The Innova car that tailed the   explosives-laden Scorpio which was found parked outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani here on February 25 was prima facie driven by Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze, currently in the custody of the NIA, an official said on Wednesday.The Scorpio was suspected to be driven by the driver of Vaze.The National Investigation Agency is probing the cases of the recovery of the explosives-laden Innova and the subsequent murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, the purported owner of that vehicle.Before these cases were taken over by the NIA, the ATS had investigated them.He said the Innova car could be seen in the CCTV footage at Mulund checkpost going towards Thane from south Mumbai.The SUV was later driven to the compound of the Mumbai Police commissioner’s office in south Mumbai, the official said.As the name of assistant police inspector Vaze cropped up in the case, the ATS feared that he might shift the Innova from the compound of the CP’s office to destroy the evidence, which prompted the ATS to launch a covert operation to keep a close eye on the SUV.The ATS had planned to arrest any person if he is found seated in the Innova or driving it outside the CP’s office, he disclosed and added that the operation was monitored by ATS DIG Shivdeep Lande.It was only because of the covert surveillance by the ATS that the SUV remained safe as a piece of evidence, the official claimed.The NIA seized the Innova after it took over the probe.Speaking about the Scorpio, containing gelatin sticks, which was found parked outside Ambani’s residence, the official said this SUV was parked on the compound of the CP’s office from February 19 to 21 this year.It was Hiran who had parked the Scorpio near Airoli-Mulund bridge on February 17 and went to Mumbai in an Ola cab to meet someone, he said.Hiran later registered an FIR that the Scorpio was stolen, however, the investigation shows that the SUV was driven from the spot on the instructions of Vaze, and it was taken to his residential society in Thane, he said.The Scorpio was later driven to the CP office in Mumbai on February 19 and driven again to the housing society on February 21, he said.The SUV was finally driven to south Mumbai and abandoned outside Ambani’s residence on the late night of February 24, he said.He said the ATS had sent a letter to Mumbai Police to preserve CCTV footage of the compound of the CP’s office.That footage is safely stored in the main server now, he added.The official said the gelatin sticks were probably kept in the Scorpio near Priyadarshini Park in suburban Chembur before it proceeded to Carmichael Road where Ambani’s residence is located. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaze-drove-car-that-followed-explosives-laden-suv-official-232614

31-03-2021||New Delhi||Blockade of Delhi-Noida roads: SC issues notice to Centre, UP govt on commuter’s plea||As the main roads connecting Delhi and Noida remain blocked since the beginning of protests against farm laws in November last year, the Supreme Court has issued notice to the Centre and the UP Government on a petition by a woman who said commuting had become a nightmare.Acting on a PIL filed by Monicca Agarwaal, a resident of Noida and a single parent with medical issues, a Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul last week asked the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government to explain why the roads connecting Delhi and Noida were not free from blockades.“We consider it appropriate to issue notice to the Union government and others to ensure that the road area is kept clear so that the passage from one place to another is not affected,” it said, posting the matter for further hearing on April 9.Agarwaal said though her workplace was in Noida she had to travel to Delhi frequently as she was in a marketing job. Noting that it was taking two hours instead of the standard 20 minutes, she contended that it had become a “nightmare” to commute between Noida and Delhi.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7, 2020, ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.On February 9, the top court dismissed a petition seeking review of the verdict, saying the right to protest can’t be anytime and everywhere.Agarwaal pointed out that despite directions issued by the top court to keep the roads blockade-free nothing had happened.Noting that a judicial view had already been taken and the matter reflected an administrative failure, the Bench agreed to take up the matter after the petitioner said the court should ensure that people’s right to passage wasn’t hindered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blockade-of-delhi-noida-roads-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-up-govt-on-commuters-plea-232608

We are not like BJP, we fulfill what we promise."The Congress leader said that in Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka his party had promised to waive farm loans and did it after assuming power."In Assam, we have guaranteed to raise the tea garden workers' daily wage to Rs 365," he said, referring to one of the five promises.Gandhi offered prayers at the Shaktipeeth atop the Nilachal Hill prior to setting out for election rallies at Chaygaon and Barkhetri, which will go to the polls in the last phase on April 6.Gandhi could not travel to his scheduled rallies at Silchar, Haflong and Bokajan on Tuesday due to heavy downpour and bad weather there.He instead posted his message on Twitter, asserting that his party will fulfill all its 'five guarantees' when it forms government in the state.The Congress has promised in its 'guarantees' that it will not allow the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to be implemented in Assam, provide employment to five lakh youths, provide 200 units of free electricity per month to all households, give monthly assistance of Rs 2,000 to every housewife, besides raising the minimum daily wages of tea garden workers.Elections to 39 constituencies will be held in the second phase on Thursday, and 40 seats in the final phase on April 6.An estimated 79.97 per cent of the total 81.09 lakh voters had exercised their franchise in 47 assembly constituencies during the first phase of polling in Assam on March 27. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unlike-bjp-congress-fulfils-its-poll-promises-rahul-gandhi-232600

31-03-2021||Mumbai/Amravati||'Lady Singham' suicide: Maharashtra suspends top forest officer||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday suspended a top Indian Forest Service officer five days after daring woman forest official Dipali Chavan-Mohite committed suicide at her home in Amravati, officials said.Former Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Field Director of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) MS Reddy, who had suddenly gone missing, has been suspended four days after he was removed from his post on March 26 and awaited a new posting.The fast-paced developments came after Women and Child Welfare Minister Yashomati Thakur - who is Guardian Minister of Amravati - called on Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and submitted a memorandum demanding stringent action all those found involved in the matter.On Friday, the Amravati police had arrested IFoS officer B. Vinod Shivkumar, as he was planning to flee from Nagpur to Bengaluru, and later the state government suspended him as the incident triggered a massive uproar in government and bureaucratic circles.Range Forest Officer (RFO) Chavan-Mohite, 28, who took the extreme step by shooting herself with her service revolver at her official quarters, had left behind a suicide note addressed to Reddy, in which she had virtually accused Shivkumar on various counts like sexual harassment, professional torture, causing financial losses and mental trauma, etc. due to which she suffered a miscarriage last month.Reddy was shunted out of his prestigious posts following complaints that he reportedly failed to heed Chavan-Mohite's complaints against Shivkumar, currently in police custody. (IANS had first highlighted the late woman RFO's plight in detail last May).Feared as the 'Lady Singham' of the forests, Chavan-Mohite was renowned for various daring acts against dreaded jungle mafias and local politicians who, in tandem with tribals or villagers, engaged in different types of illegal activities in the forests.Besides Thakur's plea to the CM, Independent MP from Amravati Navnit Kaur-Rana staged a sit-in protest in the district demanding actions against all those responsible for Chavan-Mohite's suicide, while several rights groups and associations of forest officers took up her case in a big way.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lady-singham-suicide-maharashtra-suspends-top-forest-officer-232592

31-03-2021||New Delhi||US State Department pulls up India for human rights abuses||Despite government efforts to address abuses, a lack of accountability for official misconduct persisted at all levels, contributing to widespread impunity, said a US State Department country report on human rights practices in India.Investigations and prosecutions of individual cases took place, but lax enforcement, a shortage of trained police officers, and an overburdened and under-resourced court system contributed to a low number of convictions, it said.The report identified the significant human rights issues as unlawful and arbitrary killings; torture, arbitrary arrest and detention; restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, site blocking, excessive curbs on NGOs and widespread corruption.The State Department’s cyclical March-end report usually pulls up India for several alleged acts of omission on the human rights front. Governments in Delhi, regardless of political colour, have been hostile to overseas bodies judging India’s human rights quotient. For instance, the report quoted the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances as listing seven cases. This US body has not been allowed access into India by the UPA and NDA governments since 2010. But of late the US State Department has been noting the spread of issues such as unjustified arrests, censorship, and restrictions to mainland India.But the report also noted that separatist insurgents and terrorists in J&K, the Northeast, and Maoist-affected areas committed serious abuses, including killings and torture of armed forces personnel and recruitment and use of child soldiers.The report noted that the government continued taking steps to restore normalcy in J&K by gradually lifting some security and communications restrictions, releasing most political activists and partially restoring internet access.The government also began a process to redraw electoral constituencies but did not announce a timeline for local assembly elections. The US State Department report is based on reports from the media and Indian and international organisations associated with human rights, including the National Human Rights Commission.On the slow pace of the judicial process, the report noted that formal charges have yet to be filed in the 2018 killing of Rising Kashmir editor in chief Shujaat Bukhari and his two police bodyguards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-state-department-pulls-up-india-for-human-rights-abuses-232585

31-03-2021||Washington||India not out of woods; real GDP growth to be 7.5 to 12.5 per cent:  World Bank||India's economy has bounced back amazingly from the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown over the last year, but it is not out of the woods yet, according to the World Bank, which in its latest report has predicted that the country's real GDP growth for fiscal year 21/22 could range from 7.5 to 12.5 per cent.The Washington-based global lender, in its latest South Asia Economic Focus report released ahead of the annual Spring meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that the economy was already slowing when the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded.After reaching 8.3 per cent in FY17, growth decelerated to 4.0 per cent in FY20, it said.The slowdown was caused by a decline in private consumption growth and shocks to the financial sector (the collapse of a large non-bank finance institution), which compounded pre-existing weaknesses in investment, it said.Given the significant uncertainty about both epidemiological and policy developments, the real GDP growth for FY21/22 can range from 7.5 to 12.5 per cent, depending on how the ongoing vaccination campaign proceeds, whether new restrictions to mobility are required, and how quickly the world economy recovers, the World Bank said.“It is amazing how far India has come compared to a year ago. If you think a year ago, how deep the recession was… unprecedented declines in activity of 30 to 40 per cent, no clarity about vaccines, huge uncertainty about the disease. And then if you compare it now, India is bouncing back, has opened up many of the activities, started vaccination and is leading in the production of vaccination,” Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region, told PTI in an interview.However, the situation is still incredibly challenging, both on the pandemic side with the flare-up that is being experienced now. It is an enormous challenge to vaccinate everybody in India, the official said.“Most of the people underestimate the challenge,” he said.On the economic side, Timmer said that even with the rebound and there is uncertainty here about the numbers, but it means that over two years there was no growth in India and there might well have been over two years, a decline in per capita income.“That's such a difference from what India was accustomed to. And it means that there are still many parts of the economy that have not recovered or have not fared as well as they would have without a pandemic. There is a huge concern about the financial markets,” he said.“As economic activity normalises, domestically and in key export markets, the current account is expected to return to mild deficits (around 1 per cent in FY22 and FY23) and capital inflows are projected by continued accommodative monetary policy and abundant international liquidity conditions,” the report said.Noting that the COVID-19 shock will lead to a long-lasting inflexion in India's fiscal trajectory, the report said that the general government deficit is expected to remain above 10 per cent of GDP until FY22. As a result, public debt is projected to peak at almost 90 per cent of GDP in FY21 before declining gradually thereafter.As growth resumes and the labour market prospects improve, poverty reduction is expected to return to its pre-pandemic trajectory.The poverty rate (at the USD 1.90 line) is projected to return to pre-pandemic levels in FY22, falling within 6 and 9 per cent, and fall further to between 4 and 7 per cent by FY24, the World Bank said.

31-03-2021||New York||India narrowing differences in UN Security Council: Ambassador Tirumurti||India has "been a bridge" in a polarised UN Security Council, narrowing differences and helping shape the Council's statements, discussions on Afghanistan and Myanmar, pushing for greater meeting of minds to address humanitarian crisis in Syria and focusing on terrorism, India's envoy to the UN said.With India completing three months as an elected non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council, the country's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said India had been able to bring a “unique perspective” to discussions in the Council.“You can call this an Indian perspective if you like. It has been an intensive period,” Tirumurti told PTI.He noted that India got into a Security Council which had been polarised sharply in the recent past.“While such a polarisation is still quite visible, India has certainly been a bridge narrowing down the differences in the Council. We have worked constructively with other members in the Council on all issues. Our voice is deeply respected and our contribution has been acknowledged,” he said.“There is a greater effort in the Council now with countries like India coming in to have a more collaborative approach to issues.” Tirumurti stressed that “it is more important for the Council to speak in one voice rather than not speak at all.”Outlining instances where India helped an outcome in the Council, Tirumurti said the country had brought in its own perspective on specific issues. Citing the UNSC Press Statements on Myanmar, a "country with which we have strong links and strong interests", Tirumurti said India had been able to “bring together differing viewpoints and make these statements more constructive and helpful in furthering the process to resolve the issues”.Just days after the February 1 military coup in Myanmar in which top political leaders, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, were detained, the Council issued a Press Statement emphasising the need for continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar and stressed the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and rule of law.India, Chair of the Taliban Sanctions Committee, also helped shape the Council's statement on Afghanistan to “voice our concern on the rising violence and targeted killings and keep the focus on, inter alia, women, minorities and on terrorism and its impact on Afghanistan and the region.“We have an important stake in Afghanistan and its stability and peace. As Chair of the Taliban Sanctions Committee, our role in contributing to the process will be important,” Tirumurti said.

The wheat procurement in Punjab starts from April 10.Many chances given, Goyal reminds CaptDespite multiple exemptions and sufficient time, Punjab has not implemented norms for direct digital MSP payment to farmers. — Piyush Goyal, Food Minister Official records show Punjab is the only among 12 procuring states not making direct digital payment to farmers, as mandated by the Finance Ministry’s Public Finance Management System (PFMS) order issued on May 28, 2018.Punjab continues to pay farmers through arhtiyas under the Punjab Agriculture Produce Marketing Rules-1962, which, it says, mandates MSP payments through commission agents. Several states have even integrated their land records with the central procurement portal, something Punjab hasn’t done.Food Minister Piyush Goyal has now again written to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh citing past exemptions the state was granted and urged urgent compliance.On Punjab’s concern that title issues may arise where land had been given on lease for tilling by absentee landlords, Goyal said Punjab should follow Haryana’s software that enabled details of tenant or share-cropper to be uploaded on the portal with a disclaimer that this would not be a legal proof for claiming ownership.The Tribune has, meanwhile, accessed an internal government note that shows that the Food Ministry is against granting any further waivers to Punjab.The CMD of Food Corporation of India, during his recent visit to the state, even conveyed this: “The readiness of the system in Punjab is not an issue. Willingness on the part of Punjab is still questionable.” The Secretary, Food, has spoken to the Punjab Chief Secretary and the Principal Secretary (Food), making it clear that no exemption shall be granted this year. “In the event of non-implementation, the Centre would not be obliged to reimburse the cost of procurement and other incidentals,” says the note. The note also says that in 2020, during verification of payments, the Centre had detected an alleged deduction of Rs 12 per quintal made by arthiyas from MSP payment at the cost of farmers.“The GoI stand is that the entire MSP should be transferred to farmers’ account and should not get parked into arthiya’s account,” says the note. Punjab is the top contributor to the central wheat and paddy procurement pool, which is why its compliance with online payment norms is more important, government sources said.Arhtiyas’ ‘cut’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-expect-more-exemption-on-online-msp-payment-punjab-told-232270

In that case, large containment zones with clear boundaries and stringent controls must be implemented. There should be strict perimeter control of containment zones. Endeavour should be to contain as many as possible in a containment zone for 14 days so that the chain of transmission can be broken.”This is the first time since the March lockdown was lifted that the Health Ministry has advised large containment zones and district-level lockdowns and perimeter controls.The advice came as active cases rose to 4.47 per cent of the total and the Member, Health, NITI Aayog, saying the situation was turning from “bad to worse”.“Many districts are seeing clusters of cases due to events and crowding. Some districts that saw a high number of cases in August-November are again seeing a high growth rate of cases. Additionally many new districts that saw limited prevalence earlier are worryingly showing a surge,” Bhusban’s letter said.The lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour and laxity in public health effort could lead to sudden surges, the letter said, asking chief secretaries to ensure institutional quarantine of positive people, tracing of at least 30 close contacts of those infected and review of home isolation cases.“There has been laxity in institutional quarantine. People are being asked to home isolate without proper review. That is not acceptable,” Bhushan said, adding that Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh were of particular concern and had 62 per cent of all active cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/micro-containment-not-enough-govt-wants-dist-level-lockdowns-232260

Sources said there could be a “positive outcome”. The commanders of the two sides had last met on February 20 after completing the first phase of the pullback from the LAC.In the first phase, there was visible disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops along the banks of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake.The next two steps — de-escalation and de-induction, which means pulling back troops and war equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases — have not yet begun.The WMCC comprises representatives of foreign ministries and militaries of both sides. It had last met on March 12 and decided to reach a mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement at the earliest.The need to go to the WMCC arose as the military commanders could not arrive at a timeline of the phased de-escalation and de-induction.The first phase of the disengagement process commenced on February 10, as both sides started withdrawal from the banks of Pangong Tso.

Though the lawyers’ report claims Adani is paying about Rs 2,500 crore to MEC, the group sees it differently.Edit: Volte-face by ManipurThe Australian Centre for International Justice (ACIJ) and the Justice for Myanmar group say the documents reveal that the amount was provided to MEC which “stands credibly accused and is being investigated at the ICC and ICJ for crimes against humanity”.The intention is to pressure Canberra into dumping its investment in Adani Ports, which also owns North Queensland operations linked to Carmichael coal mine. These Australian lawyers and activists also want sovereign wealth funds and pension funds to stop investing in Adani Group on ethical grounds.“The Yangon project is independent with no joint venture partners.

The BJP, Mamata’s chief rival in the constituency, also left no stone unturned to make the last day of campaigning count.The BJP campaign in Nandigram on Tuesday, where party candidate Suvendu Adhikari has thrown a tough challenge to TMC supremo Mamata, started with an elaborate roadshow by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and ended with a roadshow by actor Mithun Chakraborty.Standing atop a caparisoned truck with Adhikari by his side, Shah waved and occasionally tossed flower petals to the crowd who thronged to see the roadshow which stared from Reyapara Boropul and went to Shiva Temple.Later, Shah told mediapersons that the overwhelming response to the roadshow had convinced him Adhikari’s victory from Nandigram.In contrast, Banerjee’s roadshow — from Bhangabera Shahid Bedi to Sonachura in Nandigram — was a simple affair. Instead of riding a vehicle, she choose to take part in the roadshow in the wheelchair.The TMC supremo later addressed public meetings at Sonachura, Bansuli Chawk Lock Gate (Bhekutia) and Tengua More Crossing — all falling in the Nandigram constituency.Stating that a woman had been raped within five km of where Mamata was staying in Nandigram, Shah alleged that the government headed by Mamata had failed to provide security to women. In response, Mamata cited the Hathras incident and said Shah should first worry about the women living in BJP-ruled UP.At a meeting in Tengua More, Mamata admitted that she had called up BJP leader Pralay Paul and had asked him for help. “I was told that some local BJP leaders wanted to talk to me. That is why I had called him. I don’t think I did anything wrong,” she said.Govt okays issuance of electoral bondsNew Delhi: Amid Assembly elections in four states and a union territory, the government on Tuesday approved issuance of the 16th tranche of electoral bonds which will be open for sale from April 1 to 10.

Such fines, it is believed, would serve as a deterrent for violation of Covid-19 protocol at the airports, said an official.“Advisory issued to all airports... People must wear masks (covering nose and mouth) and maintain social distance. We are moving in direction of punitive action by police against passengers who don’t comply,” tweeted Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.The airports have already been given a set of strict standard operating procedures as part of measures to be taken to contain the spread of the virus in view of India staring at a second wave.As per earlier guidelines, violators could be handed over to airport security if they flouted norms. Besides, airlines have also been given instructions of taking action against “unruly” passengers by placing them in the “no fly” list.Approves 18,843 flights per weekThe DGCA on Tuesday approved 18,843 flights per week from 108 airports for the summer schedule, including on 22 new routes under UDAN scheme.

Along with Iranian FM Javad Zarif, he supported the orderly withdrawal of foreign troops, so as to prevent the terrorist forces from ramping up and creating trouble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-for-double-peace-un-involvement-in-afghanistan-232256

31-03-2021||New Delhi||Inflation exceptionally high in India: Moody’s||India’s inflation is at “uncomfortably high” level, which is an exception among Asian economies, Moody’s Analytics said on Tuesday. Higher fuel prices will keep upward pressure on retail inflation and keep the RBI from offering further rate cuts, said Moody’s Analytics, a financial intelligence company.Retail inflation rose to 5% in February, from 4.1% in January. The RBI mainly takes into account retail inflation while deciding on the monetary policy.Core inflation (which excludes food, fuel and light) was up 5.6% in February, from 5.3% in January, Moody’s Analytics said, adding India’s inflation is “uncomfortably high”.In its macro roundup, Moody’s Analytics said inflation is subdued in most of Asia, and expected to only gradually pick up over 2021 because of rising oil prices and economies starting to reopen. Brent crude has climbed 26% this year at around $64 per barrel. It was around $30 per barrel in March 2020, when the Covid crisis was near its peak.“India and the Philippines are exceptions. In these economies, inflation is above comfort levels, adding to the list of challenges for policymakers,” it said. — PTIHigher fuel prices to keep up pressure||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/inflation-exceptionally-high-in-india-moodys-232394

The project to supply vaccines to the Indo-Pacific region will be financed and supported by the other Quad members.This will involve the creation of new capacities and will not impact on the current vaccine production or roll out, he clarified.Capacity building and experience sharing has been an important part of the assistance extended by India during this period. This is something that the authors of the paper could also examine in greater detail as it has the potential to emerge as an important area for our healthcare industry’s global outreach, advised the Foreign Secretary.The paper points out that today, India is the world’s second largest manufacturer of PPE kits and has the capacity to produce about 1 billion RT-PCR test kits at very competitive prices. The paper concludes with ideas on the way ahead. These include addressing gaps at the bottom and top of the pharma value chain with regard to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and original molecules.“The paper includes several case studies showcasing the strength of our pharmaceuticals industry. All these examples point towards the high quality of Indian pharmaceutical products and the trust they enjoy across the globe,” said the Foreign Secretary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-maitri-to-be-recalibrated-shringla-232236
31-03-2021||Islamabad||Imran writes to PM Modi; says creation of ‘enabling environment’ imperative for dialogue||Prime Minister Imran Khan has written a letter to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, saying creation of an “enabling environment” is imperative for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between Pakistan and India, in particular the Jammu and Kashmir issue.Khan’s letter was in reply to Prime Minister Modi’s letter to him last week to extend greetings on the occasion of Pakistan Day. In his letter, Modi had said India desires cordial relations with Pakistan but an atmosphere of trust, devoid of terror and hostility, is “imperative” for it.In his reply to Prime Minister Modi’s letter, Khan thanked him and said the people of Pakistan also desire peaceful cooperative relations with all neighbours, including India.While Prime Minister Modi talked about a terror-free environment for peace, Khan said that peace was possible only if outstanding issues like Kashmir were resolved.“We are convinced that durable peace and stability in South Asia is contingent upon resolving all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan in particular the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” he wrote in the letter dated March 29.Khan said that creation of an “enabling environment is imperative for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue.”He also expressed best wishes for the people of India in their struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic.The militaries of India and Pakistan announced on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.Weeks later, both Pakistan’s Prime Minister Khan and powerful Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa made peace overtures towards New Delhi saying it was time for the two neighbours to “bury the past and move forward”.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in Pakistan. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The ties hit rock bottom after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in 2019 in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations further nosedived after India withdrew special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the State into two union territories in 2019. Since then, India and Pakistan are without high commissioners in each other’s capital—New Delhi and Islamabad, respectively.On March 18, powerful Army chief Bajwa said it was time for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze present at meeting where Hiran’s murder was planned: NIA||Suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze and former policeman Vinayak Shinde were present at the meeting where the murder of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran was planned, the NIA told the court on Tuesday and added Vaze had used a mobile phone to contact a “conspirator”.The NIA, however, didn’t name the conspirator.The investigating agency also said it was close to unravelling the conspiracy and the motive behind the crime.The special court judge P R Sitre has extended till April 7 the NIA custody of Shinde and another accused Naresh Gor, a cricket bookie, in the murder case.Hiran, a Thane resident, had been in possession of an SUV which was later found with explosives near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani in south Mumbai on February 25.The body of Hiran was found in the Mumbra creek in Thane on March 5.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad had arrested suspended constable Shinde and Gor in this connection earlier this month.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) took the duo into its custody last week. They were presented before the special NIA court on the expiry of their remand on Tuesday.The NIA told the court that its probe revealed that Vaze and Shinde were present at the meeting where the murder of Hiran was planned.The agency said it needs to question the accused duo regarding the recovery of seven SIM cards, some mobile phones and a CPU during the probe.These SIM cards and mobile phones were recovered from Shinde, the court was told.Special public prosecutor for NIA Sunil Gonsalves told the court that the probe team found a piece of paper during the probe listing 14 mobile phone numbers, of which five numbers were given to Vaze.One of the mobile phones was also given to Vaze, which he used for contacting “conspirator” to kill Hiran, the agency told the court.The NIA further said the agency is closer to unravel the conspiracy and the motive behind killing Hiran.Shinde’s lawyer Gautam Jain submitted that no role in the crimehas been attributed to the accused other than the delivery of the SIM cards.He said Shinde’s further remand is not required as he has been in the custody of the probe agencies (first the ATS and then the NIA) for almost nine days.Gor’s lawyer Aftab Diamondwale told the court that his client’s role was restricted to providing the SIM cards and that he is not connected to the (murder) case.Diamondwale told the court that Gor has been falsely implicated in the case.The Hiran murder case was initially probed by the Maharashtra ATS, but it was later taken over by the NIA.The NIA is also probing the case of the bomb scare outside Ambani’s residence and arrested Vaze.The central probe agency earlier told the court that both the cases were connected.Vaze is in the NIA’s custody till April 3.

In last few weeks, especially in some states, it is a huge cause for worry. No state, no part of the country or district should be complacent.”“We are facing an increasingly severe and intense situation, more so surely in some districts. But the whole country is potentially at risk and therefore all efforts to contain and save lives should be taken.“Hospital and ICU preparations have to be readied. If the cases increase rapidly, the healthcare system would be overwhelmed, Paul said.About surge in case positivity rates, Bhushan said Maharashtra last week had an average positivity rate of 23 per cent, followed by Punjab 8.82 per cent, Chhattisgarh 8.24 per cent, Madhya Pradesh 7.82 per cent, Tamil Nadu 2.5 per cent, Karnataka 2.45 per cent, Gujarat 2.22 per cent, and Delhi 2.04 per cent.The average national positivity rate during last week was 5.65 per cent.All states and Union Territories are reporting a surge in cases and there is a need to significantly and exponentially increase the number of COVID-19 tests. The proportion of RT-PCR tests need to be increased too, Bhushan said.“On Saturday, we held meeting with these states and also spoke to 47 districts. We requested them to increase the number of tests with a special focus on RT-PCR tests. Rapid antigen tests must be used for screening and in densely populated areas where cases are coming in clusters. The preferred test should be the RT-PCR ones,” he said.On variants of the virus, the health secretary said 10 laboratories have done genome sequencing of 11064 samples since December of which the UK variant was detected in 807 samples, South African variant in 47 and Brazilian variant in one.A total of 6,11,13,354 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered till 10 am. About 81,74,916 healthcare workers got the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and 51,88,747 the second dose. As many as 89,44,742 frontline workers got the first dose and 37,11,221 the second dose.Bhushan also said that 48.39 per cent, Telangana tops the list of states with the highest COVID-19 vaccine doses given in private facilities. Delhi came second with 43.11 per cent vaccinations in private facilities, he said.From April 1, people above the age of 45 years would be eligible for vaccination. They can register themselves in the CoWIN platform, the Aarogya Setu app or go for on-site registrations which would start after 3 pm, the health ministry said.

31-03-2021||Dushanbe||To ensure durable peace in Afghanistan peace in and around the country essential: Jaishankar||India on Tuesday underlined that for ensuring durable peace in war-torn Afghanistan, genuine "double peace" - peace within the country and peace around it - was essential.Addressing the 9th Heart of Asia Ministerial Conference in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also highlighted that it requires harmonising the interests of all, both within and around Afghanistan.For a durable peace in Afghanistan, what we need is a genuine "double peace", that is, peace within Afghanistan and peace around Afghanistan. It requires harmonising the interests of all, both within and around that country, Jaishankar tweeted."If the peace process is to be successful, then it is necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, with a serious commitment towards reaching a political solution," he wrote."Today, we are striving for a more inclusive Afghanistan that can overcome decades of conflict. But that will happen only if we stay true to principles that Heart of Asia has long embodied. Collective success may not be easy but the alternative is only collective failure," Jaishankar tweeted on the three key points he suggested at the meeting, also attended by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.Last week, Jaishankar said that India would like to clearly see a sovereign democratic and inclusive Afghanistan that takes into account the interests of its minorities."There is something called the peace and reconciliation process and everybody else is saying that the Taliban is reaching out and changing etc. Let us wait and watch," he had said.During his visit, Jaishanakar is also expected to meet leaders of other participating countries on the sidelines of the two-day conference.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||7 cops injured after Sikhs wielding swords attack them as they were denied permission to hold procession in Nanded gurdwara||Police have arrested 22 people on the charge of attempt to murder in connection with an attack on policemen by a mob of sword-wielding Sikhs in Nanded after they were denied permission to hold a public procession due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an official said on Tuesday.The Wazirabad police in Maharashtra’s Nanded district have identified and named 74 people in three FIRs registered in connection with Monday’s incident at the Sri Hazur Sahib gurdwara, and filed cases against over 500 unidentified people.The official said all the arrested accused and wanted persons have been booked on the charges of attempt to murder, rioting and under provisions of Arms Act.A viral video showed the sword-wielding mob barging out of the gurdwara, breaking the barricades put up by police and attacking the policemen.Seven policemen were injured and eight vehicles were damaged in the violence. The condition of one of the injured policemen was serious, the official said.The police were also trying to ascertain if anyone from the gurdwara committee had any role in the incident, he said.“We have arrested 22 people till now on charges of attempt to murder, rioting, and under provisions of the Arms Act and other sections. Around 74 people have been named in the FIRs, while search is on for others,” Deputy Inspector General of Police, Nanded Range, Nisar Tamboli told PTI.The officer on Monday said permission for the Hola Mohalla public procession was not granted due to the coronavirus pandemic.“The gurdwara committee was informed and they had assured us that they would abide by our directives and hold the event on the gurdwara premises,” he had said.However, when the Nishan Sahib was brought at the gate around 4 pm on Monday, several participants started arguing and over 300 youth stormed out of the gate, broke the barricades and began attacking the policeman, he had said.

31-03-2021||Washington/New York||OCI card holders no longer required to carry old passports for India travel; diaspora welcomes move||People of Indian origin and the Indian diaspora having Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cards are now not required to carry their old, expired passports for travel to India, as required earlier, according to a government notification that has been welcomed by members of the community.The Overseas Citizens of India or OCI card is issued to people of Indian origin globally which gives them almost all the privileges of an Indian national except for the right to vote, government service and buying agricultural land. The OCI card gives them a visa-free travel to India.In a March 26 press release, the Indian missions in the US said that in order to ease the travel of OCI card holders, it has been decided that the “time line for re-issuance of OCI cards in r/o OCI card holders, who may be required to get their OCI card reissued has been extended until December 31, 2021.”Further “requirement of carrying old passports along with the OCI card has been done away. Henceforth, the OCI card holders travelling on the strength of their existing OCI card bearing old passport number are not required to carry their old passport. However, carrying a new passport is mandatory.”New York-based social activist Prem Bhandari, who has been taking up the cause of OCI card holders for the past several years, welcomed the announcement. He expressed gratitude to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs and the Government of India for not only extending the renewal up to December 31 this year but also for relaxing the guidelines and not requiring OCI card holders to carry their old, expired foreign passports.“The OCI card holders can heave a sigh of relief worldwide,” with these new guidelines, he said. He expressed thanks to Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla for the new guidelines.Bhandari said that he had seen first-hand the inconvenience caused to members of the Indian diaspora due to certain OCI card rules as they undertook travel to India during the pandemic.He said some of the passengers were not allowed to board flights to India and were sent back from airports as they were not carrying their old foreign passports, which was required as per government rules.The OCI card, among other benefits, allows multiple entry, multi-purpose lifelong visa to an Indian-origin foreign national to visit India. Under the provisions of the OCI card, which gives the cardholder lifelong visa to India, those below 20 and above 50 need to renew their OCI card every time they have their passport renewed.The Indian government has relaxed the provisions since last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The timeline has been extended multiple times so far. However, this is for the first time that the guidelines have been relaxed for carrying old passports along with the OCI cards for overseas Indians.In May last year, the central government had allowed certain categories of OCI card holders, who were stranded abroad, to come to the country. Earlier, according to the regulations issued by the Indian government, visas of foreign nationals and OCI cards were suspended as part of the new international travel restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic.OCI cardholders were asked to carry their old passport with them to fly to India. Now, under the new provisions, OCI cardholders are not required to carry their old passports but will still need to carry their new passport.Bhandari said the Ministry of Home Affairs guidelines for OCI card holders to carry old expired foreign passports had been in place since 2005 but till 2019, it was not being thoroughly checked or applied.Bhandari had previously also requested Indian authorities to initiate measures such as granting emergency visas on departure to help Indian-origin families travel to their homeland for health or other emergencies amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Bhandari, Jaipur Foot USA Chairman, had said that late last year he had written to Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, as well as Civil Aviation Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola and Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla outlining some of the hardships faced by Indian-origin families in travelling to India for emergency reasons and suggesting measures that could be taken to ensure smoother travel for these families.Bhandari had suggested that holders of Indian passport/PIO/OCI card be allowed to travel with their US-born minor children under the age of 14 with any unexpired visa obtained anytime without applying for an emergency visa at consulates.He added that in case it is difficult to carry out these measures, authorities may consider either granting Emergency Visa on Departure (E-VoD) or restoring immediate e-Visa process for approval online.Last year, Bhandari had also requested extension of the date of renewal of OCI cards till December 31, 2020 such that the Non-Resident Indians/Persons of Indian Origin community had enough time to understand the new requirement and renew their OCI cards.Bhandari also expressed hope that the issue of tourist visas would also be resolved soon. In October last year, the Indian government had decided to restore with immediate effect the validity of all existing visas, except electronic, tourist and medical category visas.
