An Impartial probe must be conducted,” he said, after Param Bir Singh wrote to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray accusing Deshmukh of asking police officers to collect at least Rs 100 crore from bars and hotels each month.  In an eight-page letter, Singh alleged that Deshmukh used to call police officers to his official residence and give them a "collection target" from bars, restaurants and other establishments.Deshmukh has denied the allegation."The letter also states that CM was intimated about this earlier so why didn't he act on it,” Fadnavis said.According to reports, Singh also alleged that Deshmukh also told Waze, the disgraced top who was then heading the Crime Intelligence Unit, (CIU) and another policeman, ACP Sanjay Patil, that there were 1,750 bars, restaurants, hookha parlours and establishment operating in Mumbai. Param Bir Singh’s reported “allegation of corruption” against Deshmukh has put a question mark on not just his future but also that of the Maha Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray. Both NCP and the Congress are part of the state government.According to the letter, Deshmukh “pressurised him to register an FIR in the abetment to suicide case of Mohan Delkar, the Dadar and Nagar Haveli MP who allegedly died by suicide on February 22”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-maharashtra-cm-calls-for-home-minister-anil-deshmukhs-resignation-228099
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra home minister wanted Rs 100 cr per month, alleges Mumbai ex-CP; Deshmukh threatens to sue||Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Saturday claimed that Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect at least Rs 100 crore from city bars and hotels every month, a charge which Deshmukh denied.The senior IPS officer, who was transferred to the low-key Home Guards this week following the arrest of police officer Sachin Vaze in the case related to the bomb scare near Mukesh Ambani's house Antilia, said he was made a scapegoat.Responding to the "letter scare" which came days after the Antilia security scare, Deshmukh, NCP leader from Vidarbha region, said Singh was hurling false accusations "to save his skin" in the Vaze case.In an eight-page letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Singh alleged that Deshmukh used to call police officers to his official residence and give them a "collection target" from bars, restaurants and other establishments.Singh claimed that Vaze, who headed Mumbai police Crime Intelligence Unit, was called by Deshmukh many times in the last few months and repeatedly instructed to assist in collection of the funds.The IPS officer claimed that the minister told Vaze that he had set a target of collecting Rs 100 crore a month, half of it from nearly 1,750 bars, restaurants and similar establishments operating in the city.Singh also claimed that Deshmukh "from day one" wanted a case of abutment of suicide to be registered in Mumbai after the death of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar in a Mumbai hotel last month."A collective appraisal of events that have transpired and what is being pointed out by me makes it clear that I have been made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers," Singh's eight-page letter said.The minister rejected Singh's allegations, claiming that the former Mumbai police chief was trhing to save himself from further action with false claims."In the Mukesh Ambani case and the Mansukh Hiran death case, Sachin Vaze's involvement was established and the trail was to reach Param Bir Singh. It is due to this possibility that these allegations have been leveled," Deshmukh said.On Thursday, a day after Param Bir Singh was shunted out, Deshmukh had said he was transferred after some of his colleagues committed "serious and unforgivable mistakes".BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis sought Deshmukh's the resignation over the claims made by the IPS officer."We demand the home minister's resignation. If he doesn't, then Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray must remove him.An impartial probe must be conducted. The letter also says the chief minister was informed about this earlier, so why didn't he act on it?" Fadnavis, Leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly, told reporters.Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya said, "Param Bir Singhs letter has now exposed the extortionist in the MVA government.API Sachin Vaze was working as Deshmukh's collection man. He should be sacked as home minister."Sources in the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress state government said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar are yet to take a call on replacing the home minister in the backdrop of the latest controversy.Defamatory, says DeshmukhMaharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Saturday evening that he will file a defamation case against the former top cop.Deshmukh, an NCP leader, had tweeted earlier refuting Singh’s allegation that he had asked police officers to collect money from bars, restaurants and other establishments.In a statement, Deshmukh also asked why Singh was keeping silent for so long, and alleged that the IPS officer, shunted out from the post of city police commissioner on Wednesday, was only trying to save his own skin in the Sachin Vaze case.“The allegations made by Singh are false and I am filing a case of defamation against him,” Deshmukh said.“In the Mukesh Ambani case and the Mansukh Hiran death case, Sachin Vaze’s involvement was established and the trail was to reach Param Bir Singh. It is due to this possibility that these allegations have been leveled,” Deshmukh said.“If Sachin Vaze told him about this in February, why was Singh quiet till now?  Singh took the decision to reinstate Sachin Vaze after 16 years (after he was suspended in Khwaja Yunus custodial death case),” Deshmukh said.“Sensing trouble in the explosives case, Singh has leveled baseless allegations to blackmail the government.This is a conspiracy by Singh to mislead the probe into the explosives and Mansukh Hiran death cases,” the minister said.The chief minister should order an impartial probe in Singh’s allegations, he added. Assistant police inspector Vaze was recently arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) during its probe into the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near Ambani's house on February 25.Vaze, an "encounter specialist", has also been facing heat in the murder case of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of that SUV. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane district on March 5. The NIA has taken over the Hiran death case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-home-minister-wanted-rs-100-cr-per-month-alleges-mumbai-ex-cp-deshmukh-threatens-to-sue-228095

I saw first-hand how we can work even more closely together on tackling climate action by sharing our solutions and expertise. Deepening UK-India collaboration will be crucial to building up to a successful outcome at COP26,” he said.The minister’s visit coincided with the launch of the UK’s Integrated Review, which calls for a stronger UK focus on Indo-Pacific partnerships, ahead of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India and the UK’s G7 Summit in June which Prime Minister Modi has been invited to join.Lord Ahmad’s visit, also intended to lay further groundwork for Johnson’s visit in April, covered meetings with leaders from Tamil Nadu to discuss how the UK could share expertise with India on offshore wind energy at the headquarters of India’s National Institute of Wind Energy in Chennai.The UK has the largest offshore wind capacity in the world, and the minister said he looks forward to India attending the Global Offshore Wind Summit 2021 in London in September.The FCDO noted Tamil Nadu’s ambitious target for all taxis, two and three wheelers in the state’s six major cities to be electric by 2030.Ahmad also attended a roundtable at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras Research Park to build on links between the state and Dundee Council, which is a world-leading city in adoption of electric vehicles.“Both the UK and India are proud signatories to the Paris Agreement, and the UK is keen to work with India ahead of COP26 in November to lead the global shift to a low carbon economy and expand access to sustainable energy,” the FCDO notes.The ministerial agenda also covered Delhi, where Lord Ahmad met with senior Indian government ministers and visited the Lotus Temple for a roundtable on freedom of religion and belief. He also visited Chandigarh, where he met with agri-tech businesses, before heading to Chennai.The visit built on the meeting between UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in December 2020, which set out further cooperation on medicines and vaccines to address global healthcare.“The partnership between the Serum Institute of India and Oxford University demonstrates the UK-India relationship at its best, ensuring developing countries receive vaccines, and is an ongoing example of the two countries working together to save lives as a global force for good in the world,” the FCDO said.The Integrated Review, launched by Boris Johnson in the House of Commons earlier this week, sets out a new foreign, defence and development policy vision for the UK.The FCDO highlighted that it makes clear the government’s ambition for the UK’s role in the world and the long-term strategic aims for national security, development and foreign policy, including through enhancing partnerships with nations including India.“This will strengthen our security, build resilience to global challenges like climate change and Covid-19 and boost our strategic advantages through science and technology,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-ministers-india-visit-focuses-on-joint-efforts-on-climate-change-228082

20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Where have noisy, gregarious house sparrows gone?||Cities and towns of Punjab and Haryana are no longer a habitat of the house sparrow, small plump brownish bird once closely associated with the man, ornithologists said on Saturday.With their population drastically declining largely in urban areas over the last 20 years, its chirping has faded.Ornithologists attribute a number of reasons for the decline of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus. They include lack of nesting sites in modern buildings, use of pesticides and non-availability of food.Mohammed Dilawar, the man behind the first celebration World Sparrow Day, which falls on March 20, said five species of sparrows are found in India.Out of the five, only one species is migratory. The most abundant and widespread is Passer domesticus.“It’s important to save sparrows by installing nest boxes, bird feeders, planting native plants and reducing use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers,” he said while  delivering a keynote virtual address organised by Pushpa Gujral Science City to mark World Sparrow Day.He emphasised on saving sparrows to save humanity.WWF-India Coordinator Gitanjali Kanwar said there are about 50 species of birds that live closest to human dwellings.They include bulbul, sparrows, pigeons, warblers, parakeets, etc. Such birds find birdhouses safer, protective and habitable.“It is the survival instinct that enables the endangered sparrows to shift their natural habitats from houses and buildings to the artificially built birdhouses,” she said.Speaking at the occasion, Jalandhar-based Pushpa Gujral Science City Director General Neelima Jerath said the house sparrow is a bird that most of “us grew up with”.“The chorus of chirping that greeted us at sunrise and sunset was as good as clockwork but slowly and surely these little delightful and hyperactive birds have bid adieu to our homes and cities. This has been an ongoing process since the 1990s.“Further, each year March 20 is observed as the World Sparrow Day and rightly so, as these birds deserve our sincere conservation efforts to restore these birds to their genuine habitats.” Science City Director Rajesh Grover said it was important to raise awareness about the decreasing population of sparrows. “We may hear stories from our next generation narrating once upon a time there was a little bird called a sparrow.” Old-timers in Chandigarh say earlier houses had a number of crevices and holes. This enabled the bird to make nests. These days houses have little space for making nests.Use of heavy doses of pesticides in kitchen gardens and fields results in the decline of invertebrate fauna. Small insects play a very important role in the survival of newborn sparrows.Reduced spillage of grains, improved storage, decline in the practice of feeding sparrows, increased predation by owls and cats and competition for food by other species,  including pigeons, have also threatened the existence of sparrows.

Don’t you think those trying to erase tea from the World-map need to be taught a lesson,” he said, keeping alive environmentalist Greta Thunberg’s controversial “toolkit” during the farmers’ agitation which allegedly spoke about aspects like yoga and tea adding to India’s soft power.PM Modi said “people who are conspiring to defame India have stooped so low that they are not sparing even Indian tea”.Accusing the Congress of “supporting such people for the sake of votes”, the PM said “plans are being made to finish the tea gardens in India”. He also tore into Congress for passing off an image from “Sri Lanka as that of Assam”.“A couple of days they tried to pass off a photograph from Sri Lanka as Assam. Earlier they did the same with a photograph from Taiwan. Is it not an insult of Assam, its culture and way of life which they (Congress) have forgotten? Once can be a mistake, twice it means it is their habit,” he said, asking people to teach the party a “lesson” in the upcoming elections.     Assam produces more than half of India’s tea.    In his earlier visits to Assam also the Prime Minister has been speaking of “forces abroad conspiring to tarnish the image of Indian tea and defame the country,”Meanwhile, giving details of the BJP’s plans for the State while elaborating his party’s development agenda in the past five years, PM Modi also accused the Congress of trying to “usurp” it.The BJP-led government is seeking to retain power in Assam.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keeping-alive-toolkit-issue-pm-modi-accuses-cong-of-being-part-of-conspiracy-to-erase-assam-tea-from-world-map-228058
20-03-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government denies sanction to prosecute three cops in Ishrat Jahan case||The Gujarat government has refused sanction to prosecute three accused police officials including IPS officer G L Singhal in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, the CBI told a court here on Saturday.The Central Bureau of Investigation had sought permission from the state government to prosecute Singhal, Tarun Barot and Anaju Chaudhary on the direction of special judge V R Raval.Under section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, sanction is required for prosecuting government servants for anything done in the discharge of official duty.“The Gujarat government has declined sanction for the prosecution of the three accused. We submitted the letter to the court today,” said R C Kodekar, special prosecutor.Inspector General of Police Singhal, retired police officers Barot and J G Parmar, and Chaudhary have filed applications before the court seeking “dropping of proceedings for want of requisite sanction”.Parmar died during the course of hearing.In its order in October 2020, the court had observed that the police officers had “acted in their official duties,” so the CBI was required to obtain prosecution sanction.In 2019, the CBI court had dropped proceedings against former police officers DG Vanzara and NK Amin in the case after the state government similarly refused sanction.In 2018, former in-charge Director General of Police PP Pandey was discharged from the case.The CBI had named seven police officers—Pandey, Vanzara, Amin, Singhal, Barot, Parmar and Chaudhary—as accused in its first charge sheet filed in 2013.Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra near Mumbai, was killed alongwith Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana and Zeeshan Johar by Gujarat police in an ‘encounter’ near Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004.The police claimed the four were terrorists who were planning to assassinate then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi.However, a High Court-appointed Special Investigation Team concluded that the encounter was fake, after which the CBI registered a case against police officials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-government-denies-sanction-to-prosecute-three-cops-in-ishrat-jahan-case-228057

What is wrong with it? They were expressing their respect. They were not worshipping (me)”.Attacking Sreedharan, Viswam alleged that the technocrat “glorified” the act of washing his feet.“He is saying it is Indian tradition. This is an example of the direction in which the BJP is taking our country, the political system and democratic values,” he told reporters.The CPI leader said India had looked at Sreedharan as “a torchbearer of modern technology”, but he changed after entering into the “prison of the politics of the BJP and RSS”.Launching his campaign earlier this week, Sreedharan had said BJP is fighting the polls on the plank of development.Sitting MLA Shafi Parambil of the Congress and CPI(M)’s C P Pramod are his main rivals in the election. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metroman-comes-under-attack-from-left-over-images-of-voters-washing-touching-his-feet-228056

20-03-2021||Aizawl||Mizoram can't remain indifferent to sufferings of Myanmarese refugees fleeing coup: CM to Centre||Urging the Centre to review its order to four Myanmar-bordering northeastern states including Mizoram to prevent illegal immigration from the neighbouring country and ensure expeditious deportation, Chief Minister Zoramthanga has asserted that the people of his state, who share ethnic ties with the refugees from Chin communities, can't remain indifferent to their plight.The Mizo National Front (MNF) chief, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 18, requested him to personally intervene in the matter to provide asylum to the political refugees on humanitarian grounds, an official at the Chief Minister's Office said on Saturday.He said the MHA's March 10 advisory to Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur was not acceptable to his state.Though the MNF is a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), it does not have an alliance with the saffron party in the state."This (MHA advisory) is not acceptable to Mizoram. I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis," Zoramthanga said in the letter, a copy of which is available with the PTI.He said the areas in Myanmar bordering Mizoram are inhabited by Chin communities who share ethnic ties and have had close contact with the people of the state even before India was independent.Zoramthanga said a human catastrophe of gigantic proportions is happening in Myanmar and innocent citizens are being killed by the military, which is supposed to protect them.Every day, terrified Myanmarese people are struggling to cross over into Mizoram in search of shelter and protection, he said."Therefore, Mizoram cannot just remain indifferent to their sufferings. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard," the letter read.Zoramthanga said that India, as the world's largest democracy and Myanmar's immediate neighbour, must act in this matter.Meanwhile, Mizoram Rajya Sabha member K Vanlalvena told PTI that the number of Myanmarese refugees taking shelter in the northeastern state has soared to over 1,000.An officer in the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID), however, said that as per official records, a total of 547 Myanmarese have entered Mizoram since the coup on February 1.He said that the actual number may be higher as many Mizoram residents have accommodated Myanmarese refugees without informing the authorities.Myanmarese people fleeing the coup have taken shelter in eight districts and most of them are being handled by local NGOs, he said.Several outfits, including the state's apex student body Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), are raising money to support the refugees.

The tent was burnt after a cylinder caught fire, the SKM claimed.There were around 10 to 12 people inside the tent when the blaze broke out. Five mobile phones, twenty mattresses, 20 chairs and dry ration was destroyed, it said, adding that a fire tender from Kundali doused the fire.Hundreds of farmers are camping at Delh's borders points at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri since November demanding that the Centre repeal the three contentious farm laws and make a new one that would ensure legal guarantee on the MSP.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police bust inter-state paper leak gang, arrest 4||The Delhi Police on Saturday claimed to have busted an inter-state paper leak gang with the arrest of four people.Officials said those arrested have been identified as Rohit (23), Love Kumar (26), Himanshu (23) and Vaishali (26), all residents of Haryana.They said police got a tip-off that some illegal practice was going on at Om and Chander Associates Examination Centre in Naraina Industrial Area during the examination for the post of forest guard.On February 4, police conducted a raid at the centre and nabbed Rohit who was using a mobile phone for solving his online paper. Thereafter, a case was registered at Naraina police station, a senior police officer said.“During investigation, WhatsApp data of the seized mobile phone was retrieved and analyzed, following which three more people were arrested from Delhi and Haryana,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Urvija Goel said.Interrogation revealed Vaishali to be the kingpin of the gang. She, along with her boyfriend Anil Sharma, brother Love and other associates, used to run a racket related to online examinations for various government jobs, Goel said.The gang operated in various states, including Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar-Pradesh and Delhi, particularly in rural areas, she said.Two uniforms of Delhi Police were also recovered from them. Vaishali used to pose as an IPS officer and two of her associates used to pose as sub-inspector and head constable of the Delhi Police to impress people, the DCP said.The accused used to charge around Rs 10 to 25 lakh, depending upon the nature of the job, from candidates in order to pass the examination, Goel said.Usually an employee of private examination centre helped to provide a mobile phone to their candidate, she said.The dummy candidate used to send a picture of the paper to the kingpin. Then “solvers” solved the paper within a few minutes and circulated the answer-key to their examination centres in different states, Goel said.The bank statement of accused persons revealed heavy cash transactions in 2021. Efforts are being made to nab their associates. Links of candidates who have cleared the examination by unfair means with the help of the gang are being investigated, the officer added.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Doorstep ration delivery scheme will have no name: Delhi CM Kejriwal on Centre’s objection||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the doorstep ration delivery scheme of his government would not have any name, a day after the Centre red flagged ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’ which was scheduled to start from March 25.“We will accept all conditions of the Centre but will not allow any obstruction in implementation of the scheme,” Kejriwal asserted in a press conference.The Centre on Friday asked the Delhi government not to implement the ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’ saying it is “not permissible” to use subsidised food grain allotted under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) for a state scheme.The Chief Minister said a letter from the Centre on Friday noon informed that the doorstep delivery of ration scheme cannot be named ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’.“Perhaps they had objection over Mujhya Mantri word. We are not doing this for credit or to polish our names. So now the scheme will have no name. There will be a Cabinet meeting on Monday and its proposal will be sent to the Centre,” he said.Kejriwal claimed it was very important for him to ensure ration delivery to poor people by removing ration mafia from the public distribution system.“We dreamt of this scheme for 20-22 years and I was personally preparing for it for last 2-3 years, so our hearts sank after receiving Centre’s objection but now we will not let any obstruction come in its way and accept all their conditions.”        He said the doorstep delivery of ration was a revolutionary scheme in view of powerful mafia active in the field and hoped the scheme without any name would satisfy the Centre and it would have no objection now.Kejriwal was scheduled to launch the scheme with doorstep delivery of ration to 100 households in northeast Delhi’s Seemapuri on March 25.The Central Government, however, said it would have no objection if the Delhi government came out with a separate scheme without mixing the elements of the NFSA.

Just see the amount of money it collected under the PM Cares Fund. If the people of West Bengal want peace and a state free from riots, then the Trinamool Congress is the only option," she asserted."A party that creates riots to kill people should never be allowed to rule Bengal. Even women in the BJP are not safe," the TMC boss alleged.Banerjee said the BJP cannot fight elections in a democratic manner and it "thrives by giving threats".The eight-phase West Bengal Assembly polls will get underway on March 27.The chief minister, bound to a wheelchair after suffering injures during campaigning earlier in the month, also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of embarking on a "selling spree"."The PM has sold everything. He has devastated the Indian economy. The government is already privatising the railways, coal sector, BSNL, the insurance space and banks.Someday, the Haldia dock might get sold, too," she said.Banerjee exhorted TMC supporters to guard the EVMs after the voting process is over in each phase."The EVMs should be tested 30 times before the start of the polls to ensure there is no foul play. But, If any machine develops faults, please remain calm until it is repaired," she said.Banerjee also said her government will construct a bridge between Haldia and Nandigram to boost connectivity."A centre for development of fish will be set up at Haldia. A deep-sea port at Tajpur is also being built at a cost of Rs 15,000 crore, which will generate 25,000 jobs," the TMC supremo said.The chief minister said financial assistance to farmers of the state will be raised from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000 per year and free ration delivered at their doorsteps.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Academicians write open letter to Ashoka University over Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s resignation||Over 150 academicians from prestigious universities across the globe like Harvard, Yale, Columbia, London School of Economics and MIT, have written an open letter to trustees of Ashoka University, expressing distress over political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s resignation from the varsity under “political pressure”.Also read: Ashoka University founders have bartered away its ‘soul’: Rahguram Rajan on resignation rowThe university in Haryana’s Sonepat became the centre of controversy earlier this week, when Mehta, who had resigned as its vice chancellor two years back, chose to step down as professor, saying that the founders made it “abundantly clear” that his association with the institution was a “political liability”.Arvind Subramanian, the former chief economic adviser, had also resigned from the university, two days later, in solidarity with Mehta.Students, alumni and faculty members of the varsity have been staging protests and demanding answers from the administration about whether Mehta’s exit has been a “direct consequence of him being a public intellectual and critic of the government”.Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Saturday took to social media to say that Mehta and Subramanian’s resignation is a “grievous blow to free speech and the founders have bartered away the varsity’s soul”.“We are distressed to learn of Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s resignation under political pressure from Ashoka University. A prominent critic of the current Indian government and defender of academic freedom, he had become a target for his writings. It seems that Ashoka’s Trustees, who should have treated defending him as their institutional duty, instead all but forced his resignation,” the open letter by the academicians read.“In political life, these are free argument, tolerance, and a democratic spirit of equal citizenship. In the university, they are free inquiry, candour, and a rigorous distinction between the demands of intellectual honesty and the pressure of politicians, funders, or ideological animus. These values come under assault whenever a scholar is punished for the content of public speech.“When that speech is in defense of precisely these values, the assault is especially shameful. The university must be a home for fearless inquiry and criticism. We support Pratap Bhanu Mehta in his practice of the highest values of intellectual inquiry and public life,” it added.The signatories to the letter include academicians from the New York University, University of Oxford, Stanford University, Princeton University, Cambridge University, University of Pennsylvania and University of California, among others.Rajan said Mehta is a “thorn in the side of the establishment” as he “skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and though provoking arguments”.“Free speech is the soul of a great university. By compromising on it, the founders have bartered away its soul. And if you show a willingness to barter your soul, is there any chance the pressures will go away?” he wrote in a Linkedin post.While the administration at Ashoka University has been tight-lipped about the development, Vice Chancellor Malika Sarabhai told students in a virtual townhall on Saturday that Mehta was asked to reconsider his decision, but “he has asked to be left alone”.

It is your state and it cannot be run from Nagpur,” Gandhi said.Attacking the ruling party in Assam, he said the entire state is being “handed over” to outsiders.“The government has given Rs 2,000 crore of your money to modernise the Guwahati airport. Now that has been snatched from you and was given to (Gautam) Adani. In this way, everything in the country is being given to his 2-3 richest businessmen friends,” Gandhi said.He alleged that the BJP makes different promises at different places but does not fulfil them.“I never lie. See what I had said before the polls in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab. I had said that farmers’ loans will be waived. Within six hours of forming the government in Chhattisgarh, it was done. Likewise, every promise in other states was fulfilled,” he said.He was campaigning in Mariani, which is going to polls in the first phase on March 27, in support of sitting three- time heavyweight Congress MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi, who will have a direct contest with BJP nominee Ramani Tanti.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Free speech in India suffered ‘grievous blow’, says Raghuram Rajan on Ashoka University developments||Eminent economist Raghuram Rajan has said free speech suffered a “grievous blow” in India with the resignations of Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian from the Ashoka University and that the varsity’s founders have bartered away its "soul".Earlier this week, the Sonepat-based Ashoka University—a leading varsity that offers courses in liberal arts and sciences—found itself at the centre of a controversy after political commentator Mehta and economist Subramanian resigned.Also read: Academicians write open letter to Ashoka University over Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s resignationIn a Linkedin post, former RBI governor Rajan said that free speech has suffered a “grievous blow” in India this week as professor Mehta, one of India’s finest political scientists, resigned from the Ashoka University.“The reality is that professor Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment. He is no ordinary thorn because he skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and thought-provoking arguments,” he said.  On the recent developments at the varsity, Rajan—who is a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business—said, “Free speech is the soul of a great university. By compromising on it, the founders have bartered away its soul.”     He further said, “And if you show a willingness to barter your soul, is there any chance the pressures will go away? This is indeed a sad development for India,” Rajan said.  Mehta’s exit from the varsity was followed by the resignation of professor Subramanian, also a former chief economic advisor of the Narendra Modi government. Rajan also quoted a few lines from Subramanian’s resignation letter which said, “That even Ashoka – with its private status and backing by private capital – can no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom is ominously disturbing.  “Above all, that the University’s commitment to fight for and sustain the Ashoka vision is now open to question makes it difficult for me to continue being part of Ashoka.”          Rajan noted that if Ashoka’s founders believe “they have compromised with the powers that be in the greater interests of the university, they are wrong”.According to Rajan, it is not that Mehta has much sympathy for the opposition either. “As a true academic, he is an equal opportunity critic. He is, and I hope will continue to be, one of the intellectual leaders of liberalism in India,” the former RBI governor said.Rajan also quoted Mehta from his resignation letter that said, “After a meeting with founders it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the university may be considered a political liability.”            Rajan opined that Mehta and Subramanian’s statements suggest that Ashoka’s founders have succumbed to outside pressure to get rid of “troublesome” critics.  He added that  Ashoka’s founders should have realised that their mission was indeed not to take political sides but to continue to protect the right of people like professor Mehta to speak.  According to Rajan, a good university creates an environment where ideas for progress and change arise.“Static societies where criticism is silenced are doomed societies, which eventually succumb to the weight of their authoritarianism and groupthink,” the former RBI governor noted.He further said Ashoka University, till this week, was considered India’s likely competitor to Cambridge, Harvard, and Oxford in coming decades. “Unfortunately, its actions this week make that less probable.”      He also opined that as an institution, the university should not take political sides.A query sent to the varsity on the recent developments remained unanswered till the filing of the story.   The faculty members at the university on March 18 had written to the vice chancellor and board members, expressing anguish over Mehta’s resignation.    The alumni council of the university had also released a separate statement on March 18 expressing solidarity with Mehta, who stepped down as the VC two years ago and resigned as a professor earlier this week.   The faculty members have noted that Mehta’s exit has set a “chilling precedent for future removals of faculty” and is a “matter of great anguish.The leadership team of Ashoka University includes Dhruv Agarwala (Co-founder and CEO PropTiger), Sanjeev Aggarwal (Co-Founder Fundamental Partnership and Helion Ventures), Vishwavir Ahuja (MD and CEO, RBL Bank), Pramod Bhasin (Founder Genpact, Chairman Clix Capital), Amit Chandra (MD, Bain Capital), Ramesh Damani (Investor and Chairman, DMart), Nirmal Jain (Founder and Chairman, IIFL Holdings) and Gautam Kumra (Managing Partner, McKinsey India).

20-03-2021||Vijay Mohan||Ban use of dynamite in sensitive Himalayan region to check natural calamities, says parliamentary panel||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 20Following recent incidents of glacial outbursts and flash floods in the mountains, a key parliamentary panel wants an immediate ban on the use of dynamite for undertaking developmental works in the Himalayan region. It has instead advocated the use of cutting-edge technology and modern equipment for cutting of hills in the geologically and ecologically sensitive terrain.“Excessive cutting of trees and use of dynamites on hills and mountains of the Himalayan region for roads, tunnels, dams and other developmental and infrastructural  projects is significantly weakening the surrounding hills and may be causing avalanches, landslides, flash floods and other catastrophes,” the Standing Committee on Home Affairs observed in its report tabled in Parliament this week.“The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) may coordinate with the agencies concerned, including National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, to immediately ban the use of dynamite for developmental  projects in the Himalayan region and make judicious use of technology, particularly in high-altitude Himalayan region to minimise the damage to ecology and environment,” the committee recommended.The committee said an urgent assessment needed to be made and organisations like  Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, might be tasked to conduct glaciological studies and prepare glacial lake inventory for the Himalayan region using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS).Besides, the states concerned should be sensitised to place adequate early-warning mechanisms in all districts so that vulnerable communities can be alerted of any impending disaster for which a network of meteorological and hydrological stations, monitoring stations and weather stations be set up at the earliest. In February, the MHA had informed the committee that monitoring of glacial lake outbursts flows (GLOF) would require a network of meteorological and hydrological stations, which would provide real-time data on air temperature, precipitation and river discharge through telemetry (V-SAT).Further bathymetry, that is measurement of depth of water bodies using airborne sensors, of potentially hazardous lakes would be beneficial to estimate the impact in vulnerable areas. Remote sensing data can provide information on changes in the surface area of glacial lakes and help in preparing baseline data of potentially hazardous glacial lakes and avalanches.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ban-use-of-dynamite-in-sensitive-himalayan-region-to-check-natural-calamities-says-parliamentary-panel-228034

The incident happened on March 13 near Raiwala in Uttarakhand.Section 167 of the Railways Act specifies that anyone found smoking in a compartment despite prohibition or objection from a co-passenger is liable for a fine of up to Rs 100.Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal in a meeting with Railway Board members and general managers of zones asked them to take proactive steps towards sensitising passengers against smoking in trains and also urged that erring passengers need to be  deterred from causing risks to others by smoking in trains."The railways will crackdown on smoking in trains. The fire most likely started in one of the toilets and initial investigations revealed that the fire was in all probability caused by simmering cigarettes/ beedi thrown in the dustbin. The continuous air flow in a fast moving train would have fanned it."We are contemplating severe penalties. In some cases, even arrests can be made for causing damage to public railway property and risking the lives of others to deter irresponsible and errant persons," a senior officer said.The official refused to come on record as the investigation into the incident is still underway.The fire, the officer said was so damaging that the interior of the toilet was completely charred and the floor was cracked.Officers said that a passenger has also provided a written statement to the four- member probe team stating that the smoke detector in coach went off when the fire started."A bigger tragedy was averted by the swift response of the train crew as the coach was detached soon. "But we can't let the guard down. So much effort has been made to prevent such incidents. Irresponsible passengers cannot be allowed to risk the lives of others," DJ Narain, Spokesperson, Railways, said.

It is a matter of great concern that media persons are increasingly feeling unsafe in Sindh. Offered condolence to the heirs of the victim. Police should (go) beyond forming comtes. (sic),” he said on Twitter.A group of journalists, holding the police responsible for the incident, protested against Lalvani’s killing and carried out a march, claiming that it was a targeted killing.Lalvani’s body was cremated amidst tension in Sukkur city which remained shut on the second consecutive day, the police said.Journalists, many of whom from Karachi, Khairpur, Shikarpur, Larkana, Sukkur and other towns, participated in the last rites along with Lalvani’s relatives, friends and members of the minority Hindu community, Dawn newspaper reported.The police said that they were investigating the motive of crime, and if it was linked with the victim’s professional responsibilities.Pakistan ranks ninth on the Committee to Protect Journalists’ annual Global Impunity Index, which assesses countries where journalists are murdered regularly and their killers go free.Meanwhile, New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an American independent non-profit organisation, urged authorities in Sindh province to “must immediately launch a credible investigation” and apprehend those responsible for the killing.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 vaccine should be able to give protection for 8-10 months: AIIMS Director||The COVID-19 vaccine should be able to give good protection from the infection for eight to ten months, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said on Saturday.He also said that no major side-effect of the vaccine has been recorded.“The COVID-19 vaccine should be able to give good protection from the infection for eight to ten months and maybe, even more,” Guleria said at an event organised by the IPS (Central) Association.He said the biggest reason for the surge in cases is that people feel the pandemic is over and they are not following COVID-appropriate behaviour.“There are multiple reasons for the surge, but the main reason is that there is change in people’s attitude and they feel coronavirus is over. People should still restrict non-essential travel for some more time,” the official asserted.NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said the chain of transmission has to be stopped and for that vaccine is one tool but another is containment and surveillance strategy.“Not following COVID-19 behaviour and laxity is major reason for the surge,” he said.Responding to a question on vaccinating more people, Paul said the issue is vaccines are limited and that is why, prioritisation has been done.“If we had unlimited supply, we would open the vaccination for everyone. That is the reason, not everyone, is getting vaccinated. Most countries in the world are not able to go beyond priority group because of this reason,” he said.The NITI Aayog member also said that the highest mortality was seen among people with co-morbidities and older age groups.“These people must not delay taking the vaccine. So the message is that they need it more than others. That is the reason they have been prioritised for getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” he said.Talking about the effectiveness of the available COVID-19 vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield, Guleria said, “If we look at the two vaccines, they produce equal antibodies and are very robust. We should take the vaccine available to us because both are equally effective in terms of efficacy and long-term protection.”Over four crore people in the country have been vaccinated against the virus till now. Under the current phase of the inoculation drive, people above 60 years of age and those in the 45-59 years age bracket with co-morbidities, are being vaccinated.

The BJP's DNA has the ethics, thoughts and values of Ashutosh Mukherjee and Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. With these features, we want to take Bengal to the next level in terms of development and make the future bright for the people of the state," Modi said.Urging people to vote for the saffron camp, he said that the people of West Bengal have seen the political regimes of all other parties in Bengal, except for the BJP.People gave an opportunity of 10 years to Mamata to bring development in the state. But she gave them 10 years of "plunder, corruption and misrule"."Just give us one chance to come to power in Bengal for 5 years. I promise you that the BJP will work towards the direction of making the state a 'Sonar Bangla' (Golden Bengal), the region which has been lagging behind almost for 70-years... The BJP will bring a change to the destruction caused by these parties in last 70 years in the state..."Arrey Didi, Bengal gave you 10-years for governance... We not only want to bloom lotus in Bengal but also want to make the future of the people of Bengal bright," he pointed out.The Prime Minister said that last night, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram were down for 50-55 minutes which left everyone worried."But here in Bengal, development, belief and dreams of the young people have been down for 50-55 years," he said, adding that "Bangal mein isbar BJP sarkar (It will be a BJP government this time in Bengal)".He said that people of West Bengal are getting impatient to bring in "ashol poriborton" (real change) to Bengal.Braving scorching sun, thousands of people came to attend PM Modi's rally on Saturday at Kharagpur. Armed with banners and placards, people were also seen sloganeering in favour of Modi ahead of the Prime Minister's address at the rally.Modi recalled the names of revolutions that started from West Midnapore and bowed to the land saying he is "fortunate" to address such a huge rally at Kharagpur.He praised BJP's West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh for his effort to consolidate the party's organisation in the state."I am proud that we have a party state unit president like Dilip Ghosh who took the organisation to such a height despite regular attacks by Mamata Banerjee's party. He never refrained from working for the betterment of West Bengal," Modi said.Harping on the theory of "double-engine government" PM Modi said that wherever there are BJP governments in the states, the Central and BJP-led state governments are engaged in the services towards the people with "the power of a double engine"."We are working with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas'," he said.Modi said that if the BJP government comes to power in the state -- agriculture, irrigation and cold storage facilities will be made better. This will benefit the potato farmers in the region."Improvement drives would be carried out in areas of healthcare, drinking water facilities and rural roads too. We're committed to all-round development," he said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-no-outsider-outfit-its-a-bengal-party-in-true-sense-modi-replies-to-mamata-228027

Though 28 per cent urban Indians were feeling depressed and sad, global citizens were more deeply impacted, with 4 in 10 being in a gloomy state of mind and 2 in 10 feeling positive."Lockdowns and restrictions put the brakes on socializing and people-to-people close interactions, which made people experience a new kind of loneliness, turning them into forced reclusiveness, which many had to deal with in different ways. Digital connectivity and new hobbies made many re-access happiness and people found their own ways of staying motivated. Like some were glued to social media and OTT for entertainment. While some took solace in close family bonding, with everyone homebound," says Amit Adarkar, CEO, Ipsos India.On the upside, more than half of all urban Indians believed their local community became more supportive during the pandemic. China (55 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (51 per cent) too held similar views.Countries which experienced least support of local communities during the pandemic were Japan (10 per cent) and Russia (13 per cent), shows the multi-country survey conducted between December 2020 and January 2021."Whether gated communities or neighbourhoods, there was a feeling of oneness and bonhomie towards one another, during the pandemic," added Adarkar. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-in-10-urban-indians-became-lonelier-amid-pandemic-survey-228013

He visited Japan and South Korea before visiting India."Congratulations to Secretary Defence Austin on a successful visit to India," tweeted Congressman Filemon Vela, who is Vice Chair of the Democratic Party appointed by President Joe Biden.“Look forward to working on strengthening Indo-Pacific ties,” said Vela, a top Hispanic Member in the House of Representatives.Congressman Frank Pallone, Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee welcomed the India visit of Austin.“I'm glad to see that Secretary Defence is engaging with our strategic partner India. President Biden has shown that he is committed to strengthening the US-India partnership in order to promote stability throughout the region,” he said.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.

The company specialises in software development, cloud computing, and web-based business tools.Abdul—a resident of Assam—shared his story in a long LinkedIn post. "In 2013, With just 1000 rupees, I left my home, spent 800 on a train ticket. After roaming for 2 months on the streets, finally found a job at a security desk. One day, one of the senior employees of the company, asked my name and said - Alim, I can see something in your eyes (sounds filmy I know). He asked me about my studies and my computer knowledge. In school I learned a little bit of HTML. Then he asked me If I want to learn more, and this is how My learning began. Since every day after completing my 12 hours security shift, I went to the senior and learned. About after eight months, I created a small app. An app that takes the user input and visualizes it. The senior employee showed the app to his manager and he liked it. He asked if it is possible to interview me. I thought I will not be interviewed ever because I did not go to any college and studied only will 10th. He told that in Zoho You don't need a college degree, What matters here is you and your skills. And the day came, gave the interview and ..passed it. Today it is my 8th year in Zoho Corporation.

20-03-2021||Washington||Top American lawmakers and experts applaud historic QUAD leadership summit||Top American lawmakers and experts have applauded the first Quad summit of leaders from the US, India, Australia and Japan and supported the move of President Joe Biden to address the challenge posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region.On March 12, Biden opened the first Quad Leaders’ Summit held virtually and attended by Prime Minister Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.“The Indo-Pacific is the most consequential region for American foreign policy, with enormous challenges but also great opportunities,” Indian-American Congressman Dr Ami Bera, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia, and Nonproliferation, said on Friday.During a Congressional hearing on “America’s Way Forward in the Indo-Pacific,” chaired by him, Bera said from increased aggression in the South and East China sea, to the use of coercive trade measures, China is the greatest geopolitical challenge they have faced in decades.“The Indo-Pacific also holds significant promise and opportunity for the United States, in large part because of the friendship and partnership of our regional actors and organisations,” he said.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.Experts who testified before the Congressional subcommittee were Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and Former Director of Policy Planning at the US Department of State; Randall G. Schriver; chairman of the Project 2049 Institute and Former Assistant Secretary of Defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs; and Nadege Rolland Senior Fellow for Political and Security Affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research.During the hearing, Bera noted that the US and China will get more competitive in the future. However, the US desire is not to have a direct confrontation and to use the rule of law as a foundation for a strategy in the Indo-Pacific.Congressman Stave Chabot, Ranking Member of Subcommittee and Co-Chair of the House India Caucus, queried from Schriver on how the US should partner with India for maintenance of international order in the region.In response, Schriver said he is optimistic about the US-India relations which have grown under all administrations especially in defence during the Obama administration. India and the US have a shared understanding of threats including from China and Pakistan, which is a close ally of China, he said.Shriver said that India can be a strong partner in Indian Ocean Region and can deter the Chinese from openly operating in the Indian Ocean. Schriver also welcomed the ongoing visit of defence secretary Lloyd Austin to India. Congressman Andy Barr, member House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Financial Services Committee called for partnership in the region to offer alternatives to Chinese technology especially in communications.In her intervention, Congresswoman Kathy Manning supported for the US to undertake immigration reform to attract more talent including through removal of country caps in H-1B visas and liberalised student visas in STEM areas.Hass said that the United States should collaborate with its partners to offer high-quality, sustainable infrastructure as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, possibly through a regional fund involving Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and European countries.“While India is an important partner, it is unlikely to become a formal ally. It wants to avoid a breakdown in its relations with China and will zealously guard its strategic autonomy while it focuses on managing its fraught relationship with Pakistan, its domestic development, and its border with China,” Hass said.Hass said that the announcement that the United States will work with members of the Quad to provide one billion COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asian nations is an innovative development and hopefully a preview of more to come.Applauding last week’s meeting of the Quad at the Presidential level, Schriver this week’s two plus two meetings with Japan and Korea, and Secretary Austin’s follow-on travel to India are also positive steps. The continued recognition of China as a strategic competitor and the need to partner with like-minded countries to preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific set the appropriate vision, he said.Rolland told lawmakers that there is no “Indo-Pacific” in Beijing’s conception. The region is in fact included as part of China’s “periphery.”       Here too, the term itself is very telling about the Chinese perspective: China is at the center and at the top of a 360-degree peripheral zone that expands over both the continental and maritime domains. Left unclear are the exact geographic extent of this “periphery” and the kind of future the Chinese party-state hopes to see for it, he said.

Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5. The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad is probing that case.Hiran's wife has accused Waze of involvement in her husband's suspicious death.The NIA has so far questioned several officials of the Crime Intelligence Unit of city police, to which Waze was attached, and seized a total of five high-end vehicles including two Mercedes cars.Waze has been remanded in the NIA's custody till March 25.

No notice now,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Friday told senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.Contending that the petitioner had sent letters to the Election Commission and other authorities which didn’t respond, Singh wanted the Bench to issue notices to the Centre and Election Commission. However, the top court refused to issue notice on the PIL at this juncture and instead asked the petitioner to serve a copy to the Attorney General.It described the party symbol as the root cause of corruption and criminalisation of politics. As Singh submitted that in Brazil, one just got numbers to contest and no symbols, the Bench wondered how a symbol could affect the electronic voting process in any way.

20-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Okay to deny reproductive tech to live-in, same-sex couples: Panel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 19In a move with far-reaching ramifications for gender justice and LGBTQ rights, the parliamentary committee on health on Friday said it was correct on the part of the government to exclude live-in and same-sex couples from availing the benefits of assisted reproductive technologies to have children in the event of infertility.In its report to Parliament on the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020, today, the committee said, “Given the Indian family structure and social milieu and norms, it will not be very easy to accept a child whose parents are together, but not legally married. We feel that keeping the best interest of that child born through ART services and other parentage issues in case of their separation, it would not be appropriate to allow live-in couples and same-sex couples to avail the facility of ART.”In saying so, the panel endorsed the government’s definition of a couple commissioning ART service as “infertile married couple”. Earlier, the government had similarly excluded live-in and same-sex couples from the ambit of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019.The ART Bill, 2020, makes no groundbreaking distinction even though the parliamentary panel says it took into account the SC order decriminalising same-sex relationships. Endorsing the Bill, the parliamentary panel, however, differed with the government, which has excluded people with genetic disorders from the ambit of ART Bill.“Consider incorporating the provision of ART services to individuals with any medical condition, including genetic disorders,” the panel says, while leaving out same-sex and live-in couples noting, “Though the SC decriminalised same-sex relations, it did not introduce any special provisions or grant any additional rights to same-sex couples. The same applies for people who are in live-in relationships.”The ART Bill seeks to regulate all forms of assisted reproductive technologies, barring surrogacy, which has been covered by a separate law.It will create a National Advisory Board and state-level boards apart from a national registry for accreditation, and supervision of all ART clinics that offer services like gamete donation, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). The sector has been operating in a regulatory vacuum leading to unethical practices.Bill to modify list of SCs in TN passedThe Lok Sabha on Friday passed the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to modify the list of Scheduled Castes in Tamil Nadu by grouping seven castes that currently exist as separate castes under one nomenclature of “Devendrakula Vellalars”.

Can we accept that no development has taken place and that no backward caste has moved forward?” asked a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.The Bench pointed out that the Mandal verdict talked about reviewing the list and eliminate those who had come out from backwardness.Defers plea against states’ resolutions“Yes, we have moved forward. But it’s not that backward classes have gone down from 50 per cent to 20 per cent. We still have starvation deaths… I am not trying to say Indra Sawhney is completely wrong and throw it in the dustbin. I am raising issues where 30 years have lapsed, the law has changed, the population has grown, backward persons may also have increased,” responded senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, who represented the Maharashtra Government. It’s about giving a bigger piece of the cake to the deprived sections, he added.The Bench sought to know if there was no limit to quota what would happen to the concept of equality. “What about the resultant inequality? How many generations will you continue...?” it asked.“It’s an indication by Parliament that we have not reached anywhere near the emancipation that we require for the backwards, the have-nots, the SCs/STs,” Rohatgi submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-is-there-any-limit-to-quota-what-about-concept-of-equality-227781

The European Continent contributed 33 per cent – 514 billion tonnes — of historical emissions over this period. The US has contributed 25 per cent — 400 billion tonnes; China contributed over 13 per cent — 200 billion tonnes, while India contributed 48 billion tonnes. Our net emissions are much lower and we are absolutely not responsible for climate change,” Javadekar said answering questions on the Paris Climate Change Agreement of which India is a signatory.“We are the sufferers. Our stand is firm. The developed nations should reduce their carbon emissions and transfer low-cost technology to the developing nations to help them reduce their emissions,” Javadekar said, adding that not every environmental event was caused by climate change. He was referring to forest fires and Chamoli floods. “Every natural incident is not related to climate change alone.

General Austin, here as part of his first three-nation tour as Defence Secretary, later called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.India and the US will have separate strategic and military demands for each other when he meets Defence Minister Rajnath Singh along with their delegations tomorrow. It could very well set the tone for cooperation and collaboration between the Quad countries — US, India, Australia and Japan — to address the challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region. Quad leaders had spoken through videoconferencing on March 12 and, as expected, China was on the agenda.A joint statement is slated to be made at noon after the meeting, which will be the first major India-US interaction after Joe Biden took over as US President in January. General Austin will be in India till March 21. He arrived around 4.45 pm on Friday. While both sides are eager to work together, India will look to seek latest technology (robotics) and even joint partnership in making ‘micro-chips’ — the core of any electronic item like smart phone or TV. India is also keen on having an unmanned fighter jet. At present, India and US are running separate programmes on making unmanned fighter jets.The US is likely to discuss with India the need to “operationalise” their “major defence partnership”, including intelligence sharing. Washington will seek an update on sales of armed drones and missile systems besides naval guns. The US and India are on the verge of an agreement on the sale of 30 armed drones of the “predator” family, made by General Atomics.Besides PM, Gen Austin also met NSA Ajit Doval. Late at night, a US statement said Gen Austin commended India's leadership role in the Indo-Pacific and growing engagement with like-minded partners across the region.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||50-year-old abortion law amended to aid sexual assault victims||The Parliament on Friday approved a Bill that eases abortion rules for victims of rape, incest and for mothers bearing abnormal foetuses. The Lok Sabha cleared amendments passed by the Rajya Sabha on March 16, paving the way for President Ram Nath Kovind to grant assent to the Bill.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Bill, 2020, eases abortion conditions for a range of women survivors of assault. Under the 1971 law, surgical abortion of foetuses beyond 20 weeks was illegal. The amended Bill allows victims of rape and incest; minors and differently abled to abort foetuses with upper gestation age limit of 24 weeks instead of 20 weeks and scraps the upper gestation age limit for abortion in cases of abnormal foetuses that are incompatible with life and pose a risk to the mother.The Bill follows several court petitions seeking permission to abort pregnancies at a gestational age beyond the permissible limit on grounds of foetal abnormalities or sexual violence. The amended Bill says, “The upper gestation limit will not apply in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by a medical board. Also the name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorised in any law for the time being in force.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/50-year-old-abortion-law-amended-to-aid-sexual-assault-victims-227563

The government is unshackling the mineral potential of India to make it self-reliant. The sector contributes 1.75 per cent to India’s GDP as against 7.5 per cent in South Africa and 7 per cent in Australia. We will raise this to 2.5 per cent of the GDP,” said Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi moving The Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Amendment Bill 2021 to amend the 1957 law.Unlocking potentialJoshi said out of 10 per cent explored mineral potential, only 1.5 per cent had been mined as against 70 to 80 per cent in South Africa and Australia.“The reason for our low potential is we have not involved the private sector… having advanced technology in exploration. The Bill will also allow mine clearances to be transferred to new owners as in infra projects,” said Joshi, assuring states the Centre “will not take a penny” out of financial benefits that accrue from the Bill.The government said 143 mines were handed over to states after auctions began five years ago, but only seven were auctioned.“In March 2020, 334 mines expired and of these, 46 working mines were given back to states for auctions. But only 28 have been auctioned,” said Joshi.The Bill will enable the government to auction 572 mines allotted years ago starting 1980s but never made functional, having a worth of Rs 27 lakh crore. It mandates lease holders to start production and dispatch of minerals within two years of signing the mining lease and PSUs to start production in five years. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-nod-to-bill-allowing-pvt-sector-in-mine-exploration-227566

Just a month back, the Centre had increased the lower and upper limits on domestic airfares by 10-30 per cent due to rising ATF prices.Presently, the Ministry of Civil Aviation placed limits on airfares through seven bands classified on the basis of flight duration and this system was introduced since the resumption of scheduled commercial flights on May 25, 2020.  The first band consists of flights having less than 40-minute duration and its lower limit has been increased now to Rs 2,310. The lower limit for the highest band of flights having duration of 180-210 minutes was further hiked to Rs 7,560.“There has been a continuous rise in the price of ATF so it has been decided to increase the lower fare band by 5% keeping the upper fare band unchanged,” Puri said in one of his Twitter posts.The government may soon allow the airlines to operate at their 100 per cent capacity.  In another tweet the Minister said, “We may open the sector for 100% operations when daily passenger traffic crosses 3.5 lakh on 3 occasions in a month.”At present the airlines are allowed to operate at the level of 80 per cent of their per-COVID domestic flights. “Last few days have seen a decline in the number of air passengers largely due to restrictions & imposition of compulsory RT-PCR test by various states. Due to this we have decided to retain the permissible limit to 80 p% of schedule,” Puri added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-travel-becomes-expensive-as-govt-announces-5-pc-hike-in-lower-limit-of-airfares-227630

Due to discipline and values, we used to cover it with a patch, he said.Rawat had drawn flak after at an event earlier this week he said youngsters follow strange fashion trends due to a lack of values and consider themselves to be big shots after wearing jeans ripped at the knees. Women also follow such trends.Rawat then went on to describe the attire of a woman who sat next to him on a flight. He described her as wearing boots, jeans ripped at the knees, bangles in her hands and with two children travelling with her. He also said she runs an NGO, goes out in society and has two children and wondered what values she would give them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-cm-tirath-singh-rawat-apologises-after-backlash-but-still-objects-to-ripped-jeans-227617
20-03-2021||---||Back your rhetoric on peace with solid action: Capt Amarinder to Pak Army Chief Bajwa||Chandigarh, March 19Reacting to Pakistan Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s remarks that it was time for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said he should back his rhetoric on peace with solid action.Bajwa’s statement had come on Thursday, a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan made similar overtures following an unexpected ceasefire announcement by the militaries of the two countries weeks ago. Addressing a session of the first-ever Islamabad Security Dialogue, General Bajwa had said the potential for regional peace and development always remained hostage to the issues between Pakistan and India—the two “nuclear-armed neighbours”.Terming the Islamabad-sponsored terrorism as “the biggest hurdle to normalising relations between the two nations”, Amarinder said Bajwa should first control his ISI and then talk about stability in the India-Pakistan relations.General Bajwa “should back his rhetoric on peace with solid action”, the CM said in a statement, adding that India cannot afford to go soft with Pakistan “till they walk the talk and prove their sincerity with concrete actions”.“Infiltration into India from across the border is still happening, Indian soldiers are being killed at the borders every day. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin into Punjab via drones every other day.“Efforts to create trouble in my state continue to take place. All this should stop first, only then we can talk peace,” the Punjab CM said.“For India to trust Pakistan, the latter will have to do much more than offer an olive branch,” said the Chief Minister, citing his own experience of 1964 as ADC to the General Officer Commanding-in-C, Western Command.“We used to receive daily reports of firing and trouble from the western border as we continue to do now,” said Amarinder Singh.It is important for not just Bajwa but the entire Pakistan military apparatus to be on board with the idea of burying the past and paving the way for peace with India, said Amarinder on Friday, adding that it is not New Delhi but Islamabad which has obstructed the path of peace between the two countries.“Are they all of the same view as shared by General Bajwa? Are they withdrawing all support to terror groups immediately? Have they asked the ISI to back off and leave India alone,” asked the Chief Minister.“India is all for peace, all Indians stand for peace, but India cannot compromise on its security and integrity,” he stressed, adding that peace cannot be conditional.Given the way the situation has evolved over the past few months, Pakistan’s increasing collusion with China, which has been causing a whole lot of trouble for India on the other border, is a matter of concern, the Chief Minister said.“If Islamabad seriously wants peace with New Delhi, they should send out the message to Beijing, loud and clear, that Pakistan is not with them in the dangerous escapades at the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/back-your-rhetoric-on-peace-with-solid-action-capt-amarinder-to-pak-army-chief-bajwa-227614
20-03-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala on collision course with Centre as Crime Branch registers case against ED||Even as a fierce electoral battle is on the cards in Kerala, another battle is shaping up between the Centre and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.The Crime Branch of the Kerala Police on Friday registered a case against the Enforcement Directorate based on a complaint by two women police officials that they were pressurised by the ED officials to testify that the prime accused Swapna Suresh was asked loaded questions and was pressurised to make her name Vijayan.An FIR has been filed before a court in Kochi against Kochi ED officials on charges which include conspiracy and other non-bailable offences.The Crime Branch police sought legal opinion on this and it got the green signal from the director general of prosecution—the body that advises the state government on all criminal matters.Meanwhile, the ED is also leaving nothing to chance and is expecting to take up the issue of seeking a total probe by the CBI into this.Ever since Vijayan took over the election campaign, practically every day he makes it a point to say that the Kerala government under him is of a different breed and it has always taken on the Centre. This was especially so when it became the first state in the country to announce that the CAA won’t be implemented there.He also does not forget to raise the way the central probe agencies are out to tarnish the image of the government, whose only agenda is development of the state.In the coming days, Vijayan is likely to play to the gallery by highlighting the way his police have taken on the central agencies.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Centre has stopped doorstep delivery of ration scheme: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday claimed that the Centre has asked the Delhi Government to withdraw its doorstep delivery scheme for food grains.AAP's chief spokesperson Saurav Bharadwaj addressing a press conference at the party office said the Centre has put the AAP government's flagship scheme on hold and has asked it to withdraw the scheme.Bharadwaj questioned the timing of stopping the scheme just a few days before it was scheduled to be launched. According to the Delhi government's earlier announcement, the doorstep delivery scheme was scheduled to start from March 25. "The Central Government must withdraw this direction and allow the Delhi government to launch the scheme. The AAP government has not taken a single penny for this scheme from the Centre and if such a scheme prevents rampant corruption, the Centre shouldn't take umbrage," Bharadwaj added.The doorstep delivery of ration was a flagship scheme of the AAP government which was announced by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Republic Day this year."After AAP came to power in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decided to take some steps in the food grains distribution system. Despite the increase in the commission of the ration dealers, there were several complaints from the poor that in Delhi the ration shops do not open regularly, which leads to the poor suffering a lot. To get just five kg of ration a poor person needs to stand in the queue from the morning to evening. The Delhi government worked on this policy for over three years and decided to deliver ration at homes."He asserted that the scheme has been prepared to ensure that beneficiaries of the government's subsidised food grains get ration at their doorstep. The scheme was ready and it was to be launched on March 25 at Seemapuri's JJ cluster.He said, "We have less than a week to launch this scheme and now the Central Government has written to the Delhi government asking to stop this scheme. I don't know why the Centre has a problem if the corruption in the ration distribution system stops."The scheme announced under the 'Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna' (MMGGRY) under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) of the National Food Security Act, 2013, was notified by the government on February 20. The MMGGRY involves the delivery of packed wheat flour and rice to beneficiaries at their doorsteps.Kejriwal had mentioned in his Republic Day address that all beneficiaries in the Capital who have a ration card can avail the benefits of the scheme. The scheme will be optional and existing TPDS beneficiaries will have to specify to enrol under it. Delhi has nearly 17 lakh PDS beneficiaries. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-has-stopped-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-scheme-aap-227578
20-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Not everyone will be given Covid vaccine: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 19The government on Thursday ruled out universal COVID 19 immunization saying every vaccine does not need to be administered to everyone.Answering questions on COVID vaccine efficacy and scale in the Lok Sabha today, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said each and everyone on the globe will not be given the COVID vaccine.No signal of concern regarding use of Covishield vaccine in India: Govt“Every vaccine does not require universal immunization. Priority groups for inoculation have been carefully and scientifically determined. Tomorrow this priority group will expand. The advice on who to inoculate is based on the opinions of experts and WHO guidelines. India’s National Expert Group on Vaccination is in touch with all scientific developments in this field. It is not necessary scientifically to give the vaccine to each and every person. The COVID vaccine is not going to be given to everyone on the globe. All things are based on scientific scrutiny and advice,” Vardhan said to a pointed query by NCP’s Supriya Sule on whether universal COVID immunization was being considered.The minister also ruled out fears that COVID vaccines could alter the DNA of recipients or their progeny.Answering a question by Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu, Vardhan said vaccines are safe and the COVID vaccine adverse events following immunization rate in India is a meagre 0.00432 per cent.“India made COVID vaccines fulfill all parameters of safety, efficacy and immunogenicity. There is absolutely no cause for fear or suspicion. Eligible people should register and take the shots,” said Vardhan as India’s daily new cases touched a new high nearing 40,000 cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-everyone-will-be-given-covid-vaccine-govt-227553
20-03-2021||New Delhi||Booker finalist Sahota pens multigenerational saga; takes readers to 1920s rural Punjab||2015 Booker Prize nominee Sunjeev Sahota takes back readers to rural Punjab of the 1920s in his new novel, which is about two characters separated by more than half a century but united by blood."China Room", inspired in part by the author's own family history, will be published by Penguin Random House India in May.Sahota, author of "Ours Are the Streets" and "The Year of the Runaways", which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Dylan Thomas Prize, says he is delighted that his new novel is with Penguin Random House India.Commenting on the novel, Meru Gokhale, publisher, Penguin Press, Penguin Random House India, says it is one of those books that "stays with you long after you've put it down. Set in rural Punjab, spanning across generations, this story is full of moments of pain that are carefully layered within the plot - the pain of what it was like to be a woman in the 1920s, forbidden to love, and the pain of a young man today who has lost his identity." One of the characters Mehar, a young bride in rural Punjab of 1929, is trying to discover the identity of her new husband.Married to three brothers in a single ceremony, she and her now-sisters spend their days hard at work in the family's 'china room', sequestered from contact with the men - except when their domineering mother-in-law, Mai, summons them to a darkened chamber at night.Curious and strong-willed, Mehar tries to piece together what Mai doesn't want her to know. From beneath her veil, she studies the sounds of the men's voices and the calluses on their fingers as she serves them tea.Soon, she glimpses something that seems to confirm which of the brothers is her husband. A series of events is set in motion, which will put more than one life at risk. As the early stirrings of the Indian independence movement rise around her, Mehar must weigh her own desires against the reality - and danger - of her situation.Spiralling around Mehar's story is that of a young man who arrives at his uncle's house in Punjab in the summer of 1999, hoping to shake off an addiction that has held him in its grip for more than two years.Growing up in small-town England as the son of an immigrant shopkeeper, his experiences of racism, violence and estrangement from the culture of his birth led him to seek a dangerous form of escape.As he rides out his withdrawal at his family's ancestral home - an abandoned farmstead, its china room mysteriously locked and barred - he begins to knit himself back together, gathering strength for the journey home.

20-03-2021||Islamabad||Time for India and Pak to bury the past and move forward: Gen Bajwa||Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said on Thursday that it was time for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward” as he asserted that the peace between the two neighbours would help to “unlock” the potential of South and Central Asia.Addressing a session of the first-ever Islamabad Security Dialogue here, Gen Bajwa also said the potential for regional peace and development always remained hostage to the disputes and issues between Pakistan and India - the two “nuclear-armed neighbours”.“We feel it is time to bury the past and move forward,” he said, adding that the responsibility for a meaningful dialogue rested with India.India last month said it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.India has also told Pakistan that “talks and terror” cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.“Our neighbour will have to create a conducive environment, particularly” in Kashmir, Gen Bajwa said, adding that any effort to improve ties without addressing the core issue would be vulnerable to external political factors.“The Kashmir issue is at the heart of this. It is important to understand that without the resolution of the Kashmir dispute through peaceful means, the process will always remain susceptible to derailment to politically motivated bellicosity,” he said.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Gen Bajwa’s remarks came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan made a similar statement at the same venue.Gen Bajwa also said peace between Pakistan and India would help to “unlock the potential of South and Central Asia” by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia Prime Minister Khan said on Wednesday said India will be benefitted economically by having peace with Pakistan as it will enable New Delhi to directly access the resource-rich Central Asia region through Pakistani territory.“India will have to take the first step. Unless they do so, we cannot do much,” Khan said while delivering the inaugural address at the launch of the two-day Dialogue.Khan said having a direct route to the Central Asian region will economically benefit India. Central Asia is rich in oil and gas.Central Asia, in the modern context, generally includes five resource-rich countries—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Gen Bajwa also said peace between Pakistan and India would help to “unlock the potential of South and Central Asia” by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia.Though, both Prime Minister Khan and Gen Bajwa didn’t specify the minimum steps that India should take but many experts in Pakistan believe that some positive measures in Kashmir could ease pressure on the Pakistan government before entering into talks or restoring the normal diplomatic ties.Gen Bajwa also talked about poverty which he said was linked with the regional tension that had hindered the regional connectivity and integration.“Despite being impoverished, we end up spending a lot of our money on defence, which naturally comes at the expense of human development,” he said.However, he added that Pakistan was resisting the temptation to become part of the arms race or increase defence budget despite rising security challenges.“This has not been easy, especially when you live in a hostile and unstable neighbourhood. But having said that, let me say that we are ready to improve our environment by resolving all our outstanding issues with our neighbours through dialogue in a dignified and peaceful manner,” he said.India and Pakistan had announced on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country.Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August, 2019.Talking about the concept of national security, Gen Bajwa said that it was not just about protecting countries from an external and internal threat.“Today, the leading drivers of change in the world are demography, economy and technology…However, one issue that remains central to this concept is economic security and cooperation,” he said.He said that since national security involved ensuring human security, national progress and development, it was not solely the function of the armed forces and required a national effort to safeguard a nation.
