23-03-2021||New Delhi||Nawaz Sharif made concessions to India but failed to get anything in return: Abdul Basit||As Pakistan prime minister, Nawaz Sharif made unilateral concessions to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and even weakened Islamabad’s principled position on Jammu and Kashmir, thinking that he would extract something in return but that did not happen, a former Pakistani diplomat said on Tuesday.Pakistan’s former high commissioner to India Abdul Basit, in an online interview to Karan Thapar of The Wire, severely criticised Sharif on his policy towards India and said Islamabad’s reading of Prime Minister Modi was “off the mark”.Following an invitation, Sharif had attended Modi inauguration as prime minister in 2014, signalling his intent to improve ties with India. On his part, Modi had made a surprise stopover at Lahore in December 2015.However, a series of terror attacks on India by Pakistan-based terror groups in 2016 brought the ties under severe strain.Basit, referring to a meeting between Sharif had with Modi when he visited India in 2014, said the Pakistani leader kept silent on Kashmir and did not utter a single word on it when the Indian prime minister raised the issue of terrorism and Mumbai terror attack trial.“He (Sharif) thought that by making such concessions he would eventually be able to get concessions from prime minister Modi. But that was not the case in my view. Because the way Islamabad was reading PM Modi in my assessment was off the mark,” Basit said.He said Sharif wanted to maintain good relations with Modi but did so unilaterally without anything in return.        Asked on what ground, he accused Sharif of ‘pandering to India unilaterally and unconditionally’ in his new book, Basit said: “I watched our leader very very closely and worked with him very closely on Pakistan-India relations. I make these assumptions based on what I have seen.”   Basit was Pakistan’s envoy to India from 2014-2017, the first three years of the Modi government.        When asked whether Pakistan’s concessions to India meant its interests were compromised as Modi did not offer anything in return, the former high commissioner said, “That is correct and (it) weakened our principled position on Jammu and Kashmir in particular.” The former envoy also said that the joint statement of December 2015 and the Ufa joint statement were poorly negotiated by Pakistan and they made concessions to India.Basit said Sharif had an emotional attachment to India and Indians which, at times ... went beyond his stature as the prime minister.He said Sharif would meet almost any Indian who wanted to see him and added he was “out to oblige everyone”.Basit also criticised Sharif’s foreign affairs advisors, Sartaj Aziz and Tariq Fatemi saying they were too keen on extending concessions to India rather than standing up for Pakistan’s interests.To a question on his criticism of the high-ranking officials, the former envoy said “The way we handled our interaction with India subsequently and it was not because of the prime minister himself. I think the entire team, I do not know whether that kind of instructions they had from the prime minister.“But since he (Sharif) was at the helm, I would say that he was kind of convinced that he would eventually extract some concessions from India which he failed to do unfortunately.” Basit also indicated how he was repeatedly ignored on important India-Pakistan matters.

23-03-2021||New Delhi||‘Manipur govt-in-exile’ case: NIA files charge-sheet against 2 separatist leaders, their associates||The National Investigation Agency on Tuesday filed a chargesheet against two separatist leaders from Manipur who had in 2019 announced the launch of the “Manipur government-in-exile” and declared the state’s independence from India, officials said.Besides Yamben Biren and Narengbam Samarjit Singh, the agency filed the charge-sheet also against their associates Narengbam Biswajit Singh, Elangbam Brojendro Singh and Akoijam Deepa Anand, they said.In 2019 at a press conference in London, Biren, claiming to be the “Chief Minister of Manipur State Council” and Narengbam Samarjit Singh, claiming to be the “Minister of External Affairs and Defence of Manipur State Council”, had said they were speaking on behalf of the “Maharaja of Manipur” to formally launch the government-in-exile—“The Manipur State Council”.The officials said that the five persons have been charged under the Indian Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The chargesheet was filed before a special NIA court in Imphal in Manipur on Tuesday.“The case, filed at the Lamphel Police Station in Manipur’s Imphal West on October 30, 2019, pertains to the declaration of independence of Manipur from India and formation of ‘The Manipur State Council’ at London by the self-styled external affairs and defence minister of so-called ‘Manipur State Council’ Narengbam Samarjit Singh and self-styled chief minister of Manipur State Council Yambem Biren,” a National Investigation Agency (NIA) official said.Narengbam Samarjit Singh, chairman and managing director of the Salai Group of Companies and SMART Society, colluded with Elangbam and Anand, and illegally collected huge amounts of money and cheated the public by taking deposits by offering 36 per cent annual returns on deposits made to the Salai Group and SMART Society without any legal authority, the official said.The illegal funds were laundered by Narengbam Samarjit Singh and his associates through various companies of the Salai Group and SMART Society, the NIA official said.The illegitimate funds were further utilised for unlawful activities like declaration of independence of Manipur from the Union of India and the formation of the “Manipur State Council”, the official said.It was also used for funding the “army” of the “Manipur State Council”, the official said, adding that further investigation in the case continues. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manipur-govt-in-exile-case-nia-files-charge-sheet-against-2-separatist-leaders-their-associates-229440

23-03-2021||Patna||Bihar Police Bill passed by assembly amid unprecedented chaos||Unprecedented chaos erupted inside the Bihar Assembly on Tuesday when police was called inside to assist the marshals in evicting unruly opposition members who tried to physically prevent the Speaker from taking his Chair.Sources in the five-party Grand Alliance said on condition of anonymity that there were instructions from “leadership” that the House must not be allowed to function on the penultimate day of the month-long budget session.The bone of contention was Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, which the Nitish Kumar government has introduced in a bid to give its police more teeth, deemed necessary in view of the increasingly complex security needs of the state which has been witnessing rapid economic growth.The opposition, however, termed it as a “black” legislation, taking strong exception to provisions that empower the Special Armed Police, previously known as the Bihar Military Police, to conduct searches and arrests without producing a warrant.The Bill was, nonetheless, passed by the assembly late in the evening, well past the stipulated time, amid a “walkout” by opposition MLAs who squatted outside the building and raised slogans, slighted by the manner in which they were ousted from the hall by the men in uniform.Things had come to the pass after the Speaker was thwarted from taking his seat by a handful of women legislators of the RJD who had clambered on to the podium even as many other MLAs created ruckus in the well, threw away the chair of the Vidhan Sabha secretary and prevented staff from bringing in another piece of furniture.Tempers flared up in the treasury benches as well. The normally affable cabinet minister Ashok Choudhary was seen getting physical with an RJD MLA who tried to snatch away the papers from BJP’s Prem Kumar, who occupied the chair while Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha took his time to recover from the shock over the turn of events during the day.Sinha had around 3 pm adjourned proceedings till 4.30 pm, for the umpteenth time during the day.He was held hostage inside his chamber by opposition legislators who surrounded it from all sides preventing his exit.Top officials of the district and police administration had to contend with an RJD procession led by Tejashwi Yadav earlier in the day, taken out in protest against the Bill and rising unemployment, which resulted in injuries to many protesters and police officials as stones were hurled and lathi charge and use of water cannons was ordered.The Dak Bungalow crossing, where the protesters clashed with the police upon being prevented from marching to the assembly, witnessed lawlessness as vehicles parked by the roadside were vandalized and many journalists covering the event also suffered injuries.The officials were summoned to the Vidhan Sabha premises in the afternoon to rope in police personnel for helping the marshals who were far outnumbered by the legislators laying siege to the Speakers chamber.A few MLAs of the RJD and its ally CPI(M) fell unconscious outside the Vidhan Sabha premises where they were dumped by the security personnel. Later, they alleged that they were “severely beaten up”.Another RJD MLA appeared before the camera with his hand wrapped in plaster and declared “members of the ruling coalition broke my arm in presence of the chief minister who chose to look away”.Disturbing images of some legislators being pulled by the hair and kicked and male police personnel dragging a female MLA have also gone viral on the social media.Tejashwi Yadav, who was inside the Vidhan Sabha premises in the afternoon, having spent the first half leading the procession and courting arrest, tweeted angrily “Nitish Kumar, if you are indeed a man, get us shot instead of getting us beaten up”.It was a day of uncharacteristic anger shown by the cool-headed young leader who was seen engaged in an angry spat with an Additional SP in the evening after the police was done with helping the marshals in eviction of problematic opposition legislators.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who witnessed many of the unsavoury incidents with distaste, said “there seem to be many new legislators who need to be trained in parliamentary behaviour.“Had the opposition allowed the House to run, the government would have addressed its concerns. But that opportunity was frittered away”.The Speaker, visibly shattered by the utter chaos of which he happened to be at the receiving end, said before winding up, “many unfortunate things have happened. This cannot be allowed to recur.“Action will be taken against those members who might have indulged in vandalism on the floor of the House”.

Petitioner advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha has demanded setting up of a Central Board for Regulation and Monitoring of Online Video Contents (CBRMOV) to monitor, filter and regulate content on OTT platforms. There is another PIL filed by Justice for Rights Foundation.The Centre, however, said the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, have been put in place following complaints from civil society and politicians with regard to content on the OTT streaming platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ott-platforms-sc-stays-proceedings-in-hcs-229432
23-03-2021||Vijay Mohan||Hike in aviation security fee for domestic, international passengers at Indian airports||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 23The Civil Aviation Ministry has enhanced the rates of aviation security fee (ASF) charged from domestic as well as international passengers from April 1 onwards. The increase comes about six months after the ASF rates were revised.“Aviation Security Fee for domestic passengers will be levied at the rate of Rs 200 per embarking passenger,” orders issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) state. “Aviation Security Fee for international passengers will be levied at the rate of US$ 12 or equivalent Indian Rupees embarking passenger,” the order adds.The new rates will be effective on tickets issued on or after April 1, 2021. Airlines include ASF in airfare at the time of booking tickets and the amount so collected is paid to the government. ASF is used to fund the security arrangement at airports across the country. Given security environment and heavy deployment of forces, considerable expenditure in incurred on this account.In September 2020, the ASF for domestic flyers had been increased to Rs 160 from Rs 150, while for international passengers it went up to US$ 5.20 from of US$ 4.85. The new rates for international travellers are more than double the existing rate.Children under the age of 2 years, holders of diplomatic passports, airlines crew on duty, persons travelling on official duty on aircraft operated by the IAF, persons travelling on official duty on United Nations peacekeeping missions, passengers in transit of transfer or those departing from any airport due to involuntary re-routing because of technical problem or weather conditions are exempted from paying ASF.In India, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is responsible for security at most airports under the regulatory framework of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security in the Ministry of Civil Aviation. CISF formed an Airport Security Group, which supervises the Airport Security Unit deployed at airports. In addition, every domestic airline has its own security group who looks after the aircraft security, checked baggage screening and associated tasks.While airports in most parts of the country are facing a high level of threat perception, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had, in 2019, flagged several loopholes in the aviation security establishment.Delays in assessment and procurement of major security equipment, shortage in the deployment of Central Industrial Security Force personnel and non-availability of aviation security trained personnel were among issues raised by CAG.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hike-in-aviation-security-fee-for-domestic-international-passengers-at-indian-airports-229429

It was indeed unusual,” she said of Dr Singh’s intervention during the debate while she appreciated Bittu for “taking care of the Opposition”, in a reference to the Ludhiana MP being made the new Leader of Opposition for the ongoing Budget Session as Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury is busy with the West Bengal Assembly elections.Sitharaman began her reply to the Finance Bill by stating that it was a “very much pleasing experience to have a member from the Opposition benches recognising some of the good work done by the government.Dr Singh went into the details of the Finance Bill and pointed out areas where appropriate action was taken although he also had points where he thought the government could have done differently,” she said.“I was pleasantly surprised that for a change there was recognition from the Opposition benches,” she remarked amidst laughter.However, Dr Singh’s speech praised a few aspects only in passing while in the main he criticised the government’s overall approach.The biggest worry was the speed with which inequality was increasing, pointed out the Fatehgarh Sahib MP, while not thinking much of the government’s claim that the economy will rebound with great vigour.“Having fallen so much, rebound is bound to happen but when will it reach the 2019-20 GDP figures?” he asked.The steady rise of borrowings suggested a problem in revenue collection. “You said I spent and spent. But the truth is you could not collect taxes,” he said while pointing out that in 2020-21, GST collection was short by Rs 1.75 lakh crore, corporation tax was less by Rs 2.35 lakh crore, income tax by Rs 1.8 lakh crore though excise collection increased by Rs 1 lakh crore.Moreover, 24 per cent of the revenue is from cess and surcharges which the Centre does not share with the states.“We should see cooperation somewhere,” he proposed. Dr Singh also cast doubts over the government being able to meet its disinvestment targets.Dr Singh wanted Fatehgrah Sahib to be made into an international tourist destination, wanted a rail link to Raikot and raised the GST woes of entrepreneurs in Mandi Gobindgarh, Khanna, Doraha and Sahiwal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-encouraging-inequality-with-tax-breaks-to-rich-mp-amar-singh-229425
23-03-2021||Satya Prakash||SC to hear Mumbai ex-CP Param Bir Singh’s plea for CBI probe against Deshmukh on Wednesday||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 23Amid a political storm over former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations of corruption against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, the Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear his petition seeking an “unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair” CBI probe into alleged misdeeds of the embattled NCP politician.Singh’s petition is listed before a Bench of Justice SK Kaul and Justice R Subhash Reddy and is expected to be taken up before lunch on March 24.Singh—who had written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray accusing Deshmukh of “interfering” in investigations – has sought directions to the Maharashtra Government, the Centre and the CBI to immediately take in its custody the CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence.Terming the March 17 order transferring him from the post of Mumbai Police chief before completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years as “arbitrary” and “illegal”, the 1988-batch IPS officer said it was more of a “politically influenced move by certain political parties aggrieved by the revelation of the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the Chief Minister.”He has also urged the court to protect him from any further coercive steps apprehended in retaliation for laying bare Deshmukh’s alleged misdeeds. While denying Singh’s allegations, Deshmukh had issued a press release threatening to initiate defamation proceedings against him.Noting that the Government of Maharashtra has withdrawn the consent for investigations of offences by CBI in the state, he contended that unless directions were issued by the top court, there seemed no possibility of a fair probe into Deshmukh’s corrupt malpractices before the evidence was destroyed.He accused Deshmukh of interfering in various investigations and instructing the police officers to conduct the same in a particular manner as desired by him.“Deshmukh had been holding meetings in February, 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai and Sanjay Patil, ACP Social Service Branch, Mumbai, bypassing their seniors and had instructed them that he had a target to accumulate Rs 100 crore every month and had directed to collect money from various establishments and other sources,” Singh alleged.He said it was reliably learnt that on or about August 24-25, 2020, one Rashmi Shukla, Commissioner Intelligence, State Intelligence Department, had brought to the notice of the Director General of Police, who in turn brought it to the knowledge of the state’s Additional Chief Secretary Home Department, about corrupt malpractices in postings/ transfers by Deshmukh based on telephonic interception. “She was shunted out, rather than taking any firm action against Anil Deshmukh,” Singh alleged.“Such act of Deshmukh in abuse of the official position of the Home Minister, whether in calling and directly instructing the police officers of lower rank such as Vaze or Patil for his malicious intent of extorting money from establishments across Mumbai and from other sources or whether in interfering in the investigations & directing the same to be conducted in a particular manner, or whether indulging in corrupt malpractices in posting /transfers of officers, cannot be countenanced or justified in any democratic State,” Singh alleged.Referring to the February 25, incident near Antilia, residence of businessman Mukesh Ambani, where a car with explosives was found, Singh said the said case was now being investigated by the NIA, and Sachin Vaze, officer of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai had been arrested for custodial interrogation.“All necessary assistance had been rendered by the petitioner’s office and his officers for the conduct of a free and fair investigation by the ATS and the NIA into the Antilia incident. It is not even a case of NIA that the petitioner had in any manner obstructed the free and fair investigation by NIA”, Singh said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-mumbai-ex-cp-param-bir-singhs-plea-for-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh-on-wednesday-229424
23-03-2021||New Delhi||Maratha quota granted by Maharashtra government Constitutional, Centre tells SC||Maharashtra has the legislative competence for granting reservation quota to Marathas and its decision is Constitutional as the 102nd amendment does not denude a state of the power to declare its list of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC), the Centre told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.The 102nd Constitution amendment Act of 2018 inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the National Commission for Backward Class (NCBC), and 342A dealing with power of the President to notify a particular caste as SEBC as also of Parliament to change the list.A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was told by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that in its view the SEBC Act, 2018, of Maharashtra granting reservation to people of the Maratha community in the state in jobs and admissions is Constitutional.“The Centre is of the view that the Maharashtra SEBC Act is constitutional. We construe Article 342A gives enabling role to Central government to determine the SEBC,” Mehta said, adding that the Centre adopts the submissions of Attorney General KK Venugopal and it should be considered as the view of the Union government.On March 18, the AG had told the top court that the 102nd amendment to the Constitution does not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the SEBC and conferring benefits on them.Mehta said that the Article 342A inserted by the amendment is an enabling provision and does not denudes the states of power to declare SEBC.The bench however asked Mehta as to why no notification of SEBCs has been issued to date by the Centre under Article 342A as the President in consultation with the governor has to issue the list.“Will you not make it a dead letter by not issuing the notification for all times to come? Doesn’t it means that there is a blank slate as of now?” the bench asked Mehta, to which he replied that the existing list of SEBC continues. In that case, the existing list of SEBC has to be a part of the Constitution Amendment Act itself, the bench said, adding that it is not clear as of now as to what will be the correct interpretation of Article 342A, and what will be the effect of not having a list. Mehta said that all these questions will be answered when the top court will consider the petition challenging the validity of 102nd Constitution Amendment.The bench said it will hear the submission of Mehta again on this aspect when those petitions are considered.Mehta replied that if the court holds that states are not denuded of power to issue SEBC list after the 102nd amendment, then it may not have to address the question as the amendment act is challenged on the ground that it has taken away the state’s power to issue SEBC list.He said that he would file a written submission to answers various questions on the issue. Senior advocate Manish Singhvi, appearing for the Rajasthan government, said that the determination of SEBC in each state for subject matter(s) covered by List-II and is sole prerogative of the concerned state government.  He said the 1992 Indra Sawahney judgment (also called the Mandal verdict) put cap of 50 per cent on reservation and hence it requires re-consideration by a larger bench. Advocate Manish Singh, appearing for the Bihar government said that since 1993 there are two separate lists of SEBC—one prepared by the Centre for central services and the other by state for state services.“In relation to Bihar the Central list contains 136 castes and State list has 174 castes, for grant of reservation,” he said, adding that the affirmative action by Bihar at its own resources is to be decided by the state and taking away that power would be against the federal structure mandated by Constitution. He said that interpretation of 102nd amendment cannot be made to defeat or limit the legislative powers of the states and 1992 verdict needs to be referred to a larger bench and requires re-consideration in light of changed social dynamics of the society. The arguments in the case remained inconclusive and would resume on Wednesday.On Monday, the top court had said that states should take more steps to promote education and establish institutes for uplifting SEBC as “affirmative action” is not limited to just the reservation and several other things can be done by for this purpose.The top court had earlier sought to know for how many generations would reservations in jobs and education continue and had raised concerns over “resultant inequality” in case the overall 50 per cent limit was to be removed.The apex court is hearing a clutch of pleas challenging the Bombay High Court verdict which had upheld the grant of quota to Marathas in admissions and government jobs in the state. It had on September 9 last year stayed the implementation of legislation and referred to a larger bench the batch of pleas challenging the validity of law, but made it clear that status of those who have availed of the benefits would not be disturbed.The high court, while upholding the law in June 2019, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maratha-quota-granted-by-maharashtra-government-constitutional-centre-tells-sc-229421
23-03-2021||New Delhi||Suspension of scheduled international passenger flights extended till April 30||The coronavirus-induced suspension of scheduled international passenger flights has been extended till April 30, Indian aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Tuesday.“However, international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis,” the DGCA added.Scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral “air bubble” arrangements with selected countries since July.India has formed air bubble pacts with 27 countries, including the US, the UK, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Under an air bubble pact between two countries, special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories.The DGCA circular also said that the suspension does not affect the operation of international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by it.

23-03-2021||Chennai||ISRO demonstrates free space quantum communication||Indian space agency has successfully demonstrated free-space Quantum Communication over a distance of 300 metre with several technologies developed within the country.“For the first time in the country, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has successfully demonstrated free-space Quantum Communication over a distance of 300 metre,” ISRO said.According to ISRO, a number of key technologies were developed indigenously to accomplish this major feat, which included the use of indigenously developed NAVIC receiver for time synchronization between the transmitter and receiver modules, and gimbal mechanism systems instead of bulky large-aperture telescopes for optical alignment.The demonstration has included live video conferencing using quantum-key-encrypted signals.This is a major milestone achievement for unconditionally secured satellite data communication using quantum technologies, ISRO said on Monday.The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology underpins Quantum Communication technology that ensures unconditional data security by virtue of the principles of quantum mechanics, which is not possible with the conventional encryption systems.The conventional cryptosystems used for data-encryption rely on the complexity of mathematical algorithms, whereas the security offered by quantum communication is based on the laws of Physics.Therefore, quantum cryptography is considered as ‘future-proof’, since no future advancements in the computational power can break quantum-cryptosystem, ISRO said.The free-space QKD was demonstrated at Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad, between two line-of-sight buildings within the campus. The experiment was performed at night, in order to ensure that there is no interference of the direct sunlight.For the first time in the country, ISRO has successfully demonstrated free-space Quantum Communication over a distance of 300 m.For details visit: https://t.co/6o5qDoAP1Q pic.twitter.com/9NdNrASQWrThe experiment is a major breakthrough towards ISRO’s goal of demonstrating Satellite Based Quantum Communication (SBQC), where ISRO is gearing up to demonstrate the technology between two Indian ground stations.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-demonstrates-free-space-quantum-communication-229416

So, India has a role not just in Afghanistan but with other regional and international partners,” he underlined.Afghanistan, he said, welcomed all political measures that would reduce tensions between Pakistan and India and resolve their conflicts. “In our view, given the fact we are seeking peace ourselves, we consider it legitimate and necessary for both sides to talk,” Atmar added.Giving an insight into the talks, Atmar said progress had been good so far on the rules of procedure for the negotiations. But there has been no progress on three key aspects – an end to bloodshed, a political settlement consistent with aspirations of all parts of Afghanistan and regional and international peace guarantees for the peace agreement.“Now we are hoping to talk on this as we haven’t been able to discuss it seriously in Doha. To complement that progress, there are discussions in Moscow, Turkey etc. Regardless of the venue, the issues will be these three-four that will provide the framework for the peace and stability.’’On his talks with the Indian leadership, Atmar said the focus was peace talks, economic cooperation and regional connectivity.The two sides did not touch upon India’s approach to the Taliban but both agree that any contact with the militants should be on the condition that it will serve the peace process.“We will continue to work with India on our trade and economic cooperation regardless of the peace process. It has been there for millennia and will be there. We will make sure it happens in a more efficient and beneficial manner,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kabul-seeks-greater-role-for-india-in-peace-process-afghan-fm-229406
23-03-2021||New Delhi||Afghanistan vows to protect its Sikh, Hindu minorities||Describing Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan as "proud citizenry" of his land, the Afghanistan Foreign Minister Hanif Atmar on Tuesday said that it would be the responsibility of the government to provide them with protection and security."We got to do that", he said during a press conference here.Disagreeing with the perception of Hindus and Sikhs being "especially" targetted in Afghanistan, Atmar said: "The violence against Afghans, unfortunately, did not spare our minorities either. So, it is not a kind of persecution against specific minorities per se. It’s the general violence against the entire nation and unfortunately, this part of the population has been disproportionately affected".Last July, India had said it would facilitate a settlement of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan.There are about 1,000 Sikh and Hindus left in Afghanistan, and the sense of insecurity was heightened after the massacre in Gurudwara Guru Har Rai, Kabul, in May last year, followed by the kidnapping of a Sikh Nidan Singh Sachdeva."They are citizens of Afghanistan, and Afghanistan is proud of them. It has been like, that for centuries, and will be like that. It is the responsibility of not just the Afghan government, but the Afghan people too to protect their federal brothers,’’ he declared.Soon after the May 15, 2020, massacre at the Kabul Gurdwara, Democratic Party’s Presidential nominee Joe Biden had promised to raise the annual global refugee admissions cap to 1.25 lakhs if he won the November US Presidential elections.Implicit was the assurance that some quotas would be for Afghanistan’s embattled Sikh community.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghanistan-vows-to-protect-its-sikh-hindu-minorities-229401

India’s abstention was in contrast to the stand taken by other near neighbours of Sri Lanka such as Bangladesh, China, Russia, Pakistan and the Philippines were among those which voted no while Nepal, like India, abstained from the vote.Read also: UNHRC adopts resolution against Sri Lanka’s rights recordYes votes largely came from European countries, Uruguay and Brazil. Japan, which recently lost a container terminal deal in Sri Lanka, abstained from the vote.The resolution against Sri Lanka is for war crimes against Tamils and is among the series of such resolutions UNHRC has been bringing for a decade. India abstained from voting in 2014 and had voted in favour of a similar resolution in 2012.The present draft resolution is based on a report submitted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human rights in January. The report warned that Sri Lanka is “on an alarming path towards recurrence of grave human rights violations” and that “failure to deal with the past continues to have devastating effects on tens of thousands of family members from all communities who persist in seeking justice, reparations and the truth about the fate of their loved ones”.The resolution was tabled by the UNHCR’s Core Group which includes the UK, Germany and Canada and wants sanctions to be imposed on Sri Lanka besides listing certain action points for its government.Ten days before the vote, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had called up PM Narendra Modi who had reiterated the importance of Sri Lanka to India’s Neighbourhood First policy.Tamil parties had called on PM Modi to vote in favour of the resolution but that would have jeopardised the prospects of India building major infrastructure projects as well as provided a breach to China to step in.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-abstains-from-unhrc-vote-on-sri-lanka-229394
23-03-2021||New Delhi||Will discuss bringing petrol, diesel under GST, says FM Nirmala Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharam said her government would discuss bringing petrol and diesel under the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax at the next meeting of the GST Council.Sitharaman, who was addressing the Lok Sabha during a debate on the Finance Bill, 2021, also responded to questions over rising fuel prices.“It’s not only Centre that taxes motor fuel. States do too,” she said— remark that came at a time when her government continues to face the head over rising prices of fuel.Opposition members have been demanding that the government bring down prices of petrol and diesel, which hover at a historic high following a relentless increase in rates over the past nine months. There have been calls by opposition parties as well as sections of society to the government to reduce excise duty to ease consumer pain.Participating in the debate on the Finance Bill 2021 in the Lok Sabha, Supriya Sule (NCP) said excise component in the prices of petrol is close to Rs 38 per litre while state value-added tax (VAT) is about Rs 19 per litre in Delhi.The government should consider slashing this high excise duty, she said.She urged the government to bring down prices of petrol, diesel and LPG cylinder.Besides, Sule also raised concern over the pace of disinvestment and privatisation of profit-making public sector entities (PSEs).She also asked the government to reconsider its decision to impose tax on subscribers' contribution over Rs 2.5 lakh Employee's Provident Fund (EPF) and Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF).According to the provisions of the Finance Bill, from April 1, 2021 onwards, the interest on any contribution above Rs 2.5 lakh by an employee to a recognised provident fund is taxable.Ritesh Pandey (BSP) too raised the issue of high prices of petrol and diesel "burning a hole in pocket of the poor"."The government is imposing 48 per cent as excise... and the rising prices of petrol and diesel are hurting the poor very badly," he said."Selling of PSUs and their privatisation will impact reservation policy for Dalits as private companies will not follow reservation policy. Privatisation is going to have a long term impact on poor and Dalits of the country," he added.Equalisation tax is going to make digital payment costly and the government should rethink about this, Pandey said.Nama Nageswara Rao (TRS) too demanded that petrol and diesel prices be reduced.Rao also urged the government to consider lowering the import duty on cotton.The government raised the import duty on cotton from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the Budget 2021-22. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-discuss-bringing-petrol-diesel-under-gst-says-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-229393
23-03-2021||New Delhi||If BJP makes drinking age 25 years in other states, we will make it 30 years in Delhi: AAP||Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Sourabh Bharadwaj on Tuesday said that if the BJP made the minimum age of buying liquor 25 years in party-ruled states, then the AAP would increase it to 30 years in Delhi.   He said that the legal age of drinking alcohol in BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh was 21 years, while in BJP-ruled Goa it was 18 years.Bhardwaj said that the BJP was speaking against the decision to lower the drinking age in order to protect black markets and financial misappropriation.  He claimed that when youths under 21 years go to restaurants and pubs, police extorts money from restaurant owners which then makes its way to the "top"."By our decision, this malpractice will be stopped and that is why BJP is upset," Bhardwaj said.He said that BJP leaders should ask the central government to bring a law which makes the age of drinking 25 years in the whole country as this will bring uniformity. "I am surprised to see the hypocrisy of the BJP. Till now no one has seen such hypocrisy in any political party. It is very clear that the BJP is shameless. Within the BJP-ruled states, the legal of liquor consumption is 21 years from many years. It is 21 years in dozens of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh. The BJP has ruled for 15 years in Goa, where the legal age is 18 years," he said "I challenge Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and LOP Shri Ramvir Bidhuri to bring this age back to 25 years in the BJP ruled states, then we will make it 30 years," Bhardwaj said.This is BJP's attempt to steal revenue and protect black marketing, he alleged. The Delhi Cabinet on Monday approved a new excise policy lowering the minimum age for consumption of liquor to 21 years from 25 years, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced.The opposition on Monday hit out at the AAP government for lowering the drinking age, claiming the new excise policy will make the city the "capital of intoxicants".The Delhi BJP president said he and his party leaders will meet Lt Governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday to protest the new excise policy."The new policy will not only lead to (sale of) spurious liquor and promote crime but will also spoil youngsters as the legal age for drinking has been lowered from 25 to 21 years."The right thing would have been for the government to tighten liquor policy to make Delhi safe for women and keep youngsters away from the liquor," Gupta said in a statement. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-bjp-makes-drinking-age-25-years-in-other-states-we-will-make-it-30-years-in-delhi-aap-229391

23-03-2021||New Delhi||Light rain in Delhi-NCR, temperature to rise by weekend||The National Capital and its neighbouring areas witnessed light rain coupled with thunderstorm on Tuesday afternoon, providing much-needed relief to the people from the rising mercury levels.According to Kuldeep Srivastava, the Head of India Meteorological Department's (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, a western disturbance is behind the sudden rain, thunderstorm and increase in wind speed.The western disturbance is a cyclonic storm that originates in the Mediterranean Sea and travels across Central Asia. When it comes in contact with the Himalayas, it brings rains to the hills and the plains.However, the respite will be short-lived. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 31-degree Celsius on Tuesday, which will rise to 37-degree Celsius by March 28. The  last time the city received rain and thunderstorm was on March 12.The IMD has predicted partly cloudy sky for Wednesday. The temperature will, however, be constant.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said that the rainfall has contributed to the improvement of air quality in the national capital, where the Air Quality Index (AQI) stood in the 'poor' category at 245 micrograms per cubic metre."Better ventilation and washout are likely to influence AQI positively. AQI is likely to marginally improve to the lower end of the 'moderate' category on Wednesday.

I am a devoted party activist and a social worker. My sole aim is to develop our area. I am fighting the election for the first time and for this I have borrowed Rs 30,000 from my friends. I will return the money in installments,” Sardar told PTI when contacted.Stating that he had to convince seniors in the party to give him a ticket to fight the election in Purulia assembly constituency, Sardar said he was confident of winning despite “feeling the pinch in pocket.”“Purulia has been neglected by all political parties and there has been no development.  Drinking water and proper sanitation have long been a problem here. I will work for overall development ... I am getting a good response from the people,” he said.His party colleague Anadi Tudu, who also has reported “zero assets”, is contesting the election from Balarampur also in Purulia district.Talking to PTI from her constituency, the 52-year-old Tudu said: “Money cannot stop you from achieving dreams to do good for the people.

Both BJP and the TMC are spending huge amounts in this election compared to which we are spending almost nothing. But we have deep rooted connections with common people. They know what our motto is.”“People in Patashpur are tired of corruption. They are questioning why youth are jobless, what has happened to Amphan relief money we are working for the cause of the people of Patashpur. We want to set up a women’s college here, develop the infrastructure,” Giri said.The first phase of the elections in West Bengal are scheduled in 30 assembly constituencies in five districts of Purulia, Bankura, Jhargram, Purba Medinipur (Part 1) and Paschim Medinipur (Part 1) on March 27. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/money-no-constraint-in-bengals-electoral-battle-229382

It has been observed that it is largely due to laxity in the observance of COVID-appropriate behaviour by people especially in crowded places," he said.   Keeping in view the fresh surge in cases and upcoming festivals as well as the Maha Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, it will be important to ensure compliance of the guidelines and to strictly enforce COVID-appropriate behaviour, such as wearing masks and hygiene and social distancing by people. "I would, therefore, urge all district magistrates, state government organisations and other stakeholders to take necessary measures for creating awareness among people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour and simultaneously take necessary action for its strict enforcement to overcome the pandemic. "Necessary orders, guidelines issued by various departments of Government of India, state government and respective district administration in this regard, should be widely disseminated to the public and to the tehsil, block and village level functionaries for implementation," he said. Soon after taking over as Uttarakhand chief minister, Tirath Singh Rawat had said there will be no restrictions on devotees gathering in Haridwar for the Kumbh. Rawat himself tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday and has been in isolation at home. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-govt-asks-people-to-follow-covid-appropriate-behaviour-229376

Sometimes, the number would go up to 300 in a day."I used to sleep in the car or used to take some rest during day time. The routine used to be so frantic. I would literally run from house to house or society to society after a positive case of Covid would get reported. And, then I had to ferry the samples to designated labs in good time," he said.Asked how many samples he has taken so far, he claims, "It should be in excess of 30,000." Saha still vividly remembers the days of the COVID-19-induced lockdown in the country.In this tough period, while performing his duty he faced rudeness from a few people, but he says the "positive spirit to serve humanity" overpowered the "negative episodes"."I was willing to go and collect samples despite the rising number of cases. Our jawans fight in inhospitable terrains for the country, and this was also a nation's call for duty, and I responded," he told PTI.Saha said he had to ferry samples kept in ice boxes to any of the three designated testing centres in Haryana, whichever would be the nearest."So, in the initial days, I used to collect samples and deposit them at PGI Rohtak, Kalpana Chawla Medical College, Karnal or the government medical college at Khanpur in Sonipat. Each centre could take at max 100 samples a day only. It was exhausting to travel throughout the day in hot summer, especially in a PPE kit," he recalled.After three months, a few more lab technicians "joined work" and it eased the burden a bit, he said."During Independence Day celebrations last year, it felt humbling that the Haryana government acknowledged my efforts, and I was felicitated at a function," he added.The first case of COVID-19 in Delhi was reported on March 1 when a businessman from east Delhi who had returned from Italy tested positive for the new virus that had left the world puzzled and in a grip of extreme fear.Nearly one year ago, Haryana had reported its first COVID-19 case in Gurugram, and soon in the rest of the state that neighbours Delhi.A nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Centre from March 25 onwards, as people were confined to their homes, while the infected ones were traced and isolated by health authorities.Saha recalls several incidents during the lockdown when human vulnerabilities and want of empathy came to the fore at a time when many people in their own families were afraid to go near each other."Once I had to collect a sample of a doctor who had got infected and was quarantined in a hotel. She was finding it difficult to fight loneliness and requested if I could shared a cup of tea with her. I could have refused but, then I thought, if I sat with her, her traumatised mind will get some relief. It was the only human option I felt I had," he said.Asked if he was scared to share a cup of tea with her, he said, "No"."I have never been scared, and during my job so far, I have undergone COVID-19 test for nearly 30 times, and thankfully, all of those had come negative," the lab technician said.Asked about his daily regimen in the initial days of the lockdown, he said, the day use to begin at about 7:30 AM and since he had to ferry samples to centres as well, it would be way past midnight on many days."I used to change my PPE kit at regular intervals, sometimes using 3-4 in a day. It was faith that kept us all going, otherwise the pandemic had already taken a toll on mental well-being of people, in and out of homes," the Malda native said.Asked if he isolated himself from his family during the lockdown period, he said, "I live alone in Gurugram, my wife and my young daughter are back in Malda. I had met them last in October 2018. In 2019, I could not visit home for some other reasons, then the pandemic broke out. I reunited with them late February this year." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-lab-technician-recalls-uncertain-days-and-frantic-pace-of-work-during-covid-lockdown-229362
23-03-2021||Mumbai/New Delhi||CBI probe into police postings racket can spell more trouble for Maharashtra CM, Deshmukh||Reeling under pressure from the Vazegate, the Maha Vikas Aghadi(MVA) government in Maharashtra faces yet another charge of grave corruption relating to transfer-posting racket of top IPS officers.The Union Home Ministry, the cadre controlling authority of Indian Police Service (IPS) in the country, is expected to initiate a CBI probe into the transfer and posting racket of senior police officials which can give sleepless nights to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, accused of hushing up a probe by BJP.Former Chief Minister and present Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, who broke the racket story during a press conference in Mumbai would be handing over the sensitive audio recordings relating to postings racket in the state to Union Home Ministry in New Delhi on Tuesday evening.Fadnavis said that the recordings and names of concerned IPS officers and powerful men involved in the racket were known to Thackeray, however, the chief minister chose to hush up the case instead of taking action."What's more surprising is the fact that CM (Uddhav Thackeray) transferred the Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla who unearthed the racket flourishing in Mumbai."I have the sensitive recordings which nail the men in power but I would not share it with the public. I will hand over these recordings to the Union Home Secretary in Delhi," Fadnavis said.The Commissioner of State Intelligence (COI) Rashmi Shukla has informed the Maharashtra DGP, Subodh Kumasr Jaiswal, on August 25, 2020, that a network of brokers had emerged in Mumbai having political connections."They are engaged in arranging desired postings for police officers in exchange for monetary connections," Rashmi Shukla's letter revealed. The COI had sought permission from the concerned authorities to place the telephone numbers of the brokers under surveillance.The COI informed the DGP of the surveillance of the phone numbers which corroborated the charges relating to transfer and posting racket.The COI letter also revealed that several high ranking IPS officers were in contact with power brokers active in Mumbai. Transcripts of telephonic conversations in a sealed cover were also handed over to the DGP.Fadnavis revealed that the DGP had sent the entire transcripts, exposing the network of power brokers, to Thackeray.Instead of allowing the COI to register a case of corruption, the CM sent the report along with the transcripts to Deshmukh, informed Fadnavis.Sources said that once CBI would be given the probe of transfer and posting racket, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra would be in deep trouble as the case attracts the provision of Anti-Corruption Act against powerful people in government.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-probe-into-police-postings-racket-can-spell-more-trouble-for-maharashtra-cm-deshmukh-229359

23-03-2021||New Delhi||BJP's Bhupender Yadav takes on the Congress in Rajya Sabha||The imposition of the 1975-National Emergency by the then Indira Gandhi regime at the Centre hangs like Albatross around the neck of the Congress.Its opponents make the issue rise like the proverbial Phoenix, apparently to embarrass it at a time and place of their choosing, much to the chagrin of the party.A case in point was when BJP Member in Rajya Sabha and senior party leader Bhupender Yadav reminded the Congress Members in the House on Monday that during its entire 75-years of implementation, the Constitution was disrupted and made dysfunctional by the national Emergency in 1975.Taking part in the discussion on the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the House, Yadav said that Constitutional norms were demolished during the Emergency.The BJP had fielded Yadav, who is its OBC face, into the discussion immediately after the Leader of the Opposition and Congress heavyweight Mallikarjun Kharge had his say.Kharge said that the government had ill-intention concerning reservations to the down-trodden, including the SCs and STs.He further said that the Bill under discussion was timed in Rajya Sabha by the government with the forthcoming Assembly election in Tamil Nadu.The Bill sought to bring seven SC subcastes in Tamil Nadu under one nomenclature in the Constitution.Launching a counter to Kharge, Yadav said that the development of all sections of the society based on equity, justice and egalitarianism was one of the organising principles of the BJP.In contrast, Congress has always maintained double-speak and hypocrisy. It has been averse to the welfare of SCs and reservations, he added.He said the Dalit icon Dr BR Ambedkar was bestowed with "Bharat Ratna"- the country's highest award only-only when Congress was out of power.Also, the Mandal Commission's recommendations for reservations to the OBCs was when it was out of power. It had sat on the recommendation for years.The BJP-led government gave Constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes.Also, it gave reservations to economically weaker sections of the society while keeping the benefits to the SCs, STs and OBCs intact.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-bhupender-yadav-takes-on-the-congress-in-rajya-sabha-229354
23-03-2021||Satya Prakash||SC issues notice to Centre on PILs seeking compensation for victims of wrongful prosecution||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 23The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice to the Centre on petitions filed by two Delhi BJP leaders seeking compensation for a rape accused from Uttar Pradesh who walked free after spending 20 years in jail as the Allahabad High Court found him innocent.A Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit asked the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Law and Justice to respond to the petitions filed by Delhi BJP leaders Kapil Mishra and Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay after senior Advocate Vijay Hansaria highlighted the plight of victims of wrongful prosecution.The petitioners have urged the top court to frame guidelines to ensure strict action to prosecute fake complainants’ payment of adequate compensation to victims of malicious and wrongful prosecution.At the outset, the Bench said the existing mechanism under criminal law was good enough to deal with the issue. However, later it agreed to examine only the prayer with regard to framing guidelines for grant of compensation to such victims.Mishra and Upadhyay have raised the case of Vishnu Tiwari of a village in Lalitpur district who was booked for rape and offences under the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 after a Dalit woman accused him of sexually assaulting her. The trial court had pronounced him guilty and awarded life imprisonment.However, the Allahabad High Court recently acquitted him, holding that the victim’s testimony was found trustworthy and the medical evidence belied any case against the accused. The high court expressed anguish over Tiwari’s prolonged incarceration and the government's failure to recommend his case for remission of sentence or to commute it.They contended that SC/ST Act was being "abused by filing false and malicious complaints and no action is taken against the culprit in the absence of an effective statutory/legal scheme for providing mandatory compensatory relief and to prosecute the fake complainants."Noting that false cases often lead to suicides of innocent men, they submitted that the State was responsible for such acts of its employees (Police and Prosecution) and must repair the damage done to citizens by its officers, by adequate monetary and non-monetary compensation.Lives of the families of those falsely implicated in such cases were destroyed after years of delayed trial, which only got aggravated by reluctance to take penal action against misconduct of investigating officers and vexatious complainants, Mishra contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pils-seeking-compensation-for-victims-of-wrongful-prosecution-229353
23-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||'Tax relief only to the rich', Congress opens debate on Finance Bill in Lok Sabha||Tribune News serviceNew Delhi, March 23Opposition Congress on Tuesday opened the debate on the Finance Bill 2021 in the Lok Sabha accusing the government of offering tax relief only to the rich while burdening the poor and the middle class with repeated raise in petrol and diesel prices.Initiating the debate, Fatehgarh Saheb MP (Congress) Amar Singh urged Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to withdraw the excise duty on petrol and diesel and roll back customs duty hikes on nuts, bolts, electronic toys and rail projects.The Congress MP demanded urban MNREGA, withdrawal of farm laws and mapping of Covid-induced losses in the informal sector noting that the unorganised sector formed 60 per cent of the economy and employed lakhs of people and was the hardest hit by the pandemic.“It is another matter if you have decided to punish the farmers who ensured that of the eight core sectors of the economy only agriculture grew during Covid times. Otherwise you should withdraw the farm laws and raise budgets for agriculture which you have cut,” Singh said after the FM presented the Bill to seek permission of the House to give effect to budget proposals for FY 2021-2022.The Congress MP said the government waived Rs 1.5 lakh crore of corporate tax last year while the poor are being burdened with fuel price rise.“Your tax collections have also reduced. You collected 1.25 lakh crore lesser GST in 2020-21; Rs 2.4 lakh crore lesser corporation tax while excise duty rose by Rs 1 lakh crore. Tax relief has been only for the rich. Roll back excise duty on fuel,” Singh said cautioning the government against centralisation of taxes.The MP said the government had raised cess and surcharge so much that 24 per cent of its revenue was now coming from these sources. “But the Centre is not sharing this revenue with the states which have not even got their GST compensation. The states are heavily strained,” Amar Singh noted, referring to CAG’s observations on how cess revenues were hardly being used for the purpose they are levied.The MP also doubted that the government could achieve its listed Rs 1.75 lakh crore of disinvestment target and demanded higher budgets for health, noting that the bracketing of budget of several sectors under health would not help in Covid years.“The Ministry of Health budget at BE 2020-21 stage was Rs 65,012 crore which you raised by Rs 13,000 crore at the revised estimate stage but again brought to Rs 71,269 crore in the BE for 2021-22. This must increase. Even the finance commission grants which you have shown under the health budget this year are actually meant for five years,” he said.The MP flagged how private hospitals in Punjab fleeced people charging them up to Rs 15 lakh per patient during COVID and how the government health system came to the rescue of people.Singh demanded higher wages for ASHAs who, he said, did a great job with contact tracing during COVID.The MP also demanded restoration of MPLADS scheme suspended due to COVID.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tax-relief-only-to-the-rich-congress-opens-debate-on-finance-bill-in-lok-sabha-229352

A Committee of Secretaries headed by the Cabinet Secretary has been set up to develop the broad contours of the DTC framework, under which DCT to farmers can be implemented. The committee in its meeting on January 16, 2020, had recommended the constitution of Nodal Committee to be co-chaired by Secretaries of Department of Fertilizers and Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare to formulate and implement Direct Cash Transfer in Fertilizers," said the Fertilizer Minister Sadanand Gowda during the question and answer session in Lok Sabha.He added that the nodal committee has held two meetings, but no decision has been taken yet for implementation of Direct Cash Transfer of fertilizer subsidy to farmers.The government also said that the Department of Fertilizers has constituted Chintan Shivir Working Group on Direct Benefit Transfer to farmers under the chairmanship of the Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers.“The working group has been tasked to examine the feasibility of introducing a direct fertilizer subsidy transfer to farmers, criteria for selection of farmers and their entitlement, criteria for determining the amount of subsidy to be transferred to farmers’ accounts and periodicity of subsidy transfer. It has held several meetings with all the stakeholders. But a final decision is yet to be taken,” said Gowda.Answering a question by Bathinda MP as to which stakeholders the Centre had consulted from Punjab, and what the view of the Punjab government was on the matter, Gowda said: “Consultations have been held nationally in all states including Punjab. It is only after we finalise the issue and take some decision that I will be able to tell you what the Punjab government view is.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-decision-yet-on-direct-transfer-of-fertilizer-subsidy-to-farmers-govt-229351

The study also analysed the levels at which the risks of online gaming outweigh the benefits for children.The pandemic has forced children to find alternative at-home activities to pursue. It has led to an increase in online gaming activities.The study involved 429 parents, including working professionals, homemakers, retirees, and entrepreneurs. The study, conducted across parents of children in various age groups, such as toddlers, preschoolers, pre-teens, adolescents, and adults.As many as 65% of the parents have played online games themselves and understand why their children play online games.According to the study, 48% of the parents believe online gaming is a great way to socialise.The study makes it clear that the vast majority of Indian parents do come from a place of empathy. About 65% were themselves online gamers and understand why their kids play online games. It reveals that 83% of the parents who are entrepreneurs, strongly feel that online gaming can be beneficial for their kids. Most entrepreneurs play skilled games like sudoku to develop their skills in sharpening their brain and develop their strategic thinking.

Overall, practising good gaming hygiene can make online gaming a stressbuster for children and parents."In this age of digital outreach, it's no surprise that the amount of time towards online gaming has increased. It is even more so now because of the real-life experience and the advent of AR/VR. But everything has its set limit of dosage. There needs to be the right balance in terms of how much parents need to allow their kids to play online games. The right mix of time and conversation with kids will bring in positive outcomes," said Richa Singh, Cofounder and CEO, YourDost.

23-03-2021||Mumbai||Stan Swamy had conspired with Maoists to overthrow govt: Court||The special NIA court that refused bail to 83-year-old Jesuit priest and activist Stan Swamy in the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case has held that prima facie Swamy had hatched a "serious conspiracy" with members of a banned Maoist organisation to create unrest in the country and to overthrow government.Special judge DE Kothalikar, who rejected Swamy's bail plea on Monday, said in his order, which was made available on Tuesday, that based on the material on record it seemed Swamy was a member of a banned Maoist organisation.The material that the court referred to included around "140 e-mails between the applicant (Swamy) and his co-accused," the fact that Swamy and others he communicated with, were referred to as "comrades", and that Swamy had received Rs eight lakh from one comrade, Mohan, allegedly for the furtherance of Maoist activities."Prima facie it can be gathered that the applicant alongwith other members of the banned organisation hatched a serious conspiracy to create unrest in the entire country and to overpower the Government, politically and by using muscle power," Judge Kothalikar said in his order."The material placed on record thus prima facie denote that the applicant was not only the member of banned organisation CPI (Maoist) but he was carrying out activities further in the objective of the organisation which is nothing but to overthrow the democracy of the nation," the order read.Swamy was arrested from Ranchi in October, 2020, and has since been lodged at the Taloja Central Jail in Navi Mumbai.The judge also refused to take into the account a published report of alleged tampering with the computer of Swamy's co-accused in the case, Rona Wilson.He said that raising questions on the authenticity of the evidence in the case would amount to interference with the court proceedings."It is well known that present proceeding is sub judice. Therefore, making any comments as to the evidence to be placed before the Court would amount to interference in the administration of justice. In fact, such act is required to be deprecated," the order said.Swamy had applied for bail in November last year both on medical grounds and on merits.He had said in his plea that he suffered from Parkinson's disease, and had lost hearing in both his ears.Swamy had also argued that while in the Taloja prison, he had to be shifted to the prison hospital owing to his ill health.Swamy's lawyer Sharif Shaikh had told the special court that the activist was not a flight risk and will not jump bail.Swamy also said in his plea that his name was not even part of the original FIR but was added in the remand application in 2018 by the police as a suspected accused.Shaikh argued that the NIA had failed to find anything incriminating against Swamy in the raids conducted at his home in Ranchi.The court, however, held the fact that Swamy had not been named in the initial FIR, did nto entitle him to any relief.On his health condition, the judge cited previous Supreme Court judgements to hold that given the seriousness of the allegations made against Swamy, the "collective interest of the community would outweigh Swamy's right to personal liberty"."As such the old age and or alleged sickness of the applicant would not go in his favour," the judge said.Special Public Prosecutor Prakash Shetty, who appeared for the National Investigation Agency (NIA), had opposed Swamy's bail application, saying he was involved with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist).Shetty had told the court that Swamy was a staunch supporter of organisations such as 'Vistapan Virodhi Jan Vikas Andolan' and 'People's Union for Civil Liberties' which were involved in activities for the CPI (Maoists).Judge Kothalikar accepted the prosecution's submissions saying they had "substance"."Upon cumulative consideration of all the aforesaid circumstances as well as law on the subject, I conclude that the applicant has failed to make out a case for grant of bail," the judge said.The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the 'Elgar Parishad' conclave held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which police suspect triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon- Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the city.Varavara Rao,Wilson and some other activists are being tried at a special court here after the NIA took over probe.The Pune police had claimed that the conclave was backed by outlawed Maoist groups. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stan-swamy-had-conspired-with-maoists-to-overthrow-govt-court-229345

I had suggested alternatives 10 years ago but alas...,” he said on Twitter with regard to the project.Speaking on the occasion of the launch of "Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain" when the MoU was signed, Modi described it as "historic".He said a major step has also been taken for the Ken-Betwa Link Canal and added this "agreement is important to realize the vision and dream of Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee for interlinking of rivers."Modi further said that the agreement will be in the interest of millions of families of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.The much-awaited Ken-Betwa link canal project is the first project of the National Perspective Plan for the interlinking of rivers.The two rivers will be interlinked with about 220 KM canal and will benefit the Bundelkhand region which consists of 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ken-betwa-river-linking-project-becomes-subject-of-wrangle-229341
23-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra ATS impounds high-end car from Daman in connection with Hiran murder case||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has impounded a high-end car from Daman in connection with the Mansukh Hiran murder case, an official said on Tuesday.The Volvo car with the Maharashtra registration number was impounded on Monday, the official said, adding that there is no clarity so far on who owned this car.The car is kept at the ATS office in Thane neighbouring Mumbai, he said.After arresting two persons on Saturday night in connection with the murder case, the ATS detained a person from Gujarat who had allegedly provided them SIM cards, officials had said, adding that they recovered many SIM cards from the person.The ATS last week arrested suspended policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gaur in the case.The SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai on February 25 had been allegedly stolen from possession of Hiran, the Thane-based businessman whose body was found in a creek in Mumbra on March 5.The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case of recovery of the explosives-laden SUV and arrested Mumbai Police officer Sachin Waze, had impounded five high-end cars during its probe -- two Mercedes, one Prado, the Scorpio which was used to carry explosives, and an Innova.The ATS had said that Waze was also a prime accused in the Hiran murder case.The NIA suspects that at least three of the impounded five cars were used by Waze, who was posted as Assistant Police Inspector (API) with the Crime Intelligence Unit when arrested on March 13. He was later suspended from service.On Monday morning, the ATS team took accused Shinde to the residence of Waze in Thane and later to the creek in Mumbra where Hiran's body was found.Though the Hiran murder case was transferred to the NIA on March 20, the ATS is still conducting investigation.The ATS had lodged a murder case under Section 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against unidentified persons and on Saturday his murder case was handed over to NIA for further probe, the official added.

23-03-2021||Washington||Biden Admin proposes 18-month delay in calculating prevailing wages of H-1B and other visas||The Biden Administration has proposed an 18-month delay in the effective date of a final rule on calculating the prevailing wages of certain immigrants and non-immigrant workers, including those on the popular H-1B visas.The proposed delay will provide the Department of Labour with sufficient time to consider the rule's legal and policy issues thoroughly and issue an upcoming Request for Information and gather public comments on the sources and methods for determining prevailing wage levels, an official release said following the announcement on Monday.This proposed rule follows an initial 60-day delay announced earlier this month. The department based that action on a January 20, 2021, White House memo, the media release said.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The Department of Labour in its federal notification published earlier this month said that it is considering whether to propose a further delay of the final rule's effective date and accompanying implementation periods.The Department proposed to delay is in accordance with the Presidential directive as expressed in the memorandum of January 20, 2021, from the Assistant to the  President and Chief of Staff, entitled “Regulatory Freeze Pending Review.” The Department invited written comments from the public for 15 days on  the proposed delay of effective date. All comments had to be received by February 16, 2021.Published in January 2021, the final rule affects employers seeking to employ foreign workers on a permanent or temporary basis through certain immigrant visas or through H-1B, H-1B1 and E-3 non-immigrant visas, the Department of Labour said.While the E3 visa is one for which only citizens of Australia are eligible, the H-1B1 visa is for the people from Singapore and Chile.The proposed delay will also give agency officials sufficient time to compute and validate prevailing wage data covering specific occupations and geographic areas, complete necessary system modifications and conduct public outreach.The rule is a carry-over from the Trump administration, which had proposed revisions mandatory salaries after losing a court battle to organisations including the Bay Area Council over an initial version.If imposed, workers on the H-1B at the lowest wage level would have to receive at least the 35th percentile of the prevailing wage for their job type and location, compared to the 45th percentile in the initial version. Workers at the highest wage level would have to receive the 90th percentile, compared to the 95th percentile.According to the Department of Labour, the proposed rule's delay in effective date will result in the reduction of transfer payments in the form of higher wages from employers to H-1B employees.Additionally, the proposed rule would delay the potential for deadweight losses to occur in the event that requiring employers to pay a wage above what H-1B workers are willing to accept results in H-1B caps not to be met, it said.The Department has observed that the annual H-1B cap was reached within the first five business days each year from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2020.“While the Department expects that the increase in wages may incentivise some employers to substitute domestic workers for H-1B employees, provided that domestic workers are available for the jobs, it is likely that the same number of H-1B visas will be allotted within the annual caps in the future,” it said.To calculate the reduction of transfer payments the Department considered the transfer payments of the Final Rule as the baseline and shifted them according to the proposed rule's new transition effective dates, it said.

George whose party does not belong to any political front.While the Left led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, is trying to create electoral history by becoming the first sitting government to retain office, the Congress-led UDF is trying to wrest power and the BJP's priority is to retain the lone seat that they won last time, though they claim that they would better their performance this time.While Vijayan expects the results of the local body polls, held in December 2020, will repeat itself when it managed to retain the edge that they had in the 2015 local body polls, the UDF is expecting a repeat of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when it won 19 out of the 20 seats.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-polls-2-74-cr-voters-to-decide-fate-of-957-candidates-229322

23-03-2021||Washington||India's envoy urges corporate sector to help realise full potential of India-US relationship||India's top diplomat in the United States urged the corporate sector to help realise the full potential of the India-US relationship that, he said, has witnessed the strength of bipartisan support under the Biden administration.India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said this would create value for companies and jobs for people."If there is one message that I have for all of you today that is please help us realise the full potential of this relationship," Sandhu said in his address at the annual full board of directors meeting of the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF)."Your efforts will bring in, of course, value to your companies, money for your shareholders, benefits for your customers, jobs for the people and in a much larger plane, strategic strength to our two nations. India and US' relationship can only be strong if you are strong and if you make us strong," he said.Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen, USISPF chairman John Chambers, Cohen Group CEO William Cohen, FedEx president Rajesh Subramanian were among the attendees.Complimenting the USISPF for its extraordinary work to bring India and the US together, Sandhu said that 10 significant events that had happened in the last 10 days signified the truly multi-faceted partnership between India and the US."First and foremost is the Quad Leaders Summit. This was the first Summit of Quad at the leaders' level. This was also one of the first international summits hosted by the US that was held after President Biden took over. It was historic in many ways," he said.The summit put forth three practical areas of cooperation: vaccine manufacturing and delivery, critical and emerging technologies, and climate change, he said.The Quad vaccine initiative aims to utilise the strengths of each partner - India's manufacturing capacity, US technology, Japanese financing and Australia's logistics capability - to manufacture vaccines and export them amongst Indo-Pacific countries, he added."Second is the successful visit of Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin to India, the first in-person visit since the new administration took office," Sandhu said.Third, the special forces’ bilateral exercise, 'Vajra Prahar', just concluded in India this weekend signifying increasing military-to-military cooperation.Fourth, India and the US launched a bilateral initiative on artificial intelligence last week under the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum.Fifth, Apple started manufacturing iPhones in India.Sixth, India has resumed imports of apples from the US. The issue was stuck for a while because of certification and was sorted out just four days back."This also reflects the maturity of our two democracies to resolve issues and challenges," Sandhu said.Seventh is Ocugen, a biopharma company based in Pennsylvania, announcing that it would approach the FDA for emergency use authorisation of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by their partner in India, Bharat Biotech. They hope to be the fourth COVID vaccine to be allowed in the US, which will also complement other vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, he said.Eighth, the US became India's second-largest supplier of oil overtaking Middle Eastern countries."Ninth, again this will interest many of you, the Indian Space Research Organisation, what we call ISRO, shipped the radar payload made in India to NASA, for the world's first earth observation satellite with two different radars, which will give very high-resolution images for a variety of space applications," Sandhu said."After integration with their own radar payload here by NASA, it will be sent back to India and the NISAR-NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite will be launched later by ISRO. This will be an important milestone," he said."Tenth, Indian students continued to be the second-largest group in the US by the country of origin as per the latest ICE figures despite the pandemic," he added.India, Sandhu said, is currently unrolling the largest vaccination programme in the world and is confident that as life returns to some version of the normal, the V-shaped economic recovery would pick up.

23-03-2021||Washington||Biden admn urges US court to certify India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana||The Biden administration has urged a federal court to certify India's request to extradite Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian, in his submission before a federal US court in Los Angeles, said Rana, 59, meets all the criteria to be extradited to India for his trial in the Mumbai terrorist attack. On February 4, Rana's attorney had opposed his extradition.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian has scheduled the extradition hearing for April 22."The United States respectfully requests that following the April 22, 2021, extradition hearing, the Court certify India's request for Rana's extradition for the Secretary of State's surrender decision," Lulejian said in his 61-page court submission on Monday.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India."Fugitive Tahawwur Hussain Rana is wanted in India to stand trial for offences related to his role in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, that resulted in the death of 166 people, the injury of 239 people, and the damage to property in excess of USD 1.5 billion," Lulejian said.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding.Lulejian said the criteria warranting certification of extradition are satisfied in this case.These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.India's extradition request contains evidence to establish probable cause that the individual appearing in court is the fugitive who committed the offence for which extradition is requested, Lulejian argued.In his court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.Lulejian said that the court should find that Rana's extradition is not barred under Article 6 of the India-US Extradition Treaty. Although there is ample evidence that Rana aided and abetted the Mumbai attack, he claims that he should not be extradited because probable cause is lacking. Rana's claim is based on an improper attempt to attack the credibility of a key witness against him.Rana also does not contest that he is the person who India alleges committed the charged crimes. Instead, he challenges only whether Article 6 of the treaty bars his extradition and whether probable cause exists to believe that he committed the offences for which India requests his extradition, the Assistant US Attorney said.Lulejian said Headley's plea agreement is irrelevant because Rana cannot benefit from its terms. Not only is Rana in a different position than Headley because he did not plead guilty or cooperate with the United States, as is his right, but his inability to benefit from the negotiated terms of Headley's plea agreement is confirmed by the text of the plea agreement itself.He said Rana's extradition proceedings are separate from Headley's criminal proceedings and are being litigated by a different United States attorney's office from the one who negotiated the plea agreement with Headley.According to its very terms, Rana has no rights under Headley's plea agreement and is therefore prohibited from relying on it in an attempt to undermine the United States' position on his extraditability under the treaty, he added."Rana has failed to demonstrate that he cannot be extradited to India as a result of his prior prosecution in the United States," the attorney said.Rana attempts to undermine India's evidence of probable cause by questioning the credibility of the key witness, David Headley. Not only is Rana's challenge improper in this extradition proceeding, but his claims are also not supported by the law or the evidence, Lulejian said.

23-03-2021||New Delhi||Mumbai ex-top cop Param Bir Singh moves Supreme Court, allies back Anil Deshmukh||Former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh on Monday moved the Supreme Court against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, triggering a fresh crisis for the state’s ruling coalition which backed the minister even as the issue rocked Parliament.Param Bir, removed as the Mumbai Police Commissioner five days ago, moved the apex court seeking an “unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair” CBI probe into the allegations of corruption levelled by him against Deshmukh in his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.Param Bir demands CBI probe The former top cop, who had accused Deshmukh of “interfering” in investigations, sought directions to the Maharashtra Government, the Centre and the CBI to immediately take in its custody the CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence. Terming the March 17 order transferring him from the post of Mumbai Police chief before completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years as “arbitrary” and “illegal”, the 1988-batch IPS officer said it was more of a politically influenced move by certain political parties aggrieved by the revelation of the alleged corrupt practices of Deshmukh.Also read: Param Bir Singh's letter dented Maharashtra home department's image: Shiv SenaNCP sees ‘BJP link’ to letter gateNCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged Param Bir Singh met “people in Delhi” before writing the controversial letter to the CM. “We will reveal the truth in some time,” he said.BJP MPs demanded resignations of Uddhav Thackeray and Deshmukh in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, besides a CBI probe into Param Bir’s accusation that Deshmukh had called the now arrested cop Sanjay Waze to his residence in mid-February and ordered extortion worth Rs 100 crore a month.Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar, however, ruled out Deshmukh’s resignation and said there was no Shiv Sena pressure on the NCP to act against the minister.Pawar defended Deshmukh saying he was out of action for most of February due to Covid and, therefore, “the question of his resignation did not arise”. The NCP supremo said, “The extortion allegations were possibly made to divert the entire investigation into the main case about gelatin sticks in an SUV outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence.”Pawar’s claim about Deshmukh’s illness was, however, countered on Twitter by BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis, who posted a video saying the state Home Minister was holding a press conference the day the NCP chief said he was home-quarantined.The Maha Vikas Agadhi had decided to defend Deshmukh after a late night meeting on Sunday at Pawar’s residence in Delhi where the allies concluded that a resignation would be seen as a sign of guilt. The Sena also toned down today after Pawar spoke to Thackeray and both sides said a probe was in order but Deshmukh need not resign as the allegations by Singh were suspect.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-ex-top-cop-param-bir-singh-moves-supreme-court-allies-back-anil-deshmukh-229077

23-03-2021||New Delhi||UAE ‘brokered’ Indo-Pak truce; MEA mum||A Bloomberg news report has claimed that the India-Pakistan ceasefire marked a milestone in “secret talks brokered” by the UAE that began months earlier.The report predicted that the next step in repairing bilateral ties would be the reinstatement of two high commissioners. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has not yet responded to the report, although several clues over the past few months pointed at the UAE’s role.Roadmap to peace?A day after military chiefs from India and Pakistan surprised the world on February 25 with a rare joint commitment to respect a 2003 ceasefire agreement, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah, who then met Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi after a few days. Ties between UAE and India have strengthened during the Modi government to the extent that the former is storing oil in India for use in emergencies.The report, quoting unnamed officials, said the ceasefire was the beginning of a larger roadmap to forge a lasting peace between the neighbours. The next step involves reinstating envoys followed by the “hard part” — talks on resuming trade and a lasting resolution on Kashmir.Last week, Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa asked India “to bury the past and move forward”.Officials, however, said expectations about the current détente achieving much were low.Nevertheless, in another indication of a thaw, PM Narendra Modi posted a tweet on Saturday, wishing his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan after he was diagnosed with Covid. — TNS (with agency inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uae-brokered-indo-pak-truce-mea-mum-229080

We are not amending the Constitution.Criticising the move, Opposition party MPs accused the Modi government of “murdering” the democracy and “damaging” the country’s federal structure.Urging the government to send the Bill to the Select Committee, NCP leader Supriya Sule said: “It (the Kejriwal government) must be doing something right which is why people elected them for three consecutive terms.”Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Chief MinisterBid to wrest powerThe Bill effectively takes away powers from those who were voted by people and giving these to those who were defeated.Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy, however, said no rights were being taken away from the Delhi Government. Insisting that it was not a political move, he said: “The aim is to bring clarity to laws, create a sound government mechanism in Delhi, end ambiguity in running the affairs of the national Capital and enhance accountability.”Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut slammed BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi “for speaking against the Delhi CM who is not a member of the House”. He reminded the House of the Daman and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar, who had named the administrator in his suicide note.AAP MP Bhagwant Mann said: “We are being punished because we did not give permission for stadiums to be used as jails during the farmers’ protests. You cannot run Delhi through dictatorship. The BJP has been out of power for 22-23 years in Delhi and it can’t digest this fact.”Congress’ Manish Tewari and his colleague JS Gill accused the BJP of trying to wrest power in states it lost.Hitting back, Lekhi said the LG had the right to send the Bills to the President. “We have a quasi-federal structure where on some issues the Centre will take precedence. The Centre moved in because it was required,” she said.In ParliamentInsurance Bill raising FDI to 74% clearedThe Parliament on Monday passed the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021, increasing the FDI in the insurance sector from 49 per cent to 74 per cent with the LS approving the proposed law.

23-03-2021||New Delhi||Mizoram CM compounds Delhi’s Myanmar dilemma||The influx of refugees fleeing the military junta in Myanmar is turning into a foreign policy concern for South Block after Mizoram appeared to be defying the Centre’s directives in that regard.After writing a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow political asylum to refugees from Myanmar, Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga held a virtual meeting with Myanmar’s Foreign Minister-in-exile Zin Mar Aung, who is opposed to the military regime.Holds virtual meet with FM-in-exileZoramthanga wrote in the letter that Chin refugees were “ethnically our Mizo brethren” and “therefore Mizoram cannot remain indifferent to their suffering today. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard”.This militates against the Centre’s policy of asking all bordering states and security forces to prevent the influx and deport those who have come in since the coup.In the letter, the Mizoram CM said the Union Home Ministry’s advisory to deport the refugees was not acceptable. While he understands that some foreign policy issues require India to “proceed cautiously”, “we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis”, he said.Zoramthanga’s Mizo National Front has extended issue-based support to the Modi government.Intelligence reports say the security forces did push back some refugees, but the state has stepped in to provide shelter to some of them that may compel more of their compatriots in Myanmar to follow suit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mizoram-cm-compounds-delhis-myanmar-dilemma-229087
23-03-2021||Nonika Singh ||Sagar Sarhadi leaves behind many a love saga||Karoge yaad toh har baat yaad aayegi. The famous song from the film Bazaar may not have been written by Sagar Sarhadi. But as, the famed writer and director of the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Bazaar, breathed his last, there is much that he shall be remembered for. Much before he was to wield the directorial baton in 1982 his writing prowess had caught the imagination of cinephiles. Beginning his career in cinema in early 1970, he also wrote dialogues for Basu Bhattacharya’s Anubhav. However, it was his association with Yash Chopra that proved to be the most fruitful. Iconic film Kabhi Kabhie not only firmed up his position as a successful screenplay writer, but also paved way for many more love sagas including Chandni and Silsila. Master of romance, though romanticism, as he said runs in my veins, he remained and died a bachelor. Born as Ganga Sagar Talwar on May 11, 1933 in Baffa, Abbottabad, now in Pakistan, Partition may have uprooted him from his birthplace. Later he changed his name as a mark of love and respect for the place he belonged to. Unsurprisingly, his heartrending film Bazaar struck a chord as much among viewers in Pakistan as in India. The trigger for the film which poignantly portrayed the story of a Muslim girl being sold off to a man in Gulf came from a newspaper report about bride trade. It was the realistic cinematic treatment with lilting songs that won it much acclaim. Alas, his wish to make a sequel of Bazaar remained un-fulfilled. He did go on to direct a few more films such as Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Amruta Subhash starrer Chausar, which struggled for a release date.    The writer director who was nurtured and associated with the very best literary minds such as Kaifi Azmi, was dismayed with the quality of cinema and songs in his later years. But the ink in his pen remained as fresh, exuberant and in step with times. In 2000 he wrote dialogues for Hrithik Roshan’s launch-vehicle Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. Many a superstar film such as Shah Rukh Khan starrer Deewana benefited from his writing acumen.  Romance that he wove had a relatable feel. A firm believer of Communism, the blockbusters for which he wrote may not have brought out the Marxist in him. But as a short-story writer and playwright his plays brimmed with the angst he felt and convictions that were born out of his beliefs. His plays on Bhagat Singh and Ashfaqullah Khan were performed widely by Mumbai IPTA. Why he even desired to make a film on Ashfaqullah.    But as Israelmore Ayivor said, “We live for our unfulfilled dreams when we are alive. Our fulfilled dreams live for us when we are gone!” he leaves behind much worth cherishing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sagar-sarhadi-leaves-behind-many-a-love-saga-229088
23-03-2021||New Delhi||A year after ‘Janata curfew’, coronavirus threat rears its ugly head again||From a total of 360 COVID-19 cases to a single-day rise of 46,951 on Monday. One year after all of India stayed indoors in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to observe a ‘Janata curfew’, the country’s coronavirus story has been one of a dramatic rise, a steady fall and now an upswing again.That day, India recorded seven deaths. And today, 212 fatalities were reported, taking the death toll from the pandemic to 1,59,967, data from the Union Health Ministry showed on Monday.Paving the way for the two-month strict nationwide lockdown to curb the contagion that began on March 25, millions of people across the country stayed indoors on March 22, 2020 in an unprecedented and overwhelming response to the prime minister’s call. They came out only briefly, at exactly 5 pm, to show their gratitude to healthcare and other essential service providers by blowing conch shells, ringing bells and clapping.India reported its first case of coronavirus infection on January 30 last year from Kerala, and the first death on March 10 from Karnataka.A lockdown was clamped in the country from March 25 till May 31, affecting the economy badly.As the government initiated the ‘unlock’ procedure from June to make up for the economic cost of the lockdown, the COVID-19 cases started to gallop, and India soon became the second worst-hit nation after the US by September.The country eased the lockdown through a graded and pre-emptive approach, with the health ministry issuing standard operating procedures for opening up religious places, shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and offices and most recently, educational institutions, to prevent the spread of the infection.The number of daily coronavirus cases peaked in September with 97,894 infections being reported on the 17th day of the month, after which India began witnessing a gradual decline in cases even though several other countries saw a surge in infections.India crossed the grim milestone of one crore COVID-19 cases on December 19, even as the spread of the virus slowed down with almost a month being taken for the 10 lakh new infections, unlike in the period from August till mid-November when they rose at a faster rate.The daily rise in cases fell below 30,000 since December 14 (27,071) and the lowest daily increase of 8,635 infections was reported on February 2 this year.The daily rise in cases, however, started remaining above 30,000 from March 18.India reported 46,951 new coronavirus infections in a day, the highest so far this year, taking the nationwide COVID-19 tally to 1,16,46,081, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Monday.India has seen 2,60,742 cases in the last seven days.The daily fresh cases remained below 20,000 from January 8 till March 10 after which the cases began to spike.Registering an increase for the 12th day in a row, the total active caseload has increased to 3,34,646, which now comprises 2.87 per cent of the total infections.The national recovery rate was at its highest at 97.33 per cent on February 17 which has come down to 95.75 per cent.The active caseload was at its lowest at 1,35,926 on February 12, comprising 1.25 per cent of the total infections.Around 13 states and Union Territories (UTs) were out of the grip of COVID-19 before the Janata curfew was announced.India strengthened its healthcare infrastructure, ramped up the production of COVID-19 protective gear like personal protection equipment (PPE) and N-95 masks while scaling up testing facilities and boosting indigenous production of such items, thereby, reducing dependency on foreign countries.At the same time, the country started producing two vaccines—Bharat Biotech’s indigenously developed ‘Covaxin’ and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s ‘Covishield’ manufactured by Serum Institute—which were approved by the national drug regulator on January 3, and till date, more than 4.50 crore (4,50,65,998) vaccine doses have been administered in the country.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 this year with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated and the vaccination of frontline workers (FLWs) started from February 2.The next phase of COVID-19 vaccination commenced from March 1 for those who are over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.India stands at number one position in terms of recovered coronavirus cases followed by Brazil, while it is in the third spot in terms of the cases after the US and Brazil, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which has been compiling global COVID-19 data.In terms of fatalities, India is in the fourth position.

He said the legacy of Bangabandhu has made the heritage of both countries more comprehensive and deep-rooted and the path shown by Bangabandhu has laid a strong foundation for the partnership, progress and prosperity of both countries over the last decade,” said the Culture Ministry noting that as Bangladesh celebrates Mujib Borsho, India was honoured to commemorate his legacy jointly with the Government of Bangladesh and its people.“The Prize recognizes the unparalleled contribution of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in inspiring the liberation of Bangladesh, bringing stability to a nation born out of strife, laying the foundation for fraternal relations between India and Bangladesh and promoting non-violence in the Indian subcontinent,” said India which also honoured the longest serving monarch in the Middle East the late Sultan of Oman.The PM recalled the contributions of Sultan Qaboos to India-Oman ties and said, “He was a true friend of India and provided strong leadership for developing a strategic partnership between India and Oman. He was a visionary leader, a statesman and a beacon of peace for our region and the world.”The award carries an amount of Rs 1 crore, a citation and a plaque.The Jury comprised Chief Justice of India, Leader of the single largest Opposition Party in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and founder of Sulabh International Bindeshwar Pathak.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gandhi-peace-prize-for-sheikh-mujibur-rahman-late-sultan-of-oman-228940
23-03-2021||New Delhi||Lok Sabha clears contentious Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill 2021||The Lok Sabha on Monday cleared the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill 2021, which seeks to give more powers to the lieutenant governor (L-G), who is a representative of the Central government and Delhi’s administrative head.Opposition MPs, including from Congress, Shiv Sena, NCP, SP, BSP, IUML, National Conference, accused the Narendra Modi government of “destroying” democracy and “damaging and jeopardising” India’s federal structure and opposed the move vehemently.“They (Arvind Kejriwal government) must be doing something right which is why people elected them (AAP) for three consecutive terms,” NCP leader Supriya Sule also pointed, urging the government to send the Bill to select committee.Replying to the debate, Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy, however, said no rights were being taken away from the Delhi government. The aim of the Bill was only to bring clarity in laws and create sound government mechanism in Delhi and enhance public accountability.“Delhi is a UT with limited powers. Don’t make wrong allegations like murder of democracy, it is wrong. There has been no murder of democracy, no one is taking away any right of the Delhi government,” he said adding that only when there is a difference between the CM and LG, the President can be approached.“We are not amending the Constitution and it is in tune with recommendations and court judgments. The amendment is only to bring clarity on duties and responsibilities and clear misunderstandings. There is no political angle to the move,” said Reddy.Earlier, Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Bhaurao Raut slammed BJP’s New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi “for her words against the AAP CM who is not a member of the House”.He also reminded that Daman and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar, who allegedly died by suicide, had named the Administrator there in his suicide note.AAP MP Bhagwant Mann accused the Central government led by PM Modi of murdering the democracy.“We are being punished because we did not give stadia to build jail during farmers’ agitation. You cannot run Delhi through ‘tanashahi’. The BJP is out of power for 22 years in Delhi but cannot digest that. What is the point of holding elections,” he said. Initiating the debate, Congress MP Manish Tewari claimed that the move “cuts the legs of the Delhi Vidhan Sabha”.“This law is completely misconceived. Go and read the law by former Home Minister LK Advani and see what your worthy predecessor has proposed and how far you have come from that,” Tewari told Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy.  Congress’ JS Gill accused the BJP of trying to “usurp” power in states it lost using unfair means.“They are trying to create a super CM in Delhi,” he said, requesting the Centre to allow the Delhi government to run.Only when states are strong, country will become strong, he added.Rebutting Opposition claims, BJP’s New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi said the LG has the right to send the Bills to the President.“We are quasi federal structure where on some issues the Central government will take precedence. The Centre moved in because it was required,” she said. Quoting the 1987 Balakrishnan Committee report on the issue which talked of restricted power, she said no rights have been impinged upon by the Bill and that it only aimed at “improving” the lives of people.“When a person drowns at the Minto bridge who is responsible? The BJP is trying to amend the pitiable situation of Delhi. Why did you not give Delhi the complete statehood when you (Congress) were in power,” Lekhi questioned. She also accused the AAP government of “creating” the farmers’ agitation.“The government refused to give buses to the Delhi Police. It has not given any benefit to residents. It has not even added new buses to the DTC fleet as promised or tried to improve the life of people. The Delhi CM is not the owner of Delhi as he claims,” she said.“Democracy does not mean murder of its own people. We are servants of people not their masters. Give water, electricity and good facilities to people. Work on betterment of Delhi with the LG, who is also the Administrator,” Lekhi said. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on March 15, setting up the stage for yet another confrontation between the Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government.The Bill amends the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, which provides a framework for the functioning of the Legislative Assembly and the government. The Bill amends certain powers and responsibilities of the Legislative Assembly and the Lieutenant Governor. The Bill provides that the term “government” referred to any law made by the Legislative Assembly will imply Lieutenant Governor.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has called the Bill an “unconstitutional and anti-democracy move”.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has said the Bill will have “dangerous” consequences on India’s federal structure. The AAP and the BJP have been sparring over administrative powers of the LG ever since Arvind Kejriwal won the assembly elections in the national capital in 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-clears%C2%A0contentious%C2%A0government-of-national-capital-territory-of-delhi-amendment-bill-2021-228937

Jaishankar met the crown prince Mohamed bin Zayed who then met Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi after a few days.The UAE foreign minister had also called up Pakistan PM Imran Khan which was followed by India allowing his aircraft to fly over Indian airspace to Sri Lanka. And, a day before the February 25 ceasefire announcement, the UAE foreign secretary visited India, said the news report.Ties between UAE and India have intensified during the Modi government to the extent that the former is storing oil in India for use in emergencies. It is also alleged that the extradition of Christian Michel, an accused in an arms bribery case, to India was a quid pro quo for Indian commandos forcibly returning the daughter of a UAE sheikh who was fleeing to India.A UN panel has since then called Michel’s detention arbitrary while the UN has sought ‘proof of life’ about the princess from the UAE. Both countries have denied the allegations.The report, quoting unnamed officials, said the ceasefire was the beginning of a larger roadmap to forge a lasting peace between the neighbours. The next step involves reinstating envoys followed by the “hard part”—talks on resuming trade and a lasting resolution on Kashmir.But officials said expectations about the current détente achieving much were low.In another indication of a thaw, PM Modi sent a tweet wishing Imran Khan after he was diagnosed with Covid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/third-country-brokered-indo-pak-ceasefire-228933

This decision of revised time interval between two doses is applicable only to Covishield and not COVAXIN,” Bhushan said. He wrote to Chief Secretaries of States and UTs and noted that the Ministry of Health had accepted the recommendations of NTAGI and NEGVAC and has thereafter advised the states to ensure the administration of the second dose of Covishield to beneficiaries within this stipulated time interval of 4-8 weeks after the first dose.“It appears that protection is enhanced if the second dose of COVISHIELD is administered between 6-8 weeks but not later than stipulated period of 8 weeks. We urge states and UTs to instruct the concerned officials accordingly to undertake necessary steps to widely disseminate the message of revised dosing interval amongst programme managers, vaccinators and recipients of COVISHIELD vaccine and ensure adherence of the revised dosing interval,” Bhushan said.COVID vaccine drive has completed 65 days in India and over 4 crore people have received vaccine doses.Of these 75 lakh have completed the two dose schedule of vaccination within the four to six weeks window.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-revisits-covishield-vaccine-schedule-2nd-dose-4-8-weeks-after-first-instead-of-4-6-weeks-228914

You should reconsider it.”The Finance Minister also told Gill to “ask the Congress’ first family about squandering national resources.”“Please pose this question to the family that runs the Congress,” Sitharaman said moments before the House passed The Insurance Amendment Bill 2021 to raise FDI cap in insurance sector from 49 to 74 per cent.Responding to the banking sector, which Gill said was “in a mess”, the Finance Minister said “Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalized banks but UPA nationalized corruption and messed up public sector banks. That mess is being cleared now under PM Narendra Modi. Also, the fugitives Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi that you mentioned were actually nurtured by you. We are going after them and bringing them to justice.”The FM while speaking in defence of the insurance amendment bill also said private insurance companies employed 24 lakh people as against 17 lakh in the public sector insurance firms.Sitharaman said it was equally the government’s responsibility to enable private insurance firms to raise capital to meet the solvency ratio requirements.Noting that private insurance sector penetration had vastly increased since 2015 when the FDI in insurance cap was raised to 49 pc, the FM said there were today six public sector insurance PSUs as against 61 private insurance firms and the government ought to think about the private firms also because public companies will have access to government funds.“By raising FDI cap, private sector can raise capital. We have to think about the private sector as. Public sector can received public funds,” the FM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indira-gandhi-nationalised-banks-but-upa-govt-nationalised-corruption-sitharaman-in-lok-sabha-228910

23-03-2021||Vibha Sharma||Parliament clears Insurance (Amendment) Bill that seeks to hike FDI limit in insurance||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 22The Lok Sabha on Monday cleared the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to hike the FDI limit in insurance from 49 per cent to 74 per cent. Replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Bill had been taken up after due consultations and was not being "pushed" as alleged by some Opposition members. The FM said the government "is not selling family silver (as alleged by some Opposition members) but strengthening India's insurance sector", adding that public sector undertakings would continue and it was all about "right sizing". The amendment bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week."The recommendations are strong that is why we have gone ahead with raising the cap. The amendment is to raise the FDI cap and has nothing to do with LIC," the FM said, "No one will take away our insurance money outside the country, rather we will get the profit," she said."There is financial stress in the market,” she said to observations on liquidity."The insurance companies are facing solvency-related issues and raising the FDI limit in the insurance sector to 74 per cent was necessary to help insurers deal with issues concerning financial stress," she said.Sitharaman said, "If growth capital is hard to come by, there will be a stress situation. In order that the stress situation is not left unattended, we need to raise the FDI limit."Sitharaman said the Covid pandemic had further added to the woes of the insurance companies. The FDI limit was being raised on the recommendations of the regulator IRDAI which had held extensive consultations with the stakeholders, she added. The FDI inflow in the insurance sector, the minister said, had increased significantly after the government decided to raise the cap from 26 per cent to 49 per cent in 2015. As much as Rs 26,000 crore has come as FDI in the insurance sector since 2015, she said, adding that the asset under management (AUM) in this sector had also grown by 76 per cent during the last five years.Initiating the debate, Anandpur Sahib Congress MP Manish Tewari said when the BJP was in opposition, it opposed an increase in FDI. He said the then UPA government could not breach the wall put by late Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley in both Houses of Parliament.The decision to hike the FDI limit was like a somersault by the BJP, he said, also accusing the government of "selling the family silver".He also referred to certain parliamentary committees where senior BJP leaders (including former FM Yashwant Sinha) had opposed hike in FDI. Tewari said though the bill is small it had large implications.Defending the bill, BJP's Jagdambika Pal said the measure is in favour of India's growth story. He said while the FDI in the insurance sector would be increased, the government had put in place sufficient safeguards to keeping in mind the interests of people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-clears-insurance-amendment-bill-that-seeks-to-hike-fdi-limit-in-insurance-228905

Terming it as "nothing but extortion", he said it was revealed to the chief minister in his letter to the CM.Seeking quashing of the order to transfer him from the post of Mumbai Police chief, Singh submitted that the order was "illegal and arbitrary, in violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, for each of the grounds namely for being without the completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years in teeth of the law laid  down by this Hon’ble Court in TSR Subramanian v. Union of India, reported in (2013)."In his 130-page petition, he said the order was "in clear non-compliance with the provisions of Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 as amended in 2014, and beingcontrary to the law laid down by this Hon’ble Court in TP Senkumar v. Union of India, reported in (2017) wherein it was held that transfer of an officer from a sensitive tenure post requires serious consideration and good reasons that can be tested."He has also requested the court to issue "appropriate orders or directions to safeguard the petitioner (Singh) from any further coercive steps apprehended in the retaliation for laying bare the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of the government of Maharashtra."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/param-bir-singh-moves-sc-for-cbi-probe-against-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-228904
