10-03-2021||Dehradun||Tirath Singh Rawat: Unassuming, down-to-earth leader||Tirath Singh Rawat was denied the BJP ticket to contest the Uttarakhand assembly polls in 2017. Four years later, the party has picked him for the top job in the state.Replacing Trivendra Singh Rawat ahead of next year’s assembly polls, the new CM, sworn in Wednesday, has the reputation of being a simple and down-to-earth leader.Though a first-time MP, Rawat has held key organisational positions with the party, both in the state and at the Centre.Read also: BJP 'chooses' Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat as next Uttarakhand CMHe was the state’s first education minister, a part of the interim government when Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh. He went on to become the state BJP president from 2013 to 2015 and is now a national secretary.In the 2017 assembly polls, the BJP nomination for Chaubattakhal went to heavyweight Satpal Maharaj, overlooking Rawat’s claim to the seat he had won in 2012.But the party made up to him. Rawat was soon made a national secretary and given the ticket to contest from Pauri Garhwal Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 general elections.In that poll battle, he was pitted against BJP veteran and former chief minister Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri’s son Manish Khanduri, who was the Congress nominee. The senior Khanduri appeared to maintain distance as both his son and Rawat – who was considered his own protégé – tried to dig into his support base.Rawat, who had described himself as the true heir to Khanduri’s political legacy, won by 3,02,669 votes, one of the biggest margins in the state.Tirath Singh Rawat’s wife Rashmi, a professor of psychology, vouches for his “simplicity”.“He is simple and unassuming despite having occupied several organisational positions, and a long political experience. These are his virtues,” she told reporters after Rawat was elected leader of the state legislature party.“He is a serious man and does not speak much,” she said.Rawat’s principal challenge now is the assembly election next year, when his organisational experience will be put to test as the party hopes to retain power in Uttarakhand.

She said the husband kept delaying breaking this news to his family.On March 7, this year, the woman’s mother called her up to inform that she has contacted a religious guru who would cure her sexual orientation and will undertake a conversion therapy using psychic interventions to change her sexual orientation, the plea said.Fearing for her safety, the woman decided to leave her matrimonial house so that her family cannot force her to perform dehumanising rituals and she approached NGO—Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD) — the same day for a safe house, where she is now staying.The woman approached the court seeking immediate directions to ensure that she is provided with security and protection from her family and to direct her parental and matrimonial family to cease and desist from contacting, threatening or coercing her in any manner.She has sought protection of her right to equality under Article 14, as well as her right to privacy, autonomy, dignity and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution, as a woman who identifies as a lesbian.The woman, represented through advocate Vrinda Grover, informed the court that her family was forcing her to undergo “correction” surgeries, rituals or ceremonies qua her sexual orientation.The high court directed the Delhi Police, represented through Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, to provide complete protection to the woman and also said that no NGO members should be harassed or harmed for helping her.The petition said that the police, in brazen breach of law, leaked the information about the woman’s leaving her matrimonial home and contact details of NGO activists to her family who are now calling and harassing her and the activists. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lesbian-forcibly-married-threatened-to-be-cured-of-sexual-orientation-hc-gives-protection-to-woman-223325

Whenever there is a consensus in the House, the prime minister will make a statement,” Joshi said.The Lok Sabha passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill, 2021, to regularise unauthorised colonies in Delhi amid relentless protests by Opposition members.This is for the first time since the House met post the Budget session recess on Monday that any Bill was passed.The Rajya Sabha had already passed the Bill on February 9.Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri told the Lok Sabha that the Bill would give protection to unauthorised colonies from sealing till December 31, 2023.He said the “history of the problem of unauthorised colonies in the NCT of Delhi has been that prior to this, no government took up this issue with any degree of seriousness”.There are around 1,700 unauthorised colonies in Delhi.As the House convened at 11 AM, Opposition members started raising slogans and demanded repeal of the farm laws.Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, referred to a farmer taking his own life on the Delhi border.Birla repeatedly asked the members to let the Question Hour function smoothly. He urged the Opposition members, who were raising slogans, to maintain the dignity of the House, saying people have sent them to the Lok Sabha to debate on issues.Birla also asked senior member and Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav to persuade the protesting members to let the House function.“You do not want to discuss issues (related to the common man),” Birla said adding that it was collectively decided that there will be no disruption during the Question Hour.As the slogans demanding a rollback of the farm laws continued, the Question Hour lasted a little more than 30 minutes and the speaker adjourned the House till 12.30 pm.After the House reconvened at 12.30 it passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill, 2021. However, after the House again met at 2.30 pm to discuss the Demand for Grants for the Ministry of Railways, the protest continued.Meenakshi Lekhi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House for the day. The Lok Sabha will meet on March 15.Thursday is a holiday on the account of Mahashivratri. It is a norm that if any holiday falls on Thursday, then Friday is also a non-working day since it is precedes the weekend.

10-03-2021||Mumbai||Indian Navy’s third Kalavari class submarine commissioned||Indian Navy’s third stealth Scorpene class Submarine INS Karanj, equipped with potent weapons and sensors to neutralise any threat above or below the sea surface, was commissioned here on Wednesday.Former Navy chief Admiral V S Shekhawat, who was part of the commissioning crew of the old Karanj and later the commanding officer during the 1971 IndoPak war, was the chief guest for the commissioning ceremony at the Naval Dockyard.Six Scorpene class submarines are being built in India by the Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) Mumbai, under collaboration with Naval Group, France, a Navy spokesperson said in a release.INS Karanj is the third Kalavari-class submarine to be commissioned into the Navy. The diesel-electric submarines based on the Scorpene design are also referred to as Scorpene class submarines.INS Karanj would form part of the Western Naval Commands submarine fleet and would be another potent part of the Commands arsenal, the spokesperson said.Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh and senior Navy and MoD officers were among those present at the commissioning ceremony.The crew of the erstwhile Karanj, a Russian origin Foxtrot class submarine which was decommissioned in 2003 were also special invitees for the ceremony.During his address, the Navy chief said, “This impetus to indigenisation and Aatmanirbhar Bharat is a fundamental tenet of the Indian Navy’s growth story and future operational capabilities.”Admiral Shekhawat (retd) also highlighted Indias push towards self-reliance by saying, “We live in an India launching numerous satellites, building nuclear submarines, manufacturing vaccines for the world. The new Karanj is another example of the same.”This year is being celebrated as the Swarnim Vijay Varsh which marks 50 years of the 1971 IndoPak war. The old Karanj, commissioned on September 4, 1969 at Riga in the erstwhile USSR, also took active part in that war.In recognition of the valiant action of her officers and crew, a number of personnel on board were decorated, including the award of Vir Chakra to the then Commanding Officer Cdr Shekhawat.The commissioning Commanding Officer of the old Karanj Cdr M N R Samant later became the first Chief of the Naval Staff of the newly formed Bangladesh Navy in 1971.The Scorpene class submarines are among the most advanced conventional submarines in the world, the release said. “They are equipped with the latest global technologies.More deadly and stealthier than their predecessors, these submarines are equipped with potent weapons and sensors to neutralise any threat above or below the sea surface.,” it added.The commissioning of INS Karanj is another step towards the Indian Navy consolidating its position as a builders Navy, and also is a reflection of MDLs capabilities as a premier ship and submarine building yard in the world, the release said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-navys-third-kalavari-class-submarine-commissioned-223308

10-03-2021||Beijing||Hope first Quad summit is conducive to regional peace, ‘not the opposite’: China||As the US, India, Australia and Japan are set to hold their first Leaders’ Summit of Quad on Friday, a wary China on Wednesday hoped that the four countries will do things that are “conducive” to regional peace and stability instead of the “opposite”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga will attend the virtual summit, which is the first conclave of the top leaders of the Quadrilateral alliance, which was often projected in the official media here as an alliance against China’s rise.Asked for his reaction to the first Leaders’ summit of the Quad, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that China believes that any regional cooperation architecture should follow the principle of peaceful development and win-win cooperation, which is the prevailing trend of the times.“We hope the relevant countries will keep in mind the common interests of the regional countries uphold the principles of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation and do things that are conducive to regional peace stability and prosperity rather than the opposite,” Zhao said.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.A commentary in the state-run Global Times on the reports of Quad summit two days ago said, “the busy schedule of arrangements seems, to Chinese observers, like a ‘water-testing’ move from the US to sound out its Asian partners’ attitude toward forming an ‘unbreakable alliance’ to counter China’s rise”.Zhao also reacted cautiously when asked about the reports that Quad leaders will reach an agreement to increase their vaccine assistance to the developing countries to counter China’s vaccines diplomacy.  “China is a committed frontrunner in promoting international vaccine cooperation.” but it is opposed to vaccine nationalism and politicisation of vaccine cooperation, he said.He said China has carried out vaccine R&D and production cooperation with dozen or so countries attracting more than a hundred thousand volunteers of over 100 nationalities.    Altogether 17 Chinese vaccines had entered clinical trials. More than 60 countries have authorised the use of these vaccines, he said, adding that China is committed to providing 10 million vaccines to COVAX -- a WHO backed initiative to supply vaccines to developing countries.“The safety and effectiveness (of the) Chinese vaccines are earning recognition across the world. China is prepared to discuss with the other countries the feasibility and protocols for mutual recognition of vaccination,” he said.China has already proposed to the US to facilitate international travel with mutual recognition.Zhao said that an inspection team of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is in China to examine the Chinese vaccines.    “Now there are a number of vaccines available around the world. It’s up to each country to decide to choose. Whether it is a Chinese vaccine or not it is a good vaccine as long as it is safe and effective. China opposes vaccine nationalism. We reject any vaccine divide or any attempt to politicise vaccine cooperation,” the spokesman said.

10-03-2021||Haldia (WB)||Mamata files nomination from Nandigram, exudes confidence of winning the seat||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday filed her nomination for Nandigram assembly seat, where she will take on her former protege and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari and exuded confidence of winning it saying she has never returned empty-handed from the land of anti-farm land acquisition movement.Accompanied by TMC president Subrata Bakshi, Banerjee filed her papers at the Haldia sub-divisional office here after taking part in a 2-km roadshow. She offered prayers at a temple before filing her nomination, and at another after doing so.“I am confident about my victory from the Nandigram assembly seat. I could have easily contested from Bhawanipur seat (which she represents).“When I had visited Nandigram in January, there was no MLA from here as the sitting MLA had resigned. I looked at the faces of the common people and decided to contest from here,” she said after filing her paper.Deputy chairman of East Midnapore zilla parishad Sheikh Sufiyan has been appointed as Banerjee’s election agent.“I have never returned empty-handed from here.Nandigram is not just a name, it is the name of a movement.Bhulte pari sobar naam, bhulbo nako Nandigram (I can forget everyone’s name, but can never forget Nandigram). That’s the significance of this place for me,” the TMC supremo said.Banerjee said she had made up her mind this time to contest either from the Singur or Nandigram - the cradles of the anti-farm land acquisition movement which had catapulted her to power in 2011.“My feeling is very clear - no one can divide this place along religious lines. During the Nandigram movement all the communities had participated in it. Those who are lecturing now about its legacy were nowhere when violence was unleashed here. I was fighting alone,” she said.The feisty TMC chief will contest from Nandigram for the first time after relinquishing her Bhowanipore constituency in Kolkata.She has rented a house in Nandigram and will campaign from there.Nandigram assembly constituency is set for a high octane battle with Banerjee deciding to contest from the seat against Adhikari, who recently switched over to the saffron camp.Adhikari, who will file his nomination paper for the seat on a later date, called her an “outsider” to Nandigram and himself a “bhoomiputra” (son of the soil).He had won the Nandigram seat in the 2016 assembly poll, while another TMC candidate emerged victorious from the constituency in 2011.Adhikari had quit TMC and resigned from the assembly late last year to join BJP following differences with the state’s ruling party.Both the leaders were prominent figures in the the anti-farm land acquisition movement in Nandigram in 2007 that had catapulted Banerjee to power in West Bengal in 2011 ending the 34-year-long rule of the Left Front.The little known rural area, which had witnessed one of the bloodiest movements against the government’s acquisition of cultivable land for industrialisation, had then changed the political landscape of the West Bengal.Now after more than a decade of peace, Nandigram, home to 70 per cent Hindus and 30 per cent Muslims, is witnessing political and communal polarisation.The Muslims are firmly behind TMC that has controlled the area for the last 15 years.The constituency mainly comprises two blocks—Nandigram I and Nandigram II—with the first having 30 per minority population and the second almost 15 per cent.Election in Nandigram is slated to be held on April 1.

10-03-2021||Mumbai||Hiran’s death was carefully planned murder: Fadnavis||Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis claimed on Wednesday that Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran’s death was a “carefully planned murder”.Speaking to reporters outside the legislative complex, Fadnavis also alleged that the Shiv Sena-led state government does not want a free and fair probe in the case for fear that some “higher-ups” in the government will be exposed.“The death of Mansukh Hiran was a carefully planned murder. Only someone well-versed in the nuances of police investigation could have done it,” the BJP leader said.Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV which was found with explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in south Mumbai on February 25, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5.Fadnavis also claimed that the government could seek the resignation of forest minister and Sena leader Sanjay Rathod in the Puja Chavan suicide case because Rathod could not have posed any threat to the government “unlike API Vaze who knows many secrets”.Earlier in the day, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced in the Legislative Council that assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, against whom Hiran’s wife has levelled allegations, has been transferred from Crime Intelligence Unit.Fadnavis claimed that the government transferred the police officer only to save its skin.“But we will continue to fight for action against him based on the prima facie evidence against him and till Hiran gets justice,”  the BJP leader said.The former chief minister also claimed that Vaze, who had been suspended in the Khwaja Yunus encounter case, was reinstated by overruling the court directions “so that he could be of help during the pandemic”.“How he could be of help was seen in the present case,” Fadnavis quipped.He also alleged that the police officer, who had joined the Shiv Sena in 2008, continues to be its member. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hirans-death-was-carefully-planned-murder-fadnavis-223285
10-03-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp CEO ‘worried’ about Indian government promoting Koo||WhatsApp head Will Cathcart may not have anything to do with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey but when it comes to India, he is worried—not only about the Union government’s aim to break encryption but also the move to promote the homegrown micro-blogging platform Koo.Speaking to ‘Big Technology Podcast’ host Alex Kantrowitz, Cathcart said that “splinternet”—where instead of having a global internet, you have countries each with their own regulations—is a profound risk, and it will be worse if governments decide to have their own mini-internet with their own mini-apps.Koo has fast become a favourite among several Union ministers amid the government’s war with Twitter over removing misinformation and bad accounts from its platform.Answering a question that the Indian government is pushing Koo, which is a Twitter competitor, Cathcart said: “I think we should be worried about it. I mean, we arguably already have a  splinternet with Mainland China and the rest of the world”.“But I do think there is a risk that we end up with that in more places, in different countries around the world, or even different regions, Europe and the US, could you imagine regulations  diverging in such a way that it forces a splinternet? I think people benefit a lot from products that, one, work globally,” the WhatsApp CEO told the host during the podcast last week.The vernacular micro-blogging platform Koo, which has crossed 40 lakh users within no time, aims to garner 10 crore users by the end of this year, its Co-founder Mayank Bidawataka told  IANS last month.Koo has raised $4.1 million as part of its Series A funding. Infosys veteran Mohandas Pai’s 3one4 Capital is the latest addition to the investors on board.“We want Koo to become a world-class app and want to be known as the micro-blog of India,” Bidawataka said.WhatsApp is facing intense scrutiny in India for asking users to either give their consent to sharing data with Facebook or lose their accounts after May 15.Meanwhile, the Union government has also notified new rules for social media intermediaries, saying that the platforms will have to remove offending content within 36 hours after a government  directive or a legal order.Cathcart said that people benefit from having more choices globally.“But a lot of the decisions we’re going to make on the internet, our governments are going to make on the internet over the next 10, 20 years, I think will really shape whether this is  a global market, or whether each country has its own mini-internet with its own mini-apps. And I think the latter would be worse,” Cathcart lamented.On the growing demand to break encryption in India, he said that it’s really hard for him to imagine being comfortable with such decision.“I mean, it’s hard for me to imagine even how you ask people to do that, I think it’s such a fundamental threat. So, we’ll stand and we’ll make our case, and we’ll argue. My hope is, here,  we can find something that is not breaking encryption, that addresses the concerns that’s much more reasonable,” he argued.“Our hope is that we can find a way to end up with solutions that don’t touch encryption,” Cathcart added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whatsapp-ceo-worried-about-indian-government-promoting-koo-223284

10-03-2021||New Delhi||Hackers hit Indians with ransomware supporting farmers||In a unique way to support protesting farmers in India, cyber criminals have launched a new ransomware attack in the country that does not ask for money but justice for the community, conveying a message that no data will be recovered until the demands of the farmers are met, a new report revealed on Wednesday.The ransomware is designed to target entities connected with farmers’ protests in India, with the hacker group titled Khalsa Cyber Fauj reported to be leading this attack in the country.Quick Heal Security Labs, the threat research and response division of global cybersecurity firm Quick Heal Technologies, said it has discovered the ransomware named as “Sarbloh”, which is being distributed through malicious word documents via emails, containing a political message supporting the farmers’ community.“The latest Sarbloh ransomware that appears to be working in the favour of farmers without any monetary grains is a testimony to their growing attack abilities,” said Himanshu Dubey, Director, Quick Heal Security Labs.Surprisingly, threat actors through this new attack technique are infecting user devices by encrypting their files without asking for a ransom, which is usually the key objective of any ransomware.“Khalsa Cyber Fauj is using military-grade encryption on system files to turn them useless,” the company mentioned.The news came as apart from intensifying the agitation at Delhi’s borders, farmers are now trying to strengthen the stir against the Union farm laws on social media platforms as well.Farmers have been protesting against the various newly enacted Union farm laws since November 26, 2020, at various borders of the national Capital.“Threat actors have constantly demonstrated innovation through their evolving attack strategies. We will continue to analyse the threat environment and deploy safety measures for our users,” said Dubey.The company advised users not to download any attachment that comes from unknown emails and messages.“Avoid clicking on unverified links and those found in spam email. Besides, practice backing up the data so that it can be recovered in case of compromise, and keep updating antivirus solutions to stay protected,” the company said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hackers-hit-indians-with-ransomware-supporting-farmers-223268
10-03-2021||New Delhi||SC notice to Centre on plea raising issue of exclusion of female candidates from joining NDA||The Supreme Court Wednesday sought responses from the Centre and others on a plea which has raised the issue of exclusion of eligible and willing female candidates from joining the prestigious National Defence Academy (NDA) solely on the ground of sex which allegedly is a violation of the fundamental right of equality.The plea has sought direction to the concerned authorities to allow eligible female candidates to appear in the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination' and train at the NDA.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notices to the Centre, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and others seeking their responses on the plea which said: “the categorical exclusion of eligible female candidates from entering the National Defence Academy is not constitutionally justifiable and is simply done on the basis of their sex."The bench, also comprising justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, allowed a separate application filed by an Uttar Pradesh based woman seeking impleadment in the matter.The plea filed by advocate Kush Kalra has referred to the February last year landmark verdict in which the apex court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission and command postings.The plea said that authorities allow unmarried male candidates having adequate 10+2 qualification to take the ‘National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination', but eligible and willing female candidates are not allowed to take the examination on the sole ground of their sex and without any reasonable or justifiable explanations within the four corners of the Constitution.It alleged that this act of discrimination is a “dishonour committed” by the concerned authorities to the constitutional values of equality and non-discrimination.“The act of the respondents to categorically exclude eligible and willing female candidates from appearing for the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination over the years, solely on the ground of sex, is a violation of the fundamental right of equality before the law and equal protection of the law,” it said.It said that eligible female candidates having an adequate 10+2 level of education are denied the opportunity to take the examination on the ground of their sex and the consequence of this denial is that they do not have access to any mode of entry to join the armed forces as officers at this level.“Whereas, equally and similarly situated male candidates with 10+2 level of education have the opportunity to take the examination and after qualifying join the National Defence Academy to get trained to be commissioned as permanent commissioned officers in the Indian armed forces,” the plea said.“The categorical exclusion of women to train at the National Defence Academy and get commissioned into the armed forces of the country as permanent commissioned officers solely on the basis of their sex is a denial of the fundamental right to practice any profession and it is not justifiable within the contours of the Indian Constitution,” it said.It said that UPSC conducts the ‘National Defence Academy & Naval Academy Examination' and as per eligibility criteria, any unmarried male candidate with the required educational qualification and aged between 15-18 years can appear in it.It said that the candidate, on qualifying the exam and on successful completion of training at the NDA and subsequent training at the respective academy of the service the cadet opts for, gets commissioned into the service as a permanent commissioned officer by the age of 19-22 years old.“This opportunity to take the National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination at the age of 15-18 years, with the eligible academic qualifications is not available to eligible and willing female candidates and the sole reason for this categorical exclusion is on the basis of their sex,” the plea said.It claimed that the duration of training for the Short Service Commission women officers is very less compared to the training that a male permanent commission officer, who gets entry through the NDA, gains.The plea alleged that denying equal opportunity under the law by not allowing eligible and willing female candidates to appear in the examination “should not be used to perpetuate and continue the legal, social and economic inferiority of women.” “Therefore, the state, having control over the opportunity to allow women entry into the National Defence Academy has no constitutional right to exclude eligible and qualified individuals from joining the National Defence Academy, getting trained in the most premier institute of military education and training in the country and developing and transforming themselves into inspiring and motivating leaders in the armed forces solely based on the wrong and flawed notions of gender roles and weaker sex perpetuated by the society,” the plea said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-raising-issue-of-exclusion-of-female-candidates-from-joining-nda-223265

He said the protestors proceeded towards central Delhi despite being stopped at other barricades inside the city and broke those barricades as well.In view of this experience, and the manner in which the protesting farmers used tractors as weapons for breaking the barricades and injuring policemen, the barricades at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border were strengthened to prevent a repeat of the conduct displayed on January 26, the minister said.To alleviate the hardships caused to the commuting public due to the activities of the protestors, arrangements had been made to provide alternative routes to them, the minister said, adding that to ensure law and order and smooth movement of traffic at the borders adequate forces had been deployed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/38-cases-registered-after-violence-in-delhi-on-january-26-minister-informs-parliament-223262

The Office of the Registrar General, India had provided logistics and technical support in conducting the SECC-2011.

I am taking this decision in view of the rising demand from the opposition," the minister said.Mansukh Hiran was in possession of the SUV, which was found with explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in south Mumbai on February 25.Police said the vehicle was stolen from Hiran's possession on February 18. The mystery deepened after Hiran's body was found in a creek last Friday in neighbouring Thane.Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday demanded action against API Sachin Vaze in connection with the death of Hiran."We will take appropriate action against Vaze if he is involved in his death," Deshmukh said in the Council on Wednesday.However, Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar and other opposition members expressed dissatisfaction over the government's decision."Vaze is in some way involved in the death of Mansukh Hiran. He should face legal action and should be suspended at once," Darekar said.Later, talking to reporters in the Vidhan Bhavan complex, Deshmukh said the Maharashtra government has decided to transfer Vaze from the crime branch till the state Anti- Terrorism Squad (ATS) completes its probe into the case of Hiran's death.Referring to the alleged suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha member Mohan Delkar, he said a case has been registered at the Marine Drive police station based on a complaint of the MP's son.Besides, a case has been registered against the Union Territory's administrator Praful Kheda Patelunder the Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, the minister said.Delkar (58), a seven-term MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, was found dead in a hotel in Marine Drive area of south Mumbai on February 22.Meanwhile, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab said in the state Assembly that API Vaze will be shifted from the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU)."I also request the leader of opposition to hand over the proof that he has to the police," he said.The issue was raised by Fadnavis, who demanded that the government shift Vaze from his present posting."We want the House to function and debate on the budget. The government has said it will probe the Mansukh Hiran case. Vaze has to be shifted from his present posting," Fadnavis said.Earlier, before Home Minister Deshmukh's announcement in the Council, the Upper House witnessed ruckus as the opposition BJP demanded action against Vaze.BJP MLCs Gopichand Padalkar and Darekar sought to know Deshmukh's stand on Vaze and why the police officer was being "protected" by the state.As Deshmukh started speaking on how the crime rate in Maharashtra came down last year as compared to 2019 citing a report of the NCRB, Darekar objected to it and demanded that he first speak onwhat action would be taken on Vaze.Amid the ruckus, Council's Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe adjourning the House for five minutes.Meanwhile, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde told reporters in the Vidhan Bhavan complex that the Maharashtra ATS and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) were probing the case of Hiran's death and the recovery of explosives-laden vehicle outside Ambani's house."The truth will come out after the probe is completed.It will be unfair to take action until the probe is completed.So Vaze will be transferred from his present posting," he said.

The same year, BKU held a week-long protest in Delhi’s Boat Club to focus on the plight of farmers.After Mahendra Singh Tikait’s death in 2011, Naresh and Rakesh have been leading the main organisation in various roles, though a number of faction groups have emerged in various parts of the country over the years.Narendra said the Centre is under the misconception that it can “cull” the farmers’ protest like it has “culled” other agitations in the past using various tactics.“I am here in Sisauli but my eyes are there on the protest,” he said, adding that he kept visiting Ghazipur border where hundreds of farmers and BKU supporters had been camping since November 2020.“This government has a misconception, probably because it never faced such a protest, but we have seen agitations and been part of those for 35 years. This government has experience of facing only smaller protests and of getting those culled through various tactics,” he said.“They cannot crush this protest by any means. This will continue for as long as our demands are met. This government has a tenure of three and a half years left, and we can continue the movement till the end of its term,” he asserted.The younger and lesser-known Tikait said farmers would vacate the protest sites only after their demands were met completely and not on the basis of any future assurance or partial agreement on demands.“If the government says crops would be bought at MSP then why cannot they give this in writing? They keep harping about giving subsidies on LPG cylinders, but that subsidy is also gone,” he said.Tikait alleged that the Centre had done the same to the school education sector where private institutes are thriving and minting money while the condition of government facilities keeps getting poorer and poorer.“Now they want business houses to store crops, hoard those and later sell at desired rates. Their push is for business and that’s the agenda,” he said, adding that farmers are already reeling under the high cost of labour and fuel prices.Asked about allegations that the Tikait family holds land worth hundreds of crores and that BKU is involved in hooliganism in the region, he said, “There is nothing that they (the government) could find against us and therefore this (levelling allegations) is happening. If they find any wrongdoing on the part of any member of our family then we will return from Delhi.”He also rejected allegations of hooliganism by BKU as incorrect. “Why would we do it? Some even say that we are taking money for the protest. More than 200 of our farmers have sacrificed their lives during the protest. People are donating money even during the last rites of those who have died. There is no question of us taking money for protests as we are not short on resources,” he said.

10-03-2021||New Delhi||Some people running down institutions, says Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday noted that some people in the country were trying to run down institutions like Parliament, Judiciary and the Army by questioning their credibility. Such actions harm the cause of the country, he said.“These people, however, do not represent the country’s mainstream,” Modi said at a ceremony at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence after releasing 11 volumes of Srimad Bhagvadgita along with commentaries in original manuscripts by 21 scholars on the shlokas.The publication has been brought out by Jammu-based Dharmarth Trust, which is headed by former Union minister Dr Karan Singh.The publication is under the rubric ‘Srimad Bhagvadgita: Rare multiple Sanskrit commentaries in original calligraphy’.Modi’s observation was in the context of transcendental knowledge, including on selfless work, imparted in the holy book.He said while pitching for rights, one should also be mindful of duties.Extolling the Gita as being relevant for the entire humanity, he said it has universal values. It is also a lesson on the value of ideals of democracy, including on free choice. Lord Krishana in conclusion of his treatise eventually leaves it to his disciple-warrior Arjuna on the battle-field of Kurukshetra to pursue the path of action of his choice.Modi said the Gita epitomises India’s ancient spiritual ethics, metaphysics and logic. It teaches of  caring and sharing, and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is a family).“People abroad come to understand this metaphysical thought only after having read the GIta.”He praised Dr Singh for the publication, saying it would help people of the country to have a better understanding of the Gita. He appreciated the former Union Minister for reviving the rich culture heritage of Jammu and Kashmir.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Singh thanked Modi for releasing the book.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-people-running-down-institutions-says-modi-223240

To mark this momentous occasion, there could be no better recipient than one of the world’s greatest movie stars, and one who has understood, embraced, and publicised the cause of film preservation for years,” Frederic Maire, president of FIAF, said in a statement.“By presenting our prestigious FIAF Award to Amitabh Bachchan, we want to show the world how rich and diverse, but also how fragile, this unique film heritage is, and we want to publicly thank Bachchan for his role as a high-profile advocate for the rescue of this heritage, in India and beyond,” he added.Bachchan’s name was nominated by the FIAF affiliate Film Heritage Foundation.Founded by filmmaker and archivist Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, Film Heritage Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the preservation, restoration, documentation, exhibition, and study of India’s film heritage.Bachchan said he is honoured to receive the award for a cause he is “deeply committed to”.“It was when I became the ambassador of Film Heritage Foundation in 2015 that I realised the extent of the neglect and colossal loss of our precious film heritage and how we continue to lose more of our legacy every day.“Recognising the urgency of the situation, I have been working closely with Film Heritage Foundation since its inception to do everything in our power to save our films and to build a movement for film preservation in our part of the world,” the 78-year-old actor said.

Are we developing a stronger alliance with them? You mentioned them as part of the Quad. Do they consider themselves a member of something of that nature,” King asked.Responding to questions, Davidson said that China had a vast disinformation machine.“They use both regular media and social media and have nearly 1 million people in their propaganda machine to undermine US interests, to capture the narrative to their own benefit, and to, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, you know, corrupt the environment in a way that creates doubt amongst our allies and partners in the reliability of the United States,” he said.In response to another question, Davidson said China’s Belt and Road Initiative actually had a component that is trying to enable smart cities globally where all cyber connections would lead back to China, which the US had to highlight, the threat that it presented to others.“And then we, a whole of government approach, have to be willing to compete in that environment to help the infrastructure and advances in these other cities, even if it’s only advice,” he said.

10-03-2021||Vibha Sharma||Trivendra Singh Rawat steps down as Uttarakhand CM||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 9After days of speculation over the Uttarakhand Chief Minister’s future amid rumblings among state leaders over his “style of functioning”, Trivendra Singh Rawat today tendered his resignation to Governor Baby Rani Maurya in Dehradun. This comes a day after Rawat met senior leaders in Delhi, including party president JP Nadda, and Rajya Sabha MP and BJP’s national media in charge Anil Baluni.What forced him outGolden periodThese four years have been golden period of my political career. I had never imagined that the party will give such a big honour to someone like me. — Trivendra Singh Rawat, Uttarakhand CM Among 8 CMs with curtailed termsDhan, Baluni front-runnersState minister Dhan Singh Rawat has emerged as a front-runner for the CM’s post. Others in the race include RS MP Anil Baluni, Union Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, state minister Satpal Maharaj, MP Ajay Bhat and BJP general secretary Suresh BhatBefore the resignation, Rawat was closeted with close associates, including ministers Madan Kaushik and Dhan Singh Rawat, who has now emerged as a frontrunner for the post.Incidentally, Baluni is another name on the long list of probables that includes Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, state Cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj, Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar MP Ajay Bhat and general secretary of state BJP Suresh Bhat. There is also talk about a Deputy CM “to assuage all sections and regions” of the state that goes to the polls next year.While sources said “a name acceptable to all, with elections slated next year, has already been decided”, BJP general secretary in charge of Uttarakhand Dushyant Gautam insisted the decision would be taken at a meeting of legislators tomorrow. He said Rawat “will be given a big responsibility at the Centre”.Addressing mediapersons after the resignation, the outgoing CM thanked the BJP leadership for giving him the opportunity to serve the state. Regarding the resignation, he said all decisions are taken in a “collective manner” in the BJP.While this is not the first time PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have removed a CM of a BJP-ruled state before the elections — Anandiben Patel was replaced by Vijay Rupani in Gujarat — the situation in Uttarakhand is said to be “more serious”. The change has certainly given an opportunity to adversaries, especially the Congress, to strike back with a reminder of the times “BJP engineered trouble” for the Harish Rawat government. Sources said Shah, Nadda and national general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh discussed the political situation and all possibilities with party observers — vice-president Raman Singh and Gautam.Apart from “serious discontent” amid BJP MLAs and MPs and objections regarding Rawat’s “style of functioning and allowing bureaucracy to become more powerful peoples’ representatives,” it is learnt an observers’ report also mentioned it will be difficult for the BJP to win next year with Rawat as the face. Seemingly, the Sangh parivaar too was upset with over some of the decisions of the government. Some Congress imports were also threatening to jump ship ahead of Assembly elections next year, spelling trouble for the ruling party amid “increasing influence” of the Aam Aadmi Party in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trivendra-singh-rawat-steps-down-as-uttarakhand-cm-223041

Today was also the last day of filing nomination papers for the first phase of the Assembly polls in West Bengal and Assam.Sources said the inauguration of the bridge was slated during PM Modi’s Dhaka visit on January 26, but the event was brought forward at South Block’s request.As a result, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina could not be present real-time when PM Modi was inaugurating the bridge. Instead, a tape recorded address by Hasina was instead inserted.“This is a historic moment as we are creating a new era in South Asia by providing connectivity to India. Political boundaries should not become physical barriers to trade,” she said.At the same time, Hasina said the project was conceived by an earlier Chief Minister (Manik Sarkar of the CPM) who had then approached her to facilitate various clearances. The CM, she said, had also assured that his side would take care of the financing.PM Modi said the developmental activity was a result of “a double-engine government, BJP at the Centre and BJP in Tripura”.With this inauguration, Tripura is set to become the “Gateway of North East” with access to Chittagong Port of Bangladesh, which is 80 km from Sabroom, said a statement from the PM’s Office.The PM also laid foundation stones for integrated check post at Sabroom, highway in Tripura and 40,978 low-income houses in Agartala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-inaugurates-maitri-setu-to-connect-india-bangladesh-223049

DGAFMS heads the medical wing of all three services and is equivalent in status to an Army Commander.The Lieutenant General had contended that as per existing rules selection to the post of DGAFMS is based purely on the seniority among three of the most senior officers in the zone of consideration.He also claimed certain procedural irregularities in his medical classification after he had suffered a serious cardiac condition last year, besides averring that he was not selected because certain irrelevant considerations and extraneous factors had crept into the decision-making process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attributing-lifestyle-disease-to-covid-environment-costs-lieutenant-general%C2%A0top-medical-post-222857

Farmers within the age group of 18-40 years are eligible to get themselves enrolled under the scheme. The scheme aims at providing an assured pension of Rs 3,000 per month once the farmer attains the age of 60 years.“The committee has been informed that only 21,20,310 farmers have subscribed to this scheme till date,” the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture Chaired by BJP MP P C Gaddigoudar said in its 24th report tabled in the Lok Sabha.The panel said PMKMY is a flagship social security scheme catering to provide financial security to most deprived section of our society. This Scheme, if properly implemented, will help small and marginal farmers which constitute majority farming community of our country, to lead a dignified life in their twilight years.“However, the committee is not happy with very low level of enrolment under the scheme till date,” the panel said and asked the ministry to identify the reasons for low subscription of farmers to the scheme and if needed, comprehensively modify the Yojana to make it attractive for the subscription by the farmers.

The evaluation of safety outcomes requires extensive phase 3 clinical trials. We were unable to assess other immune responses (ie, binding antibody and cell-mediated responses) in convalescent serum samples due to the low quantity. Furthermore, no additional data on the age of the participant or the severity of disease from symptomatic individuals were obtained,” says the report.It also pointed out that comparisons between phase 1 and 2 trials were not done in a randomised set of participants, and no adjustments on baseline parameters were made.“Conclusions are to be considered as post-hoc analyses. Even though direct comparisons between the phase 1 and 2 trials cannot be made, the reactogenicity assessments reported in this study were substantially better in the phase 2 trial than the phase 1 trial and other trials with a placebo group,” it added.The report says that the proportion of participants reporting adverse events in the phase 2 trial were lower than in the phase 1 trial. The study coordinators had verified all source documents to ensure that no data were missing or that errors had occurred.“Further corroboration with phase 3 safety results is required. This study enrolled a small number of participants aged 12-18 years and 55-65 years. Follow-on studies are required to establish immunogenicity in children and in those aged 65 years and older.”It did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Covaxin in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India.The most common adverse event in the phase 2 trial was pain at the injection site, followed by headache, fatigue, and fever. No severe or life-threatening solicited adverse events were reported.Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered, four weeks apart, in 380 healthy children and adults. Higher neutralising antibody titres (2-fold) was observed in the phase 2 study than in the phase 1 study.In a follow-up of the phase 1 trial, Covaxin produced, durable antibody and T-cell responses 3-months post-vaccination. It said that 6 and 12 months of follow-up studies are ongoing.After 2-doses, local and systemic adverse reactions observed in both vaccine groups were minimal. The probability of experiencing a side effect was 10-12 per cent, which is 6-times lower than other Emergency Use Authorized vaccines.Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) was granted emergency approval in January before data from its final stage testing.The move by the drug regulator raised concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine Though Covaxin was included along with Covishield for nation-wide immunization launched on January 16, healthcare workers and frontline staff showed reluctance in taking Covaxin.When the second phase of vaccination began on March 1, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took Covaxin shot and this is believed to have increased the confidence among beneficiaries.Last week, Bharat Biotech released phase 3 results Covaxin and claimed that the vaccine demonstrated 81% interim efficacy in preventing Covid-19, in those without prior infection, after the second dose.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-safe-has-no-serious-side-effects-says-lancet-222814

Candid discussions are an important part of our mature and wide-ranging relationship with the Indian Government”.Indicating that it did not concur with the application of force and other measures on the farmers’ stir, the Minister said, “We look to the Indian Government to uphold the freedoms and rights guaranteed to the Indian people by the constitution and by the international instruments to which India is party”.Labour and Scottish Nationalist Party stalwarts such as Jeremy Corbyn, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Martyn Day and Stephen Kinnock were joined in their criticism of New Delhi’s handling of farmers’ protests by MPs from across parties including Khalid Mehmood, Nadia Whittome, Paul Bristow, Pat McFadden, Virendra Sharma, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Layla Moran, Seema Malhotra, John McDonell and Brendon O’Hara.The Indian High Commission described their observations over farmers’ protest as “a false narrative” even though it had tried to inform all concerned about the issues raised in the petition. The e-petition that the High Commission was referring to was initiated by a local councilor. It quickly garnered over one lakh signatures that made the topic eligible for a debate.The High Commission also dismissed claims of affinity with India by some MPs. “When aspersions are cast on India by anyone, irrespective of their claims of friendship and love for India or domestic political compulsions, there is a need to set the record straight,” it stated in a statement.The British Minister was noncommittal on the demand by a MP to impose sanctions on officials who committed serious human rights violations or abuses. “It is not appropriate to speculate on who may be designated under the regime in future, as to do so could very well reduce their impact,” said Adams.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-summons-british-envoy-over-discussion-on-agriculture-reforms-in-uk-parliament-222759
