14-03-2021||Dehradun||Following anti-Covid norm must but no one to be troubled during Kumbh: CM||Following anti-Covid precautions is necessary during the ongoing Haridwar Kumbh but no one should be deprived of taking a holy dip in the Ganga during it, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat said on Sunday.The new chief minister also announced that his government has decided to withdraw cases against 4,500 people booked for allegedly violating the anti-Covid guidelines during the lockdown in the state.Rawat said it while reiterating his government’s commitment to ensuring a grand Kumbh in Haridwar, which, he said, is held only once in 12 years and is a significant occasion not only for the state but for the country and the entire world.As per an official communique, the chief minister said it is necessary to follow all anti-Covid guidelines during the Kumbh but the people participating in it do not have to be inconvenienced.“We do not have to deprive people of taking a holy dip in the Ganga,” said Rawat, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “unique working style” which, he said, enabled the government to take care of people’s need even during the Covid lockdown.It is the PM’s “unique working style” which gave rise to the “Modi hai to mumkin hai” (everything is feasible with Modi being around) slogan, the chief minister said.The chief minister said it is because of his eagerness to hold a grand Kumb in Haridwar that he got the seers, taking holy dips in the Ganga at Brahmkund on Maha Shivratri, from a helicopter.He said on the occasion lakhs of people bathed in the Ganga and his government’s arrangements pleased both the public and seers besides the trading community.Rawat said the government is taking steps to increase the number of buses and trains reaching the Haridwar Kumbh.He said the service to the people itself is the service to God and in the time to come, Prime Minister Modi would be hailed all over the world for his service to the nation.On the occasion, All-India Akhara Parishad chief Mahant Narendra Giri too praised the government work for the Haridwar Kumbh and said the efforts must be made to better it than Allahabad Kumbh. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/following-anti-covid-norm-must-but-no-one-to-be-troubled-during-kumbh-cm-225188

The trial court had pronounced him guilty and awarded life imprisonment.However, the Allahabad High Court recently acquitted him, holding that the victim’s testimony was found trustworthy and the medical evidence belied any case against the accused. The high court expressed anguish over Tiwari’s prolonged incarceration and the government’s failure to recommend his case for remission of sentence or to commute it.Mishra contended that SC/ST Act was being “abused by filing fake and malicious complaints and no action is taken against the culprit in the absence of effective statutory/legal scheme for providing mandatory compensatory relief and to prosecute the fake complainants”.Noting that false cases often lead to suicides of innocent men, he submitted that the State was responsible for the tortuous acts of its employees (Police and Prosecution) and must repair the damage done to citizens by its officers, by adequate monetary and non-monetary compensation.Lives of the families of those falsely implicated in such cases were destroyed after years of delayed trial which only got aggravated by reluctance to take penal action against misconduct of investigating officers and vexatious complainants, he contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kapil-mishra-moves-sc-seeks-compensation-for-up-man-falsely-implicated-in-rape-case-225181

I want a law guaranteeing the minimum support price for various crops,” said Tikait.He said he was not going to sit in Delhi alone but was planning to visit all over the country, including Madhya Pradesh on March 14 and 15, Ganga Nagar in Rajasthan on March 17, Ghazipur’s UP Gate border in Delhi on March 18, Odisha on March 19 and Karnataka on March 21 and 22.During his visit here, Tikait also garlanded a statue of his late father and farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait at Tikait Park in Jhalwa near here.The BKU spokesperson claimed the three central laws will lead to the closure of all small-time neighbourhood shops, leaving only big commercial malls to survive.“These farm laws will ruin traders and lead to the closure of small business utilities and the collapse of small industries. These laws will bring in big multinational firms like Wallmart,” claimed Tikait.“Had this government belonged to a political party, it would have talked to farmers and resolved the matter,” Tikait said.“But this government is being run by big business houses. It is bent upon selling the entire country,” he alleged. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-stir-may-continue-till-december-rakesh-tikait-225152

We believe there is no human problem which cannot be resolved with human wisdom pregnant with mutual respect and equality as Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often quoted. We are for peace and progress,” the statement said.However, the NSCN-IM made it clear that “any formulation or proposal from any quarter which is outside the parameter of the framework agreement shall not be acceptable to the NSCN in particular and the Naga people in general”.The Central government recently had told Parliament that talks with the NSCN-IM and other Naga groups are at an advance stage but did not give details of the negotiations, nor any timeframe to complete the dialogue.The framework agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland which started soon after India’s Independence.However, the talks with the NSCN-IM is currently going nowhere as the group has been insisting for a separate Naga flag and constitution, a demand rejected by the Central government.

14-03-2021||Patna||Kushwaha merges RLSP with JD(U), gets rewarded with top party post by Nitish||Bihar’s ruling JD(U) on Sunday received a shot in the arm with the merger of RLSP of Upendra Kushwaha, a former protege of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who came back under his wing nine years after having fallen apart.The merger took place at the JD(U) state headquarters here, where the chief minister welcomed Kushwaha, a former Union minister, by presenting him with a bouquet.Top JD(U) leaders like Rajeev Ranjan Singh alias Lalan, Sanjay Kumar Jha and Vashisth Narayan Singh and key office bearers of the now dissolved RLSP like Madhaw Anand and Fazl Imam Mallick were also present.The much-anticipated reunion, likely to be mutually beneficial, comes on the back of hectic parleys between the two leaders in the recent past.Soon after he was inducted into the JD(U), Kumar announced Kushwaha’s appointment as the national parliamentary board president “with immediate effect”.Kushwaha, who brings on table his support base of the sizeable Koeri caste, vowed to make the JD(U) “the number one party” in Bihar and said that after having been witness to “many ups and downs” as the RLSP founding chief, he looked forward to making use of his experience under the guidance of Nitish Kumar.Kushwaha was in political wilderness since his exit from NDA in 2017. Feeling “stifled” in the RJD-led Grand Alliance, he quit the coalition ahead of the assembly elections last year and ended up facing political isolation notwithstanding the support of his Koeri community which is the second most populous OBC group in Bihar after the Yadavas.Kumar, who is serving his fourth consecutive term in power, has suffered a diminution in clout on account of the JD(U)’s unimpressive performance in the assembly elections which saw him lose the upper hand to the BJP.The chief minister, who has since relinquished the post of the JD(U) president, nonetheless enjoys supreme control over the party and has been busy consolidating his Luv-Kush (Kurmi-Koeri) base, in a bid to hold his own against the BJP juggernaut.Kumar himself is a Kurmi, a caste that is numerically small but very influential by virtue of being economically and educationally advanced.After cutting his teeth as a youth leader in the Lok Dal and Janata Dal, Kushwaha went on to become the deputy leader in the state assembly of the Samata Party, a breakaway group which Kumar had formed along with veteran socialist leader George Fernandes.By 2004, after the JD(U)  an entity formed with the merger of Samata Party with Janata Dal’s splinter group headed by Sharad Yadav  emerged as the senior NDA partner, Kushwaha became the Leader of the Opposition.He got expelled from the JD(U) for anti-party activities in 2007, but was re-inducted two years later. He was rewarded with a Rajya Sabha seat but ambition got the better of him in 2013 when he fell apart with Kumar once again and floated the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party.The BJP-led NDA, which was then desperate for new allies in the wake of the exit of Kumar, welcomed Kushwaha and his fledgling party won three seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, riding the Modi wave.Kushwaha himself was appointed the Minister of State for HRD, a post he held till his exit from the NDA.Meanwhile, Ashok Choudhary, one of the closest aides of the chief minister, summed up the buoyancy in JD(U) camp.“It is being increasingly clear to all that the future belongs to the brand of politics popularised by Nitish Kumar.In the recent past, many have crossed over.

14-03-2021||Bhubaneswar||US-based group sponsors MBBS studies of 5 underprivileged Odisha students||Impressed with their success by overcoming all odds, a US-based foundation has come forward to finance the MBBS studies of five poor students of Odisha, who are products of ‘Zindagi’ programme run by a non- governmental organisation here, in medical colleges in the state.The scholarship for the five-year MBBS course was awarded by California’s ‘Saloni Heart Foundation’ to the five students who had cracked NEET exam in 2020 and secured admission in medical colleges of Odisha.The students were felicitated on a virtual platform attended by leading medical professionals of the US and founder of the ‘Zindagi Foundation’ Ajay Bahadur Singh on late Saturday evening.The US-based group will also connect these budding doctors with America’s leading paediatric cardiologists and paediatric cardiothoracic surgeons through the mentoring programme.The Bhubaneswar-based Zindagi Foundation provides coaching, food, lodging and study material, free of cost, to medical aspirants from poor financial backgrounds.All 19 students of the organisation have successfully qualified for NEET 2020 and many of them have got admission into prestigious medical colleges.The ‘Saloni Heart Foundation’ began the programme last year by financing studies of Krishna Mohanty, a poor fatherless girl from Odisha.Those selected in the current year are Kshirodini Sahoo, Subhendu Parida, Debashish Biswal, Mrutyunjaya Tripathy and Brutti Sundar Behera.Hailing from disadvantaged backgrounds, the selected students are children of landless farmers, daily labourers, vegetable sellers, roadside vendors, with most of the families hardly getting two square meals a day.Despite the challenges, these five students performed excellently in NEET 2020 and secured seats in prestigious government medical colleges of the coastal state.Fourteen students of Zindagi Foundation had cracked the medical entrance test in 2018 and 12 of them had got admitted to government medical institutions in Odisha.Speaking at the event, Singh said, “These students come from very poor background and their families barely manage to have proper meals every day. We provide them all facilities free of cost and help them realise their dream of becoming doctors.“Families of these students are not in a position to afford even the nominal fees of government medical colleges and their happiness converts into sorrow.“We approached some groups like Saloni Heart Foundation who have taken the responsibility to cover expenses for their studies, food and hostel accomodation during the entire five-year MBBS course,” he said.Noting that the challenge was more severe this time because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Singh, himself an academician said, “We did not let the spirit of the students dip and provided all assistance to help them crack the difficult NEET exam.”The scholarship amount is transferred to the bank accounts of the students directly to ensure complete transparency, he said.Singh, the man behind the Zindagi programme, was a brilliant student and wanted to become a doctor.However, he had to quit studies due to sudden illness of his father and start earning to meet the medical expenses of his ailing father.Navigating through severe financial difficulties, he even sold tea and ‘sharbet’ (squash) at Deogarh Shravani Mela in Jharkhand in the early 90s to sustain his family after the death of his father due to kidney ailment.“I could not become a doctor myself but I live my dreams through them,” he said.Saloni Heart Foundation was started by Milli and Himanshu Seth after the death of their daughter Saloni due to a heart ailment at the age of 13 in 2018.Saloni had a history of congenital heart disease and wanted to become a cardio-thoracic surgeon.Himanshu Seth said, “Saloni had aspired to become a doctor, but unfortunately left us at an early age. By financing MBBS studies of these poor students we want to see a Saloni in them.”The felicitation ceremony was also attended by world renowned doctors Dr. V M Reddy, P. Venugopal, Padma Bhushan awardee, ex-director and Head of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, AIIMS and Ketan Patel, Managing Director HP India.

14-03-2021||Mumbai||NIA taking over SUV case amounts to demoralising Mumbai Police: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday alleged that the NIA taking over the probe into the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence here amounted to demoralising the Mumbai Police and creating instability in Maharashtra.Talking to reporters here, Raut also said Mumbai Police officer Sachin Waze, who was arrested late Saturday night by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), is an “honest, successful officer and a good investigator”.“The state government’s prestige is at stake in this case,” the Rajya Sabha member said.A Scorpio found parked near Ambani’s house on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai on February 25 contained some gelatin sticks and a threat letter.Waze, an “encounter specialist”, is also facing heat in the murder case of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the Scorpio. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane district on March 5.The state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is investigating the Hiran murder case. It had registered an FIR against unidentified persons days after Hiran’s body was found.Raut said the Mumbai Police were capable of investigating both the cases and involvement of central agencies “wasn’t required”.“They (Mumbai Police) are capable and professional.They can’t be pressurised. The NIA taking over the probe amounts to creating pressure and terror of the central government bylowering the morale of the police and destabilising the state,” he alleged.The Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson further charged that Waze’s arrest by the NIA amounted to encroaching upon the rights of the police and an attack on their capabilities.Raut said state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had handed over the probe to the ATS, but the NIA entered the scene to probe the recovery of 20 gelatin sticks in the Scorpio.To a question on sections under which Waze has been charged, Raut said, “There is a difference between charges being levelled and the charges being proved.”              “The state government’s prestige is at stake in this case,” he further said.Raut also said the government should take “very seriously” the issue of sensitive information reaching the opposition leaders first.The opposition should explain what the CBI’s probe found into the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death which the Mumbai Police had not investigated.Meanwhile, Home Minister Deshmukh told reporters in Nagpur that the ATS and NIA were probing the recovery of the explosives-laden vehicle and the case of Hiran’s death.“The truth will come out and action will be taken accordingly,” he said.When asked if Waze would be suspended, Deshmukh did not many any comment.

But now, the situation has improved. There cannot be any better news than the prevailing of peace in the region," he said.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed charge in 2014, the Centre had taken a resolve to end terrorism and insurgency, Singh, who was the Union Home Minister during the Adivasi killings, said."The condition in Assam has improved a lot. The state is on the path of progress," the senior BJP leader said.He said the BJP-led government has sealed a major portion of the India-Bangladesh border and installed electronic surveillance along the riverine stretch."We have sealed the international border in Dhubri.Whatever little stretch is left unfenced will be completely seated after the BJP returns to power in Assam," he said.Singh said the BJP government in Tripura is also working towards stopping illegal immigration from the neighbouring country.He was campaigning for sitting BJP MLA Promod Borthakur, who will have a direct contest with Congress nominee Anjan Borah in Biswanath seat that is going to polls in the first phase on March 27. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/terrorism-insurgency-on-decline-in-assam-state-on-path-of-progress-rajnath-225116
14-03-2021||New Delhi||No govt communication ever threatened social media platforms' staff of jail term: IT Ministry||The government has never threatened employees of any social media platform, such as Twitter, of jail term, the IT Ministry has said.Reacting to reports that alluded to Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter employees being threatened with a jail term, the Ministry said social media platforms are "obliged to follow the laws of India and the Constitution of India, just like all other businesses in India have to.""As has been conveyed on the floor of Parliament, users of social media can criticise the government, the Prime Minister or any Minister but the promotion of violence, rampant communal divide and stoking the flames of terrorism will have to be reflected upon," it said.The government had ordered Twitter to take down hundreds of posts, accounts and hashtags, that it saw violating rules. Twitter initially did not fully comply but fell in line after the government showed the rule book that contained penal provisions.The IT Ministry went on to state that the recent guidelines pertaining to social media simply require the platforms to put in place a robust grievance redressal mechanism for users."None of the government communications, either written or oral, have ever threatened the employees of any of the social media platforms of jail term," it said."The government welcomes criticism and dissent. However, of late, repeated instances of abuse of social media to foment hate, discord and violence by terrorist groups from outside India and circulation of morphed images of women, revenge porn posing threat to the safety of users especially women users have become grave concerns," it said.

It is like a thunderbolt from the blue to them.""With the ruling TMC in total disarray looking for a straw to clutch, and the Sanyukt Morcha of the Left-Congress-Indian Secular Front in jitters, there is a strong possibility of them forming unholy nexus at a subterranean level to halt the triumphal march of the BJP," Zafar Islam said and added that the situation, however, has spun out of their control.He said a section of the Muslim voters will give the lie to the BJP's opponents by supporting it during the elections. There will be a three-way split in the minority votes: for the BJP, TMC and the Sanyuk Morcha.Islam is among the BJP leaders from a minority background who have been assigned election duties in the state.Muslims preponderate the demographic profile in about 80-90 assembly seats. They had been a pillar of strength for the TMC. Constituting about 23 per cent population of the state, they helped it a big way to dominate the state's political landscape.Zafar Islam said that the community has now realised that the TMC, the Left and the Congress have been making vacuous promises all through these years.They had been raising the BJP bogey to the Muslims to exploit them for their votes."The equitable delivery of the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre has started dawning among the Muslims in West Bengal, as in other states. They see the Prime Minister as a symbol of hope and development, and an inspirational figure," Zafar Islam said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-has-firmed-up-poll-strategy-for-bengal-elections-syed-zafar-islam-225110

14-03-2021|| New Delhi||DU online exams: Important do's and don'ts||Online exams are scheduled to begin in Delhi University from March 15. The students have been asked to take care of technical things like download, upload, password, internet network, more than the answers to the questions.Many times, hundreds of students get entangled in technical matters. To overcome this confusion, a special team has now been formed, which includes professors and students knowing about online book exams.On March 15, online book examinations of the first-year students are going to start. About 1.25 lakh students will appear online. For the first time, this team of professors and students will provide solutions to the problems related to the examination of students of Delhi University sitting in the online book exam. Students of colleges, non-collegiate and SOL will get benefit from this.The team has been formed by the Delhi Teachers Association (DTA) and student organisation CYSS. The committee includes those teachers and students who have information related to the university examination. The committee consists of Hansraj Suman as convenor and Kamal Tiwari as covalent. Assistant Professors Sunil Kumar, Manoj Kumar Singh and Narendra Pandey are also part of this committee.Professor Hansraj told IANS, "Students have been instructed to first go to the university's website and download their admit cards to get the information related to taking the exam. Please do any work related to the exam with your registered email id. The students will be required to download the question papers and upload answer sheets with the same email id from which they have filled the examination form."Professor Sunil Kumar said, "It is mandatory to remember your email ID and its password before the exam, write it down somewhere or remember it. While submitting the PDF of the answer sheet, keep in mind that it should not be password protected, otherwise the checker will not be able to open and evaluate it."Students will have to create a separate PDF for every answer which should not be greater than 7MB in size. For instance -- If a student attempts four questions, he or she will have to create four PDFs for every answer with the size of up to 7MB each, he said.Giving information related to the exam, the committee's co-convenor Kamal Tiwari said that the students will get 3 hours to complete their question paper and one hour to upload the answers.Differently-abled students will get a total of 6 hours. Students are advised to use the uploading time only for uploading, otherwise, they might have to face trouble due to network issues at the last moment. Hence, students should take care of the time.Another important step that the student must follow, is to take a screenshot at every stage of the examination. Keep the screenshot of every question and its answer that you are giving, Moreover, if you receive the acknowledgement slip after submitting your answer then take a screenshot of it too because in any case of unsuccessful upload the varsity and college may ask you for the screenshot as proof. These screenshots would also help you in case of a wrong evaluation.Students are informed that sometimes they face problems while uploading the PDFs due to network issues. If it happens then they are advised to take screenshots of that too and upload the proof with the answer PDFs. The university is giving you one hour extra for only the right uploading.After submitting all the PDFs when the acknowledgement slip appears, it means the papers have been submitted.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/du-online-exams-important-dos-and-donts-225057

The potential financer and distributor Mr. Uttam Maheshwari, who had come on board, sent my docket to Kangana. It had my script, characterisation, possible cast—everything.""For the last three years, all I have done is dream about this film and worked towards it. Now I am in major loss because I was already in talks with production houses," Kaul added.He revealed that he had sent a mail to Kangana informing her of the copyright violation but was met with a holding response that they would reply to his mail.When contacted, Kangana Ranaut's advocate Rizwan Siddiquee said: "I shall obtain a copy of the entire proceedings from the court and then give a detailed statement.

Inspector Bela Pappu Singh said, "During interrogation, Rajesh, a farmer by profession, admitted to his involvement in the crime and revealed that he had victimised over 100 girls and women across the state for personal satisfaction." The complainants told police they had been getting incessant calls and messages from two numbers, which the accused was using. Police said he had contacts of more than 200 women in his phones at the time of his arrest.Police about his modus-operandi said the accused would allegedly dial different combinations of numbers.If a girl or woman picked up, he would save the number. Later, he would allegedly dial again and force the girls and women to indulge with him in vulgar talks.Inspector, Women Power Line, Ajay Pal, said, "He was harassing girls and women since 2018. Initially, Women Power Line, after tracking down his number following numerous complaints, also tried to counsel him, but in vain, and he continued with his misdeeds."A case under sections 354 D 2 (whoever commits the offence of stalking), 294 (obscene acts and songs), 504 (whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person, intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation will cause him to break the public peace, or to commit any other offence) and 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of IPC has been lodged against him, and he has been sent to jail. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/51-year-old-up-man-facing-66-harassment-complaints-arrested-225051

Democracy does not mean holding elections at regular intervals. It also means the elected leaders are accountable to the people. The country is not in safe hands.”In 1999, when the Indian Airlines plane was hijacked by terrorists and flown to Kandahar, Mamata, then a minister in the NDA government, had offered herself in exchange for Indian hostages and was “prepared to make any sacrifice for the country”, he said.“There is a world of difference between this BJP and the BJP of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Atalji believed in consensus, while the BJP of today believes in crushing everyone. Atalji courted people, the BJP today conquers people,” he said. Farmers and workers were suffering under the BJP rule, he alleged.“The Bengal elections will send a message to the entire country.

Naidu cautioned the Opposition against overusing the adjournment notice. “The House has frequently run into problems due to repeated recourse to certain rules, nowadays to Rule 267, seeking suspension of business to take up a certain subject.Rule 267 is a ‘Brahmastra’. It should be used rarely,” said the Vice President, admonishing MPs not to bring religion, region, caste and creed to Parliament.“Irrespective of religion and region we are Bharatiyas. We must act accordingly,” he said, citing how an Indian student had to resign from an Oxford University position due to “racial discrimination.”He said there were misconceptions about privileges. “Anyone can be arrested, but the Chair has to be informed in 24 hours. If someone obstructs you from discharging your responsibility, then there is a privilege. But if you criticise each other, you can’t claim a privilege,” said the Rajya Sabha Vice President.Amid Opposition charge that the farm laws were rammed through the Rajya Sabha, Naidu told MPs that they had the power to block a legislation provided they had the numbers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/criticism-shouldnt-hurt-india-naidus-tip-to-new-rajya-sabha-mps-224896
14-03-2021||---||Quad summit may kill vision of  ‘Asian Century’||New Delhi, March 13The Quad may or may not gravitate to a higher calling in joint cooperation such as emerging technologies but it may have snuffed out the visions of an “Asian Century” envisaged by non-western leaning strategists in Asia. Proponents of this outlook suggest that the era of western domination since the 19th and 20th centuries is ending and the time has come for the resurgence of Asia.Optimists like Kishore Mehbubani still hold the view that the pandemic will consolidate Asia’s dominance in world affairs and the global economy and their deference to western societies will be replaced by respect for East Asia and India. But with India and China now pulling in different directions after the Galwan valley clash of June 15, the part of Asia extending eastwards of India may be at the mercy of external powers.With the impressive economic growth of China, India and that of Southeast Asian countries, scholars had started talking about 21st century as an Asian century, agrees Dhanajay Tripathi, an expert on international relations at South Asia University.“The Quad summit is the first concrete step in killing the dream of the ‘Asian Century’ — strategic competition in Asia as of now appears unavoidable. Although the key is still with India and China, provided both are willing to resolve their bilateral issues peacefully, he observes. The ‘Asian Century’ is about a united Asia dominating world politics. In the past, both India and China showed a willingness to strengthen their ties. While trade between the two improved over the years, the border dispute remained unresolved.Moreover, the Chinese aggressive posture towards India last summer broke the illusion that there will only be healthy competition between the two. “When India-China political relations remain tense, the Quad summit brings India close to powers interested in checking China’s rise. With Western powers again getting involved in Asia, the concept of the Asian century will lose its attractiveness,” he observes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-summit-may-kill-vision-of-asian-century-224906

But RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last month that there was no need to change the current target band.“The country requires growth at this juncture as it aspires to increase its dominance and self-reliance in the global economy,” he said at a virtual annual regional meeting of the CII, Eastern Region.In other words, the Centre does not want the RBI to tighten the monetary policy to control inflation by raising the interest rate for borrowing from the banks. As inflation has risen, Subramanian has advocated that the RBI should adopt another matrix for measuring it. The observations come ahead of a review on March 31 by the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee of the policy framework and inflation targets.The Chief Economic Adviser has suggested that the RBI should consider adopting core inflation as an indicator, which excludes the impact of food and fuel prices. He has also suggested the need to update the base year of 2011-12.This will be the first review by the RBI since June 2016 when it was asked to frame policies so that the mandated inflation target is 4 per cent with a 2 per cent deviation either way.“At this juncture we must focus on growth and when it comes to pressures for trade-offs, we must be leaning on growth,” Subramanian said.Indirectly seeking a change, he said the RBI’s tools mainly addressed demand-side factors but the current inflation target was affected by food prices, which was largely dependent on supply-side measures.Earlier, he had suggested reviewing household consumption items for the collection of monthly consumer price data to reflect the change in consumption patterns. He said healthcare studies for Auyushman Bharat had shown that rates of the private sector hospitals were six to seven times higher than government hospitals.Centre’s stanceWhat Guv said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-rbi-at-odds-over-relaxing-inflation-target-224913

It did not happen so the ordinance is lapsed, hence the commission is dissolved,” Gupta said.The commission was headed by MM Kutty, former secretary to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.Official sources from the ministry said they will try to introduce the ordinance in the next session of Parliament and in the meantime, the state pollution control board and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will be the supervising authorities.Faced with rising air pollution in Delhi-NCR, the Centre had introduced the ordinance that put in place the commission and provided for up to five years of jail term and Rs 1 crore fine for violators with immediate effect.Under the ordinance released by the Ministry of Law and Justice on October 28, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) was dissolved and replaced by the commission.The 20-member commission was set up under the ordinance, which was signed by the president on October 28, to ensure strict compliance.The commission had the power to lay down parameters of air quality, parameters of discharge of environmental pollutants, inspect premises violating the law, ordering closure of non-abiding industries/plants, etc.“The ordinance may be called the Commission for Air Quality Management. In National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance 2020. It shall apply to national capital region and also adjoining areas in so far as it relates to matters concerning air pollution in the NCR. It shall come into force at once,” the ordinance had said.As per the ordinance, the areas where it was in force included Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, adjoining areas of the NCR and Delhi where any source of pollution was located.The commission had the power to restrict any industry, operations or processes or class of industries that could have implications on air quality in the region. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-panel-for-air-quality-management-in-ncr-shuts-down-within-5-months-of-formation-224745
14-03-2021||Bengaluru||Pronounced guilty, not in court of law, but by TRP seekers: Disha Ravi||Climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested in connection with allegedly being involved in sharing a “toolkit” on social media related to the farmers’ protest and released on bail later, wondered on Saturday when it became a crime to think of sustenance on earth.“Locked in my cell, I wondered when it became a crime to think the most basic elements of sustenance on this planet were as much mine as theirs,” the 22-year-old activist from Bengaluru said in her four-page statement posted on Twitter.Wondering why were millions paying the ultimate price for the greed of a few hundred, Ravi said the human race would be inching closer to its own expiry “if we did not act in time to stop the endless consumption and greed.”The activist claimed during her arrest her autonomy was violated and her photographs were splashed all over the news.“My actions were pronounced guilty—not in the court of law, but on flat screens by seekers of TRPs,” Ravi lamented.Expressing her gratitude to the people who came out in her support and fought her case pro bono (term usually refers to services that are rendered by a professional for free or at a lower cost), she said the past few days had been painful.“I was lucky enough to have excellent pro bono legal assistance but what of all those who do not? What of all those still in jail whose stories are not marketable? What of the marginalised that are not worthy of your screen time?” Ravi argued.Underlining that truth, no matter how long it took, always revealed itself, the activist quoted Soni Sori, an activist from the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh, who said, “We are threatened every day, our voices crushed; but we will continue to fight.”Ravi, who hails from Bengaluru, was arrested on charges of sedition by the Delhi police on February 16.She was arrested for allegedly sharing and editing a document intended to amplify the protests against the new farm laws.The ‘toolkit’, a common term used by social activists for campaign material, was also tweeted by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.In its order granting Ravi bail on February 23, a Delhi court said there was nothing on record to suggest that Ravi “subscribed to any secessionist idea”.“The offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the governments,” the court order read.

14-03-2021||---||SKM’s Balbir Singh Rajewal says PM Modi bigger threat to India than Pakistan||New Delhi, March 13The farmers’ agitation that began with an apolitical agenda, one to get the three farm laws repealed, has turned "political" with senior most leader of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) Balbir Singh Rajewal targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Rajewal, the most respected face of the SKM, the umbrella unit of over 40 Kisan Unions, has kicked off a political storm after saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a bigger threat to India than Pakistan.Rajewal, who was addressing a gathering at Nandigram, which will see a pitched battle between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and former TMC MLA and now BJP’s firebrand leader Suvendu Mukherjee, also asked the voters to vote for anyone but the Bharatiya Janata Party.“BJP only knows vote ki Rajniti. You possess a great weapon called a vote. Please don’t give that vote to Modi. Give your vote to anyone, rather give it to a winning candidate but please don’t vote for Modi,” 77-year-old said addressing the Kisan Mahapanchayat in Nandigram on Saturday.“Modi is the biggest threat to our country. We are not threatened by Pakistan or any other country. But Modi is our biggest threat,” he added.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had also requested the voters to not vote for the BJP ahead of the SKM’s three-day campaign in West Bengal. Ironically, Tikait’s faction is called BKU (Arajnaitik).Rajewal also touched the topic of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) from the same stage. “There is another issue of the EVM. We are thinking of doing something about it once the Kisan Andolan gets over,” he added.Rajewal’s outburst is part of the anti-BJP campaign currently being undertaken by the SKM in poll-bound states. On Friday, the SKM had issued an open letter to the farmers and citizens of West Bengal asking them to teach ‘arrogant government’ a lesson.Yogendra Yadav read the open letter that would be circulated in all of the 294 constituencies in West Bengal.“…The BJP government without consulting the farmers brought the three laws which will not only destroy our produce but also our next generations. They called us brokers, anti-nationals and even terrorists. We were peppered with water cannons, we were lathicharged and were framed in false cases. Because of all these atrocities I want your help. Elections are being held in Bengal. BJP does not bother about good or bad, constitutional or unconstitutional acts. It only understands one language that is of vote, seat and power,” the letter stated.“Shaheed Bhagat Singh had once said we need a bomb to shake up the British. Similarly, to wake the BJP out of its slumber we need to hurt them with votes. Please do this job for me. BJP is desperate to win in Bengal. If farmers of Bengal punish them in these elections, it will teach them a lesson. If BJP loses in Bengal then it will bring down their arrogance and Modiji will be forced to hear farmers. I am hopeful that you will keep my request in mind when you go to vote,” the letter added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/skms-balbir-singh-rajewal-says-pm-modi-bigger-threat-to-india-than-pakistan-224730

During the investigation, the location of the phone was traced near Delhi's Tihar Jail, the officer had said.The Delhi government has sought a report from the director general of prisons regarding the recovery of the mobile phone from Tihar Jail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ambani-bomb-scare-cops-reach-tihar-jail-to-question-terror-convict-on-mobile-phone-recovery-224684

14-03-2021||Mumbai||Ambani house SUV case fallout: Cop hints at 'suicide'||In a startling development, a Mumbai police official who has been under fire in the case pertaining to the SUV found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's home and the subsequent mystery death of a Thane businessman Mansukh Hiren, has hinted at ending his life, here on Saturday.In an ominous WhatsApp status early Saturday, Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze—who is likely to be probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS)—has claimed he was sought to be implicated in a similar incident earlier.Despite repeated attempts by police officers and mediapersons, including IANS, Vaze remained incommunicado about his social media status, foxing all.In a short update, an apparently disturbed Vaze has hinted at the possibility of ending his life as the case investigations get underway, saying: "I think the time to say goodbye to the world is coming closer.""3rd March 2004. Fellow officers from the CID arrested me in a false case. That arrest inconclusive till date. Sensing history is going to repeat," said Vaze on his status."My fellow officers are on to falsely trap me. There's a slight difference in the scenario. Then probably I had 17 years of hope, patience, life and service too," Vaze said.The controversial police official added that now he would neither have 17 years of further life or service, "nor patience to live", and "I think the time to say goodbye to the world is coming closer".Shunted out of the elite Crime Intelligence Unit of Mumbai Police's Crime Branch, Vaze's status check created waves in media and police circles even as he has applied for an anticipatory bail in the ATS's probe into the death of Hiren, which will come up for hearing in Thane Sessions Court on March 19. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ambani-house-suv-case-fallout-cop-hints-at-suicide-224680
14-03-2021||New Delhi||Air travellers violating Covid protocol despite warnings to be treated as 'unruly passengers': DGCA||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Saturday issued a circular, asking airport authorities, and airline operators to "ensure passengers, without fail, wear masks", and "maintain social distancing norms", and in case if any norms are violated, the passenger would be "dealt as per the law" and would be declared "unruly passenger".  The move comes after the Delhi High Court directed DGCA that passengers travelling on flights without wearing face mask properly can be offloaded by cabin crew.In the order, the DGCA said: “Passengers should be de-boarded if they don’t wear a mask properly inside aircraft or don’t follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. If a passenger violates protocol despite repeated warning then he/she should be treated like an unruly passenger.”Talking about COVID-19 protocols, the DGCA added: “Essentially involves wearing a mask properly that is not blow the nose, during all times of the journey from entering the airport for departure to exiting the airport after arrival.”    As people are failing to adhere to COVID-19 protocol, the DGCA has ordered the CISF, and other police personnel deployed at the airport entrance, to "ensure that no one is allowed to enter the airport without wearing a mask". “Chief Aviation Security officers (CASO), and other supervising officers must ensure this personally,” it added.“The airport director or terminal manager, as applicable, must ensure that passengers are wearing masks properly and maintain social distance at all times within the airport premises. In case any passenger is not following the protocol they should be handed over to the security agency after proper warning. If required, they may be dealt as per law.”Notably, on Tuesday, the Delhi High Court had directed the DGCA to make its guidelines "widely" known, and ensure "strict" adherence was ensured.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-travellers-violating-covid-protocol-despite-warnings-to-be-treated-as-unruly-passengers-dgca-224676

We have asked the state administration to furnish more details”.In the report the state government referred to the presence of a huge crowd at the spot but did not mention about the “4-5 people”, who Banerjee alleged had attacked her, the officials said.After the incident, the ECI had sought a report from the state government and appointed two poll observers for the state.The eight-phase elections to the 294-member assembly will be held from March 27 to April 29 and results will be declared on May 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/observers-report-to-ec-says-mamatas-injury-accidental-224674

Democracy does not mean merely holding elections at regular intervals but also that the elected are accountable to the people.” He said the condition of the country is visible to all. “Farmers are agitated. Labourers had to migrate in distress and continue to suffer. Institutions, including the judiciary, have been weakened. And the government is unfazed,” said Sinha, whose son Jayant Sinha was MoS Finance under the Modi-led BJP government’s first term.Sinha said the ruling party’s sole agenda is electoral victory, no matter what the level.He also explained why he quit the BJP-led NDA after serving as minister in the Atal Behari Vajpayee government from 1998 to 2004.“There is a world of difference between the BJP of Atal Behari Vajpayee’s times and today’s. Atalji believed in consensus. Today, the party believes in crushing everyone. Atalji courted people, these people are capturing people. Atal Bihari ji’s coalition had Akali Dal in Punjab, Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, TDP in Andhra Pradesh, AIADMK and DMK at separate times in Tamil Nadu, BJD in Odisha, TMC in Bengal, AGP in Assam, JDU in Bihar. Atal ji formed a truly national coalition. He never believed in crushing parties and occupying the vacuum hence created,” said Sinha.The TMC leaders hailed Sinha’s entry as a shot in the arm of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who has been recently hit by the exit of party heavyweights including Suvendu Adhikari.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yashwant-sinha-joins-tmc-says-democracy-under-bjp-is-in-danger-224665
