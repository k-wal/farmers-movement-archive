04-03-2021||New Delhi||Left Front-Congress-ISF agree on seat-sharing formula ahead of West Bengal elections||The CPI(M)-led Left Front, the Congress and the Indian Secular Front (ISF) of Muslim cleric Abbas Siddiqui in West Bengal have almost finalised the seat-sharing formula for the eight-phase election to the 294-seat Assembly in the state.The three have formed an alliance in West Bengal to take on the ruling TMC and the resurgent BJP.Sources in the Left said a formal announcement on sharing of the seats is expected by end of this week.The nitty-gritty of the poll strategy, including sharing of seats, were broadly agreed upon during a meeting of leaders of Left Front, Congress and ISF in Kolkata on Tuesday.The sources said that although some minor changes in the number of seats to be shared among the constituents cannot be ruled out, the leaders have broadly agreed on the formula.As per the understanding, the ISF will contest on about 38 seats, although Siddiqui had pitched for 45 seats.The Congress will be allotted about 92 seats.Among the Left Front constituents, the CPI(M) will contest between 117-120 seats, the CPI about 11, the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB) about 14 seats and the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) about 11 seats.There could be a slight change regarding seat allotment among the constituents in the Left Front.Sources said that the alliance will also declare its policy statement which would be a kind of Common Minimum Programme (CMP).In a related development, the Left Front is mindful of the possibility of Hyderabad-based Asaduddin Owasi’s All India Majlis Ittehad-e Muslimeen(AIMIM) entering the election fray and putting up candidates in Muslim-dominated assembly constituencies.The Muslim section of the population is a factor in about 80-90 constituencies and had been instrumental in shoring up TMC’s fortunes.In the 2016 Assembly election, the CPI(M) had contested 148 seats and won 26. The CPI contested 11 and won one. The AIFB contested 25 and won two. The RSP contested 19 and won three.The Congress had contested at 92 seats and won 44.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-front-congress-isf-agree-on-seat-sharing-formula-ahead-of-west-bengal-elections-220417

Later, he was found to be in possession with a motorbike, which was reportedly stolen on Sunday. He was later handed over to Kaushambi police.Dharmendra was reportedly staying at the site for the past three months.Earlier that day, another youth had to be evicted for slapping a woman rag picker. In another incident on Tuesday, a laptop was reportedly stolen from a tent.Such incidences have heightened tensions at the protest site.BKU’s Uttar Pradesh chief Rajbir Singh Jadaun said his organization would not stand with any of such anti-social elements.“Dharmendra said he has been here for a long time. We found in his possession a bike, which was stolen. He was later handed over to the police. We are very clear about one thing that we have no space for anti-social elements among us,” Jadaun told The Tribune.“We have also seen cases where outsiders come here to harass the media to bring bad name to the agitation. Our volunteers are alert to all such incidents as we have to deal with drunkards as well. We have to keep a watch and remove them,” the BKU leader added.Jadaun said the BKU would act tough against their own activists and supporters if they were found to be unruly or involved in any scuffle.“We don’t care if someone is from the BKU or not. If he/she is creating a ruckus, they will be asked to leave immediately. Our supporters are not like them. But having said that, such people when caught will always come up with a stories claiming that they have political affiliations or connections. But like I said, we are very clear that anti-social elements will not be tolerated in this protest site,” the BKU leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drunkards-thefts-has-ghazipur-border-on-high-alert-220414

04-03-2021|| New Delhi||No woman, only one man from reserved category among 10 wealthiest MLAs in West Bengal||The disreputable bhadralok–chhotolok division in West Bengal was reflected in an analysis of the financial backgrounds of the sitting MLAs of the state. Two organisations – Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) and West Bengal Election Watch – have jointly produced the report covering various aspects of the state’s sitting MLAs.The list of the 10 wealthiest MLAs, prepared on the basis of asset affidavits filed by candidates with their nominations forms, contained the names of six who fall in the category of what is popularly known as 'bhadralok' in Bengal. Being an upper caste is a pre-requisite for membership of this elite group who have a disproportionately high representation in professions and businesses.Three of the wealthiest – holding second, third and sixth positions, respectively, on the list – are Muslims. James Kujur, who represents a constituency reserved for Schedules Tribes (ST), is the only Christian on the list of 10 richest MLAs.Topping the list of wealthiest MLAs is a Brahmin man, Samir Chakraborty, who declared total assets of over Rs 40 crore. There are two more Brahmins on the list. Except for Kujur, who worked in the commercial taxes department and then with the police before he joined politics, none of the other wealthiest MLAs belong to any of the reserved categories. Kujur remained a minister until removal from the post by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. There is not a single woman among the ten wealthiest MLAs. The wealthiest MLAs are all from the ruling TMC. Given the fact that TMC has an overwhelming presence in the House (206 among 284 MLAs, 10 seats are vacant), it is perhaps not all that surprising that the ten wealthiest MLAs are all from one party.The chhotolok (lowly people) in Bengal derives directly from the caste system prevalent in the local Hindu society. Sure enough, the list of ten MLAs with the lowest assets contained the names of seven legislators representing various reserved constituencies. While four of the seven belong to STs, the remaining three are belong to SCs.The poorest MLA, however, is a Muslim. Ibrahim Ali, CPI(M) MLA, has assets worth Rs 49,000 only. TMC has a strong presence in this list too having seven in the list of ten poorest MLAs. Two in the list are from CPI(M) while one is from Congress. There are two women on the list of the 10 poorest MLAs. Pratima Rajak, Congress MLA from Burwan (SC) seat, declared assets worth Rs four lakhs only. Jyostna Mandi, TMC MLA from Ranibandh (ST) constituency, reported assets worth less than Rs 2 lakhs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-woman-only-one-man-from-reserved-category-among-10-wealthiest-mlas-in-west-bengal-220403

The Gujarat Vidhan Sabha has 182 seats. The state goes to the polls next year.AAP wins MCD bypollsAam Aadmi Party on Wednesday swept the MC bypolls in Delhi, winning four of the five seats.

A Congress MLA and kin of senior party leaders faced defeat in these elections,” he pointed out.“This is a vote for development and also an endorsement of the farm laws and agri reforms.

There is nothing in the statement (of Abdullah) which we find so offensive as to give a cause of action for a court to initiate proceedings,” a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said.Noting the petitioners had nothing to do with the issue, the Bench said, “This is clearly a case of publicity interest litigation for the petitioners to get their names in the Press.”It imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the petitioners and ordered them to deposit the amount in the Supreme Court Advocates Welfare Fund within four weeks, saying, "We must discourage such endeavours.” Petitioners Rajat Sharma and Dr Neh Srivastava of Vishwa Guru India Vision of Sardar Patel alleged Abdullah was trying to “hand over” Kashmir to China and thus, he should be prosecuted for sedition.“He (Abdullah) made the statement that for restoring Article 370, he would take help of China. This clearly amounts to seditious act and, therefore, he is liable to be punished under Section 124-A of the IPC,” the petitioners said.The special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked on August 5, 2019, and political leaders of the erstwhile state, including Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others, were placed under preventive detention.

Nearly 25,800 participants, aged between 18 and 98 years, including 2,433 over 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities, were enrolled.The ICMR said Covaxin’s ability to neutralise the UK variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 has been established.Bharat Biotech said analysis from the National Institute of Virology indicatedthat vaccine-induced antibodies could neutralise the UK variant and other strains.“Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against the pandemic,” Krishna Ella, chairman, Bharat Biotech, said.ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said: “The bench-to-bedside journey of the indigenous vaccine in less than eight months showcases the immense strength of Atmanirbhar Bharat to fight the odds. It is also a testament to India’s emergence as a global vaccine superpower.”With the publication of this data, doubts shrouding Covaxin safety would end. The Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh had refused to use Covaxin until Phase 3 results were available.The AAP-led Delhi Government had also, at the start of the inoculation drive on January 16, supplied Covaxin for health and frontline workers of central hospitals and retained Serum Institute-made Covishield for state hospital staffers, showing distrust in the indigenous shot.

For most of us, that is enough recognition,” observed the former Law Minister, days after Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal said the party was weakening.Khurshid also said the growing dark footprint of communal forces had pushed the Congress into forced errors where it shied away from speaking about minorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-change-goalpost-khurshid-asks-g-23-220251
04-03-2021||New Delhi||Sasikala steps aside from power race; wants AIADMK to unite and defeat DMK||In a surprise development that could impact electoral equations in poll bound Tamil Nadu, former AIADMK chief VK Sasikala quit the power race late Wednesday night and said she was not power hungry.The expelled AIADMK president, who has spent four years in Bengaluru jail on graft charges, urged AIADMK cadres to unite and defeat the DMK.“I will stay away from politics and pray for the golden rule of late J Jayalalitha in Tamil Nadu. I urge all true supporters of J Jayalalitha to prevent the common enemy DMK from coming to power in assembly polls and ensure Amma’s golden rule in Tamil Nadu,” Sasikala said in a letter today.With the power tussle in AIADMK settled, the E Palaniswamy-led outfit can now strongly enter the poll fray in alliance with the BJP.Sasikala’s decision to quit politics also paves the way for the merger of the breakaway faction of AIADMK with the original party.The BJP and the AIADMK are still in talks for seat sharing in the state.All eyes are now on Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran’s next moves.Sasikala, meanwhile, said in her letter that she has never been after power and she never hankered after power even when Jayalalitha was alive.“I pray for J Jayalalitha’s party to win and her legacy to continue,” Sasikala said.Sasikala was released on February 8 on bail and had made attempts to seek a place in Jayalalitha’s legacy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sasikala-steps-aside-from-power-race-wants-aiadmk-to-unite-and-defeat-dmk-220095
04-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Why changing goalposts, Khurshid asks Azad-led G-23 in open letter||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 3Disquiet is growing in the Congress over public stances taken by G-23 led by veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad with former minister Salman Khurshid on Wednesday asking the letter writers why they were changing goal posts and urging them to consider how they would be judged by history.In some plainspeak to Azad and former ministers Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal, Khurshid asked if it was fair to kick the very ladder one has used to climb up in life.“We thought the G-23 made their point and were informed that party elections will be held when appropriate, something they agreed to in their interaction with the Congress President and later at the CWC. But are they changing the goal posts once again with the public display of disquiet or reservations in Jammu and as we are being told, very soon in Haryana?” asked Khurshid telling the G-23 that even the unrewarded, unknown Congress workers cared about democracy.Khurshid quoted US President John Kennedy and said to G-23, “Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country (read party).”He also asked them if it was honourable to be asking what share anyone would have in the India of tomorrow and what credit the party would give us?“Just as the names of national martyrs are engraved on India Gate, there are records in the Congress office where innumerable names are embossed as part of our history. For most of us that is enough recognition,” said the former law minister days after Sharma and Sibal said the party was weakening.Noting that sacrifices could not come with preconditions, Khurshid added, “There are two ways of spending the current dark moments—to count our blessings and the moments of joy and comfort our party has given to us; or else to wing about what we did not receive. If we choose the latter what conviction will we carry with the innumerable workers who continue to hope that the darkness will give way? Besides how will we be judged by history?”He also said the growing dark footprint of communal forces had pushed the Congress into forced errors where it shies away from speaking about minorities and puts on a public display of identifying with the cultural symbols of the majority that have largely been appropriated by the BJP.He asked the G-23 “it is a relevant question whether it is fair to kick the very ladder you have climbed to the top storey of life from where making speeches is easy.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-changing-goalposts-khurshid-asks-azad-led-g-23-in-open-letter-220091
04-03-2021||New Delhi||Govt allows 24x7 COVID vaccination; indigenous Covaxin’s phase-3 trial results show 81 per cent efficacy||The government on Wednesday said it has permitted round-the-clock COVID-19 vaccination as part of efforts to speed-up the immunisation drive which received a fresh boost with the makers of the indigenous Covaxin saying it has shown an interim efficacy of 81 per cent in Phase 3 clinical trials.Easing restrictions, all private hospitals were on Tuesday allowed to give the vaccines if they adhere to the laid down norms, while the 9 am to 5 pm timing was also done away with. More than 1.56 crore (1,56,20,749) vaccine doses have been administered in the country through 3,12,188 sessions since January 16, according to a provisional report till Wednesday 7 am.“The government has lifted the time restriction to increase the speed of vaccination. People can now get vaccinated 24x7 according to their convenience. Prime Minister Narendra Modi understands the value of health as well as the time of citizens,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted in Hindi, a day after he got his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.President Ram Nath Kovind was administered the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at an army hospital in the national capital on Wednesday.Several other prominent people including Union Minister Hardeep Puri, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik and Sikkim Governor Ganga Prasad also received their first jabs.The Indian Council of Medical Research, the country’s apex research body, and Bharat Biotech announced that phase 3 results of Covaxin, developed by them, has shown an interim vaccine efficacy of 81 per cent in preventing COVID-19, and dubbed it as an important milestone in vaccine discovery.“The bench-to-bedside journey of completely indigenous COVID-19 vaccine in less than eight months’ time showcases the immense strength of Atmanirbhar Bharat [self-reliant India] to fight the odds and stand tall in the global public health community.“It is also a testament to India’s emergence as a global vaccine superpower,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR, said on Wednesday.In January, India’s drugs regulator had approved Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for the massive inoculation drive.Read also: Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala continue to see upsurge in Covid casesMaharashtra man dies after getting second dose of Covid vaccineSome questions were raised on the approval to Covaxin as its phase three trial results were awaited, but the company and government authorities had discounted concerns.“Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus. With today’s results from our phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our COVID-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants,” Bharat Biotech Chairman & Managing Director Krishna Ella said.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was administered Covaxin on the very first day of expansion of the inoculation drive to cover people aged 60 and above and those between 45-59 having co-morbidities.Covaxin has been developed on the WHO prequalified vero cell platform which is globally recognised with a well-established track record of safety, the ICMR said.It said Covaxin’s ability to neutralise the UK variant strain of SARS-CoV-2 has also recently been established.“The development and deployment of Covaxin ensures that India has a powerful weapon in its arsenal in a continually evolving pandemic situation and will go a long way in helping us win the war against COVID-19.“The need of the hour is to ensure that people in India continue to receive the vaccine and break the chain of virus transmission,” said Dr Samiran Panda, Head, Epidemiology and Communicable Disease, ICMR and Director, National AIDS Research Institute.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had told a press conference on Tuesday that the timeline of vaccinating the beneficiaries from 9 am to 5 pm has been done away with and it is up to the hospitals to decide whether they want to continue administering the vaccines even after that.“Co-WIN 2.0 does not provide 9 am-5 pm vaccination sessions. It has done away with that timeline. If a hospital has the capacity, the system permits it to do vaccination even after 5 pm in consultation with the state government. This has been briefed both to the state governments as well as the private and government hospitals,” he said.The second dose of the vaccine against COVID-19 was being administered from February 13 for those who have completed 28 days since the receipt of the first dose. The vaccination of frontline workers (FLWs) started on February 2.The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination commenced from March 1 for people over 60 years of age and those aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-allows-24x7-covid-vaccination-indigenous-covaxins-phase-3-trial-results-show-81-per-cent-efficacy-220035

04-03-2021||Mumbai/New Delhi||IT Department raids Taapsee Pannu, Anurag Kashyap, others in tax evasion probe||The Income Tax Department on Wednesday raided premises linked to Bollywood actor Taapsee Pannu and filmmaker Anurag Kashyap as well as his partners who launched the now-dissolved production house Phantom Films, officials said. The searches, part of a tax evasion probe against Phantom Films and carried out across 30 locations in Mumbai and Pune, also covered Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhasish Sarkar and some executives of celebrity and talent management company KWAN, they said.The raids began in the morning and were continuing till evening.The action is part of an investigation against the production house, which was dissolved in 2018, and its then promoters Kashyap, director-producer Vikramaditya Motwane, producer Vikas Bahl and producer-distributor Madhu Mantena.Tax department sources said some inter-linked transactions between the entities searched were under the scanner of the department. The raids, they added, are aimed at gathering more evidence to further probe tax evasion allegations against them.The business transactions of films made under the banner of Phantom Films are also being probed, the sources said.The searches against Mantena are being carried out in context of his links with KWAN, of which he is a co-promoter.Both Kashyap and Pannu, who worked together in the 2018 film “Manmarziyaan” and are now collaborating in the upcoming film “Dobaara”, are known to be outspoken about their views on a range of issues.Responding to a question at a press conference in Delhi, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar rejected allegations that the raids against Kashyap and Pannu were linked to their comments, which are seen at times critical of the BJP."This is too much," he said to the question. "Probe agencies undertake investigations based on credible information and the matter later goes to courts as well," he added.In Maharashtra, the debate intensified with state minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik describing the searches as an attempt to suppress the voices of those who speak against the Narendra Modi-led government."Central agencies like ED, CBI, and Income Tax are being used to target those who take an anti-government stand and speak against the policies of the regime," the minister told reporters in Mumbai."The premises of Anurag Kashyap and Pannu have been raided. Both were raising their voices against the Modi government," he said.Pannu's last tweet was on March 1, when she spoke on the Supreme Court asking a man accused of repeated rape whether he was willing to marry the woman. When the court was told he is already married, he was asked to seek regular bail from the concerned court.The 33-year-old actor, known for her films ‘Pink’, ‘Thappad’ and ‘Badla’, put out a strong worded post on the matter.Kashyap, who had visited JNU and Shaheen Bagh during the anti-CAA protests last year and is known to be equally outspoken on a range of issues, has been quiet on Twitter in recent times except for occasionally retweeting others.The 48-year-old, one of the most prominent new directors in Hindi cinema, is the man behind ‘Black Friday’, ‘Dev D’ and the two-part crime saga ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’.Founded in 2011, his production house Phantom Films  produced films such as ‘Lootera’, ‘Queen’, ‘Ugly’, ‘NH 10’, ‘Masaan’ and ‘Udta Punjab’. However, it was disbanded seven years later.Kashyap later launched a new production company called Good Bad Films while Motwane launched Andolan Films. 'Govt trying to harass farmers, supporters'The Samyukta Kisan Morcha condemned the raids and accused the Centre of trying to “harass” supporters of the agitation against farm laws.In a statement, the SKM acknowledged the “fearless support” by many international and national celebrities, and well-known individuals who had been lending support to the farmers’ movement against the contentious agriculture laws.“Instead of fulfilling the farmers’ legitimate demands, the government is seeking ways to harass and attack farmers and their supporters,” the SKM, an umbrella organisation of many farmer unions, said.The IT raids unleashed on Taapsee Pannu and others “are part of this desperate attempt by the government”, it said, condemning the searches. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-department-raids-taapsee-pannu-anurag-kashyap-others-in-tax-evasion-probe-219982
04-03-2021||---||SC dismisses PIL against Farooq Abdullah, says dissent isn’t sedition||New Delhi, March 3Maintaining that dissent can’t be termed as sedition, the Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a PIL seeking action against former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah for his comments on nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution."The expression of a view which is dissent from a decision taken by the Central Government itself cannot be said to be seditious. There is nothing in the statement (of Abdullah) which we find so offensive as to give a cause of action for a court to initiate proceedings,” said a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.Noting that the petitioners had nothing to do with the issue, the Bench said: “This is clearly a case of publicity interest litigation for the petitioners only to get their names in press.”It imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the petitioners and ordered them to deposit the amount with the Supreme Court Advocates Welfare Fund within four weeks, saying: “We must discourage such endeavours.”Petitioners Rajat Sharma and Dr Neh Srivastava of Vishwa Guru India Vision of Sardar Patel alleged that Abdullah was trying to "hand over" Kashmir to China and thus, he should be prosecuted for sedition."Farooq Abdullah has committed an offence punishable under section 124-A of Indian Penal Code. As he has made the live statement that for restoring Article 370 he would take help of China which clearly amounts to seditious act and therefore he is liable to be punished under section 124-A of the IPC," the petitioners submitted.They referred to his alleged statement demanding restoration of Article 370 – which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir – and calling upon people of Jammu and Kashmir to join China for the purpose.The special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked on August 5, 2019 and political leaders of the erstwhile state, including Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others were placed under preventive detention. They were released after several months.The Supreme Court is seized of several PILs against nullification of Article 370 and division of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-pil-against-farooq-abdullah-says-dissent-isnt-sedition-219978

The ruling party in Delhi won seats in Kalyanpuri, Rohini-C, Shalimar Bagh (North) and Trilokpuri.The Congress won the Chauhan Banger ward.While the results have been a shot in the arm for AAP ahead of the 2022 MCD elections, it was a setback for the BJP, which failed to hold onto its seat in Shalimar Bagh.AAP candidate Sunita Mishra trounced BJP’s Sunita Jaju by a margin of 2,705 votes in Shalimar Bagh. In fact all AAP candidates won by a sizeable margin.In Trilokpuri, AAP’s Vijay Kumar defeated BJP’s Om Prakash by 4,985 votes, in Kalyanpuri the winning margin of AAP’s Dhirendra Kumar was 7,045, while AAP’s Ram Chander defeated BJP’s Rakesh Goyal by 2,985 votes. Congress’ Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad who trounced AAP’s Mohammad Israq Khan by 10,642 votes registered the biggest win in the by-polls.The by-poll win has given the ruling party from Delhi confidence that they will be able to dislodge the BJP from the MCD in elections, which is scheduled for next year.“People from Delhi have once again voted for performance. I congratulate everyone. People are sick of BJP’s 15 years of misrule in MCD. Now they have made up their minds to install Aam Aadmi Party in MCD as well,” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after the results.Delhi Jal Board Vice Chairman and AAP MLA Raghav Chadha said the results were an indication of the 2022 MCD elections.“AAP wins semi final decisively, with roughly one year to go for the MCD finals in 2022. It is time for Delhiites to put an end to the 15-year corruption plagued rule of BJP in MCD. Rajya Sarkar mein bhi Kejriwal, phir chalegi double engine ki Kejriwal Sarkar,” Chadha wrote on his Twitter page.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-sweeps-mcd-bypolls-says-results-an-indication-ahead-of-2022-election-219950
04-03-2021||---||Pak misleading OIC on J&K: India at UN||New Delhi, March 2India today said the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was misled by Pakistan during its submissions at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). Exercising its right of reply to the statements made by Pakistan and the OIC, Indian diplomat Pawankumar Badhe rejected the reference to the UT of J&K in the OIC statement. The 57-member organisation, he said, had no locus standi to comment on matters related to J&K, which was an integral and inalienable part of India.Move RegrettableIt’s regrettable that the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Countries continues to allow itself to be exploited by Pakistan to indulge in anti-India propaganda. — Envoy at UNHRCHe found it regrettable that “OIC continues to allow itself to be exploited by Pakistan to indulge in anti-India propaganda’’. On February 24, Indian diplomats had criticised the Pakistani statement and gave fresh evidence of Islamabad’s heavy hand against civil society activists. In September 2020, they recalled that UN human rights experts had condemned the enforced disappearance of Idris Khattak, a former consultant with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Khattak had himself worked on reports on enforced disappearances before disappearing himself in November 2019, “in a cruel twist of fate”. The UN human rights experts have called upon the Pakistani authorities to end Khattak’s secret detention at the earliest.India said the pandemic has changed the way the 46th UNHRC Session is being conducted and accused Pakistan of misuse of the forum “for its propaganda against India”, aimed at diverting the council’s attention from its own serious violations of human rights. Recently, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, the key suspect in murder of Daniel Pearl, was allowed to go scot free.India also said Pakistan has provided pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists out of state funds and has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of UN-proscribed terrorists.India also asked the UNHRC to ask Pakistan why the size of its minority communities had drastically shrunk since independence and why some communities have been subjected to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution and forced conversions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-misleading-oic-on-jk-india-at-un-219718
