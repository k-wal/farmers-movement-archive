21-03-2021||New Delhi||Farmer unions condemn parliamentary panel’s demand for implementation of ECAA||Farmer unions on Sunday condemned the demand for immediate implementation of the Essential Commodities Amendment Act (ECAA) by a parliamentary committee.The ECAA is one of the three laws against which farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders.The parliamentary panel, which also has members from opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC and the AAP, asked the government to implement in “letter and spirit” the ECAA.These parties have been demanding repeal of all three farm laws enacted by the Centre recently.“It is insensitive to the food security of poor people and the demand to increase the procurement of farmers’ crops,” the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a joint front of the protesting farmer unions, said in a statement.“We appeal to farmers, labourers and common citizens to intensify their struggle for the repeal of the three laws and legal right of minimum support price,” the SKM said.The Morcha said it is clear from the overwhelming support from “Kisan Mahapanchayats” against the agricultural laws that the proposed “Bharat Bandh” on March 26 will be successful.It said all services, other than emergency services, will remain suspended from 6 am to 6 pm on that day.

When the number of cases decreases, everything will go back to normal,” the CM said.Rupani said the government’s concern is that people do not suffer due to the pandemic and that their jobs are not affected.He also appealed to people to exercise caution and to adhere to COVID-19 norms.“The government will not take steps that will adversely affect livelihood of the people. They should not lose patience,” he said.Rupani said the government was not interested in imposing fine on people for not wearing face masks.“A fine of Rs 1,000 is collected from people for not wearing masks on the order of the Gujarat High Court,” he said.Rupani said people should follow norms like maintaining social distance, wearing masks and using sanitiser.“(Eligible) People should get themselves vaccinated when their turn comes. They should not go out unnecessarily and avoid gatherings,” he said.The CM said the state is now conducting more COVID-19 tests.“At the same time, adequate number of beds and essential medicines are being made available.

21-03-2021||New Delhi||ITBP men reunite 70-year-old with his family in Karnataka using social media, earn force’s top award||He spent three decades of his life living like a destitute—wearing torn clothes, spending days working at an eatery in Uttarakhand just for enough food to survive, nights at a nearby bus stop even in bone-chilling winters, and his plight kept only to himself as he spoke and understood nothing except Kannada.But, 70-year-old Kenchappa Govindappa’s wait for uniting with his family ended earlier this year when he was spotted by ITBP Jawan Constable Riyaz Sunkad, while he was going on leave, at the roadside eatery in Chalthi village of Lohaghat area, 64 kms from Pithoragarh.Sunkad went home, but Govindappa’s story kept troubling him.He called his two seniors who hail from Karnataka—Head Constables Premananda Pai and Sharana Basava Ragapur—and told them about the man.And thus began, Govindappa’s reunion story.Pai and Ragapur were also proceeding on leave and they went to the eatery, where they found the man in a “real bad shape”. “He was in emotional shock. He was lost for years and could not get in touch with his family or relatives,” Pai told PTI over phone.“The man knew only Kannada (a language alien to the sparsely-populated village). He used to sleep at a bus stop behind the eatery even in bone-chilling winters,” he said.           The ITBP jawans sought more information from the eatery-owner who said that Kenchappa had come to this location on a truck many years back. He said he was not paid any money for his work at the shop.“The eatery owner only gave him food for helping him in the daily chores,” Pai said.He was living like a destitute as no one could understand his language and the plight he was enduring, he said.The ITBP jawans provided him with adequate medical care and gave him a new look by replacing his torn clothes with new ones.The troopers later made a video with the man at the eatery and uploaded it on social media platforms like Facebook. The video did not reach his family, but, fortunately, to someone who knew them.After a few days, a call was received from an advocate who knew Kenchappa’s family who lived in Kalghatagi village of Dharwad district in Karnataka.The ITBP personnel now embarked on an over 2,000-km journey to take the 70-year-old to his home he missed dearly for 30 years.                        “We handed him over to his family who were elated to see him. We were informed that Kenchappa had six children—four sons and two daughters—and he had left home sometime in 1991 in search of a job.“From Karnataka, he probably reached Maharashtra and later to Chalthi in Uttarakhand where we found him,” Pai said.When asked what made them undertake this noble mission, Pai said in an unflattering tone: “How could we turn our back on someone who had suffered so much in life. It was only humane to do what we did.”The ITBP personnel, posted with the 36th battalion of the border force, have been awarded the top force commendation in recognition of their humanitarian deed.They have been given the Director General commendation role and silver disc insignia, meant for rendering exceptional service. The three joined the paramilitary force around 2002-2003.Their citation said they are being awarded the top category force honour “for exemplary humane approach and a great sense of responsibility by reuniting an old man with his family by taking him from Chalthi to Dharwad”.ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said, “The force is proud of the three men who did a humanitarian task beyond the call of their official duty and reaffirmed the values that the force stood for.”The about 90,000 personnel strong ITBP is primarily tasked to guard the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China apart of rendering a variety of internal security duties which includes fighting Naxals in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra and terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.

Nobody (in state government) has contacted me. And in any case even if they contact me, I am unavailable,” Ribeiro told PTI when asked about Pawar’s suggestion.Read also: Corruption allegations against Maharashtra Home Minister Dehsmukh ‘serious’: Sharad Pawar“I am 92 years old. Nobody goes around doing this work at the age of 92. If the inquiry is against the home minister of Maharashtra, then Mr Pawar should make it because he is the head of the (ruling) party,” Ribeiro said.Ribeiro is a former Mumbai police commissioner, who eventually became the chief of Gujarat and Punjab police and was later named India’s ambassador to Romania.“Why should a retired police officer be asked to do this,” he said.Earlier in the day, Pawar told reporters in Delhi that he would suggest Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek Ribeiro’s help to investigate the claims made by Singh.In a letter to Thackeray, Param Bir Singh alleged that Anil Deshmukh instructed suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze to collect Rs 100 crore every month for him.

Inaction for years has broken the dreams of the youth and has stopped the flow of employment. In the last 10 years, TMC’s ill-governance has started a dark chapter in Bengal’s history,” he alleged.In the poll manifesto, the party also promised a Rs 20,000 crore Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar Fund for the infrastructure development of schools, and five universities on a par with IITs and IIMs.The party said that to transform Kolkata into an international city, it will set up a Kolkata Development Fund worth Rs 22,000 crore and also ensure that the metropolis becomes a UNESCO Heritage City.“We have decided that we will clear the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act in the first cabinet meeting itself, besides approving the Ayushman Bharat scheme for the benefit of the poor,” Shah said.The party further promised that every refugee family will be given Rs 10,000 per year for five years through direct benefit transfer (DBT).Shah said that his party would work towards building a safe Bengal, an “appeasement-free Bengal” and an infiltration-free state, if voted to power.“We will bring back the Bengal that made the entire nation proud,” he said.“You have given time to Congress, over 30 years to Communists and ten years to TMC.

21-03-2021||New Delhi||Childless woman held for ‘sacrificing’ 3-year-old on tantrik’s advice||In a shocking incident, a superstitious, childless woman brutally strangulated a three-year-old boy on a tantrik’s urging as he had allegedly told her that she would conceive a child if she undertook this sacrifice, police said on Sunday.“During the course of interrogation, accused Neelam Gupta revealed that she got married in 2013 and could not conceive a child despite medical aid. Under a lot of pressure to conceive due to taunts of her in-laws and society, she approached a tantrik in (Uttar Pradesh’s) Hardoi four years back who suggested to her at that time to sacrifice a child if she wants to conceive,” DCP, Rohini, Pranav Tayal, said.Gupta, who hails from Hardoi, was residing at Budh Vihar here with her husband.The matter came to light on Saturday, after a missing report of a 3-year-old child was lodged at the Budh Vihar police station. During the search operation, a police team noticed a white-coloured bag lying the roof of the adjacent house and it raised some suspicion in their minds. They opened it to find the dead body of the missing child inside.“The deceased child had some injury marks on his neck and on prima facie observation, it was found he was strangulated,” the officer added.Family members, relatives and neighbours of the family were questioned. During the course of interrogation, it was revealed that last time the child was seen with one of the neighbours who was identified as Neelam.After sustained questioning in which the accused tried to mislead the police, she confessed to having committed the murder when the boy was playing on the roof alone.She said she went to the roof of the building in which all the families stayed together, when others were absent, to execute her plan.

The court said that since these people had completed their punishment, they can be sent outside India,” the SP said.

The board has already made pass certificate and marksheets available on DigiLocker.CBSE has eased its rules for getting duplicate copies of education-related documents.The existing rules require the school principal or a gazette officer to attest a request for duplicate documents. In addition, one must publish a notice of such a loss in two national dailies.CBSE has done away with both these conditions, and requires an applicant to send only a valid photo identity such as Aadhaar card, Driving License, Voter ID Card, and their bank pass book with their application to the board.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-to-make-softcopies-of-migration-certificates-available-on-digilocker-228516
21-03-2021||Ahmedabad||COVID-19: BJP workers not infected as they work hard, says MLA||A Gujarat BJP MLA on Sunday said workers of his party do not get infected with novel coronavirus since they work hard.Rajkot (South) legislator Govind Patel’s take on coronavirus came after reporters asked him if the flouting of guidelines by political leaders and workers during poll campaigning was resulting in a spike in cases.“Those who work hard do not get coronavirus infection. BJP workers work hard, and therefore, not a single worker has been infected with the virus,” Patel claimed.Incidentally, during the campaigning for the local bodies polls last month, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was detected with the infection, and among others in the ruling party who have tested positive at different points of time include state unit chief CR Paatil and several MLAs.On Saturday, Vadodara BJP MP Ranjanben Bhatt had announced that she was admitted in hospital for COVID-19.Meanwhile, state Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel refuted talk that local polls as well as the Test and T20I cricket matches in Ahmedabad were prime factors behind the COVID-19 spike.“Elections are held as per the requirement under the Constitution. Cricket matches were limited to only Ahmedabad. There was no cricket match or election in Maharashtra, but it accounts for the highest number of cases, nearly 50 percent of the country’s daily cases,” he said.He said one could come to any conclusion on the recent surge but the reality remained that it was the people’s collective responsibility to adhere to outbreak norms and control the pandemic.

The police action came after the video surfaced on social media.Ashok Meghwal alleged in the video that some men belonging to upper caste attacked his mother Daili Devi and pregnant sister Lalita Devi over a land dispute.He said two cases pertaining to the dispute are pending in the court but Thakur Hukum Singh Rajput of the village has been pressuring them to vacate the land.“We have been living on this land since generations but Hukum Singh has been putting pressure on us to vacate this place and also demanding money,” Meghwal alleged.Meghwal said they had given a complaint against Hukum Singh and six others to the Rohet police on March 15, suspecting threat to their lives.“But police did not take any action in time and on Friday, some 10-12 persons again attacked us, abused us and beat up my mother and pregnant sister,” said Meghwal in the video.Meghwal claimed that he had also written to the Rajasthan chief minister, DGP and local officials but no action was taken against the accused.Taking advantage of the apathy of the system, the accused attacked us, Meghwal said.Commenting on the case, SP Rawat said, “We have arrested four people and searches are being conducted to arrest the other accused named in the FIR.

21-03-2021||Jorhat (Assam)||PM sad for tweet by 22-year-old woman, but not for flood-hit people in Assam: Priyanka||Launching a frontal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday alleged he is sad about a tweet by a “22-year-old woman” but not for the flood-ravaged people of Assam.A day after Modi raised the toolkit issue and alleged Congress conspiracy in it at a poll rally in Chabua in Assam, the daughter of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, lamented that Modi was silent about people’s suffering in perennial flood and “attack on culture” by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Last year’s flooding of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries during the pandemic affected some 2.8 million people in Assam.“I was listening to the Prime Minister’s speech yesterday. He very seriously said that he was very sad about a development. I thought he would speak about Assam’s development or how BJP worked in Assam.”“But I was shocked to hear that the PM was talking about a tweet by a 22-year-old woman. He said the Congress conspired to finish the tea industry of Assam. He was also sad about the Congress mistakenly putting two wrong pictures on social media,” Vadra said.By “a 22-year-old woman”, she apparently referred to climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested for allegedly being involved in sharing a “toolkit” on social media related to the farmers’ protest. Ravi is now out on bail.The Congress general secretary questioned Modi why he was not sad for the people affected by the flood and the anti-CAA movement, in which five youths were killed.“Why didn’t you come to Assam when people were drowning? Why were you not sad when all the big promises by BJP were not fulfilled? Did you go to tea gardens and talk to workers about their problems?” she asked of Modi.Vadra on March 2 visited a tea garden in Biswanath of Assam to interact with the workers and also tried her hands in plucking tea leaves, which was termed as “theatrics and drama” by the BJP leadership.Talking about her visit to a tea garden during her last trip to Assam, Gandhi said she came to know about their lifestyle and realised that “the tea garden sisters are the protectors of culture and identity”.On the prime minister’s frequently uttered statement of “double-engined” government in Assam, Vadra made fun of it saying the state currently has “two chief ministers”, in an apparent reference to rumours of powerful minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal acting as rival power centres.“The PM said you have a double-engine government but Assam has two CMs. I don’t know which fuel runs which engine.The Assam government is not run in Assam. Even the Asom Gana Parishad (an ally of the ruling BJP) is now Delhi Gana Parishad as it can’t work without Delhi’s permission... God save you!“The Assam government is currently run by remote control. If you elect them again, you will be hurt. So, elect a Congress government and have your own chief minister,” she added.The Congress leader also alleged that all segments of the society, including youths, farmers and tea garden workers, have been cheated by the BJP government as it did not fulfil any of its promises made five years ago.“Today, I think I will not speak about big issues, but the small problems of my sisters. You carry the biggest responsibility of the society. You run the home, bring up the children and also earn for the household.“It is your life’s problems and realities. I don’t know them. My leaders don’t know them. You are my sister. So, please take a decision carefully for your future,” she appealed to the crowd, consisting mostly of women.Vadra pointed out the BJP’s promises of 2016 such as 25 lakh jobs, protection of culture, implementation of Assam Accord and minimum wages to tea gardens, and alleged that none of these have been fulfilled.Continuing her tirade against Modi, she said, “The PM also said Congress insulted Assamese culture and people won’t forgive us. Now, is it not an insult to former CM Tarun Gogoi, who is no more today? Gogoi lived for Assam and worked for people till his last breath.”She also slammed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for allegedly insulting 15th-16th century Vaishnavite scholar Srimanta Sankardeva by stating that he fought against infiltrators.Vadra alleged the BJP’s sole aim is to “hand over” prime properties of Assam to Modi’s 2-3 close businessmen friends.“The BJP wanted to hand over farmers’ land in Nagaon to a corporate body. When protests took place, a pregnant woman was attacked and farmers were jailed. They also brought an ordinance to sell land to anyone from outside without any permission,” she said.Assam has huge unemployment problem, while several big scams have surfaced in the last five years, she alleged.“How can you trust the BJP? You have seen what you have got in five years. Tarun Gogoi might have committed some mistakes, but he never cheated you. He did not bring the CAA and attacked your culture and identity,” she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-sad-for-tweet-by-22-year-old-woman-but-not-for-flood-hit-people-in-assam-priyanka-228500
21-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Prisons steps up efforts to tackle COVID-19 as inmates return||The threat of coronavirus infection looms large in Delhi Prisons as it readies for the returning inmates who were granted parole during the coronavirus outbreak last year. According to jail officials, it will be difficult to maintain social distancing with the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the prisons.They said the situation could be more difficult to manage when the inmates, who were granted parole during the pandemic outbreak last year, would return.There are a total of 18,900 inmates in the Delhi Prisons comprising Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails. However, the intake capacity of Delhi Prisons Department is 10,026 inmates.The number of inmates will pass the 20,000-mark as more will come after their emergency parole lapse, a senior jail official said.Meanwhile, the jail authority asserted that all steps are being taken to keep the COVID-19 situation under control.“The last time an inmate was tested positive was on January 14. After that, three more persons were found positive, but their disease was detected before entering the jail.“No jail staff has been detected COVID-19 positive after January 9. Thus, the COVID situation inside the jails is very much under control. We will continue to take all the precautions, including wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and quarantining the new inmates,” Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel said.The jail authorities are alert and conducting tests as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, another official said.A total of 1,184 convicts and around 5,500 under-trials were released under the department's decongestion drive amid the pandemic outbreak.The process of vaccination in the jails has already been started. Almost all jail staff and security personnel have received their jabs.Around 20 prison inmates in Delhi received their first jab of COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccination drive for prison inmates started last week.Delhi reported 813 coronavirus cases on Saturday. The active cases rose to 3,409 from 3,165 a day ago. The positivity rate breached the 1 per cent-mark after over two months, according to official data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-prisons-steps-up-efforts-to-tackle-covid-19-as-inmates-return-228499

21-03-2021||---||Allegations against Deshmukh: Pawar trying to save Maha govt, says Fadnavis||Nagpur, March 21Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said NCP chief Sharad Pawar was trying to save the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in view of allegations of corruption levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.Speaking to reporters here, Fadnavis contested Pawar’s assertion that neither chief minister Uddhav Thackeray nor Deshmukh was responsible for reinstating controversial police officer Sachin Waze in the Mumbai police force last year.Days after he was shunted as Mumbai police commissioner, Singh wrote a letter to the CM claiming Deshmukh, a senior NCP leader, had asked Waze and other police officers to collect Rs 100 crore monthly from bars and hotels in Mumbai.“How could important postings and cases were given to Waze without the knowledge of the chief minister and the home minister?” Fadnavis questioned.The Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly also questioned Pawar’s statement that the latter would suggest the CM to seek retired IPS officer Julio Ribeiro’s help for looking into the claims made by Singh.Waze is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his alleged role in placing an explosives- laden SUV outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month.The NIA is also probing the alleged murder of Thane- based businessman Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of that SUV.“As the architect of the MVA government (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress), Pawar is trying to save the government. Pawar’s press conference today is an attempt to save the government. The presser is just a window dressing.Actually, it is an attempt to move away from truth,” Fadnavis alleged.He reiterated his demand for resignation of Deshmukh and a court-monitored probe into the allegations raised by Singh.“Waze (a former encounter specialist who was suspended after the alleged custodial death of bomb blast suspect Khwaja Yunis in 2003) was reinstated by a committee headed by Param Bir Singh. But how is it possible that Waze was given important cases and postings without the knowledge of the CM and the home minister?”“Pawar should say that Waze was reinstated on the instructions of the CM and the home minister, and with their blessings, he was given key cases and postings,” the former chief minister claimed.Fadnavis also said how could Ribeiro, who retired 15 years ago, can conduct an “inquiry of Param Bir Singh and the home minister. Will he have that authority and can he conduct a fair probe?Meanwhile, BJP workers on Sunday staged demonstrations in Nagpur demanding resignation of Deshmukh over Singh’s letter.BJP workers led by former state energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule staged protests at Sanvidhan square and raised slogans against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.A demonstration was also organised by workers of the BJP Yuva Morcha outside the residence of Deshmukh here.Meanwhile, Fadnavis claimed that allegations were raised earlier against state Home department by a top police officer.“Param Bir Singh is not the first person to raise such allegations. Earlier, a report was submitted by then Maharashtra DGP Subodh Jaiswal about a racket involving touts in transferring police officials in exchange of money, but the state government didn’t take any action on that report.Jaiswal had submitted the report containing full transcript to the chief minister and the home minister via the then commissioner of Intelligence,” he said.Subsequently, Jaiswal opted out of an important posting as the DGP and went on a Central deputation because the state government did not initiate any inquiry on the report submitted by him, Fadnavis said, adding that rather action was taken against the then state “Commissioner of Intelligence” Rashmi Shukla.“The current situation wouldn’t have arose had the state government acted on the report of Jaiswal and Shukla,” he said.Fadnavis also demanded that officials and other persons who had used vehicles that were found possession of Waze be investigated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allegations-against-deshmukh-pawar-trying-to-save-maha-govt-says-fadnavis-228488
21-03-2021||Kanthi Dakshin (WB)||‘I am a big donkey’, says Mamata for not recognising ‘true face’ of Adhikari family||West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday blamed herself for not recognising the “true face” of the influential Adhikari family of Purba Medinipur district and called herself a “big donkey” for being unable to do so.Venting her ire against Suvendu Adhikari, her protege-turned-rival who is pitted against the TMC leader from Nandigram constituency for the coming assembly polls, Banerjee said at an election rally here, she had even heard rumours the Adhikari family had built an empire worth Rs 5,000 crore.“I say I am a ‘big donkey’ (Ami ekta boro gadha) for having failed to recognise them. I don’t know (about it), but people say their ‘empire’ is worth Rs 5,000 crore and they will use money to buy votes. But don’t vote for them,” Banerjee told the rally.The chief minister said she will get it investigated once she is voted to power.Most members of the Adhikari family, which holds considerable political clout in the district, have either joined the BJP or expressed a desire to join the saffron party.Veteran TMC MP Sisir Adhikari - father of Suvendu, on Sunday joined the BJP at Egra in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other senior leaders of the party.She compared the Adhikari family with “Mir Jafar” (traitor) and said the people of the region will not tolerate it and give befitting replies with ballots.Mir Jafar, the military general of Bengal’s last independent nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, is considered a traitor for deceiving the besieged Nawab during the Battle of Plassey in 1757 which paved the way for British rule in India.The TMC chief also described the BJP as a party of “rogues and goons”.She also blamed the Adhikari family for ruling the district as “zamindars” (landlords) by taking full control of the area, claiming that even she was not allowed to hold public meetings there.Highlighting that all works like health, roads and other schemes were undertaken by the state government and not by the Adhikari family, Banerjee urged the crowd to keep the BJP out of West Bengal to maintain peace and further the pace of development.Earlier too, she had described Suvendu Adhikari as a “traitor”, pointing out that she had blindly supported him when he was in the Trinamool Congress.Banerjee also attempted to play the nationalistic card by raising slogans of “Bande Mataram” and “Jai Hind”.Banerjee left her Bhowanipore constituency in Kolkata to contest against her former lieutenant and BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram seat, where an anti-land acquisition movement catapulted the TMC to power in the state in 2011.

21-03-2021||New Delhi||A person cannot donate blood for 28 days after taking last jab of COVID vaccine: Order||A recent order by the National Blood Transfusion Council has said that a person cannot donate blood for the next 28 days after taking the last dose of COVID-19 vaccine.As approved in the 30th meeting of the governing body of the NBTC held on February 17, the deferral criteria for blood donation post COVID-19 vaccine was finalised as “28 days post vaccination deferral after the last dose of COVID-19 vaccination irrespective of the type of the vaccine received”. The order implies that the donor has to wait for 28 days after taking second dose of the vaccine, which means that he or she cannot donate for 56 days after taking the first jab.The order was issued by NBTC director Dr Sunil Gupta on March 5.According to the Union Health Ministry, two doses of the vaccine need to be taken by an individual 28 days apart to complete the immunisation schedule.Protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose, it has said.Also, on whether one should avoid alcohol after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the ministry in a series of FAQs on March 2 clarified that “according to experts, there is no evidence of alcohol impairing the effectiveness of the vaccine”.    Two vaccines—Oxford’s Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute in the country and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have been approved by the National Drug Regulator for restricted emergency use in India.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated and vaccination of the frontline workers (FLWs) started from February 2.The next phase of COVID-19 vaccination commenced from March 1 for those who are over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.

21-03-2021||Shivamogga||'Lay seige to Bengaluru with tractors to protest farm laws': Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait has exhorted farmers of Karnataka to lay siege to Bengaluru with their tractors in protest against the three contentious farm laws passed by the Centre and convert the city to the focal point of agitation, like in Delhi."....you have to turn Bengaluru into Delhi. You will have to lay siege to the city from all directions," he told a farmers' mahapanchayat here late on Saturday.Only tractors should be used, like in Delhi, where over 25,000 have blocked entry points to the city, he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points —Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—for over three months, demanding the repeal of farm laws and a legal guarantee on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops.Tikait claimed that lakhs of farmers and their families have laid siege to Delhi by agitating at the border points and said the stir would continue until the three laws are repealed."Unless the three laws are repealed, unless there is a law related to the MSP, you need to continue this agitation in Karnataka as well," Tikait said.He said though the stir was to repeal the three farm bills, there were other 'controversial' bills in the pipeline, aimed at grabbing farmers' lands, forcing them to work as daily wagers in factories"Besides these three laws, other bills pertaining to milk, electricity, seed and pesticides will also be introduced," he said.Tikait alleged that privatisation of banks would result in farmers who have availed of loans through Kisan Credit Cards, with land as collateral, being asked to surrender them."If the farmers do not have money to repay the loans, then they will take away your land," he alleged.The government's target is to ensure that in the next 20 years, all the land goes to the banks and companies and the farmers become labourers, he charged.The farmer leader, son of illustrious farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, has taken the mantle of farmers' agitation along with his brother Naresh Tikait around Delhi and has been conducting public meetings in various parts of the country against the farm bills. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lay-seige-to-bengaluru-with-tractors-to-protest-farm-laws%C2%A0tikait-228479

21-03-2021||New Delhi||Narco-analysis testing facility in Delhi expected to be operational soon: Officials||The narco analysis testing facility in the national capital is expected to start soon and six experts from the Forensic Science Laboratory here underwent a week-long training session in Gujarat recently to equip themselves about the techniques involved in it, officials said on Sunday.Officials at FSL, Rohini said after their return from Ahmedabad, the team also conducted two dummy exercises under the supervision of medical experts at the Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital here where the narco-analysis testing facility has been set up. The facility, which was expected to start much earlier, could not commence due to various reasons, FSL officials said. They cited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons that led to further delay, saying there were restrictions on physical movement while training institutes were also closed.However, as the situation improved, our experts were sent for training and the facility is expected to start soon, they said.FSL director Deepa Verma said, "We are in the process of finalising the procedure, and we expect the facility to start shortly. For this, we also organised a full-fledged training session for our experts. "Our team was sent to Ahmedabad recently where they underwent training and based on the information they got from the session, our experts are further preparing themselves."The direction for setting up a narco-analysis facility came in 2019 while the Delhi High Court was hearing a habeas corpus petition by a man seeking to trace his four-and-a-half years old son who had gone missing since August 4, 2018. The court was left surprised when it was informed that no such facility was available in the National Capital and the narco-analysis test had to be done in Gujarat following which it directed the AAP government to set up the facility here.In October 2020, however, the AAP government informed the Delhi High Court that the facility has been set up at Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini, but it could not start due to the pandemic.When contacted, Dr, Naveen Kumar, who is an anaesthetist at Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital said, "The hospital is offering its operation theatre to the FSL team which will perform the narco analysis test here. "The role of the doctors would be to inject the medicine and monitor the health of the patient when the narco analysis is being done." He added: "We are hopeful that the facility will be operational soon." An official from FSL, Rohini said as part of their week-long training in Gujarat, the experts from the psychology division, who will be conducting the narco analysis test once the facility becomes operational, learned the techniques involved while performing the narco analysis test on a person, to monitor their frame of mind,  the kind of questionnaire to be prepared and how to approach the case. The experts will be conducting their analysis under the supervision of an anaesthetist and video record the entire process, he said. Incharge, Crime Scene Management, Sanjeev Gupta said: "The consent of the suspect is necessary to administer the narco test.  Investigating agencies are employing these tests in the investigation as a soft alternative in fact finding and certainly it is helpful in solving the complex cases."   Narco analysis involves injecting a drug named sodium pentothal which induces a hypnotic or sedated state in which the person's imagination is neutralised and he or she is expected to divulge true information. During the test, questions are asked and responses are recorded on camera, officials said.The Supreme Court in 2010 has held that involuntary administration of narco or lie detection test is an intrusion into a person's mental privacy and the law disapproves of involuntary testimony. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narco-analysis-testing-facility-in-delhi-expected-to-be-operational-soon-officials-228476

21-03-2021||Dhaka||Bangladesh rules out security threat to PM Modi's visit amid protests by 'few' Left, Islamist groups||Bangladesh has ruled out any security threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to the country later this week and said "few" left wing and hardline Islamist groups are against his trip, but there is "nothing to worry" about them.Prime Minister Modi will visit Bangladesh from March 26 to 27 to attend the celebrations of the golden jubilee of the country's independence and the birth centenary of its founder ‘Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.This would be his first trip to a foreign country since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic."We are proud to invite him (Modi) to Bangladesh… people are with us (the government)," Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen told reporters on Saturday night.Momen said "only a few can oppose this visit and let them do it". "There is nothing to worry about  (their protests)," he added."Bangladesh is a democratic country where people have the right to express their opinion and the government is not worried about it," he said, adding that the protesters are "few in number" and just taking the advantage of the "freedom of expression".Prime Minister Modi and heads of state and government from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives will be among the distinguished foreign guests to join the celebrations under separate schedules.Momen said authorities have taken every required step to ensure security of all visiting foreign dignitaries.Some hardline Islamists, left leaning groups and civil society members recently staged demonstrations against Modi's visit, referring to India's new citizenship law.Meanwhile, Junior Foreign Minister Shahriar Alam urged “those who are giving different opinions to show respect for the invited guests if they have respect for the Bangabandhu as Father of the Nation and love for the country”.He specifically asked the groups and figures associated with the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to refrain from "exhibiting double-standards by opposing Modi's visit since they tried to appease him during his first term of the government".During his visit, Modi will also visit two Hindu temples in southwestern Shatkhira and Gopalganj districts, largely inhabited by the Hindu Matua community, a large number of them hailing from West Bengal.Asked whether there was any link between Modi's interaction with the Matua community and elections in West Bengal, Alam said: "it is not a concern of Bangladesh if his visit has any link to politics."We're happy that Modi will visit different places outside Dhaka. He's our guest, and he's willing to go outside Dhaka. It'll help grow our tourism sector. So, it's a good thing for us". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-rules-out-security-threat-to-pm-modis-visit-amid-protests-by-few-left-islamist-groups-228473

Monteiro has confirmed that he was together with Harrison when the Song was developed, and saw its evolution," Singapore media quoted the Ministry as saying."Furthermore, our checks conducted in India turned up no evidence or records whatsoever of Mendoza having any rights to 'We Can Achieve' from 1983 or anytime thereafter," said the Ministry.Mendoza has unconditionally and irrevocably withdrawn any claims of whatsoever nature, directly or indirectly, with regard to the lyrics and tune of "We Can Achieve" and has informed all of his associates and networks, instructing all social media platforms to remove "We Can Achieve", said the Ministry."It is important that our rights to the Song are protected and that there remains no doubt as to our origination and ownership of the Song. MCCY accepts Mendoza's apology on the terms set out above, and will treat the matter as closed, on this basis," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-based-composer-mendoza-withdraws-claim-to-singapores-national-song-says-ministry-228470
21-03-2021||New Delhi||Five states account for over 83 per cent of new COVID-19 cases: Govt||As India witnessed the highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases this year, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday that Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh account for 83.14 per cent of the new infections.Maharashtra continues to report the highest daily new cases at 27,126. It is followed by Punjab with 2,578 while Kerala reported 2,078 new cases.Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh reported 1,798, 1,565 and 1, 308 infections in a day.India recorded 43,846 new coronavirus cases in a day, the highest single-day rise so far this year, taking the nationwide COVID-19 tally to 1,15,99,130.Besides, 197 deaths were reported in a span 24 hours, the ministry said adding six states account for 86.8 per cent of the new deaths. Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (92). Punjab follows with 38 daily deaths. Kerala reported15 deaths.Delhi reported over 800 coronavirus cases for the first time this year on Saturday, while two more people succumbed to the pathogen.The active cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rose to 3,409 from 3,165 a day ago.

People should still restrict non-essential travel for some more time," AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said.Dr V K Paul, NITI Aayog member (Health) said to remain free of this virus, it is very important that COVID-appropriate behaviour, containment strategy, readiness from the health infrastructure point of view as well as vaccination has to be brought in to fight the pandemic.He advised that in districts where COVID-19 cases are seemingly on the rise, vaccination of eligible individuals should be intensified and prioritised.States and UTs  showing an upsurge in daily new cases and with a high caseload of active cases have been advised by the Centre to improve testing in districts reporting reduction in testing and increase the overall share of RT-PCR tests (more than 70 pc), especially in districts dependent on high levels of antigen testing in line with the ‘Test Track and Treat' strategy of the government. They have also been advised to carry out an average close contact tracing of minimum of 20 persons per positive case (in the first 72 hours) along with isolation and early treatment of the serious cases as per clinical protocol.They have been asked to focus on surveillance and stringent containment of those areas in selected districts which are seeing cluster of cases and focus on clinical management in districts reporting higher deaths and that they should also follow up on sending samples for genome testing to track virus variants of concern, officials said.All states and UTs have been tagged to 10 national labs under the INSACOG consortium with National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as the nodal institute. They have been asked to limit the gathering in public places along with promoting COVID-appropriate behaviour through communication and enforcement and accelerate vaccination for priority population groups in districts reporting higher cases.Accelerating the pace of vaccination has also been stressed upon, officials stated.India's cumulative recoveries stand at 1,11,30,288 on Sunday.Seventeen states and UTs have not reported any COVID-19 deaths in a span of 24 hours. These are Rajasthan, Assam, Goa, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Jharkhand, Lakshadweep, Sikkim, Puducherry, Daman and Diu & Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Nagaland, Tripura, Ladakh (UT), Manipur, Mizoram, A&N Islands and Arunachal Pradesh.Besides, over 4.4 crore (4,46,03,841) vaccine doses have been administered through 7,25,138 sessions, as per the provisional report till Sunday 7 am.These include 77,79,985 HCWs (1st dose), 48,77,356 HCWs (2nd dose), 80,84,311 FLWs (1st dose) and 26,01,298 FLWs (2nd Dose), 36,33,473 beneficiaries aged more than 45 years with specific co-morbidities (1st Dose) and 1,76,27,418 beneficiaries aged more than 60 years.As on Day-64 of the vaccination drive ( March 20), more than 25 lakh (25,40,449) vaccine doses were given.

We are protesting against a scam that has taken place on the lines of the 2013 Vyapam scam. We demand an investigation into the conduct of the exams and cancellation of recruitments and a fresh recruitment process should be organised."In these exams, only students who belong to the same caste, college, region top. Their college records are very bad. They take six to seven years to clear a four-year course. They top in those subjects in which they consistently fail for four to five years. This is evident from these facts that the PEB makes the question papers and answers available to them before the exams," he alleged. The Vyapam scam that took place in 2013, involved 13 different examinations conducted by the PEB for recruitment to government jobs and admissions to educational institutions in Madhya Pradesh. In August 2013, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government constituted a Special Task Force to probe the scam.The Central Bureau of Investigation took over in July 2015. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-candidates-stage-semi-nude-protest-against-exam-irregularities-228462

21-03-2021||Raipur||Govt wants to snatch farmers’ future: Rahul on new agri laws||Stepping up his attack on the BJP-led Centre over the three new farms laws, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the government wants to snatch the income and future of farmers for the benefit of a few top businessmen in the country.He was addressing a function in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur to disburse cash benefit to farmers and cattle-rearers under the two schemes of the state government through a recorded video-message in Hindi.“What we had promised to farmers, we have fulfilled it today. You know the government of India is heading on some other path. It has brought three farm laws against the farmers. The central government wanted to snatch the income and future of farmers and hand it over to two-three big businessmen,” he said without naming anyone.Hailing the Bhupesh Baghel-led dispensation in Chhattisgarh, Gandhi said he is happy that his party’s governments in Chhattisgarh and other states are walking on the path of supporting farmers, labourers, small businessmen, youth and women.Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation and GST rollout, Gandhi said, “Narendra Modiji’s government implemented ‘notebandi’ and GST, and today you can see that India has failed to create employment.”    In contrast, the Chhattisgarh government extended support to farmers and strengthened the rural economy, he said.“We pumped in money into the rural economy and therefore, Chhattisgarh has not been facing any trouble (during the coronavirus crises), which is being faced by other states,” he added.On the occasion, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel transferred Rs 1,104.27 crore into the accounts of 18.43 lakh farmers as the fourth and last instalment of Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana (for kharif and rabi crop year 2019-20).Besides, he also transferred Rs 7.55 crore to the accounts of cattle-rearers under the Godhan Nyay Yojana.Under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana, farmers have been paid a total of Rs 5,627.89 crore in four instalments as input support to paddy cultivators and certified seeds growers, a government official said.Under Godhan Nyay Yojna, the state government has been procuring cow dung at Rs 2 per kg from cattle-rearers for production of vermi-compost, he said.

21-03-2021||Guwahati||Congress failed to provide security, stability in Assam: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday accused the Congress of giving “false guarantees” when it was in power at the Centre and also in Assam at the same time earlier, and failed to provide security and stability in the northeastern state.The Congress can go to any extent for coming to power and this is evident from the “lies” that they are spreading through the manifesto, the Prime Minister said at an election rally in Bokakhat.“When there was a Congress government at the Centre and in the state at the same time, there was double neglect, double corruption and double infiltration”, he said.“They had given false guarantees of providing employment and women empowerment,” he added.The double-engine NDA government, however, ensured that the foundation for development is laid and the state is connected with the rest of the country, while during the next five years there will be more all-around speedy development, Modi said.“The Congress means lies, confusion, instability, violence and corruption. The party’s coffers are empty and they want to come to power at any cost to fill it”, Modi said taking a swipe at the grand old party.During Congress rule, people used to think will Assam be ever free of bomb blasts, guns or violence and peace would prevail, but the NDA government has ensured that there is peace and stability in the state.He also accused the Congress of patronising poachers, but the NDA government has ensured that rhino poaching is stopped and poachers are put in jails, while the famed Kaziranga National Park has been freed of encroachers.The Prime Minister was addressing an election rally at Bokahat in Golaghat district from where minister and AGP president Atul Bora is contesting.

21-03-2021||Mumbai||Hiran death case: Maharashtra ATS arrest policeman, bookie||In a “major breakthrough”, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has arrested a policeman and a bookie in connection with the alleged murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, an official said on Sunday, adding Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze had played a key role in the crime and emerged as the prime accused.The accused duo, identified as policeman Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gaur, were arrested on Saturday late night, he said.Earlier in the day, the official had given the name of the bookie as Naresh Dhare, but later said it was Naresh Gaur.Shinde is a convict in the 2006 Lakhan Bhaiya fake encounter case and he came out from jail on furlough last year, he said, adding that Shinde had been in touch with Vaze since then.Vaze is currently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is probing the recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle which was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s multi-storey residence ‘Antilia’ in south Mumbai on February 25.The vehicle was in possession of Hiran before his body was found in a creek near Thane on March 5. The Union Home Ministry on Saturday handed over the Hiran murder case to the NIA.“Sachin Vaze is a prime accused in the Hiran murder case. He had played a key role. During the probe, the ATS found that Gaur had provided five SIM cards to API Vaze and Shinde for the crime. Shinde used to help Vaze in his illegal activities,” the official said.He said the ATS was investigating if more people were involved in the case and what role they had played.“The ATS is probing who was the main conspirator (in Hiran murder case),” he added.“Both the accused were on Saturday called to the ATS headquarters for questioning in connection with the case and later placed under arrest,” he added.“The state ATS has so far interrogated several people, including police officials and the family members of the deceased. The arrest of these two persons is a major breakthrough in the case,” the official said.The ATS had earlier registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) against unidentified persons in connection with Hiran’s death.Meanwhile, the BJP said that Vaze could be one of pawns in the “entire game”.“Sachin Vaze, Param Bir Singh (former Mumbai police commissioner) and (state Home Minister) Anil Deshmukh perhaps are only pawns in the entire game. Real power (s) behind them needs to be investigated along with their motives,” Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said in a statement on Sunday. “Once Vaze starts speaking in the NIA interrogation, more skeletons will tumble out from the government’s closet.”Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said in a statement on Sunday.Earlier in the day, MNS chief Raj Thackeray sought the Centre’s intervention in unearthing the truth behind the explosives-laden car that was found near Ambani’s residence.Addressing a press conference, Thackeray alleged that the Maharashtra government failed to shed light on several basic points in the case.“The explosives case doesn’t revolve only around Param Bir Singh and Sachin Vaze. Police placing the explosives or being asked to do so is not a small thing,” he said.Param Bir Singh, who was under flak over handling of the bomb scare episode, was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner on Wednesday. On Saturday, he wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Home Minister Anil Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect Rs 100 crore per month from bars and hotels.Deshmukh had denied the allegations.The Centre should help in finding out the truth in the case. The basic issue of who placed the explosives-laden vehicle and on whose instructions it was done needs to be found out, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief said.“The basic issue should not be forgotten, otherwise this case will go the same way as actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s (death) case,” he said.Thackeray said it seems very unlikely that the vehicle with explosives was parked near Ambani’s house by Vaze without being asked to do so.Thackeray asked why there is no clarity yet from the state government as to why Param Bir Singh was shunted out.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hiran-death-case-maharashtra-ats-arrest-policeman-bookie-228451

The contents (of Singh’s letter) are sensational,” he said.“The veracity of the letter’s contents will be done by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and (NCP president) Sharad Pawar. The MVA government has completed a year-and-a-half now and all allies need to introspect if their feet are on the ground,” he said.Raut said the police administration is the backbone of any government.The backbone is symbol of pride and self-respect and the government should always strengthen it, he added.“This government is doing well. But now something needs to be rectified and the MVA allies should get together to discuss how the stain can be washed off,” he said.“I have to accept that these allegations and the Waze case have tainted the image of the government...Uddhav Thackeray has always tried to keep the government’s image clean. What happens because of government officials needs to controlled at the right time,” the Shiv Sena MP added.Raut said that Deshmukh himself has called for an investigation into the allegations against him.“Even as the state investigative agencies are under Deshmukh, he has asked the chief minister to order a probe,” he said.The Sena leader said he would try to meet Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Sunday.Earlier in the day, Raut tweeted a two-line Hindi poem, of which one line says- ‘We are only in search of new paths’. When asked about what he meant by it, he only said, “You will know the meaning soon.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/param-birs-letter-waze-case-tainted-maha-vikas-aghadis-image-allies-need-to-introspect-sanjay-raut-228443

Meanwhile, the police have written to the chief medical officer to act against illegal clinics.Both Rajendra Shukla and Rajesh Sahni have been arrested and booked following a police complaint by the woman's husband.The incident, which took place on March 17, came to light when Rajaram, the woman's husband, filed a complaint that his wife and newborn child died due to medical negligence.Sultanpur Superintendent of Police Arvind Chaturvedi said, "We found that it was an unregistered clinic with no infrastructure to perform surgeries. Quacks used razor blades to conduct operations."

21-03-2021||London||New book chronicles Indian fugitives who escaped to UK||A new book on some high-profile, as well as lesser-known Indian extradition cases, attempts to decode why the UK is considered a safe haven for those wanting to escape the law in India.'Escaped: True stories of Indian fugitives in London', released worldwide on Monday, tracks 12 cases involving alleged offenders wanted in India to stand trial for offences ranging from loan defaults to murder. The book, by London-based journalists and researchers Danish and Ruhi Khan, includes a recap of the more recent cases involving former Kingfisher Airlines boss Vijay Mallya and diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on fraud and money laundering charges, as well as some historic ones including those of former Indian Naval officer Ravi Shankaran and musician Nadeem Saifi. “These 12 cases were chosen as much for the significance of the allegations against them as for the interesting arguments raised during their hearings and the observations made in their judgments,” said Danish Khan.“We have studied in much detail many other extradition cases, have had long interviews with experts and pored over case laws and parliamentary reports to understand the principles underlying the extradition process that we explore in our last chapter,” he said.As journalists covering the recent court cases in London, the couple said they drew on their own observations and reporting and also dug into British archives, old newspaper records and parliamentary reports to review cases dating back to the 1950s that have had a significant impact on the India-UK extradition policy. “We have used investigative reporting and eye-witness accounts to bring to life the stories of the flamboyant billionaire Vijay Mallya and diamond czar Nirav Modi. We have also made extensive use of the British archives and historical newspapers reports to bring into focus the less heard but extremely important and intriguing stories of other fugitives that throw a spotlight on India over the past seven decades – whether it is the underworld-cricket-Bollywood nexus or the Indo-Pak diplomatic wars,” said Ruhi Khan.Among some of the past extradition cases is that of a key lieutenant of Dawood Ibrahim, Iqbal Mirchi, who set up a base in London at a time when the Middle East was the most popular destination for underworld dons and it proved a good choice as he was successful in his fight against being extradited to India. The authors say they have tried to take a close look at how Mirchi built his empire, rising from the mohallas of Bombay to London's millionaire row. The book similarly tracks the lives of all these fugitives who "escaped" from India, many winning their battle against extradition and others carrying on a long-drawn legal fight to stay on in the UK.

Mamata, Modi alleged, ran a school of “nirmamata” (cruelty) where the syllabus consisted of “tolabazi” (extortion), cut-money (illegal commission) and syndicate-bazi (land mafia operations).Addressing a rally at Chabua in poll-bound Assam, PM Modi once again accused the Congress of trying to erase the pride of Assam, its tea, from the world map, asking people to “teach it a lesson”.He said a toolkit recently sought to defame Assam tea, famous across the world, and yoga, the legacy of India’s ancient saints, as part of a “conspiracy”.Mamata, who was campaigning in neighbouring Purba Medinipur district, retorted saying the BJP was the biggest “tolabaz” (extortionist) in the country.“What happened to the PM Cares Fund? Why the amount of money collected for the fund was not disclosed,” the TMC supremo said addressing a meeting at Haldia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhaipo-wbs-single-window-pm-228163

In his first interaction with the media, the newly elected Sarkaryavah said the Sangh would support laws against ‘love jihad’.Stating that the issue had nothing to do with religion, he was quoted as saying that “fraudulent methods used to lure girls for marriage, conversion, any kind of misuse or taking them to other countries had to be condemned and opposed”. He also distanced the RSS from the controversial statement of Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat on women wearing ripped jeans. “He (Rawat) is capable of answering,” he said.Under Hosabale’s tenure as Sarkaryavah, the RSS will focus on its expansion plan. The Sangh is preparing for its centenary celebrations in 2025.
