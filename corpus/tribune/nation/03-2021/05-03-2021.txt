05-03-2021||New Delhi||India on track to achieving climate goals: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the country was on track to achieving its climate goals well before the target date as it switches over to energy-efficient mediums and uses waste to generate energy.Speaking after accepting the 2021 CERAWeek Global Energy & Environment Leadership Award for his commitment to energy sustainability and the environment, Modi said climate change and calamity are major challenges facing the world.Both are interlinked, and one way to fight them is through policies, laws, rules and orders, and the other is bringing behavioural change, he said, listing measures taken by his government for sustainable energy usage.While the target of mixing 20 per cent ethanol has been advanced to 2025, 5,000 compressed bio-gas plants will be set up to turn municipal and agriculture waste into energy, he said.While switch over to energy-efficient LED bulbs has helped save 38 million tonnes of carbon emission, modern techniques of irrigation as well as reducing the use of pesticides with greater awareness of improving soil health has greatly helped, he said.The share of non-fossil sources in India's installed capacity of electricity has grown to 38 per cent and the nation adopted Bharat-VI emission norms in April last year to cut vehicular pollution.India, he said, is working to increase the share of natural gas, which is environment friendly and less polluting, in the energy basket from the current 6 per cent to 15 per cent by 2030.Also, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is being promoted as a fuel.He also mentioned of recently launched National Hydrogen Mission and equitable and decentralized model of solar energy generation."India is well on track to achieve its Paris agreement targets well before the target date of 2030," he said.India has maintained that it is not a polluter and cause of climate change and has voluntarily committed to reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.On behavioural changes, Modi cited examples such as people embracing LED bulbs, voluntarily giving up LPG subsidy, increased cooking gas coverage and affordable transportation initiatives.The Prime Minister noted that over the last seven years, India's forest cover has grown significantly, the population of lions, tigers, leopards and waterfowls has grown.These, he said, are great indicators of positive behavioural changes.Accepting the award, he said, "It is with great humility that I accept the CERAWeek Global Energy and Environment Leadership Award. I dedicate this award to the people of our great Motherland, India. I dedicate this award to the glorious tradition of our land that has shown the way when it comes to caring for the environment."         He added that Indians are leaders when it comes to caring for the environment for centuries and the nation's culture, nature and divinity are closely linked.The Prime Minister said that Mahatma Gandhi is one of the greatest environment champions to have ever lived. "If humanity had followed the path laid down by him, we would not face many of the problems we do today."He concluded "now is the time to think logically and ecologically. After all this is not about me or you. It is about our planet's future. We owe this to our coming generations."

05-03-2021||New Delhi||High fuel prices: Tax cut should be joint call of Centre and states, says Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday acknowledged that consumers have a case for petrol and diesel prices to be brought down but said a reduction in taxes to make that happen should be a joint call of the central and state governments.As much as 60 per cent of the retail price of petrol, which has shot above Rs 100 mark at some places in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra and is at an all-time high elsewhere in the country, is made up of central and state taxes. Taxes make up for about 56 per cent of the record high diesel rates.Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to a two-decade low, remained non-committal on taking the first step to cut central taxes to give relief to consumers.For consumers, “there is enough case to say that prices should be down, its a burden,” she said while interacting with journalists at IWPC.While the burden on the consumers is “understood”, the pricing is a vexatious issue, she said.“That’s where I use the word ‘dharamsankat’,” she said. “It is a question which I would like states and the Centre to talk about because it’s not just the Centre which has duties on petroleum products, it also has the states charging.”Stating that both states and the Centre draw revenue out of taxes levied on petrol and diesel, she said 41 per cent of the tax collections made by the Centre go to the states.“So there is an issue which is layered and as a result that has to be a matter ideally for the Centre and the states to talk about,” she added.On the issue of bringing petrol and diesel under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which will end the cascading impact of taxes and bring uniformity, the finance minister said the call has to be taken by the GST Council, the apex decision making body of the indirect tax regime.Currently, the central government levies a fixed rate of excise duty while states levy different rates of VAT. Under the GST, the two would merge and bring uniformity, solving the problem of fuel rates being higher in states with higher VAT.“Whenever the GST Council decides to take up this issue, they are well within their interest to take it up and discuss. It’s a call which the Council has to take,” she said.Asked if the Centre will take such a proposal to the Council in the next meeting likely this month, she said a call will be taken “closer to the date of the Council meeting.” Sitharaman raised excise duty by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively, between March 2020 and May 2020 and it now accounts for more than one-third of the Rs 91.17 a litre price of petrol in Delhi and 40 per cent of Rs 81.47 per litre rate of diesel.Earlier this week, economists at SBI in a report stated that petrol price can go down to Rs 75 a litre across the country if it is brought under the ambit of GST.Diesel will come at Rs 68 a litre and the revenue loss for the Centre and states will be only Rs 1 lakh crore or 0.4 per cent of GDP, according to the calculation by the economists made under the assumption of global crude prices at USD 60 a barrel and exchange rate at Rs 73 per dollar.

05-03-2021||New Delhi||SC frowns upon ‘cut-copy-paste’ order of Orissa HC||The Supreme Court is facing a peculiar problem caused by excessive dependence on technology by some high court judges who pass “cut-copy-paste” orders without independent application of the mind.Confronted with such an order from the Orissa High Court, Justice DY Chandrachud on Friday noted that “One of the problems of the computer-age is copying and pasting of orders. I am fed-up of seeing cut-copy-paste orders of high courts”.“Independent reasons have to be cited for arming an order. There has to be an independent application of the mind. Cut-copy-paste from the tribunal’s judgment only adds to the volume of pages but does not answer the core issue of appeal,” Justice Chandrachud said while dealing with the UPSC’s petition against an Orissa High Court verdict upholding an order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Cuttack Bench.The CAT and HC were supposed to interpret UPSC Rules under Article 320 to decide the legality of the decision to deny a place in the IAS to an officer in view of a disciplinary penalty imposed on him in 2011.The top court set aside the high court’s decision on the ground that DoPT guidelines and sent the matter back to the court.“There is no independent application of mind by the high court. Only the Tribunal’s order has been copied…The tribunal directed the appellant-UPSC to reconsider the case of the respondent for promotion to the IAS by reconvening the meeting of the Selection Committee,” it said.Poor quality of judgments delivered by high courts has been bothering the Supreme Court for several years. In July 2018 it had emphasized that a verdict should clearly narrate facts of the case; issues involved; submissions of the parties; legal principles and reasons for reaching a conclusion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-frowns-upon-cut-copy-paste-order-of-orissa-hc-221042

Vaiko also ruled out scope for joining any third front formation.A meeting would be held here on Saturday to deliberate on the DMK's offer, an MDMK office-bearer said.Senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily, who had earlier stated that there was no stalemate in the talks and that differences would be sorted out with the DMK, said his party was taking a firm stand on the matter.Asked what was the hurdle faced by the Congress in the seat sharing exercise, the senior leader said "negotiations are on”.“We will fight for a respectable number of seats to keep the morale of the Congressmen very high," he said.     He told reporters here that the DMK would realise the need for consolidation of secular forces in Tamil Nadu."It is necessary to defeat the divisive forces represented by the BJP-led NDA and Tamil Nadu is a strong platform to keep up the spirit of federalism and nationalism," he said.Earlier, Moily who was here to discuss the DMKs offer and way forward with the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee at the Congress headquarters Sathyamurthy Bhavan, had indicated that discussions with the DMK on sharing of seats would be resumed.On Thursday, the DMK had urged the Congress to resume talks after AICC in-charge of Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao met TNCC leaders here and discussed the DMK's offer of seats which was not agreeable to the national party.The two rounds of discussions between DMK and Congress have remained inconclusive and sources said the party wanted a decent number of assembly seats.TNCC chief KS Alagiri dismissed speculation that the party would walk out of the DMK-led alliance, saying it was a “making of the media"."We don't have faith on the third front. At present we are consulting our party members," he told reporters after meeting his party leaders.Confirming that discussions with DMK would resume, Moily said: "It (talks) have not yet reached a stalemate... The differences will be sorted out."To a query on the group of 23 dissenting Congress leaders holding a separate meeting recently, he said: "There is no such thing as G 23 or G 24."The Congress is totally united under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and she has always heard grievances and taken action on them, he said.

05-03-2021|| Hyderabad||State upset at a rethink on rail factory in Telangana||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president KT Rama Rao (KTR) has lashed out at the Union Government ignoring the state’s need for infrastructure development in general and going back on the announcement of setting up of a rail coach factory in Kazipet.  KTR, who is the son of Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) and also the Urban Development Minister in his cabinet said: “The Union Government did not have any right to reject or take a U-turn on the promise made to Telangana State in the Parliament on the setting up a rail coach factory in the state. We will fight for our rights”. Demanding an immediate review of its decision on the Kazipet factory he said all party MP have been instructed to take up the issue in the upcoming Parliamentary session. Slamming the Indian Railways that has said there was no need to set up a Railway Coach Factory, KTR said this was clearly an anti-Telangana stand. After the Centre has acceded to the request of the chief minister, the state acquired 150 acres of land and handed over to the Central Railway Department for setting up the Railway Coach Factory, he has said. Telangana has been demanding about eight pending railway lines, two new lines, Kazipet wagon factory, Kazipet Railway Division and setting up of Railway University. This was clearly playing favourites with states and in the just-announced budget not a single rupee was allocated any railway project in Telangana. Regarding the announcement of bullet train and high-speed trains, the BJP government has meted out great injustice to Telangana. “Depriving a bullet or speed train to a metropolis like Hyderabad shows BJP’s discrimination towards Telangana,” Rama Rao said. Attempts by the centre to privatise railways would have serious consequences that could cost the railways about Rs.63,000 crore annually.“Privatisation of railways will affect millions of youths as there will be no new job notifications from Railways, the largest employer in the country,” KTR said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/state-upset-at-a-rethink-on-rail-factory-in-telangana-221029

Later, she received a letter dated May 31, 2010 from a Major General informing that Sanjit’s name had been added to the list of missing prisoners of war (POWs).It said the petitioner was informed that the issue of missing defence personnel was taken up with Pakistani authorities several times, including during the Agra summit in July 2001, but the Pakistani officials said Sanjit could not be traced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-mothers-plea-to-secure-army-officer-son-languishing-in-pak-jail-221028
05-03-2021||New Delhi||We expect China to work towards disengagement in remaining areas: India on Ladakh standoff||India said on Friday that it hoped that China will work towards ensuring that disengagement in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh is completed at the earliest.This aspect was emphasised by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in a telephone conversation with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last week. The External Affairs Minister had emphasised that with the completion of disengagement in the Pangong Lake area, the two sides should now move quickly to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh, said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at the weekly media briefing.Interestingly, these attempts by India and China to cool tensions on their land border come amidst concerted attempts by the new Biden administration to keep afloat the Quad grouping of India, the US, Japan and Australia aimed at containing China in the South China Sea.Close on the heels of a Quad Foreign Ministers’ interaction on February 18, US President Joe Biden has proposed a step up in the engagement through a virtual summit this month with PMs Narendra Modi, Yoshihide Suga (Japan) and Scott Morrison (Australia).Srivastava went on to add that the Indian expectation is that the Chinese side will work, both through the WMCC and Senior Commanders’ meetings, to effect a speedy disengagement.The Senior Military Commanders in their last meeting held on February 20 had also noted that the disengagement in the Pangong Lake area provided a good basis for the resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in the Western Sector.India maintains that maintenance of peace and tranquility along the LAC was essential for the development of bilateral relations and that a prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side.The two Ministers have also agreed to establish a hotline, details of which will be worked out subsequently through diplomatic channels.The disengagement in the remaining areas will lead to the restoration of peace and tranquility and provide conditions for progress in our bilateral relationship, emphasised Srivastava.India says the situation on the LAC for over six months was due to actions of the Chinese side which has sought to effect a unilateral change in its status in Eastern  Ladakh. These actions are in violation of the bilateral agreements and protocol on ensuring peace and tranquility along the LAC in the India-China border areas. Russia welcomes de-escalationRussia welcomed the agreements reached between India and China to deescalate tensions on the line of actual control (LAC).“We continue to monitor the situation at the China-India border. We welcome the agreements reached by the foreign ministers of China and India during the phone conversation on February 25. We respect the parties’ resolve to settle the situation without foreign interference and within the existing framework of the multi-level mechanisms of bilateral dialogue,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said at a media briefing on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-expect-china-to-work-towards-disengagement-in-remaining-areas-india-on-ladakh-standoff-221024
05-03-2021||New Delhi||We are going strong: Farmer leaders as protest enters 100th day||As the farmer agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws enters its hundredth day on Saturday, union leaders have asserted that their movement is far from over, and they are “going strong”.The marathon movement has sent out a message of unity, made “farmers visible once again” and brought them back on the political landscape of the country, they said on Friday.For over three months, the three Delhi border points at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur have transformed into townships occupied by thousands of farmers from different parts of the country, mainly Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said they are prepared to continue the protest as long as it is required.“We are completely prepared. Unless and until the government listens to us and meets our demands, we will not move from here,” Tikait, who is among the leaders at the forefront of the movement, told PTI.Despite several rounds of talks between the government and the farmer unions, the two sides have failed to reach an agreement, and the farmers have refused to budge until the three laws are repealed.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.While a resolution was reached on two of the four demands—rollback of rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning—in January, a decision on repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP continues to be stuck in limbo.However, according to the farmer leaders, the movement, which will complete its 100th day on Saturday, has achieved much beyond the immediate scope of the protest. It has evoked nationwide unity among farmers as well as recognised the contribution of women in farming.Talking about how the protest has made the farming community a noteworthy player in the country’s political landscape, Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India said, “The movement has brought the farmers back on the political landscape of this country. It has made farmers visible once again. It has taught every politician a lesson — not to take ‘panga’ with the farmers.”      “People used to take farmers for granted but this movement has shown that getting into a confrontation with farmers is costly business,” the activist-political told PTI.The fight against the laws was one cause that seemed to have resonated with a large number of farmers throughout the nation, cutting across religious and caste barriers .“It has united farmers like never before. Haryana and Punjab  farmers are united. Despite deep attempts at communal mobilisation in UP, Hindu and Muslim farmers are united in this protest. Gujjars and Meenas are united in Rajasthan,” Yadav said.Kavitha Kuruganti of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) agreed and added that the movement had proven very “constructive” socially as well.“The farmers movement has to be assisted on multiple levels. There is a very important but limited agenda of securing our four demands, but beyond that is the issue of what the farmers movement has been able to achieve as larger outcomes.         “In Punjab, socially...things like substance abuse, alcoholism and so on have come down because the youth have been constructively engaged in the movement,” she said.She added that the movement had also “reinforced the identity of women farmers”.“Women farmers have been able to assert themselves and make their presence and participation felt in this movement. There has been recognition of women farmers as farmers,” she said.To mark International Women’s Day on March 8, the protesting men will hand over charge of managing the protest sites to their female counterparts.“The stage management will be taken care of by women only. Besides, the spokesperson for the farmers movement for that particular day would all be women,” said Avtar Singh Mehma of the Krantikari Kisan Union.Continuing the movement over such a long period has also not been devoid of any setbacks. One of the major setbacks that the movement faced was the January 26 tractor parade that resulted in clashes with the police.“There’s been the setback of January 26, when all farmers were portrayed as violent ‘khalistanis’ and so on. The image that was there of the protest before the 26th was intentionally maligned by the police and the government,” Kurugranthi said.She added that they have also had to “fend off multiple attacks from the government, including supplies being cut, and locals being provoked against the protestors”.Prepared for the long haul, protesting farmers at all the borders have already started gearing up to beat the Delhi summer, by equipping their trolleys with air conditioners, coolers and farmers.Arrangements for better and steady supply of water are also being made.After protesting against the new agri laws in their respective regions, farmers from Punjab and Haryana pushed towards the national capital with their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march and camped at Singhu and Tikri on November 26 last year.They were joined a few days later by farmers from UP who set up a camp at the Ghazipur border.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-are-going-strong-farmer-leaders-as-protest-enters-100th-day-221022

During the test, many new technologies, including solid fuel based ducted ramjet technology, were proven.Successful demonstration SFDR has provided DRDO with a technological advantage that will be employed to develop long range air-to-air missiles. At present, this technology is available only with a handful of countries in the world.A ramjet is a form of air breathing jet engine that uses the engine’s forward motion to compress incoming air without the use of a rotating turbine compressor as in aero-engines like turbo-jet of turbo-fan. Ramjets can operate up to speeds of Mach 6.During the test, air launch scenario was simulated using a booster motor. Subsequently, the nozzle-less booster accelerated it to the required Mach number for ramjet operation.The performance of the missile was monitored using the data captured by electro-optical, radar and telemetry instruments deployed at the test range and confirmed the mission objectives.The launch was monitored by senior scientists of various DRDO labs, including Defence Research and Development Laboratory, Research Centre Imarat and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-tests-ramjet-technology-to-help-develop-long-range-air-to-air-missiles-221007

They should first get our map right,” the finance minister said at an interaction at the Indian Women’s Press Corps.She said Freedom House calls itself an independent body and yet doesn’t have the wherewithal to understand the sovereign map of India.“Get the map straight first. How do I take you seriously when you don’t have our map right and comment on matters so intrinsic as freedom in a multicultural country like India where religions have lived forever without cleansing,” she said.Freedom House this week downgraded India on its freedom rankings from free to partly free.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-get-the-indian-map-right-sitharaman-to-freedom-house-221003
05-03-2021||New Delhi||Legal process has to be followed through, can’t shortcut that: UK on Vijay Mallya extradition||Noting the urgency and desire on the part of India to extradite people accused of corruption, the UK on Friday said a “legal process” is on in Vijay Mallya’s matter, and it has to be followed through as there cannot be any shortcut.In May last year, the fugitive businessman lost his appeals in the British Supreme Court against his extradition to India to face money laundering and fraud charges.Asked when can Mallya be extradited to India and if some kind of legal issue is still pending in the matter, the new British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis, without pointing to any particular case, said he recognises the urgency, importance and the desire to get back people who are accused of corruption to India.“Extradition is a mixture of an administrative and a judicial process, and so it goes to the courts. The home secretary has done what needs to be done from the executive’s point of view in the case of Vijay Mallya. But it (the matter) is part of a judicial process and our courts work their way through those processes. It is something controlled by the judges,” he said.Asked about what kind of issue was holding up Mallya’s extradition, the British envoy said, “There is a process going on. I think it is a legal process and has to be followed through, can’t shortcut that. That is why you have legal processes.”        India has been pressing the UK to extradite Mallya after he lost his appeals in the British Supreme Court.The UK top court’s decision marked a major setback to the 64-year-old businessman as it came weeks after he lost his High Court appeal last April against an extradition order to India.In June last year, India urged the UK not to consider any request for asylum by Mallya as there appeared to be no ground for his persecution in the country.Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by the Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.The High Court verdict in April upheld the 2018 ruling by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018 that the former Kingfisher Airlines boss had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts.Significantly, in another extradition case India is fighting in the UK, a UK judge ruled last week that fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi not only has a case to answer in Indian courts but that there is no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India.Asked about AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal case accused British national Christian Michel, Ellis said, “There we do the things you do in a consular case like that. If it’s a British national you support the person concerned. You also provide consular assistance to the family. We hope and want a swifter resolution of the case.”  It is for the Indian judicial process to work out, what happens in the case, it is not the UK’s business but obviously “we want things to move as quickly as they can”, he said.Ellis’ remarks came days after media reports claimed that the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) found that Michel, who has been held in India since December 2018 after being extradited from the United Arab Emirates, was being “detained arbitrarily”.India had rejected the opinion of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and said the conclusions drawn by the UN panel are based on limited information, biased allegations and an inaccurate understanding of its criminal justice system. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/legal-process-has-to-be-followed-through-cant-shortcut-that-uk-on-vijay-mallya-extradition-220999

Sources are indicating some change in strategy, perhaps also a re-think over some seats in the key state that is a prestige issue for both the BJP and the TMC.Even as party leaders insisted that the BJP’s Bengal list for upcoming Assembly elections was “ready and will be announced soon",  Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda apparently have asked the state leaders to recommend “more names”.While the BJP attacked Mamata for shifting to Nandigram, it is yet to officially announce Suvendu Adhikari’s candidature against her. Sources said: "The top leadership will take the final call after taking into consideration all factors, including the TMC candidates."       Also read: Bengal Assembly polls: Mamata announces TMC candidates for 291 seats, will contest from NandigramSoon after Mamata announced her candidature from Nandigram, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya said: “If the incumbent Chief Minister is unsure of winning her traditional seat, it is because she has sensed strong anti-incumbency on ground. This is just the beginning. Pishi will soon see Maa, Maati and Manush all slipping out of her hands. Bengal will finally see ashol poriborton”. Earlier, the BJP had said if Mamata was confident she should just contest from one seat, in this case Nandigram from where Adhikari, her former confidant and now BJP leader, was expected to be the saffron candidate.Malviya, who also questioned how Mamata knew the BJP was fielding Adhikari from Nandigram, claimed she left Bhowanipore because she was “scared” and that she was keeping “open” the option of Tollygunge.“A nervous Mamata Banerjee not only deserts her traditional seat of Bhowanipore but also keeps the option of contesting Tollygunge open. In the press she slips in, ‘I may contest too’ while announcing Arup Biswas’s name for the seat! Pishi is sensing defeat,” Malviya said.BJP leaders also claimed that Mamata took the decision to shift out of Bhowanipore because of the “large number of Hindus” there.“She knows she would have lost in Bhowanipore,” they said.Meanwhile,  sources also said the leadership was considering fielding Union Minister Babul Supriyo from Bhowanipore if Mamata had decided to contest from there.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-polls-amit-shah-takes-control-of-ticket-distribution-220985

It came close of the heels of the railways increasing ticket cost for short-distance trains.The national transporter said the increase in short-distance travel cost, too, was aimed at discouraging unnecessary travel during the pandemic.“Present increase in platform ticket prices at some stations is a ‘temporary’ measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus through crowding. This is being done at a limited number of stations which see heavy rush,” the Railways said, adding that the hike had been effected in only seven stations in Mumbai division out of a total of 78.It said powers to raise platform ticket prices to prevent crowding at stations had been delegated to Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs) since 2015.It also said this was in practice for many years and was used occasionally as a “short-term crowd control measure”.“There is nothing new about it,” it said. Earlier, this had been done during festivals and gradually rolled back, it added.“This time it’s being due to COVID-19 exigencies and the decision has been taken in interest of public only. At many places, it was introduced in March after lockdown,” the Railways said.

05-03-2021||Satya Prakash||'Tandav' case: SC protects Amazon Prime Video India head Aparna Purohit from arrest||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 5The Supreme Court on Friday protected from arrest Amazon Prime Video India head Aparna Purohit who is facing criminal charges for alleged inappropriate depiction of UP Police personnel, Hindu deities and an adverse portrayal of a character playing the prime minister in controversial web series 'Tandav'.While protecting Purohit from arrest and other coercive action, a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked her to co-operate with the investigation.After perusing the latest regulations notified by the Centre, it said the guidelines were ineffective in checking pornographic content on OTT platforms."We went through the Technology intermediary guidelines. But there is no teeth. No power of prosecution. These are just guidelines. No mechanism to control it. Without legislation you can't control it," the Bench noted.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that a fresh legislation was under consideration.Expressing concern over pornographic content on some over-the-top (OTT) platforms, the Supreme Court had on Thursday said there should be a mechanism to screen such programmes.It had asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to place before it on Friday the recent guidelines issued by the Centre to regulate social media platforms.Last week, the Centre had notified Information Technology (Guidelines for intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules, 2021) to regulate the functioning of online media portals and publishers, OTT platforms and social media intermediaries.“A balance has to be struck as some OTT platforms are also showing pornographic materials on their platforms,” the Bench had said.On behalf of Purohit, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi had argued that she was neither a producer nor an actor but still she had been made an accused in around 10 cases across India in relation to Tandav -- a nine-episode political thriller starring Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub – that started streaming recently.The Supreme Court on January 27 refused to grant interim protection from arrest to the director, producer, writer and actor of web series 'Tandav' who faced multiple cases of allegedly hurting religious sentiments of Hindus in six states.It had also dismissed their pleas for quashing of the FIRs, saying, "You can’t play a role hurting religious sentiments of others." The right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution was not absolute, it had noted.The Bench had, however, issued notices on their petitions for clubbing of all the FIRs and them to one place.The 'Tandav' team members were booked for gate speech and hurting religious sentiments of Hindus under Sections 153-A, 295, 505(1)(b), 505(2) and 469 of IPC and certain provisions of the Information Technology Act.The top court had on October 15 last year issued notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking setting up of an autonomous body to regulate OTT platforms which provide paid film and television content to consumers via a high-speed Internet connection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tandav-case-sc-protects-amazon-prime-video-india-head-aparna-purohit-from-arrest-220955

05-03-2021||New Delhi||While Delhi doctor battles COVID, her autistic sons pine||An already challenging life combining full-time work as a doctor with mothering two autistic sons was turned upside down for Meenakshi Mourya when the pandemic hit India.The country has the world’s second-highest recorded caseload of COVID-19 in the world after the United States and a shortage of healthcare workers puts a heavy burden on those there are.For almost a month as cases spiked last year, Mourya said she could not spend time with her children as she worked long and gruelling hours treating a flood of patients.“I was so emotionally down at that time...patients were dying in front of me,” she said, visibly emotional as she spoke to Reuters in the home she shares with her husband, also a doctor, and their four and nine-year-olds, who need help to eat and find it hard to communicate.“I did not want them to see me, because when they see me, they will cry.”An anaesthesia specialist at Delhi’s biggest public hospital, Safdarjung, Mourya’s job was critical during last year’s peak, when the Indian capital was recording around 7,000-8,000 new cases every day.At home, her sons sat at the window, pining for her, she said. The lockdown meant their special education classes were halted too, putting extra pressure on their female carer.“They were restless, uncomfortable, crying all the time, and waiting for me, sitting at the window ... sometimes in a very confused state, not eating well,” Mourya said.With more than 11 million recorded cases of COVID-19 and more than 150,000 deaths, India has seen cases rising again since early February. In Delhi, though, the virus is now under far better control, allowing Mourya more time with her kids.They still cry when she leaves for work, often clinging to the window for hours, but when she comes home, she says she is now able to enjoy giving them the intensive care they need.And there has been a bright spot in the family’s ordeal: while the older son finds speech difficult, the younger one has begun using words, among them, ‘Papa’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/while-delhi-doctor-battles-covid-her-autistic-sons-pine-220917

05-03-2021||New Delhi||Over Rs 650 crore discrepancies found after raids on Taapsee Pannu, Anurag Kashyap and others, claims IT Dept||The Income Tax Department has detected financial irregularities of over Rs 650 crore after it raided two film production companies, two talent management companies and a leading actress, the Central Board of Direct Taxes claimed on Thursday but did not take any names.The statement from the CBDT came as raids on the homes and offices of Bollywood actor Taapsee Pannu, director Anurag Kashyap and his partners who launched the now shuttered Phantom Films continued in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad for the second day.The searches also covered some executives of celebrity and talent management companies KWAN and Exceed, officials said.        A day later, without naming the people or companies searched, the CBDT said the entities searched were mainly engaged in the business of production of motion pictures, web series, acting, direction and talent management of celebrities and other artists.                 Official sources identified the entities raided as Pannu and the four former promoters of Phantom Films—Kashyap, director-producer Vikramaditya Motwane, producer Vikas Bahl and producer-distributor Madhu Mantena. They also identified the celebrity and talent management companies as Kwan and Exceed.The second film production company that was raided belongs to Kashyap, the sources said.“Evidence of huge suppression of income by the leading film production house compared to the actual box office collections has been unearthed,” the statement from CBDT, the administrative body of the IT Department, claimed.“The company officials have not been able to explain discrepancy of around Rs 300 crore,” it said.                   Evidence related to “manipulation and under-valuation” of share transactions of the production house amongst the film directors and shareholders, with a tax implication of about Rs 350 crore has also been found and is being further investigated, it alleged.“Evidence of cash receipts by the leading actress amounting to Rs 5 crore has been recovered and further investigation is going on,” the CBDT claimed.Also, “non-genuine or bogus expenditure” to related concerns by the leading producers and directors having tax implication of about Rs 20 crore has been detected, the statement said.“Similar findings have been made in the case of the leading actress also,” it alleged.The statement added that “huge amount” of digital data has been seized in the form of emails, WhatsApp chats, hard disk from the offices of the two talent management companies.A total of seven bank lockers were found and placed under restraint, the CBDT statement said.The searches against Mantena are also being carried out in context of his links with Kwan, of which he is a co-promoter, officials said. While Kwan’s client list includes Deepika Padukone, Exceed manages Saif Ali Khan and Sonakshi Sinha among others. Pannu, 33, and Kashyap, 48, both known to be outspoken in their views on a range of issues, were shooting in Pune on Wednesday and were understood to have been questioned by the tax sleuths as part of the preliminary questioning that takes place during raids.Kashyap and Pannu, who worked together in the 2018 film “Manmarziyaan”, are now collaborating in the upcoming film “Dobaara”.Pannu’s last tweet was on March 1, when she spoke on the Supreme Court asking a man accused of repeated rape whether he was willing to marry the woman. When the court was told he is already married, he was asked to seek regular bail from the concerned court.The actor, who has made a name for herself in films such as “Pink”, “Thappad” and “Badla”, put out a strong worded post on the matter.Kashyap, who had visited JNU and Shaheen Bagh during the anti-CAA protests last year and is also known to be vocal about his views, has been quiet on Twitter in recent times except for occasionally retweeting others.Ruling allies Congress and NCP in Maharashtra had criticised the raids and termed them an attempt to suppress the voices of those who speak against the Narendra Modi-led government.The raids also attracted huge attention on social media platforms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-rs-650-crore-discrepancies-found-after-raids-on-taapsee-pannu-anurag-kashyap-and-others-claims-it-dept-220514

05-03-2021||New Delhi||Explain rationale behind classification for COVID-19 vaccination: HC to Centre||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the Centre to explain the rationale behind keeping strict control over class of persons who can be vaccinated against COVID-19 currently as under the present system those above the age of 60 years or with co-morbidities can receive vaccination.The High Court said the two institutes which have developed the vaccines COVISHIELD and COVAXIN – Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech – have more capacity to provide the vaccines but it seems that their full capacity is not being exploited."We are not utilising it fully. We are either donating it to foreign countries or selling it to them and are not vaccinating our own people. So there has to be that sense of responsibility and urgency," a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The High Court directed the two institutes to file separate affidavits on their capacity to manufacture the vaccines on per day, per week and per month basis and also the current optic of the vaccines and how much unused capacity is lying.Also read: Punjab, 5 other states account for over 85 per cent of fresh Covid casesThey also have to indicate if they can scale up their production capacities, it said.“Union of India shall file an affidavit disclosing the capacity to transport the vaccines while maintaining the whole chain, particularly to the NCT of Delhi. The Union of India shall also indicate the extent to which it is presently being used,” the court said.“The Union of India shall explain the rationale behind keeping strict control over class of persons who can be vaccinated as noticed in our last order. Under the present system, persons above 60 years of age and between 45 to 60 years with co-morbidities can receive vaccination.“An affidavit to be filed by the Union of India disclosing the rationale for such classification,” it said.It also asked the Delhi Government to carry out inspection of medical facilities available in court complexes here and to report if COVID-19 vaccination centres could be set up there and also the short comings in facilities.The High Court asked all the authorities to file their affidavits by March 9 and listed the matter for further hearing on March 10.The High Court was hearing a PIL initiated by it to examine the demand of Bar Council of Delhi to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers as “frontline workers” so that they could receive COVID-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition.It also asked the Delhi High Court Bar Association and BCD to disclose the strength of members registered with them to get an idea of number of people to be vaccinated in the judicial system in the national capital.During the hearing, the counsel for Bharat Biotech sought to know the target audience for vaccination and whether the ambit was entire judiciary.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and advocate Anil Soni, representing the Centre, informed the court that selection of class of people for vaccination was a policy decision which was taken by an expert body.Sharma informed the High Court that a similar petition was pending before the Supreme Court and will come up for hearing on Monday.To this, the Bench said the issue here was to find out if the whole judicial system, including judges, lawyers and court staff, can be prioritised without age and co-morbidities limitation.On Wednesday, the High Court had taken suo motu cognisance and initiated on its own a public interest litigation on the basis of a communication received from the Bar Council of Delhi.It had said there is a clear pattern emerging that the number of COVID-19 positive cases increase with greater intermingling and congregation of people.It had said premises and court rooms of the High Court, which is scheduled to resume physical functioning from March 15, and some of the district courts are air-conditioned and with increased footfall, there is likelihood of the rate of infection amongst those who attend the courts spiking, once the full-fledged physical functioning of courts in Delhi resumes.Also read: Kota man dies a day after taking anti-Covid jabIt had noted that in the first round, frontline workers, particularly of the medical community were covered, and others such as the police force have already been covered.The court had referred to a communication sent to the Chief Justice by Bar Council of Delhi chairman Ramesh Gupta requesting that appropriate directions be issued to the authorities concerned to make available necessary infrastructure in court premises, particularly in dispensaries for vaccinating the members of the judicial system by treating them as frontline workers.The Bench had said that the need of the hour was to vaccinate the masses, in view of the raging pandemic, on a war footing so as to secure the life and health of all those who step out of their homes to attend to their avocations and professions.It had added that since the cases listed on any given day are mostly different from those listed on the previous or the next day, the litigants are also different and this peculiarity exposes the judges, court staff and the lawyers to the risk of contracting the disease.The Bench had observed that the co-morbidities enlisted by the government to accommodate people of 45 to 60 years age are serious conditions from which the judges, staff and advocates may or may not be suffering with but this does not mean that the risk of their contracting the disease and suffering serious health issues, including fatality, does not exist.

05-03-2021||New Delhi||HC asks UP police to give X-Ray, post-mortem report of dead farmer to their Delhi counterparts||The Delhi High Court Thursday directed the Uttar Pradesh police to provide original X-Ray plate and video of post mortem of the 25-year-old farmer, who died after his tractor overturned during the tractor rally on Republic Day.Justice Yogesh Khanna said let both the original documents be handed over to the official of Delhi Police on March 5 at 2 pm and they shall be retained by the investigating officer in safe custody.The high court was hearing a plea by deceased Navreet Singh’s grandfather—Hardeep Singh—claiming that the victim suffered gunshot injuries to his head. His post mortem was conducted at Rampur district hospital in Uttar Pradesh.However, both the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police claimed before the court that Navreet did not suffer any gunshot wounds.Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi Police, told the court that though they have requested the Uttar Pradesh Police to give original X-Ray plate and post mortem video but the officials of Rampur police and hospital denied the same, unless ordered by the court.Advocate Garima Prashad, representing the Uttar Pradesh Police and the CMO of the hospital, said they do not have X-Ray report and they only have the X-Ray plate and the post mortem report which they are willing to handover to the Delhi Police on the date and time fixed by the court.She said the original post mortem and inquest reports have already been handed over to the Delhi Police.Advocate Vrinda Grover, representing the petitioner, sought a copy of the X-Ray report and post mortem and inquest reports.As Mehra stated that they have no objection in giving those documents to the petitioner, the high court said, “let the needful be done” and listed the matter for further hearing on March 17.Grover also said once the original X-Ray plate is received from the Uttar Pradesh Police, the court can ask AIIMS or any other forensic department to prepare a report out of the X-Ray plate for their perusal.Delhi Police had earlier said according to the post-mortem report, the young farmer died due to a head injury as a result of the accident and all his injuries were possible in a road accident.The petition, also filed through advocate Soutik Banerjee, has sought a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of the young farmer.The Delhi Police, also represented by advocate Chaitanya Gosain, has relied upon the footage collected from CCTV cameras located at the site—Deen Dayal Upadhyay marg—where the young farmer died and said that he was driving the tractor at high speed and the vehicle overturned after hitting the barricades.The Delhi Police agreed to show the footage to the petitioner’s counsel.It had said that the footage also shows that the police personnel were running away for safety from the speeding tractor and that none of them fired upon the vehicle or the driver.The Delhi Police have also said CCTV footage further indicates that the protesters did not take the injured Navreet Singh to any nearby hospital and instead they attacked the ambulances that reached the site after hearing about the accident.It had said the protesters instead of taking him to the hospital immediately, kept his body on the road for five hours and then spread rumours that he was killed in police firing.The Uttar Pradesh police, in its status report, had stated that no FIR has been registered by it in connection with the death as claimed by the petitioner.The petitioner’s counsel had earlier contended that the way Delhi Police has conducted itself in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”.It had argued that this indicated that the victim lost control of the tractor and it overturned as he was shot by the police personnel.According to the police, the man had died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour of the pre-agreed route for the march.The police had claimed that the man was driving the tractor and he came under the vehicle as it overturned.

05-03-2021||Ravi S Singh||EPFO fixes 8.5 per cent interest on EPF deposits for 2020-21||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 4The Central Board of Trustees, EPF, in its meeting on Thursday recommended 8.5 per cent annual rate of interest to be credited on the EPF accumulations in members’ accounts for the financial year 2020-21.The meeting, presided over by Union Labour Minister Santosk Kumar Gangwar, was held in Srinagar.“Since FY 2014, EPFO has consistently generated returns not less than 8.5 per cent,” the Labour Ministry said, adding: “A high EPF interest rate, along with compounding, makes a significant difference to gains of subscribers.”“This is despite the fact that the EPFO has consistently followed a conservative approach towards investment, putting highest emphasis on the safety and preservation of principal first approach,” Gangwar said during the meeting.The Ministry said the EPFO over the years had been able to distribute higher income to its members, through various economic cycles with minimal credit risk.It informed that during the period from 2015-16, the EPFO prudently started investing in equity through exchange traded funds based on the NSE 50 and BSE 30 indices.The investment in equity assets started from 5 per cent for FY 2015 and subsequently gone up to 15 per cent of the incremental portfolio.For FY 2021, the EPFO decided to liquidate investment and the interest rate recommended is a result of combined income from interest received from debt investment as well as income realised from equity investment.This has enabled the EPFO to provide higher return to its subscribers and still allowing the EPFO with healthy surplus to act as cushion for providing higher return in future also. There is no over-drawl on the EPFO corpus due to this income distribution.“The assured fixed return approach of the EPFO, announced by the CBT every year along with the tax exemptions, makes it an attractive choice for investors, providing them with strong social security in the form of provident fund, pension and insurance schemes,” the Ministry said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/epfo-fixes-8-5-per-cent-interest-on-epf-deposits-for-2020-21-220457
