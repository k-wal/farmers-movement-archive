01-03-2021||New Delhi||Extreme weather events claimed over 1.4 lakh lives in last 50 years: Meteorologists||Extreme weather events (EWEs) claimed the lives of more than 1.4 lakh people in the last 50 years, with deaths due to occurrences like heat waves and lightning witnessing a rise, according to a paper by country's top meteorologists.The paper also stated that the period from 1970-2019 recorded 7,063 extreme weather events – heat waves, cold waves, floods, lightning and tropical cyclones.It also emphasised the need to develop action plans to prioritise high population states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Maharashtra, Kerala, and West Bengal that suffer from maximum mortalities by EWEs."In the past 50 years (1970-2019) a total of 7,063 EWEs associated with at least one mortality, were found to have occurred in the country. These 7,063 events caused 141,308 deaths, with an average of 20 deaths per event," stated the paper.As per the paper, 65,130 people were killed in 3,175 incidents of floods. Some 40,358 people died in 117 tropical cyclones, with 344.9 deaths per mortality event.There were 706 heat wave incidents that claimed the lives of 17,362 people, the paper mentioned, adding there is a rise in the number of casualties because of this type of EWE.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a forecast of above normal summers for north and east India which usually sees high number of deaths due to heat waves.The temperature is on rise in the last two decades due to global warming.The year 2020 was the eighth warmest since 1901 but it was "substantially lower" than the highest warming observed in 2016, the IMD had said earlier this year.The IMD said the past two decades – 2001-2010 and 2011-2020 – were also the warmest decades on record with anomalies of 0.23 degree Celsius and 0.34 degree Celsius respectively, indicating the overall rising temperature.Lighting has been another major killer. Some 8,862 people died in 2,157 lightning events."For the country as a whole, floods and tropical cyclones have been two major disasters causing mortality, though heatwaves and lightning are gaining importance," it said.The paper has been authored by Kamaljit Ray, RK Giri, SS Ray, AP Dimri and M Rajeevan, who is also the secretary in the Ministry of Earth Sciences.Despite the increase in EWEs, the analysis shows a decrease of 27 and 31 per cent in the mortality rate due to total EWEs in each of the last two decades as compared to the earlier decade."Decadal analysis of the human mortality rates indicates mortality due to EWEs was maximum in the decade 1970-1979 (87.5 per cent of these mortalities were due to floods and tropical cyclones) followed by 1990-1999," the paper stated.The mortality rates were lower in 1980-1989 as there was no major tropical cyclone landfall. In the last decade (2010-2019) the mortality rates reduced by 66.5 per cent as compared to the highest mortality rate decade (1970-1979).The maximum mortalities reported in the last decade were 49 per cent due to floods, followed by 24 per cent due to heat waves. The mortalities due to tropical cyclones were lowest (2.3 per cent) during 2000-2019.Even though the frequency of tropical cyclones did not show an increase in the past 50 years, the mortalities have reduced significantly, due to improved models and thus better forecasts and warnings, their timely dissemination and better disaster management on the ground, said Rajeevan."There is a significant increase in the EWEs in the last 50 years, except for cyclones. However, the mortality per event has decreased for all the EWEs, though it is significant only in the case of heatwaves, floods, and total EWEs," the paper mentioned.Rajeevan said even though the IMD issues forecasts for heat waves and lightning, people may not be able to take corrective steps."Mortality per year per million population has a negative trend for all EWEs, except for heatwave and lightning," it added."In the case of lightning, the mortality rates have significantly increased in the last two decades as compared to earlier decades," the paper further stated.The decadal analysis for five decades showed that, despite the significant increase in EWEs, there was a decrease in mortality rate due to total EWEs in each of the last two decades as compared to the earlier decade.In the case of floods, tropical cyclones, and cold waves, the current decade had a lower death rate, compared to the previous decade. However, most of these decadal trends in mortality rates are not statistically significant, except for an increasing trend due to lightning events.At all-India levels, the mortality per EWE has declined by 48.6 per cent in the last two decades compared to the previous two decades, the paper noted.Much of this decrease is due to a decline in mortalities caused by tropical cyclones and floods, which account for 75 per cent of the total mortalities caused by various EWEs.This study was carried out to understand the trend in the mortalities due to various extreme weather events in India and its various states, using a 50-year (1970-2019) dataset from IMD.The analysis was done on an annual basis, decadal basis, and taking two 20-year slice periods.The overall purpose of the study was to provide necessary inputs to the government for prioritising its disaster management policy towards specific disasters and vulnerable states.

01-03-2021||Lucknow||UP Assembly passes Bill for recovery of damages from protesters||The Uttar Pradesh Assembly on Monday passed two Bills, including one that relates to recovery of damages to public and private properties from protesters, amid Opposition demands that it be referred to a select committee.According to the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Bill, 2021, protesters found guilty of damaging government or private properties will face imprisonment of one year or a fine ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 1 lakh.The House also passed the Uttar Pradesh Goonda Control (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to empower Joint and Deputy Commissioners of Police to act under the legislation.Assembly Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit announced the passage of both Bills.The Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Bill, 2021 was tabled in the House by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna.Leader of Opposition (LoP) Ram Govind Chaudhary said the state government was only enacting laws to pat its own back."Since Independence, there is a tradition of writing on walls. If it will be banned, how will political parties express themselves?" he asked.If any goon or anti-social element enters a demonstration or agitation and causes damage, the government will make recovery from a political party worker which would not be right, he said.Samajwadi Party leader Ujjwal Raman Singh demanded that the Bill be referred to a select committee, saying the government makes laws in haste and later withdraws them.Bahujan Samaj Party leader Lalji Verma backed the demand.The Bill has been brought with a view to suppress the democratic movement and it should be presented only after giving it a thorough thought, he said.However, minister Khanna said this Bill had been brought in good spirit and will start a good tradition.The Opposition's proposal to send the Bill to the select committee fell flat as it does not have the required numbers.Earlier, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said public and private properties in the state were damaged during political processions, demonstrations, strikes and agitations. Pamphlets and posters are pasted on walls and they are defaced with ink or paint.He had said that a law would be enacted to protect the beauty of towns, cities and public interest and recovery would be made from those who cause harm.The Uttar Pradesh Goonda Control (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was also passed by the Assembly.It amends the existing Goonda Act to empower Joint and Deputy Commissioners of Police to take action under the law.The Goonda Act allows police to keep habitual offenders under preventive detention for a year. According to the law, a "goonda" is a person who, either by himself or as a member or leader of a gang, habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offences.After Khanna tabled the Bill, LoP Chaudhary and BSP's Lalji Verma demanded that it be sent to a select committee.Khanna said once enacted, this law would be effective only in Lucknow and Gautam Buddh Nagar districts where the police commissionerate system has been implemented.He said Section 2 of the Uttar Pradesh Goonda Control Act, 1970 had been amended.Till date, the District Magistrate and the Additional District Magistrate had the right of hearing and taking action under the section. But now, in the commissionerate police system of Lucknow and Noida (Gautam Buddh Nagar), the Joint and Deputy Commissioners of Police will be empowered to take action, he said.The minister further said the amendments had been made as Police Commissioners are senior officers and DMs are below them in districts.Both Bills have now been referred to the Legislative Council.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Cong leader Anand Sharma slams party’s tie-up with ISF in West Bengal||Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Monday slammed the party’s tie-up with Indian Secular Front (ISF) led by Muslim cleric Abbas Siddiqui in West Bengal, saying it was against the party’s core ideology and Gandhian and Nehruvian secularism.He also said the party “cannot be selective in fighting the communalists” and it must do so in all its manifestations, irrespective of religion and colour.Sharma, a former union minister and a leader of the group of 23 which had written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanding organisational overhaul, said the issue of a tie-up with a radical party like the ISF should have been discussed and approved by the Congress Working Committee (CWC).The CWC is the highest decision-making body of the party that takes important decisions of the party.The CWC is the highest decision-making body of the party.Sharma is a member of the CWC and the deputy leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha.The Congress is contesting the West Bengal assembly elections in alliance with the Left and ISF, but is fighting the CPI-M in Kerala as the principal opposition party.Leaders of the Left, Congress and the ISF addressed a joint rally at the Brigade Parade ground in Kolkata on Sunday.“Congress’ alliance with parties like ISF and other such forces militates against the core ideology of the party and Gandhian and Nehruvian secularism, which forms the soul of the party. These issues need to be approved by the CWC,” he said on Twitter.“Congress cannot be selective in fighting communalists but must do so in all its manifestations, irrespective of religion and colour. The presence and endorsement by West Bengal PCC President is painful and shameful, he must clarify,” the senior party leader said.However, Chowdhury said the West Bengal PCC has not taken any decision of its own.Any decision in this regard has been taken jointly in consultation with the party leadership, he said.Sources said the Congress' seat-sharing arrangement is with the Left in the state and the Left parties will accommodate ISF in their share.Joining the Left and Congress leaders at the dais was Abbas Siddique of the iconic Furfura Shareef and founder of the Indian Secular Front (ISF), a recent member of the opposition alliance in the state.Sharma and several other ‘G-23’ leaders had gathered in Jammu on Saturday and said that the party was weakening, in an apparent show of dissent.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Farmers to block KMP Expressway on Saturday: SKM leader||Protesting farmers will block the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal Expressway on March 6, a Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader said on Monday.Balbir Singh Rajewal said a call has been given to farmers camping at three Delhi border points to block the KMP Expressway from 11 am to 5 pm on Saturday.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur --- demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws enacted in September last year.“We will block the KMP expressway on March 6 as part of the intensification of the ongoing protest,” Rajewal told PTI.The 136-km Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway or the western peripheral expressway was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018.It was built to decongest the ever-busy roads of Delhi, especially by reducing the number of trucks entering the national capital, thus helping to curb pollution. It provides high-speed link between northern Haryana and southern districts and gives uninterrupted high-speed link for traffic, especially commercial traffic, from Haryana to neighbouring states.Meanwhile, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said that a joint programme of action is being worked out by it along with many central trade unions which have expressed their support and solidarity for the ongoing farmers’ movement.In a statement, the Morcha said the month of March will witness numerous Mahapanchayats across the country, including in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, West Bengal and Odisha.

01-03-2021||Kanyakumari (TN)||TN should show the way to India in keeping out BJP, oust CM: Rahul Gandhi||Tamil Nadu should show the way to India in keeping away forces that are inimical to language and culture and those projecting “one culture, one nation and one history” concept, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Monday.The Lok Sabha MP participated in multiple engagements in this district as part of his three-day tour of Tamil Nadu, ahead of the April 6 assembly polls in the state which his party is facing in alliance with the MK Stalin-led DMK.If he were to interview Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi said he would ask “why are you convinced that all answers should come from you”.He also said the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), strongly opposed to by Tamil Nadu political parties, was a “big issue” and “not beneficial” for students.The Wayanad MP displayed his fitness when he effortlessly did multiple push-ups, including one-handed, while he shook a leg with the students he interacted with, as accompanying Congress leaders Dinesh Gundu Rao and KS Alagiri joined him.At a public address in Nagercoil in the district, Gandhi said history has shown nobody can rule Tamil Nadu other than the Tamil people.“This election will show the same thing that only a person who truly represents the Tamil people can be a chief minister of Tamil Nadu,” he said.“Tamil Nadu chief minister (K Palaniswami) who bows to Prime Minister Narendra Modi will never be able to do this. The chief minister should bow to the people of the state,” he said.The RSS and Modi “insult Tamil language and culture”, he said, adding the people should not allow them to gain a foothold in the state.Gandhi further said “Modi talks about one culture, one nation, one history and one leader.”“Is Tamil not an Indian language? Is Bengali not an Indian language? Is Tamil culture not Indian culture? This is the battle that is being fought in this election,” he said as the crowd cheered.“It is my duty to protect the Tamil language, culture and history just as it is my duty to protect all languages and religions in India,” he said.He accused the BJP-led government at the Centre as well as the Palaniswami government of not respecting Tamil language, culture or tradition.Recalling the yeoman service of late Congress MP H Vasantha Kumar, Gandhi said he always stood by the party values. He laid a wreath at Kumar’s memorial at Kanyakumari.During his interaction with students of St. Joseph’s Matric Higher Secondary School, Mulagumoodu in the district, he said NEET is a ‘big’ issue in the state.“NEET is a big issue here. It is stopping many youngsters from pursuing their dreams. It is not beneficial,” he claimed.Arguing that teachers and students are both equally important in shaping education policy, as they are the pillars of the institution, he said no policy will be beneficial if the views of teachers and students are not obtained.“If I force you to read, then it is arrogance, but if I ask what do you require, then it is humility. Arrogance creates problems whereas humility resolves problems,” he said.Asked why youngsters don’t want to make politics a career, Gandhi said it could be so because “there are some politicians who steal from people.”“There are good political leaders who work for the people, try to understand people and empower them. Draw inspiration from such leaders who help people,” he said.Recalling his brief interaction with a few boys with whom he sipped tea, before arriving at the school, Gandhi said he was impressed by the ambition of one of them who wanted to become an astronaut.He said he would write a letter to the Chairman of ISRO who may allow the boy to visit the space station.“When he visits, he may be inspired and will grow up to join the space mission...,” Gandhi said.Becoming an astronaut was the boy’s choice but helping him achieve his dream was the politician’s job, he added.Asked what he would ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi, if he were to interview him, he shot back, “you have asked me a tricky question”, evoking laughter from the audience.“I would ask, why are you convinced that all answers should come from you. Why don’t you listen to what the people of the country feel or want to say,” he said.Many students who interacted with Gandhi addressed him as Rahul “Anna” (elder brother).What is Rahul Anna’s recipe for good health, does he follow a special diet regimen, a student asked.“I run, swim and cycle. I have learnt Aikido martial art,” Gandhi said and demonstrated the Japanese technique.During his tour, he tasted palm fruit and sipped tea in a shop.Later, at a roadshow, he lashed out at the Centre over demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST), saying they “destroyed” many small and medium businesses.“The new farm laws are going to destroy the lives of our farmers,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tn-should-show-the-way-to-india-in-keeping-out-bjp-oust-cm-rahul-gandhi-219113

Even as Naidu sought to know why he was being detained, the police denied him the permission for the protest citing the model code of conduct, which is in place for urban local body elections, and prevalence of coronavirus pandemic."I have been the Chief Minister for 14 years and am now the Leader of Opposition. Don't I have the right to protest? Why can't I go and meet the District Collector and the SP?” Naidu angrily questioned the police officials and sat on the floor of the airport lounge.On Sunday, the Tirupati Municipal Corporation officials had allegedly ransacked a tea stall belonging to a TDP leader, whose wife was contesting the March 10 elections.The party alleged that the ruling YSR Congress wanted the TDP candidate to withdraw from the contest but since she refused, the tea stall of her husband was ransacked.TDP politburo member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu strongly condemned the police action against Naidu and said it further exposed the draconian rule of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy."Detention of the opposition leader is nothing but trampling of civil liberties.

He urged the party workers to inform people about the works carried out by the State and Central governments and be a part of people’s “happiness and sorrows” and help solve their problems.Next year, the key BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand are due for polls along with Punjab – the epicenter of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Western UP, along with Punjab, will be the real big test of the BJP on the three Central farm laws against which farmers of the region are agitating.Amid the ongoing agitation, the BJP has a tall order to defend – as many as 312 seats in the 403-member UP Assembly. The treasury benches of the Yogi Adityanath-led government have 324 MLAs. This is in direct contrast to upcoming Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala and Puducherry where the party in all has just four seats. Assam is the only poll-bound state where BJP is heading the government.In fact, in two out of the five election-bound Assemblies – Tamil Nadu and Puducherry – the saffron party has “zero” number of seats. In Kerala, it has just one seat and in West Bengal, three.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-gets-started-with-mission-uttar-pradesh-219106
01-03-2021||New Delhi||IATA plans to launch travel pass this month; in talks with Indian authorities, airlines||To provide easier air travel amid the coronavirus pandemic, global airlines’ body IATA plans to launch its travel pass by the end of March and is also in talks with Indian authorities and carriers for using the pass in India.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has around 290 airlines as members, including Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and SpiceJet.The IATA Travel Pass will be a mobile app to help passengers easily and securely manage their travel in line with government requirements for COVID-19 tests or vaccines.There is a need to have a global and standardised solution to validate and authenticate all country regulations regarding COVID-19 passenger travel requirements.IATA Regional Director for Airports and External Relations (Asia Pacific) Vinoop Goel told PTI that the pass will move existing paper processes to a digital platform and joins it with up-to-date information on entry requirements. This will also make the process more convenient and help avoid fraudulent documentation.“There will be paper-based alternatives for people who do not have mobile phones, albeit less convenient ones. IATA is already managing health requirements through its Timatic solution, so IATA Travel Pass is a natural evolution to support the industry during the pandemic,” he noted.The first cross-border pilot project for the pass was announced at the end of 2020. The iOS and android launch is slated for the end of March 2021 and IATA is working as fast as we can with airlines to bring it to market, Goel said.To contain spreading of coronavirus infections, restrictions on cross-border movement of people are in place in various countries. There are also strict requirements such as carrying COVID-negative certificates for overseas travellers.When asked whether IATA is in discussions with Indian carriers for rolling out the pass, Goel said the grouping is in talks with Indian authorities and airlines for the pass to be used in India.“IATA Travel Pass is a fully digital solution that can be quickly rolled out and can cater to a huge aviation market like India. Also, given the prevalence of e-solutions in normal Indian day-to-say activities, the Indian population is well versed with such mobile solutions and we are confident that they will be quick to adopt the IATA Travel Pass.“Given the scale and diversity of the Indian air travel market and the multiple languages used, it will be very difficult to implement a paper-based certificate verification process,” he noted.The pass will have four open and interoperable modules—global registry of health requirements, global registry of testing/ vaccination centres, Lab App and contactless travel app. The last one will help create a digital passport, receive test and vaccination certificates and verify that they are sufficient for their itinerary, and share testing or vaccination certificates with airlines and authorities to facilitate travel.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Mandatory FASTag to help save Rs 20k cr per annum on fuel: Gadkari||Mandatory FASTag for highways will help save Rs 20,000 crore per annum on fuel and boost the revenue by at least Rs 10,000 crore, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday.Launching a live monitoring system to assess the live condition at toll plazas pan India and releasing a rating system for highways here, the road transport and highways minister said this was a step towards achieving perfection in terms of highway use, construction and quality.“Making FASTags mandatory for highway users for collection of electronic toll has significantly reduced delays at toll plazas. This will result in a significant saving to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore per annum on fuel cost,” Gadkari said while addressing the media.The minister said not only this, the electronic toll collection is set to boost royalty by 10,000 crore per annum.Following the mandatory payment of user fee through FASTag at toll plazas from February 16, 2021, toll collection has seen consistent growth, and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said its daily toll collection through FASTag has reached about Rs 104 crore.Gadkari said a new GPS based system for tolling is in the offing, where highways commuters will be required to pay only for the distance travelled on the basis of entry and exit points.He, however, clarified that the system will take two years to be introduced.After the introduction of e-tolling in December 2016, the toll plazas covered under it reached 794 on February 28 from 403 toll plazas in March 2018.Gadkari said through live monitoring of toll plazas, one can not only access the live situation at the particular toll plazas, including delays but will get a history of the traffic and an almost realistic forecast of the traffic situation.He said after the launch of the system, the delays have reduced significantly at toll plazas and the government endeavours to reduce delays to less than a minute in all plazas.Citing the example of how FASTag has resulted in seamless traffic, he showed how delays at a Jaipur plaza were reduced to 5 minutes from earlier 30 minutes.“There is zero waiting time at 80 per cent of the total toll plazas and toll collection through electronic tolling has reached 93 per cent from 80 per cent during the last fortnight after the FASTag was made mandatory,” Gadkari said.Highlighting the advantages of the live monitoring of toll plazas, the minister said recently in a Mumbai incident, where a vehicle was found parked outside an industrialist’s house, it could be detected that vehicle entered from which toll plaza and who was sitting there and now the police is investigating it.A vehicle with gelatin sticks, an explosive material, was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in south Mumbai recently.Gadkari said live monitoring of toll plazas will prove to be an important tool in the hands of officials from Income-Tax, GST and other related departments.He said that based on the live status at toll plazas, the government could further take steps for correction, including increasing the lanes.The Centre has provided this platform to eight states, the minister added.He also launched a rating system for highways, saying the rating has been completed for about 20,000 km of 4/6 lane NH stretches, covering 343 cells (toll plazas) till the end of October 2020 and is ready for release.As a policy, this highway rating exercise will be conducted biannually. This regular exercise will help all involved institutions to improve their services in a more objective manner and also to further improve the existing network for a better travel experience, Gadkari said.The audit of highways will be done on about 40 parameters, including quality, safety, services, facilities and other aspects.To improve green plantation cover beside highways, e-tagging of plants will be done, Gadkari added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mandatory-fastag-to-help-save-rs-20k-cr-per-annum-on-fuel-gadkari-219100

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Highways construction touches record 33 km a day: Gadkari||Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said highway building has achieved a new feat, with the construction touching record 30 km a day.The feat could be achieved after the construction of 11,035 kilometres of national highways this fiscal so far, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gadkari said while talking to reporters here.“We have built 11,035 km of highways till date this year. This comes to 32.85 km a day of highway building, which is a record,” Gadkari said.The minister also said that by March 31, it may reach 40 km a day.He said the achievement was remarkable as it could be achieved despite constraints posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.The feat, he said, comes close on the heels of a world record in construction of a stretch of the Mumbai-Delhi Expressway.The minister said that when he took over the charge of the ministry, the highway building pace was just 2 km a day, with 406 stalled projects entailing an investment of Rs 3.85 lakh crore.It was a slew of steps that saved Indian banks from Rs 3 lakh crore of non-performing assets (NPAs), he said.Gadkari said massive initiatives to resolve the deadlocks and accelerate the pace of highway building, including termination of projects worth Rs 40,000 crore, resulted in fast-tracking of the road building.“Now, the ministry is targeting 40 km a day by March-end, given the pace of execution,” he added.The government envisages building 34,800 km of highways at a cost of about Rs 5.35 lakh crore under the ambitious Bharatmala Pariyojna.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), he said, has also made a world record by laying down 12,500 cubic metres of concrete on a stretch of 2.54 km.NHAI contractor Patel Infrastructure had created a world record by laying the highest quantity of concrete on a four-lane highway in 24 hours recently.The feat by contractor Patel Infrastructure Ltd was recognised by the India Book of Records and Golden Book of World Records.It had laid a four-lane highway of 2,580 metres length within 24 hours totalling about 10.32 lane km.The highway is part of the greenfield Delhi-Vadodara-Mumbai 8-lane Expressway project and was carried out by the world’s largest fully automatic ultra-modern concrete paver machine.In total, projects of 8,948 km of roads were awarded in 2019-20, while 10,237 km of roads were constructed.The achievement assumes significance given the fact that the first two months of the current financial year were lost due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.The ministry has taken several initiatives to increase the pace of construction. The pace of construction is expected to increase further in the remaining months of the current financial year, which are conducive for construction activities. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/highways-construction-touches-record-33-km-a-day-gadkari-219087

But the preliminary information I have, there definitely was a cyber attack and it was a sabotage, he said.Raut, a Congress minister, did not share more details.His comments came in the wake of a US company’s report claiming that amidst the border tension in Ladakh last year, a Chinese government-linked group of hackers targeted India’s critical power grid system through a malware.The report raised suspicion whether the massive power outage in Mumbai was a result of the online intrusion.

It is about 44 per cent higher than the corresponding period last fiscal.As many as 1.69 crore new job cards were issued this year as compared to about 69 lakh in previous year, reflecting the succor MGNREGA provided to the migrant workers going back to their villages.This has also resulted in creation of around 72 lakh durable and useful assets. A total of 4.29 crore assets have been geo-tagged with the coordinated efforts of the Union and states governments."The total person-days generated under the MGNREGA during the current financial year included 52 per cent women person-days," Union Rural Development Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said at a programme last week."This reflects significant participation of women in the programme."Under the scheme, priority is accorded to creating individual assets and assets on water conservation/irrigation which would help the agriculture sector.With an aim to achieve transparency and accountability, the government has been taking steps to achieve 100 per cent payment of wages in the bank accounts of MGNREGA workers and accordingly emphasise on social audit of works.During the current financial year, an all-time high Rs 1,11,500 crore has been allocated to the flagship programme. A sum of about Rs 93,000 core has already been released to the states and UTs.The government's determination to arrange for additional funds for the programme in case of need has also been advertised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mgnrega-emerges-as-important-source-of-employment-during-pandemic-219078

Its tally improved marginally in the 2019 general election to 52.Goyal stated that the farm laws brought by the government are in the interest of the farmers and the country.Majority of farmers, including those from Himachal Pradesh, are in favour of new farm laws, and only some are “misguided”, he said, adding that a solution would soon be reached. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-will-get-even-fewer-seats-in-next-lok-sabha-election-if-it-continues-to-misguide-farmers-goyal-219076

We have killed corona. Farmers’ immunity level is strong because they work hard on their fields. Farmers are not afraid of coronavirus,” Rajewal told PTI.Another senior leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan (75) said the fear of contracting the disease is “not enough” to distract them from their fight.“There is no corona for farmers. I will not get vaccine shots, but we will not ask anyone to not get the shot,” said the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), which is leading the protest at Delhi’s Tikri border.However, Dharmendra Malik, the media in-charge of Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait who is leading the protest at the Ghazipur border, said if the local administration makes arrangements for protesting farmers, Tikait will not have any problem getting vaccinated.The 70-year-old Kulwant Singh Sandhu, a member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said he will not receive the vaccine shot.“We are not afraid of coronavirus. Thousands of farmers are staging sit-in protests at Delhi borders, but not a single case of coronavirus has been detected there,” Sandhu said.The second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive began on Monday in the country.In the first phase, starting January 16, over 3.6 lakh beneficiaries comprising healthcare workers and frontline workers, have been vaccinated in Delhi.On Monday, the drive began to give jabs to persons aged 60 and above, and those in 45-59 age bracket with comorbidities.

Police alleged that the event was backed by some Maoist groups.Navlakha had approached the high court last year, challenging the special NIA court’s July 12, 2020, order that rejected his plea for statutory bail.But the high court said “it sees no reason to interfere with a special court’s order which earlier rejected his bail plea”.The Pune police had arrested Navlakha in August 2018, but had not taken him into custody. He remained under house arrest and the Delhi High Court quashed his arrest and remand order in October 2018.The FIR against him was re-registered in January 2020, and Navlakha surrendered before the NIA on April 14 last year.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Whistleblower professor’s student gets PhD from IIT Kharagpur after 6 years||A six years struggle for IIT Kharagpur scholar Mahesh Shirole ended recently when he was awarded a PhD degree after repeated rejections of his doctorate thesis since January 2015, his supervisor said.Shirole and Professor Rajeev Kumar had been approaching different authorities, including the office of the President of India, against the denial of a PhD.The president is the Visitor to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur among other central institutes.“I am happy that Mahesh Shirole has got a PhD degree after six years of battle with the IIT Kharagpur and the Ministry of Education,” Kumar, who is Shirole’s supervisor and is now a professor in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) here, said.Kumar, a former professor of the computer science and engineering department at IIT Kharagpur, said that Shirole could get his hard-earned degree only due to the intervention of the Visitor and direction from the concerned education ministry.“It is better to be late than never,” he told PTI.Shirole was awarded PhD in the 66th convocation of the institute, which was held virtually on Tuesday last week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered the convocation address as the chief guest.Shirole had submitted his thesis in 2014 for the award of PhD, which was accepted by an Indian examiner, but rejected by an NRI one, Kumar said, adding that as per the laid down practice, it was never sent to the third examiner.Instead, the IIT kept on directing the student to revise the thesis and it was sent to the same NRI examiner thrice, who rejected it with new comments every time, he said.Kumar, who had been fighting for justice for his student, had claimed that the denial was the result of the institution’s “vindictive attitude” towards him.“IIT Kharagpur’s denial of PhD to the student is an extension of its vindictive attitude against me. IIT Kharagpur has been vindictive to me, as I disclosed arbitrariness and irregularities in IITs admissions in 2006 onwards, and contributed significantly in reforming IITs admissions and academic processes,” he had said in his multiple appeals to authorities.IIT Kharagpur had in May 2011 suspended Kumar on charges of misconduct. He was accused of damaging its reputation by levelling allegations of irregularities in admissions, purchase of laptops and rampant copying by students in exams.Then, the IIT imposed a penalty of his compulsory retirement in 2014, which was set-aside in 2017 by then-president Pranab Mukherjee.At that time, Kumar was appointed and joined JNU in 2015 during his legal fight over the issue.Kumar was hailed as an “unsung hero” bY the Supreme Court in 2011 for his efforts to reform the IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), which has since been re-christened as JEE-Advanced. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whistleblower-professors-student-gets-phd-from-iit-kharagpur-after-6-years-219050
01-03-2021||New Delhi||Bhima Koregaon case: SC to hear bail plea of activist Navlakha on Wednesday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Wednesday the bail plea of activist Gautam Navlakha in the alleged Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case.The activist, on February 19, had moved the top court against the Bombay High Court order of February 8 dismissing his bail plea.The high court had said that "it sees no reason to interfere with a special court's order which earlier rejected his bail plea".A three judge bench of the apex court comprising justices U U Lalit, Indira Banerjee and K M Joseph would take up the appeal of Navlakha for hearing on March 3 against the high court's order.According to police, some activists allegedly made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence at Koregaon Bhima in the district the next day.Police also alleged that the event was backed by some Maoist groups.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is conducting a probe into the case.Navlakha had approached the high court last year, challenging the special NIA court's order of July 12, 2020 that rejected his plea for statutory bail.On December 16 last year, the high court bench reserved its verdict on the plea filed by Navlakha, seeking statutory or default bail on grounds that he had been in custody for over 90 days, but the prosecution failed to file a charge sheet in the case within this period.The NIA had argued that his plea was not maintainable, and sought an extension to file the charge sheet.The special court had then accepted NIA's plea seeking extension of 90 to 180 days to file the charge sheet against Navlakha and his co-accused, activist Dr Anand Teltumbde.Navlakha's counsel had told the high court that the NIA was granted the extension to file its charge sheet.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had said Navlakha had already spent 93 days in custody, including 34 days of house arrest, and that the high court must count house arrest as a period of custody.While he was under house arrest, Navlakha's personal liberties remained curtailed, Sibal had said.However, Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, who appeared for the NIA, had argued that Navlakha's house arrest could not be included in the time spent in the custody of police or NIA, or under judicial custody.Raju argued that the Pune police arrested Navlakha in August 2018, but had not taken him into custody.He said the accused remained under house arrest, and the Delhi High Court quashed his arrest and remand order in October 2018.The FIR against him was re-registered in January 2020, and Navlakha surrendered before the NIA on April 14.He spent 11 days in the NIA's custody till April 25, and since then he in judicial custody in the Taloja jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai.Raju had argued that if the court “looked from the other angle, it would see that if he (Navlakha) was arrested on August 28, 2018, he should have been enlarged on bail.”  “He was a free man till April 2020. He was neither on bail nor in custody. There cannot be a gap in the custody and detention period,” Raju had said.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Warming will increase frequency of flash droughts in India: IIT Gandhinagar study||Climate change will increase the frequency of flash droughts in India in the future, which will hurt crop production, irrigation demands, and groundwater abstraction, says a study by researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar.According to the researchers, flash droughts occur due to the rapid depletion of soil moisture.In contrast to the conventional droughts, they said, flash droughts can impact a large region within two-three weeks, severely affecting crop health and irrigation water demands.However, the occurrence and impacts of flash droughts in the current and future climate in India are not well known.The study, published in the journal npj Climate and Atmospheric Science, examined the role of human-caused climate warming and intra-seasonal variability during the summer monsoon season on the flash drought occurrence over India.The researchers used soil moisture simulations, observations from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), and climate projections to examine the frequency of flash droughts in the country under the observed and future climate scenarios.The team noted that the worst flash drought in the observed timeframe from 1951–2016 occurred in 1979, when more than 40 per cent of the country was affected.The frequency of concurrent hot and dry extremes, the researchers explained, is projected to rise by about five-fold, causing an approximately seven-fold increase in flash droughts like 1979 by the end of the 21st century.“We find that flash droughts in India are caused by the monsoon breaks or delayed monsoon and the number of flash droughts will increase in the future,” said Vimal Mishra, Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar.“As air temperature is projected to get warmer significantly in the future due to climate change, monsoon breaks and increased air temperature can exacerbate the flash drought occurrence in India,” Mishra, the corresponding author of the study, told PTI.The researchers—including Saran Aadhar and Shanti Shwarup Mahto—both from IIT Gandhinagar, noted that India is projected to witness extreme climatic conditions in the future.Extreme hot and dry conditions that lead to flash droughts can occur more frequently under climate change.Mishra explained that flash droughts can be devastating for agriculture in the absence of irrigation, adding, however, their prediction ahead of time can assist in minimising losses and managing water resources.“Climate warming is directly linked with the occurrence of heatwaves, droughts, extreme precipitation and floods, which have implications for society,” Mishra added. –PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/warming-will-increase-frequency-of-flash-droughts-in-india-iit-gandhinagar-study-219036

He also talked about the need to encourage agri startups, saying they had performed well during the pandemic period.The Prime Minister also emphasised on establishing network for soil testing at village level and also on accessibility of technology for farmers.

Don't I have the right to protest? Why can’t I go and meet the district collector and the SP,” Naidu angrily questioned the police officials and sat on the airport lounge floor.On the other hand, the Tirupati and Chittoor police placed important TDP leaders of the district under house arrest ahead of Naidu's visit.TDP politburo member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu strongly condemned the police act and said it further exposed the draconian rule of YS Jagan Mohan Reddy."Detention of the Opposition leader is nothing but trampling the civil liberties. Is there a rule of law in AP?" Ramakrishnudu angrily questioned in a statement.

He accused him of opening the borders to illegal immigration, but reiterated his call for a merit-based immigration system."Trumpism means strong borders, but people coming into our country based on a system of merit. So they come in and they can help us, as opposed to coming here, and not be good for us, including criminals, of which there are many."He said that an immigration crisis was brewing at the southern border with Mexico and the countries in Central America sending "caravans" of illegal immigrants were not "not giving us their best and their finest".He criticised Biden's policies to allow "chain migration" of members of extended families and increase the number of legal refugees allowed in.He said that Biden's orders to restrict deportations were letting criminals go free.The former President also took aim at outsourcing."We believe in standing up to China, shutting down outsourcing, bringing back our factories and supply chains and ensuring that America not China dominates the future of the world," he added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trump-repeats-environment-criticism-of-india-in-1st-speech-after-white-house-departure-219004

NASA’s Kate Rubins and Victor Glover emerged from the orbiting lab lugging 8-foot (2.5-m) duffle-style bags stuffed with hundreds of pounds of mounting brackets and struts. The astronauts headed with their unusually large load to the far port side of the station, careful not to bump into anything. That’s where the station’s oldest and most degraded solar wings are located.

The 23-year-old activist, who believes borders are a thing of the past as people need peace and not division, says her dream is to see India and Pakistan as friends.“It is my dream to see India and Pakistan become true friends and we could all visit each other’s countries. You can continue watching Pakistani dramas and we can continue to watch Bollywood movies and enjoy cricket matches,” she said.As she spoke about her book, I am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, she expressed concern on the news of internet shutdown and arrest of activists doing peaceful protests. According to Malala, “You are Indian and I am Pakistani and we are completely fine, then why is this hatred created between us? This philosophy of borders is old. The divide and conquer idea doesn’t work anymore... we as humans want to live in peace.”In another session, director and writer Devashish Makhija launched his launched latest book Oonga that is based on his film of the same name. Talking to Kaveree Bamzai, he calls it ‘the journey of a little boy in the midst of a clash among adivasis, Naxalites, the CRPF and a mining company’.“It is a tragic tale of all those who are the victims of violence that battles forces upon them. They fight for their identity and the fights they do not want to be involved in.”The programme offered a kaleidoscopic view into themes of technology, politics, history, environment, economics, poetry, music, food, literature and so much more.In one of the sessions on the perils of climate changes, Bill Gates spoke about the mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 51 million tons to zero by 2050 and his book The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. The business magnate and philanthropist thinks political parties need to prioritise the issue of climate change. He said “We want climate to be a bi-partisan issue because we’ve got to cap 30 years of progress, not just four years.” And when asked how can young people contribute, his response was, “I am not an expert of advocacy.”— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nobel-laureate-malala-yousafzai-talks-about-indo-pak-relations-on-the-concluding-day-of-jaipur-literature-festival-218956

The “on leave” retort was meant to taunt Gandhi for his frequent foreign holidays.“The party whose leader has been in the Lok Sabha for four terms does not know a fisheries department started two years ago.

Collaborations have intensified post pandemic. Many countries have come together to work on a positive agenda like providing vaccines,” the Foreign Secretary added, pointing out that India had received messages from Africa, the Gulf, the Bahamas and its own neighborhood on their gratitude for the vaccines. “This reveals India’s unrivalled position in global and health supply chains,” he pointed out.On the new Biden administration, Shringla said India had an element of continuity with successive incumbents in the White House. “There is a range of areas to collaborate with the Biden administration introducing new elements like climate change and technology,” he said.Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan, at an earlier session, said India had done well in FTAs. “If there are no negotiations, there are no gains,” he stressed. Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, speaking on the first day of the AED, seemed to have expressed the opposite view when he said India had got the rough end of the FTAs signed by previous governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shringla-foresees-greater-eu-engagement-on-indo-pacific-218837

I am also from a village. Many tall leaders are proud of their humble beginnings like our Prime Minister who also says he is from a village and has washed utensils and sold tea. We have political differences with the Prime Minister but at least he does not hide his true self.”Azad while praising the PM for being rooted said people who hide their realities were living in a make believe world.“The moment you hide your reality, you are living in a bubble. A person should be proud of his roots. I have travelled the world, lived in five stars but when I sit with villagers, I sense an earthy fragrance which is refreshing,” said the former Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha without naming anyone.The pro-Modi remarks came a day after Congress rebels Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal, BS Hooda, Manish Tewari, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha, publicly called the party weak and pledged to strengthen it.Praising the PM in one breath, Azad also flagged lack of finances for the development of Jammu and Kashmir and said there was an urgent need to fix the economy of the UT after the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two UTs.“Development works in J&K must be enhanced. Central funding must be raised by three to four times. The development work claimed to have been done is not visible in J&K and the industry is closed. Revival is urgent,” said Azad who had received a tearful farewell from PM Modi in mid-February.While it remains to be seen if the rebellion by some senior Congress leaders would lead to a formal split in the party, it’s instantly clear that dissenters are attempting a new idiom to articulate their opposition of the BJP — one that is not rabidly anti-Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/appreciate-pm-for-being-rooted-dissenter-ghulam-nabi-azad-218838

The contribution will soar to 123 per 10,000 new jobs created by 2022.These projections by the World Economic Forum are based on extrapolated figures from data for 20 economies including India and the US.Sharing the data on new emerging professional clusters during her keynote address on the National Science Day event hosted by the government today, IBM Research India Director Gargi Banerjee Dasgupta said new opportunities lay in seven clusters the WEF has identified through rigorous scientific assessment of movement of economies.These seven clusters – data and artificial intelligence, engineering and cloud computing, product development, people (human resources), sales and marketing, care economy and green economy — will together create 2.4 million opportunities (per 10,000 opportunities in the labour market) by 2022.“Data and AI are the fastest growing clusters at 41 per cent, followed by green economy at 35 per cent and cloud computing at 34 per cent,” Dasgupta said, calling for learning patterns to be realigned to meet the needs of changing times.A distinguished engineer and chief technology officer, IBM South Asia, Dasgupta, (the first woman to head IBM Research India) spoke on “Future of jobs and urgency of science” today and said five skill sets would be needed for people to land future jobs.These skill sets are — business (how to start a new enterprise and budget it), industry skills (sales, radiation oncology, care economy skills), general and soft skills, tech baseline skills (computer technology, working with Microsoft products, social media and telecommunications) and tech disruptive skills (AI, natural language processing, automation, robotics and cyber security skills).“Tech baseline skills will be the most widespread. So computer literacy must expand as much as possible. We need to translate all these skills into our education system,” she said in the presence of Science and Technology Secretary Ashutosh Sharma and CSIR Director Shekhar Mande.National Science Day is celebrated annually on February 28 to mark the discovery of Raman Effect by physicist CV Raman, who won the Physics Nobel for the feat in 1930.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/data-ai-fastest-growing-job-clusters-in-world-218856

Textiles, handicraft goods, electronic appliances, mobiles…in every field we have to increase our presence. When we move forward with this thought, only then will we become self-reliant in the truest sense,” he said.Modi expressed happiness that the mantra of self-reliant India was reaching villages.

They should do it again by ensuring the defeat of the BJP and TMC in Bengal, he added.Siddiqui’s speech raises eyebrowsKolkata, February 28The impressive rally by Sanyukta Morcha also ironically exposed the cracks in the alliance when ISF leader Abbas Siddiqui singled out Left Front candidates for backing by his supporters in the Assembly polls in Bengal.The cleric made no such appeal to his supporters about candidates of the Congress.Addressing the crowd, Siddiqui said, “You may be curious to know why I did not ask you to vote for Congress. This is because I want our rightful share. I am not asking for charity from anyone.”Quoting BR Ambedkar, Abbasi said one must assert one’s right and not “beg” for it.

We are fighting an enemy that is dominating the money in this country. We are fighting an enemy that is crushing its opponents. But we have done this before. We have defeated a much bigger enemy (British) than this new enemy that has come.”Recalling the country’s independence movement, he said the British were much more powerful than Modi would ever be.“Who is Narendra Modi in comparison to the British empire? Nobody. People of this country sent the British empire back and in the same way we will send Narendra Modi back to Nagpur (RSS headquarters in Maharashtra),” he said.Apparently, he meant that Modi would go into political oblivion after defeat by the Congress with people’s support.Gandhi said this would be achieved without any hatred, anger or violence towards PM Modi or his party even if they may ‘abuse’ or unleash ‘violence’ against them.The Congress is an ally of the DMK in Tamil Nadu and BJP is a partner of the ruling AIADMK.The Congress leader, replying to another participant, alleged the BJP-led Centre claimed to “represent Hinduism” in several ideas they espoused, but in reality it had nothing to do with that faith.Hindusim does not preach insulting, killing or beating up people, Gandhi asserted, alleging “but they do it.”    The essence of all religions was love but the Central government’s ‘whole game’ is to ‘steal’ money of ordinary people, including farmers through initiatives like farm laws, and give it away to the biggest businesses in the country, he alleged.To another question, he said he did not like the Centre’s New Education Policy, 2020 either.When a professor alleged the NEP was agenda driven, Gandhi said any policy on education should be an outcome of deliberations with learners and teachers.“Unfortunately this was not done,” he claimed adding it concentrated too much power in the hands of the Centre and it was set to damage the education system.Though NEP had a positive aspect of flexibility, it was however, a “weapon to communalise, to push a particular ideology into the Indian system and that is why I do not like it.”He batted for more scholarship so that more and more poor students got education and underscored women empowerment.To a demand on bringing back education to the state list of the Constitution from the concurrent category, he said, “I don’t know we will look into it.”Centralising everything was a bad idea and decentralisation and facilitating access to education from all corners of the country were fundamental, he said.In 1976, the then Congress government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi shifted education, which was previously a state subject, to the concurrent list allowing Centre to legislate on the matter besides the states.

01-03-2021||Karachi||Pakistan arrests 17 Indian fishermen||Pakistan has arrested 17 Indian fishermen and confiscated their three boats for allegedly straying into the country’s territorial waters.The fishermen, arrested on Friday, were produced before a judicial magistrate on Saturday and handed over to the police, said a spokesperson for the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency.The official said the Indian fishermen were warned that they were in Pakistan’s territorial waters and should turn away but did not heed the warning.Fast response boats were used to arrest the 17 fishermen who were 10-15 nautical miles inside Pakistan’s territorial waters near Sir Creek, the coastal border between Pakistan and India, the spokesperson said.The Indian fishermen are sent either to Malir or Landhi jail in Karachi.The arrest comes after a gap of one year when 23 Indian fishermen were arrested and four of their fishing boats seized by the Maritime Security Agency.Pakistan and India frequently arrest fishermen as there is no clear demarcation of the maritime border in the Arabian Sea and the fishermen do not have boats equipped with the technology to know their precise location.Owing to the lengthy and slow bureaucratic and legal procedures, the fishermen usually remain in jail for several months and sometimes even for years.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-arrests-17-indian-fishermen-218653

01-03-2021||Sriharikota (AP)||ISRO launches Brazil’s Amazonia-1, 18 other satellites; SD-SAT carries e-Gita, PM Modi’s photo||India’s Polar rocket on Sunday successfully launched Amazonia-1 of Brazil and 18 other satellites from the spaceport here, in the first mission of the year for space agency ISRO.The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle PSLV-C51 lifted off at around 10.24 am from the first launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) and first injected into orbit primary payload Amazonia-1 about 17 minutes later.After a gap of over one-and-half hours, the co-passenger satellites, including one from Chennai- based Space Kidz India (SKI), which is engraved with a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were launched subsequently one after another in the space of ten minutes in a textbook launch.SKI’s Satish Dhawan Satellite (SD-SAT) also carried Bhagavad Gita in a Secured Digital card format.According to SKI, the picture of Modi has been engraved on the top panel of the spacecraft to show solidarity and gratitude for his Atmanirbhar initiative and space sector privatisation.A beaming Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K Sivan announced the mission was successful and all 19 satellites were launched in precise orbits.“Today is a very great day for the entire ISRO team and the PSLV-C51 is a special mission for India. Let me congratulate and compliment the team ISRO for achieving the precise injection of AMAZONIA-1 and 18 other satellites,” he said.PSLV-C51 is the first dedicated commercial mission of NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), ISRO’s commercial arm, and the launch was watched among others by Brazilian government officials at the mission control centre here, over 100 kms from Chennai.The 18 co-passenger satellites placed in the orbit are—four from ISRO’s Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (three UNITY Sats from consortium of three Indian academic institutes and the SD-SAT from SKI) and 14 from NSIL.The 637-kg Amazonia-1 which became the first Brazilian satellite to be launched from India is an optical earth observation satellite of National Institute for Space Research (INPE).It is intended for providing remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory.Earlier, at the end of the 25.5 hour countdown, the four-stage 44.4 metre tall PSLV, a workhorse launch vehicle of ISRO in its 53rd mission, soared into clear sky and every stage performed as programmed, ISRO said.PM hails 1st dedicated commercial launchNew Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday congratulated ISRO on the success of the first dedicated commercial launch of PSLV-C51/Amazonia-1 Mission, saying it ushers in a new era of space reforms in the country.The Prime Minister also congratulated Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on the successful launch of Brazil’s Amazonia-1 satellite by PSLV-C51, and said this is a historic moment in space cooperation between the two countries.“Congratulations to NSIL (NewSpace India Limited) and @isro on the success of the 1st dedicated commercial launch of PSLV-C51/Amazonia-1 Mission. This ushers in a new era of space reforms in the country,” Modi tweeted.           He said 18 co-passengers included four small satellites that showcase dynamism and innovation of our youth.“Congratulations President @jairbolsonaro on the successful launch of Brazil’s Amazonia-1 satellite by  PSLV-C51. This is a historic moment in our space cooperation and my felicitations to the scientists of Brazil,” the Prime Minister said.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Mann ki Baat: Aatmanirbhar Bharat is national spirit, says PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday underlined that Atmanirbhar Bharat is not just a government policy but also a national spirit, and said the mantra of self-reliant India is reaching villages of the country.In his monthly Mann Ki Baat radio programme, Modi also called for a 100-day campaign to clean up all water bodies and prepare them for rain water harvesting before monsoon starts.Stressing the importance of collective responsibility towards water conservation, he said the Union Jal Shakti Ministry will soon initiate a “Catch the rain” campaign with its main theme being “catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls”.Conveying greetings on the National Science Day, Modi pointed out that this day is dedicated to the discovery of ‘Raman Effect’ by the great scientist of India, Dr C V Raman.Asserting that there is a lot of contribution of the power of science in the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign, Modi said there is a need to make science more popular and that science cannot be limited to physics-chemistry and labs. He called for expanding science with a mantra of ‘lab to land’.Modi said water has been crucial for the development of humankind for centuries and people should understand their collective responsibility towards its conservation.He said that in most parts of India, rainfall begins in May-June and asked “can we right away start a 100-day campaign for the sake of cleaning up water sources around us and conserving rainwater”.With this very thought in mind, in a few days from now, ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan Catch the rain’ is being initiated by the Jal Shakti Ministry, he said.“We shall commit ourselves to the task right now…we shall get existing rainwater harvesting systems repaired, clean up lakes and ponds in villages, remove impediments in the way of water flowing into water sources; thus we shall be able to conserve rainwater to the maximum,” he said.Modi highlighted an assertion made by a person who had written to him from Kolkata that the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign is not just a government policy but also a national spirit, and said this was hundred per cent correct.When every person in the country takes pride in indigenous products and connects with the idea of self-reliance, Atmanirbhar Bharat doesn’t just remain an economic campaign but becomes a national spirit, he asserted.“When we see fighter plane Tejas made in our own country doing acrobatics in the sky, when Made in India tanks, Made in India missiles increase our pride, when we see Made in India coaches in Metro trains in wealthy-advanced nations, when we see Made in India Corona vaccines reaching dozens of countries, then our heads are held high,” Modi said.Noting that is not that only bigger things will make India self-reliant, he said, be it textiles Made in India, handicraft goods made by talented artisans of the country, electronic appliances, mobiles, in every field “we have to raise this pride”.“When we move forward with this thought, only then will we become self-reliant in the truest sense,” the prime minister said.Modi expressed happiness that the mantra of self-reliant India is reaching the villages.He cited several examples of people using innovative techniques to emerge as shining examples of Atmanirbhar Bharat, from a person in Bihar’s Bettiah starting a LED bulb factory to another person in Uttar Pradesh’s Garhmukteshwar reviving his family craft of making mats.During the broadcast, he rued not being able to make enough efforts to learn the world’s oldest language, Tamil.“In the run up to Mann Ki Baat, I was asked if there was something I missed out on during these long years as chief minister and prime minister. I feel—it is a regret of sorts that I could not make enough efforts to learn the world’s oldest language Tamil. Tamil literature is beautiful,” Modi said.Sharing a guide’s voice at the Statue of Unity, informing people in Sanskrit about the tallest statue of Sardar Patel in the world and also cricket commentary in Sanskrit, Modi highlighted that India is home to many languages.He also batted for sports commentary in different languages and asked why not have good commentaries of different sports and especially Indian sports in more languages.“We must think about encouraging it. I would urge the Sports Ministry and private institutional partners to think about it,” he said.Noting that the coming few months are of special importance for students with Boards and other exams approaching, Modi said, “Do all of you remember – You have to become a warrior not a worrier, go gleefully for the examination and come back with a smile. You have to compete with yourself, not with anyone else.”    “Get adequate sleep and be mindful of time management. Do not stop playing, for those who play are the ones that blossom. Revision and smart methods of memorization are to be adopted, that is, overall, in these exams, you have to bring out your best,” he said.He also urged all “exam warriors”, parents and teachers to participate in his upcoming ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ event in March.In his address, the prime minister also highlighted the positive work being done in the Kaziranga National Park in Assam.The Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve Authority has been carrying out its Annual Waterfowls Census and it reveals the population of water birds and also about their favourite habitat, Modi said.“Just two-three weeks ago, the survey was conducted again. You will also be delighted to know that this time the number of water birds has increased by about 175 percent compared to last year. A total of 112 species of birds have been sighted in Kaziranga National Park during this Census,” he said.Of these, 58 species happen to be winter migrants from different parts of the world including Europe, Central Asia and East Asia, he said.Modi pointed out that the most important reason for this is that here, there is better water conservation along with very little human interference.He also highlighted how temples in Assam are also playing a unique role in the protection of nature.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-aatmanirbhar-bharat-is-national-spirit-says-pm-modi-218617
