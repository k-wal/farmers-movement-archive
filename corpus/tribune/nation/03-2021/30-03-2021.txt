30-03-2021||New Delhi||61 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in India, 64 million given to 84 nations: Vardhan||In India, 61 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have already been administered, while 64 million doses have been given to 84 nations under various programmes, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday.Virtually participating in a panel discussion on vaccine production and distribution across Asia at the ‘World Immunisation and Logistics Summit’, he detailed how the infrastructure of India’s universal immunisation programme provided a pivot for its COVID-19 vaccine drive.The virtual conference brought together over 1,000 attendees from around the region and the world to discuss key issues of global supply chains as the world faces the largest and most complex logistical operation in history in an effort to deliver life-saving vaccines worldwide, the Health Ministry said in a statement.It said the panel was informed how India is scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines and how the government was working with local and international partners to ensure timely distribution of the same.Reminding everyone that India produces 60 per cent of the world’s vaccine, Vardhan said, “More than 61 million vaccine doses have already been administered in our country and 64 million doses have been given to 84 countries under various programmes. We always feel that benefits of science be delivered to the whole world.”           At the summit, he showcased India’s vaccine drive, the development of two vaccines—Covishield and Covaxin—as well as the priority pyramid of beneficiaries.The Union health minister said that half a dozen vaccines are under clinical trial and around one dozen are in pre-clinical trial which are being monitored by an expert group for vaccine NEGVAC, Vardhan said. Applauding initiatives for collaboration, including the HOPE consortium, as a welcome step, he observed, “It is going to help in shaping the future policy for equitable distribution of the vaccine.”              This will strengthen the efforts of WHO in their commitment to ensuring that there is a common platform invalidation, all manufacturing companies of the world are on the same page and all stakeholders are committed to equitable distribution of vaccine, the minister said.         “We have learnt from each other’s experiences and from various guidelines. There is a great need for this exercise to be scaled up. We need to introspect and review till the time everyone on this platform gets vaccinated.”      Recollecting the biggest challenges faced by him in terms of rolling out the vaccination programme, Vardhan said India itself with a huge population of 1.35 billion and huge diversity is a big challenge.             “We took this challenge head-on under the leadership of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On January 17 last year, we had issued an advisory regarding COVID long before it snowballed into the crisis it is today. “We also developed capacities for testing, ventilators, tracking, surveillance, quarantine centre and emphasized that COVID appropriate behaviour is the most potent vaccine against COVID,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.

30-03-2021||New Delhi||No charging of electronic devices on board trains at night: Railways as precaution against fire||The Railways has decided to disallowed passengers from using mobile charging stations onboard trains between 11 pm and 5 am as a precautionary measure against the spread of fire, senior officials said Tuesday.The Western Railway has already put things in motion on March 16 by cutting off supply to these charging ports between this period.“It is a Railway Board instruction for all railways. We have started implementing it from March 16,” CPRO of Western Railway, Sumit Thakur, told PTI.Southern Railway CPRO B Guganesan told PTI that these instructions are not new, but a reiteration of earlier orders of the Railway Board.In 2014, the Commissioner of Railway Safety had recommended that charging stations be switched off between 11 pm and 5 am, soon after a fire incident in the Bangalore-Hazur Sahib Nanded Express. The Railway Board had eventually issued such orders to all rail zones.“In view of the recent incidents of fire, we have done the needful. It is a precautionary measure and even earlier the Railway Board had issued such orders. The power from the main switchboard for these points will be switched off from 11 pm to 5 am,” Guganesan said.This comes after recent incidents of fire reported in some trains. According to railway officials, the decision to restrict the use of the charging ports was taken as a precautionary measure.In a report on the fires, officials suggested that the points used for charging mobile phones and other electronic devices should be switched off at night.Many incidents of minor fires, reported onboard long-distance trains, were caused due to overcharging of electronic devices, officials said.Recently a coach of the Dehradun-bound Shatabdi Express caught fire in a suspected case of a short circuit on March 13. Barely six days later, a fire broke out in the engine of a static goods train at the Ranchi station.The Railways has also announced a slew of initiatives against smoking and carrying inflammable items, which were apparently also the cause behind some of the recent fires onboard trains.The national transporter has instructed zonal railways to initiate an intensive awareness drive of seven days to educate all the stakeholders, including railway users and employees, about precautions to be taken against fire incidents.

30-03-2021||New Delhi||Contempt plea against Justice Katju: Attorney General Venugopal recuses himself||Attorney General KK Venugopal has recused himself from dealing with an application for grant of sanction to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against former Supreme Court judge Justice Markandey Katju for his alleged remarks against the top court in his deposition before a UK court in Nirav Modi extradition case.“I have to point out that I have known Justice Katju for the last about 16 years and we have been interacting with each other ever since. In this background it is not appropriate that I deal with the matter,” Venugopal wrote to advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava who wanted the AG’s consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against the former SC judge.Citing Section 15(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Venugopal said it empowered either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General to grant consent for initiating criminal contempt proceedings, if deemed fit.Srivastava had on March 1 sought his consent for initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Justice Katju, citing the UK court’s verdict of February 25 while rejecting the plea of fugitive economic offender Nirav Modi against his extradition to India.The UK court has recorded the alleged “contemptuous” remarks made by Justice Katju by way of evidence in favour of Nirav Modi, Srivastava pointed out.Nirav Modi is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank scam case.On February 25, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London accepted the contention of the Indian government to extradite Nirav Modi saying that the evidence against him “is prima facie sufficient to order his extradition to India to face the charges”.It rejected Nirav Modi’s submissions regarding human rights violations, fair trial and prison conditions and decided to send his case to the Secretary of the State, UK for a final decision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-plea-against-justice-katju-attorney-general-venugopal-recuses-himself-232229

30-03-2021||New Delhi||ED attaches Unitech’s Gurugram properties worth over Rs 150-crore under PMLA||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday said it has issued a provision attachment order under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to seize properties worth over Rs 150 crore of real estate firm Unitech Group.According to officials in the ED, the assets include 12 pieces of land measuring a total of 48.56 acres in Gurugram near Delhi.“The registered value of these land pieces comes to Rs 152.48 crore and these are owned by promoters of Unitech Group through proxy or benami entities like Crown Infra Projects Pvt Ltd, Kore Communities India Pvt Ltd and Joshu Gurgaon SEZ Pvt Ltd,” an ED official said.According to the official, the agency has alleged that these three companies are part of one Trikar Group/Kore Group, which is a benami investment of the Chandra family of Unitech Group.The present criminal case against Unitech Group and its promoters—filed under PMLA—is related to allegations that Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra had illegally diverted more than Rs 2,000 crore to Cyprus and Cayman Island, the officials said.This ED had filed a case after studying multiple FIRs filed by the Delhi Police economic offences wing (EOW) against the promoters and the company. One of the cases pertains to the accused allegedly failing to complete a housing project within stipulated time in Gurugram.The agency had recently raided 35 premises in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai as part of its probe into the case. The officials claimed the ED in its investigation found that for “purchasing these properties, funds moved through Singapore-based companies like Joshu Pte Ltd, Trikar Residential Developers Pte Ltd and Trikar Property Opportunities Pte Ltd during 2015-2020.“The source of funds in these companies was from a Cayman Island-based entity namely Trikar Fund Limited (SPC) which is being controlled by the Chandra family through another Cayman-based entity Trikar Asset Management Ltd SPC,” another official said.The ED claimed that after analysis of seized records followed by the admissions of various persons, the “benami structure” (of companies) has been unravelled.“It is highly likely that this benami investment is the part of the fund diverted to Cayman Island and Cyprus,” the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-unitechs-gurugram-properties-worth-over-rs-150-crore-under-pmla-232217
30-03-2021||New Delhi||Covishield, Covaxin effective against UK, Brazilian variants; work against South African strain on: Govt||Both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines are effective against the UK and the Brazilian variants of coronavirus, while the work against the South African strain was on at several laboratories, the Centre said on Tuesday.Addressing a weekly press conference of the Union Health Ministry, ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargava also said of 11,064 genome samples sequenced in the country, the UK variant of the virus was detected in 807, the South African variant in 47 and the Brazilian variant was found in one.“Both the vaccines—Covishield and Covaxin—are effective against the UK and the Brazilian variants and the work against the South African variant is ongoing at several laboratories,” he said.Bhargava further said mutations are sporadic and single mutations are not found to be dominant in any particular area in India.“In terms of significance of the point of double mutations they are not significant as far as India is concerned and their relationship with increased severity or increased transmissibility has not been established in Indian context,” he said.Responding to another question, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said there is no Indian strain of coronavirus.Noting that there are two concepts—concept of virus shift and virus drift, Bhushan said all viruses drift as the virus replicates itself but the changes that occur due to this process are not important and it does not call for any rapid change in the public response strategy.He also said it was “natural and inevitable phenomenon” that a virus that has been around for more than a year, travelled through more than one crore people, will obviously undergo change. This is not a cause to panic, he added.“However, when a virus shifts it undergoes significant changes and there is a need to test whether my existing vaccines work against the virus, known as variant or mutant virus,” he explained.Last week, the Union Health Ministry said the new “double mutant” variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three “variants of concern”—first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil—that have been found in at least 18 states and union territories.

These Australian lawyers and activists also want sovereign wealth funds and pension funds to stop investing in the Adani group on ethical grounds.But an Adani Ports spokesperson said the Yangon International Terminal project was an independent container terminal with no joint venture partners. Adani Ports was watching the situation in Myanmar “carefully and will engage with the relevant authorities and stakeholders to seek their advice on the way forward,’’ said the spokesperson.Last month, the Adani Group had denied it had engaged with Myanmar’s generals over the approval of its port. A UN fact-finding mission in 2019 had warned foreign companies against doing business with MEC and specifically named Adani Ports as one of them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-may-face-heat-of-us-sanctions-on-myanmar-232194

30-03-2021||New Delhi||Modi's visit to Bangladesh violated poll code: TMC to EC||The TMC has written to the Election Commission alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Bangladesh violated the model code of conduct in place for the West Bengal Assembly polls and some of his programmes there "intended to influence the voting pattern" in certain constituencies of the state.The letter dated March 28 was released by the Trinamool Congress on Tuesday.Modi visited Bangladesh from March 26 to 27 to attend the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the country's independence and the birth centenary of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman following an invitation from his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina. The subject line of the letter written by TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek O'Brien read: "Gross violation of democratic ethics and the Model Code of Conduct by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during his visit to Bangladesh." "We have no objection whatsoever to his visit to Bangladesh for this official purpose. After all, India played a critical role in the liberation of Bangladesh. West Bengal, in particular, made an immense contribution to the heroic struggle of our fellow Bengalis in (what was then) East Pakistan for freedom from the brutal regime in West Pakistan."However, the All India Trinamool Congress strongly objects to Shri Modi's programmes in Bangladesh on March 27. These had nothing to do with either the 50th anniversary of the independence of Bangladesh or the birth centenary of 'Bangabandhu'. Rather, they were solely and exclusively intended to influence the voting pattern in certain constituencies in the ongoing elections to the Legislative Assembly of West Bengal," O'Brien said in the letter."No Indian Prime Minister has so brazenly indulged in an unethical and undemocratic act and violated the Model Code of Conduct by indirectly campaigning for his party from foreign soil," he said.The TMC leader further alleged that the political motive behind Modi's visit is proven by the fact that he took along with him BJP MP from West Bengal Santanu Thakur, who holds no official position in the government of India."No MP or representative from the Trinamool Congress or other parties was invited to accompany the PM. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has thus grossly misused his official position to interfere from foreign soil in the election process in West Bengal," O'Brien said."The All India Trinamool Congress demands that the Election Commission of India not only censure him but also take deterrent punitive action against him so that he dares not repeat such misconduct in future," he said.

Also, she has plans to field her followers from 'Janata Sena', a local political outfit founded by Randhir Singh Bhinder, who is considered a staunch Raje supporter.A BJP source said: "As a state organisation, we have convinced more than 50 per cent of followers to terminate their plans to contest as independents and have been successful so far. It's just two or three candidates who are acting tough and shall be convinced."Without seeking any help from Raje's supporters we are confident of winning all three seats. We have finished our door-to-door survey in each of these places. Our ground survey confirms our victory and hence we stand confident of winning these elections."On Tuesday, BJP candidates were filing nomination papers for the Rajsamand seat, but Raje was nowhere to be seen.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vasundhara-raje-missing-from-bjp-star-campaigners-list-232171
30-03-2021||Palakkad (Kerala)||LDF govt 'betrayed' people of Kerala just as Judas did to Lord Jesus: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday targetted Kerala's ruling LDF over the gold smuggling scam, saying the CPI(M)-led government "betrayed" the people of the state just as Judas did to Lord Jesus for a few pieces of silver.He also slammed the LDF government over the manner in which it dealt with the agitation against the decision to implement a Supreme Court verdict allowing entry of women in all age groups into Sabarimala temple, saying the Left dispensation should be ashamed of showering lathis on innocent devotees."About LDF it can be said: Judas betrayed Lord Christ for a few pieces of silver. LDF has betrayed Kerala for a few pieces of gold", the PM said while attacking the Left government over the sensational gold smuggling case.Addressing his first election rally in Palakkad where 'Metro Man' E Sreedharan is contesting as the BJP candidate, Modi also criticised the UDF over corruption, saying during its rule, the Congress-led government did not even spare rays of the sun, a reference to the solar panel scam.The veteran BJP leader claimed that the politics of the southern state was seeing a major shift driven by aspirations of the youth who have questioned the "match-fixing" politics of the LDF and the opposition UDF."Over the last few years, the politics of Kerala is seeing a major shift. This shift is being driven by the aspirations of the youth, especially the first time voter in the state.For many years, the worst kept secret of Kerala politics was the friendly agreement of UDF and LDF. Now, the first time voters of Kerala are asking- what is this match-fixing?", Modi said.Training guns on the LDF and the UDF over the Sabarimala temple issue, Modi said, "LDF government should be ashamed of showering Lathis on innocent devotees.UDF should be ashamed of remaining silent when this was happening.I am proud to belong to a party that has, is and will always defend the culture of our land.""I want to tell the LDF and UDF: If you abuse our culture, we will not be mute spectators," he said, referring to the agitation led by the party's state unit chief K Surendran to protect faith in the state."Our state unit President Surendran Ji was arrested and ill-treated by the Kerala government.What was his crime? That he spoke for Kerala's traditions?" Modi asked.Taking on the Left parties on political violence in the state, Modi said they have been in power many times in Kerala but their leaders still behave like junior level goons or party leaders."Under their eyes and with their blessings, political rivals are killed, hacked, beaten," Modi said.He promised that if voted to power, the BJP government will stop the culture of violence in the southern state."In a democracy, we can have political differences. But, violence is not acceptable. So many of our young BJP Karyakartas have lost their lives.A BJP government in Kerala will stop this culture of violence", Modi said.

30-03-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan’s Textile Ministry asks govt to lift ban on import of cotton from India||Pakistan's textile ministry headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan has recommended the lifting of the ban on the import of cotton from India to bridge the raw material shortfall the country's textile sector was facing, according to a media report on Tuesday.The Ministry of Textile Industry has sought permission from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet to lift the ban on import of cotton and cotton yarn from India, the Dawn News reported, quoting official sources.“We already submitted the summary to the ECC more than a week ago to lift the ban,” an official said, adding that the decision of the coordination committee would then be placed before the federal Cabinet for formal approval.Prime Minister Khan, as in-charge of the Commerce and Textile Ministry, had already approved the summary to be placed before the ECC, the report said.The low yield of cotton bales in Pakistan has created problems, paving the way for import from India.The government's decision to consider lifting the ban from India came as a big relief for the value-added textile sector, which seeks access to cheap raw materials.Currently, cotton and yarn imports are allowed from all countries except India.Pakistan suspended trade ties with India after New Delhi revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcating it into Union territories in August 2019.In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on import of medicines and raw material from India to ensure there is no shortage of essential drugs amid the COVID-19 pandemic.This was the first step of reversing the complete suspension of trade with India.Commerce Adviser Razak Dawood tweeted, “A meeting was held with the Prime Minister @ImranKhanPTI escalating prices of cotton yarn were discussed. He was sympathetic towards the value-added sectors & advised that in order to ease the pressure on yarn and keep momentum of value added exports.”“All steps be taken through cross-border imports of cotton yarn including by land. A summary will be presented at the next ECC to ensure availability of cotton and yarn in the coming months,” the commerce adviser said in another tweet.The textile sector has hailed the government's move.Pakistan Textile Exporters Association Chairman Khurram Mukhtar in a tweet said that import of raw cotton, yarn and grey fabric from India would bridge the gap in demand and supply. It would enable Pakistani exporters to continue growth momentum, he said.

30-03-2021||Mumbai||Aurangabad man claims number plate recovered by NIA belongs to his vehicle||A resident of Aurangabad in Maharashtra has claimed one of the number plates recovered by the NIA from the Mithi river in Mumbai belonged to his van which was stolen last year, a police official said on Tuesday.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is probing the cases of the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV found outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month and the subsequent murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, the purported owner of that vehicle.The probe agency on Sunday took suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Waze to the Mithi river here and recovered two digital video recorders (DVRs), two CPUs, a laptop, two hard disks, two number plates and a printer with the help of divers.Vijay Nade, an Aurangabad resident who works as a clerk with the social justice department in Jalna, approached the City Chowk police station in Aurangabad on Monday after he started getting calls from journalists about the number plate of his vehicle, the police official said.One of the number plates, which was dumped into the river, belonged to Nade's vehicle, he said.His vehicle was stolen from Aurangabad in November last year and he had lodged a case of theft at the City Chowk police station there, the official said."There is an FIR of vehicle theft on November 17 last year. So far, there is no communication from the probe Agency (NIA), but we will provide all assistance to them in the case," Aurangabad City Chowk police station's senior inspector Sambhaji Powar said.Nade told PTI on Tuesday he had lodged a complaint of van theft and has CCTV footage of that incident."I had submitted all the documents and related evidence to police, but they were not able to trace the vehicle. Suddenly, on Monday, I got information from journalists about the number plate of my vehicle recovered from the Mithi river," he said.It is suspected that Assistant Police Inspector Riyazuddin Kaazi had told the NIA during his interrogation that these pieces of evidence were thrown into the Mithi river.Kaazi, who is close to Waze, was questioned by the NIA multiple times in recent past.It was Kaazi who allegedly took away the DVR from Waze's housing society on the latter's instructions.The body of Hiran, a resident of Thane, was found in Mumbra creek on March 5.

30-03-2021||Idukki (Kerala)||Ex-MP calls Rahul 'unmarried trouble-maker', courts controversy in Kerala||After coming under fire for his sexually-coloured remarks against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, former MP Joyce George on Tuesday withdrew his comments and expressed regret publicly, even as the national party demanded his arrest while the ruling CPI(M) distanced itself from the slur.“I hereby unconditionally withdraw the inappropriate remarks made by me while addressing an election rally in Irattayar here on Monday. I also express regret over that,” he said while speaking at a meeting in Kumaly in this high range district.George had won as the CPI(M) supported independent during 2014 Parliament election from Idukki but lost to Congress’s Dean Kuriakose in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.As TV channels started airing the visuals of his speech in Irattayar here this morning, sharp reactions poured in from various quarters especially from the Congress-UDF fold which strongly condemned the remarks and described it as “misogynistic”.Sensing that the objectionable remarks would give the opposition ammunition to target them during campaigns in the poll-bound state, the CPI(M) was quick to reject George’s comments.Distancing himself from the derogatory comments, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan made it clear that attacking Gandhi personally was not the LDF’s stand.“We will oppose him politically not personally’, Vijayan told reporters in Kasaragod.Soon after that, the CPI(M) state secretariat here issued a press statement stating that the Left party does not agree with the remarks made by their ex-MP.“The CPI(M) is opposing the political stand taken by the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi. Such remarks will only help to deviate attention from the political criticism. Nobody should make such comments,” it said.Attacking the opposition Congress-led UDF and Rahul Gandhi in particular, George, during his Irattayar speech, had said Gandhi would visit only women’s colleges and the girls should be ‘careful’ while dealing with the former Congress president.“Rahul Gandhi is a bachelor and troublemaker… so girls should be wary of him…do not bend down in front of him,” he had said while campaigning for Power Minister M M Mani.The former Left independent MP’s remarks came days after Gandhi had given Aikido lessons at the famed St Teresa’s college in Kochi based on the request of a student.The Congress leader had visited the women’s college for an interaction with students after he arrived at the state for election campaigning.Meanwhile, the Congress leaders were up in arm against the George’s obscene statements against Gandhi.Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala termed the sexually coloured remarks against Gandhi as ‘unfortunate and unacceptable.’A case should be registered against the former MP and he should be arrested, he said.KPCC chief Mullappally Ramachandran and former chief minister Oommen Chandy lashed out at the ex-MP and said the remarks were “high deplorable” and “unacceptable”.Member of Parliament and Youth Congress leader Dean Kuriakose said George might have spoken about his own character.“The vulgarity within him has come out now. What is his merit to criticise Rahul Gandhi? He is trying to follow the footsteps of Power Minister MM Mani, known for making such derogatory comments,” he said.Kuriakose said through the comments, the former MP had not only insulted Gandhi but also the girl students.He also said he would soon lodge a complaint with the Election Commission against George in this connection.Criticising George, Kerala Congress leader PJ Joseph said the remarks were ‘immature’ and wanted to know whether it was the opinion of the entire LDF.However, minister MM Mani justified George and said he had not made any anti-women remarks and only criticised Rahul Gandhi.

30-03-2021||Imphal||Manipur govt asks DCs to 'politely turn away' Myanmar refugees, takes back order||The Manipur government issued a circular to the Deputy Commissioners of districts bordering Myanmar not to open camps to provide food and shelter to refugees fleeing the neighbouring country after the coup but withdrew it three days later to avoid potential public anger.In the advisory issued to the DCs of Chandel, Tengoupal, Kamjong, Ukhrul and Churachandpur on March 26, Special Secretary (Home) H Gyan Prakash also asked them to stop Aadhaar enrolment exercise.As a fallout of the events taking place in the neighbouring country, Myanmar, it is reported that the country's nationals have been trying to enter India through the border states including Manipur, it said."District administration should not open any camps to provide food and shelter. The civil society organisations should also not be allowed to open any camps to provide shelter/food," the circular, which came into the public domain on Monday, said.While advising the DCs to "politely turn away", those trying to sneak into India, the Special Secretary wrote, in case of grievous injuries, medical attention may be provided on humanitarian considerations.With public anger mounting in neighbouring Mizoram against attempts to thwart the entry of refugees from Myanmar, the officer issued another advisory on Monday, saying the contents of the previous letter had been "misconstrued"."It appears that the contents of the letter have been misconstrued and interpreted differently. The state government has been taking all humanitarian steps had recently taken all steps, including taking them to Imphal, to treat the injured Myanmarese nationals. The state government continues to provide all aid," it said."In order to avoid this misunderstanding I am directed to convey the decision of the Government that it has decided to withdraw the letter dated 26.03.2021 mentioned above," Prakash said.Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga had recently written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to provide asylum to the refugees, saying a "human catastrophe of gigantic proportions" is happening in Myanmar and innocent citizens are being killed by the military, which is supposed to protect them.He had dubbed as "not acceptable" the Centre's order to prevent illegal immigration from Myanmar and ensure speedy deportation of refugees.Zoramthanga said the areas in Myanmar bordering Mizoram are inhabited by the people of the Chin community who share ethnic ties and have had close contact with the people of the state even before India became Independent."This (MHA advisory) is not acceptable to Mizoram. I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis," Zoramthanga said in the letter.Over 1,000 Myanmarese have taken refuge in Mizoram since the coup, and a senior government official told PTI on Monday that the state had received no communication from the Centre after the March 10 directive to stop illegal immigration from the neighbouring country.An unspecified number of refugees also entered Manipur, including those with injuries, who were sheltered by the residents of border villages.

30-03-2021||Islamabad||Meeting with Jaishankar not ‘finalised or requested’: Pak Foreign Minister Qureshi||Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said no meeting has been "finalised or requested" so far with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on the sidelines of the 'Heart of Asia' conference on Tuesday at Tajikistan's capital Dushanbe, according to a media report on Monday.The participation of both the ministers at the conference has sparked speculation of a possible meeting between the two leaders amidst recent peace overtures from the Pakistan Army.Qureshi on Sunday told the Dawn newspaper that “no meeting (between him and Jaishankar) has been finalised or requested”.When asked about media speculation that India and Pakistan have been quietly negotiating for the full resumption of diplomatic relations, Qureshi said, “No such decision yet.”Jaishankar last week also did not give a specific reply to questions on whether he would meet Qureshi on the sidelines of the conference."My scheduling is in progress. So far I do not think any such meeting (is scheduled)," he said at the India Economic Conclave in New Delhi on March 26. While announcing his participation, the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement on Friday had said that Jaishankar is expected to meet leaders of other participating countries on the sidelines of the 9th Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process (HoA-IP) ministerial conference.The last meeting between Qureshi and an Indian external affairs minister took place in May 2019 in Bishkek on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. Late Sushma Swaraj then held the portfolio of the external affairs minister.Pakistan's Foreign Office on Sunday said Qureshi would hold “consultations with key regional and international partners” on the sidelines of the conference.India and Pakistan are without high commissioners in each other's capital - New Delhi and Islamabad, respectively - since the relations between the two countries nosedived after India withdrew special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into union territories in August 2019.On March 18, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa said it is time for India and Pakistan to "bury the past and move forward".India has said it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence and that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility.The HoA-IP ministerial conference is part of the Istanbul Process - a regional initiative on security and cooperation for a stable and peaceful Afghanistan - that was launched on November 2, 2011 in Turkey.
