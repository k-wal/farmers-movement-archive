22-03-2021||New Delhi||Affirmative action not limited to reservation alone: SC||Noting that affirmative action was not limited to reservation alone, the Supreme Court on Monday said states should take additional steps to promote education and establish institutions for uplifting socially and educationally backward classes (SEBS).“Why can’t other things be done? Why not promote education and establish more institutes? Somewhere this matrix has to move beyond reservation. Affirmative action is not just reservation,” a five-judge Constitution Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan noted.The Bench—which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat—had on Friday sought to know if there was no limit to quota what would happen to the concept of equality. “What about the resultant inequality? How many generations will you continue?” it had asked.On the sixth day of hearing to decide whether the nine-judge Bench verdict in the Indira Sawhney (Mandal) case which fixed 50 per cent ceiling for quota in government jobs and admission to educational institutions should be revisited in view of subsequent constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics, the top court said several other things could be done by the State for it.On behalf of Jharkhand government, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said it involved various issues, including financial resources of the state, number of schools, teachers etc. The extent of reservation would differ from state to state depending on the population and thus, there cannot be a straight-jacketed formula, he submitted.Senior advocate PS Patwalia, representing the Maharashtra government, said reservation was a burning issue. This was a huge social issue in the state, he added while referring to protests on the issue.On Friday, the top court had wondered if no development had taken place in the country since Independence.“Seventy years have passed since independence…states are carrying out so many beneficial schemes. Can we accept that no development has taken place and that no backward caste has moved forward?” it had asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/affirmative-action-not-limited-to-reservation-alone-sc-228972

Hence, I demand strict action against Sawant,” she added.Rana raised the Vaze issue in the Lok Sabha as the BJP demanded resignation of the Maharashtra government headed by Uddhav Thackeray in the wake of former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh’s claim that the state’s Home Minister Anil Deshmukh set a Rs 100-crore collection target for the police every month.Singh had also claimed that Deshmukh asked Vaze to help with collection of money.Rana claimed that Thackeray had spoken to then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking reinstatement of Vaze who was under suspension following the Khwaja Yunus custodial death case.“The then chief minister flatly refused. But when the current chief minister (Thackeray) took charge, the first decision he took was to reinstate Vaze. Because of the chief minister such things are happening in Maharashtra,” she said.The NIA is probing Vaze’s alleged role in placing an explosives-laden SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-navneet-rana-accuses-senas-arvind-sawant-of-threatening-her-228971

With this in mind the Founders are supportive of the appointment of the Ombudsperson by 31st May 2021. The Chancellor and Vice Chancellor will propose candidates for this position for approval by the Governing Body,” a statement from Ashoka University’s Board of Trustees to the faculty said today.The trustees acknowledged that protocols and processes to maintain a separation of the academic functioning from the Founders needed to be established. “Many processes are already in place but these need to be strengthened. The Founders are open to helping out in the task of strengthening these processes. There is another very important section of the academic community of Ashoka that need to be brought in here. These are the students who are being taught to think critically and to question and doubt. They also have valid concerns about their freedom of expression and the need to be heard by various decision-making bodies. The Founders are conscious of this,” the statement said days after Mehta resigned and later ruled out any possibility of reconsidering his move.The Board of Trustees statement signed by Ashish Dhawan, Pramath Raj Sinha, Sanjeev Bikhchandani and Vineet Gupta also noted that the varsity’s aim was to enable free enquiry, free expression and intellectual honesty.“All this cannot be achieved overnight. Ashoka will always be a work in progress. The present moment provides an opportunity to make a fresh start by collectively reaffirming our faith in the vision and ethos of Ashoka. We seek to work together to make Ashoka not only one of the best universities in the world but also an institution that makes a difference to the world,” said the trustees after two faculty resigned citing lack of space for academic freedom.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-backlash-ashoka-varsity-founders-promise-ombudsperson-for-academic-freedom-228969

He elaborated on the potential and number of opportunities that can be tapped into for attracting the discerning Singaporean traveller once the tourism traffic resumes.During each of the webinars, the India Tourism Office in Singapore highlighted that there has been an upswing in the confidence of the domestic travellers in the last few months and several destinations have been receiving domestic tourists in good numbers.Presentations were also given by representatives of Indian luxury hotel groups like The Taj and the Oberoi as well as the Indian Association of Tour Operators who elaborated on the various steps taken by the tourism industry in India during the pandemic and their preparations for receiving foreign tourists when the borders reopen.Representatives from the local trade bodies and organisations of the respective countries also gave their views.

22-03-2021||Kolkata||Congress manifesto promises to bring back ‘glorious’ BC Roy days in Bengal||The Congress on Monday released its manifesto for West Bengal Assembly polls, stressing that it wants to restore the glory that the state enjoyed in the 1950s and 60s under the then chief minister, Bidhan Chandra Roy, widely regarded as the architect of modern Bengal.The Congress, which has forged an alliance with the Left Front and the newly formed Indian Secular Front (ISF) for the assembly elections, said in the document that it does not believe in “politics of freebies”, but would ensure wholesome development of West Bengal.Maintaining that Bengal had progressed well during the tenure of BC Roy, who brought several heavy industries to the state, WBPCC president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party has highlighted eight issues that it wishes to address, if voted to power.The Congress, if allowed to form government, will prioritise the state’s law and order situation, women’s safety, social security, industrialisation and job creation.The manifesto also promised to take steps for farmers’ development, which include at least 20 per cent subsidy on the electricity that will be used for irrigation.The party gave assurance that it would strengthen education and health infrastructure, preserve the state’s culture, heritage and art, and provide clean drinking water to every household in the state.“People should not make the mistake of choosing the TMC or the BJP, claiming that they are two flowers of the same stem. We have framed a new slogan — ‘Extend your hand, save Bengal. We are the only party that could work for the betterment of the state’s future,” the Congress leader said.Admitting that several Congress activists have objected to the choice of candidates, Chowdhury said the grand old party, however, had to put up with “little hassle” as compared to the TMC or the BJP.“The protests show that many people are interested in representing the Congress, which is nothing but a very healthy sign. Seats in our quota are limited, and that is the reason (we could not please all) ...”The Congress is contesting from 90-odd constituencies, as part of the alliance stitched for assembly polls, which will be held in eight phases for the 294-member House.

22-03-2021||New Delhi||SC rules out insurance claim to kin of a man who died due to excessive alcohol consumption||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to grant insurance claim to the legal heir of a man who died of asphyxia due to excessive drinking of alcohol, saying the insurer was only liable to compensate a person who sustains injury solely and directly from the accident.A Bench of Justices MM Shantangoudar and Vineet Saran upheld the orders of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which had said that the death was not accidental and therefore, the firm had no statutory liability to compensate the loss of life of the deceased as per the terms of the Insurance Policy.“In the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order dated April 24, 2009 passed by the National Commission...,” the Bench said.The top court passed the verdict on an appeal filed by Narbada Devi, the legal heir of the man employed as watchman (Chowkidar) with Himachal Pradesh State Forest Corporation (HPSFC), after he died on the thunderous and rainy cold night of October 7-8, 1997, in Chopal Panchayat of Shimla district.“From a bare perusal of the Insurance Policy, it is clear that only if the insured sustains any bodily injury resulting solely and directly from accident caused by outward, violent and visible means, the insurance company would be liable to indemnify the insured,” the Bench said, adding that as per the insurance policy, only accidental death of the insured shall be indemnified.It noted that the post-mortem report clearly indicates that there were no injuries found on the body of the deceased and the probable cause of death as per the final opinion is asphyxiation caused by alcohol consumption and regurgitation of food into larynx.“As such, we find it difficult to conclude that the deceased’s death was accidental,” the Bench said, adding that in light of the explicit terms of the insurance policy, “we find that the National Commission and the State Commission have rightly held that the deceased’s death was not accidental, and that the insurance company would not be liable to settle the appellants’ claim”.According to the legal heir of the man, on the morning of October 8, 1997, on the way to village Thundal, the deceased was found in a hapless condition around 9 am, smelling of alcohol.The appeal said that in the post-mortem report no injury was seen on any part of the body and the cause of death was probably asphyxia resulting from regurgitation of food articles into larynx and trachea after consumption of alcohol.               Under the Janta Personal Accident Insurance Scheme, the HPSFC had taken the insurance policy for its 3,008 employees from the New India Assurance Company under with coverage of Rs 1 lakh for those who opt for the said scheme.When Devi, made the claim for the death of the man before the insurance company it repudiated the claim.            Aggrieved with the repudiation of the claim, she approached the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Shimla alleging deficiency in service on part of the insurance company and claiming insurance amount of Rs 2 lakhs along with interest and cost.The forum held that the insurance company had wrongly repudiated the claim and was liable to make payment and indemnification of the insured amount of Rs 2 lakhs to the legal heir of the man.              Aggrieved by the order, the insurance company approached the state consumer commission, which held that the body of the deceased did not have any external injury or mark of violence, and therefore opined that the death was not accidental.It said that the insurance company could not be held liable under the insurance policy but said that HPSFC was liable to pay the compensation.Aggrieved with the order HPSFC approached the NCDRC, which held that neither the insurance company had any statutory liability to compensate the loss of life of the deceased nor the HPSFC has any liability under the policy.

22-03-2021||New Delhi||Loan moratorium: SC to pronounce verdict on Tuesday on pleas for relief from trade bodies||The Supreme Court will on Tuesday pronounce verdict on a batch of pleas by various trade associations, including from real estate and power sectors, seeking extension of loan moratorium and other reliefs in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan which had reserved its verdict on the batch of pleas on December 17, last year, will pronounce the judgement.The Centre had earlier submitted before the top court that if it were to consider waiving interest on all the loans and advances to all categories of borrowers for the six-month moratorium period announced by RBI in view of COVID-19 pandemic, then the amount foregone would be more than Rs 6 lakh crore.If the banks were to bear this burden, then it would necessarily wipe out a substantial and a major part of their net worth, rendering most of the lenders unviable and raising a very serious question mark over their very survival, it had said.The government said this was a main reason as to why waiver of interest was not even contemplated and only payment of instalments was deferred. Giving an illustration, it had said that in case of State Bank of India alone (which is the largest bank in the country), waiver of six months’ interest would completely wipe out over half of the bank’s net worth which has accumulated over nearly 65 years of its existence.It had pointed out the sector-specific relief measures taken by the government for the small and mid-sized business/MSMEs including from sectors such as restaurants and hotels.The Centre has promulgated emergency credit-linked guarantee scheme (ECLGS) of Rs 3 lakh crore providing additional credit at lower rate of interest, with 100 per cent government guarantee and no fresh collateral, it had said.The scheme has been extended with higher financial limits to twenty seven COVID-19 impacted sectors including restaurant and hotel sectors, it had said. On November 27 last year, the top court had  asked the Centre to ensure that all steps be taken to implement its decision to forego interest on eight specified categories of loans paid up to Rs 2 crore in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The apex court had noted that the moratorium period as granted by the Reserve Bank of India continued from March 3 to August 31, six months.It had said the COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused serious threat to the health of the people but has also cast its shadow on the economic growth of the country as well as other countries in the entire world. The eight categories of loans are MSME (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises), Education, Housing, Consumer durable, Credit card, Automobile, Personal and Consumption.The RBI had on March 27 issued the circular which allowed lending institutions to grant a moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1 and May 31, 2020, due to the pandemic. Later, the moratorium was extended till August 31 this year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-sc-to-pronounce-verdict-on-tuesday-on-pleas-for-relief-from-trade-bodies-228955
22-03-2021||---||PIL against manual scavenging: Can’t compel states to respond, says SC||New Delhi, March 22Maintaining that it can’t compel states to file their replies, the Supreme Court on Monday said it will proceed with the hearing on a PIL against manual scavenging in India. “We can’t compel people to file counter affidavit. We will proceed and draw adverse inference against them,” said a Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde while listing the matter for further hearing in the third week of August.The top court’s comments came after petitioner Criminal Justice Society of India’s counsel Ashima Mandala said notice was issued in the matter in February 2019 and there were over 40 respondents but only 13 had filed replies so far.Mandla submitted that one manual scavenger died every five days and the issue was also raised in the Rajya Sabha.On February 8, 2019, the top court had asked the chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories (UTs) to place a record status report on the number of manual scavengers employed directly or indirectly since 1993 when the law prohibiting the practice was enacted.It had observed that the matter was “serious” and asked all the states and the UTs to file their reply within four weeks.  The SC has sought the number of manual scavengers who have died since 1993 when manual scavenging was declared illegal.It also sought a direction to states, UTs and the Indian Railways to investigate the death of manual scavengers and initiate criminal proceedings under IPC Section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against authorities, agencies, contractors or any other official, who have directly or indirectly employed manual scavengers.The death of persons under these circumstances cannot be attributed to mere negligence as these persons are engaged either directly or indirectly to carry out acts which are prohibited under the law and are exposing them to deplorable and hazardous conditions which have proved to be fatal in numerous instances, it said.“Hence, it is the plea of the petitioner that the said contractors, officials, agencies or any other persons shall face criminal proceedings under section 304 of the Penal Code including the cases of agency wherein vicarious liability applies,” the plea said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-against-manual-scavenging-cant-compel-states-to-respond-says-sc-228953

The World Bank, which is the IWT adjudicator, has often cleared India built dams after asking for minor adjustments to account for Pakistani concerns.The meeting is part of a graded thaw in Indo-Pak ties that began with last month’s joint ceasefire announcement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-delegation-arrives-in-india-for-indus-water-talks-228950

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Hiran murder: ATS takes accused to crime spot, detains man in Gujarat||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Monday took an accused arrested in the Mansukh Hiran murder case to the creek where his body was found, and also detained a person from Gujarat who had provided them SIM cards, officials said.The ATS last week arrested suspended policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gaur in the case. The SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house here had been allegedly stolen from Hiran’s possession.According to the ATS, Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, now suspended and in custody of the NIA, has emerged as the prime accused in the Hiran case.“Shinde was taken to Retibunder area near Mumbra creek where Hiran’s body was found (on March 5),” an ATS official said.“Also, our team traveled to Ahmedabad and detained a man from whom the accused had got SIM cards for use in the crime and also seized some of the cards,” he added.On Sunday, ATS DIG Shivdeep Lande had posted a message on Facebook stating that the Hiran murder case had been cracked.Shinde was convicted in the 2006 Lakhan Bhaiya fake encounter case and came out of jail on furlough last year. He was allegedly in touch with Vaze, who himself was once known as ‘encounter specialist’ officer, since then.Apparently it was Shinde who had called Hiran from suburban Kandivali by identifying himself as “Tawde saheb” on March 4, the day before the Thane-based businessman’s body was found in the creek, the ATS official said.Vaze is currently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which is probing the recovery of the vehicle containing gelatin sticks and a threat letter which was found parked near Ambani’s multi-storey residence ‘Antilia’.The Union Home Ministry on Saturday handed over the Hiran murder case to the NIA, but the ATS officials, as of Monday, were still sharing details of their own probe.“Sachin Vaze is a prime accused in the Hiran murder case. He had played a key role. During the probe, the ATS found that Gaur had provided five SIM cards to API Vaze and Shinde for the crime. Shinde used to help Vaze in his illegal activities,” an ATS official had said earlier, claiming that the arrest of Shinde and Gaur was a major breakthrough. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hiran-murder-ats-takes-accused-to-crime-spot-detains-man-in-gujarat-228944

22-03-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi launches ‘Catch the Rain’ campaign||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched a 100-day ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain’ campaign on World Water Day via video conferencing and pitched for leadership roles to women with regard to water management.Also he witnessed signing of Memorandum of Understanding between the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, respectively Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Yogi Adityanath, to link Ken and Betwa rivers on the occasion.Doubling down on the importance of water, Modi said water undergirds India’s vision of progress and success. It impinges upon every aspect of life. India cannot progress without its water security, he added.He said not much was done in this regard before. He said conservation and preservation of water is the cornerstone of the Union government policies.The PMKSY, JJM, Per More Per Crop, Namami gange, Har Khet Jal and Atal Bhujal Yojana are some of the policies directed for better water management.He expressed concern that groundwater in several parts of the country was contaminated with arsenic and fluoride among others affecting the health of the people of the areas.Calling upon people to save rainwater under the canvass of water management, he said it is pragmatism that precautionary and redemptive measures are taken in time.He called for peoples’ movement led by women for better management of the country’s water resources.“Give our mothers and sisters the leadership role,” Modi said, and added that they know the importance of water better.“The country’s water scarcity will be countered effectively if they take up the leadership role.”The campaign launched today will be undertaken across the country in both rural and urban areas with the theme “catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls”. It will be implemented from March 22 to November 30, 2021 -- the pre-monsoon and monsoon period in the country.Modi directed that during this period, all the MGNREGA related works must be directed only towards the theme of the campaign.Modi also interacted with elected representatives of village panchayats on the issue of water conservation on the occasion. After the event, Gram Sabhas are scheduled to hold in all Gram Panchayats of each district (except in the poll bound states) to discuss issues related to water and water conservation.Gram Sabhas will also take ‘Jal Shapath’ for water conservation.Terming the MoU for the Ken-Betwa rivers link project as “historic”, Modi said it will benefit the people of the large swathe of the parched Bundelkhand region.The Bundelkhand is a hilly region consisting of 13 districts spread over Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Historically, the region has earned notoriety for acute water scarcity and rampant poverty.While Ken starts in Bundelkhand and flows through Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, Betwa (tributary of Yamuna) rises in Vindhya Range and flows through the two states.The two rivers will be linked vide a 212 km-long canal.Over 10 lakh hectares of farm land of the region will be irrigated on account of the link project. About 62 lakh people would be provided potable water.Besides, a slew of projects, including power projects will be set up along the course of the rivers. Linking of Ken and Betwa rivers project is the first project of the National Perspective Plan for interlinking of the country’s rivers.This plan was conceived in right earnest during the AB Vajpayee-led NDA government at the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-launches-catch-the-rain-campaign-228907
22-03-2021||New Delhi||Renewable electricity needs to grow 55-fold to achieve zero-emission in India by 2050: Study||Renewables in electricity must increase 55-fold for India to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report by Council on Energy, Environment and Wate (CEEW).    India will need to generate at least 83 per cent of its electricity from (non-hydro power) renewable energy sources by 2050 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, according to the study.This would mean a massive 55-fold increase in the use of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation within the coming three decades, from only 160 Terawatt-hour (TWh) (10 per cent) in 2019, CEEW said in a statement.Further, to achieve net-zero by 2050 the share of electricity in India's industrial energy use must rise three-fold, from 20.3 per cent in 2018 to 70 per cent in 2050, the study - Peaking and Net-Zero for India's Energy Sector CO2 Emissions: An Analytical Exposition - revealed.The share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales will also have to rise to 76 per cent by 2050 from just 0.1 per cent in 2019, it added.These estimates are based on CEEW's best understanding of progress on mitigation technologies.To meet net-zero, India will need to either eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or balance these by sequestering GHG emissions.The study is the first exercise to outline multiple pathways for India to attain net-zero emissions, rather than fixating on a single scenario or a single year.It highlighted that India will need to reach peak emissions within this decade if it were to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century, a pace of transition, unlike anything the world has seen before.This will give India an extremely narrow window to ensure a smooth and equitable transition from a peaking year to a net-zero year.Advanced economies, including China, Japan, the UK, and the US, will have taken at least 30, and at times well over 40 years for this transition. Advanced economies peaked emissions at much higher levels of development, slower rates of growth and would have had longer transition periods, it added.  "...We find that India would need to undergo a double transition, through faster electrification of sectors and an increasing share of renewables in power generation, if it were to announce an ambitious net-zero target," Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow at CEEW, and author of the study said.Policymakers will also need to identify manufacturing sectors where electricity could replace fossil fuels. Reducing the cost of electricity to make it competitive would be equally critical, he added."Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2060 would need rapid systemic changes across all sectors and sections of society. This, in turn, would require significant international financial investments and technological transfer from or technology co-development with the developed world," Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said.It will be equally important for India to closely examine trade-offs such as increasing cost of household electricity, increasing railways passenger fares, fiscal challenges for coal-dependent states, job losses for over half a million coal mining workers, and the shifting geopolitics around energy trade and the energy transition before announcing its net-zero targets, Ghosh added.The CEEW study also explained why India's case is different from the net-zero pathways of China, the EU, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.First, the per capita emissions for all other economies in their respective peaking years would be much higher than India's, even if it were to peak in 2050. Secondly, India's real GDP growth rate would be much higher than any other country post their peaking years. This indicates that India would need to put in significantly more effort to peak and subsequently reduce emissions. Thirdly, India will have a much lower per capita income to support the transition, even if it began the post-peak transition in 2050, let alone 2030.The study also found that if India were to peak in 2030 and reach net-zero in 2060 like China, its cumulative carbon emissions in 2021-2100 would be 80 GtCO2. For the same period, China and the US' cumulative carbon emissions, even after incorporating their net-zero ambition, would be 349 GtCO2 and 104 GtCO2, respectively.According to the World Bank, India's per capita carbon dioxide emissions stood at 1.82 tCO2 in 2016, much lower than the global average of 4.55 tCO2.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/renewable-electricity-needs-to-grow-55-fold-to-achieve-zero-emission-in-india-by-2050-study-228901
22-03-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh shielded people with underworld links: Cop||A suspended inspector of the Mumbai Police has alleged that former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh had tried to shield some people having Underworld links from law when he was DG of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).The policeman also alleged that Singh's aide had demanded a bribe of Rs 2 crore to reinstate him into the police force.Police Inspector Anup Dange, who was attached to Gamdevi police station before he was suspended in July, 2020, had written a letter raising allegations against Singh to Maharashtra Additional Chief Secretary, Home, on February 2 this year.Dange said Jeetu Navlani, a pub owner, threatened him on November 22, 2019, when he was trying to get pubs closed on time in posh Breach Candy area in Mumbai.Dange stated that Navlani tried to pressurise him by claiming close links with Param Bir Singh, who was then DG, ACB.He stated that on November 22, 2019, an altercation broke out among three guests of Navlani at his pub and they started fighting.When constable Santosh Pawar intervened, he was assaulted by Yash Rajiv Mehta, grandson of film and diamond financier Bharat Shah, Dange stated, adding that he registered an FIR in the matter.After a while, Bharat Shah himself came to the police station and tried to convince Dange to release Yash Mehta, Dange claimed.When Dange refused to oblige, Shah, his son Rajiv Shah and grandson Yash Mehta assaulted him, the letter stated.Subsequently, Dange registered a second FIR.On February 29, 2020, Param Bir Singh took charge as commissioner of Mumbai Police.Singh ordered that no chargesheet be filed in the Navlani case, Dange stated.He also claimed that Singh met Navlani at a private flat located on the first floor of Moti Mahal building opposite the Marine Drive police station.He stated that Navlani acted as liaison for Bharat Shah.The flat is rented by Shardul Singh Bayas, who claims himself to be a cousin of Singh, the letter said.Dange stated that Navlani wanted his name to be dropped from the chargesheet.He claimed that Bayas demanded Rs 50 lakh from him to avoid a punishment posting.In July 2020, Dange was suspended. He claimed in the letter that Bayas demanded Rs 2 crore for reinstating him in the police force.He said that "Shah, Navlani are dubious characters with Underworld links".Dange further stated that an ongoing departmental inquiry against him be transferred to any IAS officer.Singh was last week transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in the midst of a probe by the NIA into the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV which was found parked outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month.

She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".Directing the special judge (SC/ST Act) Hathras to conduct in-camera proceedings of the trial henceforth, the bench had warned that if any person tried to disturb the trial or attempted to threaten the life, liberty and property of the victim's family and the witnesses in any manner, it would take very serious action, including initiating contempt proceedings.The bench was hearing an application moved by the victim's brother who alleged that on March 5 that a mob, which included some lawyers, created a ruckus in the trial court and threatened the lawyer and two witnesses who had come to depose in the court on that date.

22-03-2021||New Delhi||Maharashtra letter gate resonates in Lok Sabha: BJP-Opposition clash, MVA allies meet to discuss fallout||The controversy involving Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh facing allegations of extortion resonated in Lok Sabha on Monday with the BJP clashing with the Shiv Sena and the Congress over the issue.BJP members of the Lok Sabha attacked the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress for “protecting" Deshmukh.Majoj Kotak, BJP MP from Mumbai (northeast), led the demand for the resignation of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deshmukh. He demanded accountability after ex Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh alleged Deshmukh had ordered arrested policeman Sachin Vaze to collect Rs 100 crore per month.“There are 1742 bars in Mumbai and the issue is grave as state home minister is accused of extorting Rs 100 crore. Why is the CM silent? This government is indulging in loot and extortion. We demand the resignation of CM and home minister and a CBI probe,” Kotak said.After BJP’s Rakesh Singh, Poonam Mahajan and Amaravati MP Navneet Rana asked for action against Deshmukh, Shiv Sena’s Vinayak Raut alleged there are attempts to destabilise the Maharashtra government.“All efforts have failed. We need to ask who is Param Bir Singh?” He said.Congress MP Ravneet Bittu said interference of central agencies in Maharashtra will not be acceptable m.“Why do central agencies interfere in opposition ruled states only? The main culprits are officers and we politicians keep blaming each other. Bureaucrats should not escape but equally Maharashtra will not accept central agency interference. You want to topple the Maharashtra government after MP,” said Bittu ahead of a crucial meeting among Maha Vikas Aghadi allies to decide on the Deshmukh issue.Late last night, NCP Maharashtra chief Jayant Patil backed Deshmukh saying there was no question of Deshmukh resigning.Clarity on the issue is expected on Monday with NCP Sharad Pawar questioning the timing of Param Bir Singh’s letter to CM Thackeray.The Congress has also left the decision to NCP, leaving the decision to Pawar noting, “the matter pertains to that (NCP) portion of the alliance.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-letter-gate-resonates-in-lok-sabha-bjp-opposition-clash-mva-allies-meet-to-discuss-fallout-228889

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh's letter dented Maharashtra home department's image: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government enjoys a "good majority" and it will not fall because of "one official" even as it admitted that ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh's allegations of corruption against state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh have maligned the image of the latter's department.The Sena also said this issue has now become a "matter of prestige" for the party-led government, a day after Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) ruled out the resignation of Deshmukh.In the editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', the party said a fire will erupt if the BJP tries to undermine the majority enjoyed by the MVA government.The MVA comprises the Sena, NCP and Congress.A major political storm erupted in Maharashtra after Singh wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray last week claiming that Deshmukh had asked police officers to collect Rs 100 crore monthly, including Rs 50-60 crore from bars and hotels in Mumbai.Singh was recently shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner in the midst of a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV from outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month.Deshmukh had said that Singh was transferred in view of "serious and unforgivable mistakes" committed by some colleagues of the top cop. The home minister had also denied the allegations of corruption raised against him.The hue and cry being generated by the BJP over Singh's letter seems to be part of a conspiracy, the Sena said, adding the letter came close on the heels of Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi last week."It seems to be the goal of the BJP to impose President's rule in Maharashtra by contending that law and order situation is not right. For this, new pawns are being created. It is clear, Singh is being used in that manner," it said.Singh, whose suspension the BJP was seeking over the bomb scare outside Ambani's residence, has now become a "darling" of the opposition party which is now targeting the government by keeping the gun on his shoulder, the edit said.The Sena, however, admitted that Singh's allegations against Deshmukh have "definitely maligned" the image of the state home department and that they have given a tool to the Opposition to target the government."It (the overall issue) is now become a matter of the government's prestige," the Sena said.".....The MVA enjoys a good majority even today. Fire will erupt if (you) try to undermine that majority. This is not a warning, but a fact. The Opposition should not forget that governments are not formed and don't fall because of one official," it added.The Sena further said that Singh making allegations against Deshmukh in the letter and "leaking" the same to the media was not in line with discipline.Hailing Singh as a "dynamic" officer, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said Singh had discharged several responsibilities in a "very good" manner.Mumbai Police carried out a proper probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput under Singh's leadership, the Sena said and praised him for handling the Kangana Ranaut episode well."..It is true that the Opposition has made allegations against him (Singh) in connection with the 'Antilia' (Ambani's residence) episode, but it is not right to level allegations against the government," the Sena added.The Sena alleged that the BJP was using Singh to defame the state government."Reacting to Singh's letter, Deshmukh on Saturday said that Singh was raising such accusations to save his skin in police officer Sachin Waze (arrested by the NIA in connection with the bomb scare case)."If this (Deshmukh's comment) is true, then the BJP is using Singh to defame the Maharashtra government," the Sena said.The party alleged that it was the BJP's policy to not only defame the government but to cause trouble in its functioning."The Opposition party has been making the extreme use of Central probe agencies in Maharashtra. It seems the Centre may send CBI or NIA in the state even if four hens and two crows die due to electric shock somewhere," the edit said.

So I must close this chapter,” Mehta said to the students noting that although India was bursting with creativity, “dark shadows of authoritarianism are also hovering over us”.“We will have to find principled ways of overcoming this condition,” said Mehta.Meanwhile, Ashoka varsity Chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee today countered the recent aspersions on the institution saying Ashoka was “committed to academic freedom and intellectual independence”.Chairman of Ashoka’s Board of Trustees Ashish Dhawan in another letter to students said the institution would keep lines of communication open to understand each other better.Mukherjee said the Board of Trustees stood for free inquiry, academic freedom and intellectual independence. The university leaders also said they wanted students to continue questioning the world around them, including the university.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/founders-never-interfered-ashoka-chancellor-228680

In phase III, the network is being extended to 475 districts, selected in consultation with director generals (DGs) of state police. Out of 475 identified locations, 451 have been found feasible for providing connectivity, out of which 174 have already been connected. When completed, the network will cover 825 locations around the country,” sources said.The MAC is a common platform for inputs coming in from various intelligence agencies where it is collated and passed on for further action. “For this purpose, the national capital was connected with 25 central member agencies and all state capitals. In state capitals, the network links the SMAC (housed in the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau/SIB), state police special branch and offices of all central and other counter-terror agencies. The government now plans to expand the MAC network base,” the MHA told the panel. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-terror-net-widens-ib-to-cover-825-locations-228611

Among the panel members are BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab and BJP’s Rajendra Agarwal and Meenakshi Lekhi.The 17th Lok Sabha has not yet had an election for the Deputy Speaker’s post.A Lok Sabha secretariat source said, “In this case the post of the Speaker is not vacant.”The House may decide mostly from one among a panel of Chairpersons to preside over proceedings. Such a view would emanate after due discussion with the Speaker in consultation with Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and may be with other leaders of the House.The occasion for the President appointing a person to act as the Speaker may not arise because the Speaker is not even incapacitated and as regards decisions on admissibility of notices, administrative matters go, the Speaker can continue to function.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-tests-positive-no-deputy-speaker-to-preside-over-house-228609

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress put up a united face saying the government was stable and “attempts to destabilise it would fail”. Earlier in the day, Pawar came out for damage-control and said the decision on Deshmukh would be taken by CM Uddhav Thackeray by tomorrow. Pawar, chief architect of the 16-month-old MVA, questioned the timing of the letter former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh wrote to the CM accusing Deshmukh of extortion and demands of Rs 100 crore a month from restaurants and bars. “Why did Param Bir Singh write the letter after he was transferred to Home Guard,” asked Pawar, addressing the media here while admitting that the charges were serious and must be probed.Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Law MinisterExposÉ tip of icebergWhat has been alleged in the letter could be just the tip of the iceberg. As (NCP) party chief, what action is he (Sharad Pawar) going to take. Pawar said he would advise the CM to set up an independent probe into Singh’s accusations by former Mumbai police chief Julio Ribeiro. The latter declined to head any such investigation.Amid heightening speculation that Deshmukh might be replaced, NCP leaders (Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, state chief Jayant Patil and MP Supriya Sule) remained huddled at Pawar’s New Delhi residence all day with Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut and Congress’ Kamal Nath also engaged on the issue.“Neither the CM nor the Home Minister are responsible for reinstatement of Sachin Waze in Mumbai police last year. I have spoken to the CM about the letter but the timing is suspect. It comes after Singh was transferred on March 17 and also after Devendra Fadnavis visited Delhi,” said Pawar. These efforts will fail, said Pawar with the ruling alliance allies expected to meet tomorrow for a final call on whether to replace Deshmukh. A section of NCP leaders said the name of state minister and NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil was under discussion for a replacement, if any.Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “It will not be fair for us to comment. The matter pertains to a minister from that part of the ruling coalition. Even so, the BJP has never answered corruption allegations on its leaders... Karnataka CM BS Yedyurappa is facing grave charges.

22-03-2021||New Delhi||No question of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh resigning: NCP state chief||There is a no question of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh resigning, NCP state chief and senior minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government Jayant Patil said on Sunday against the backdrop of ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s corruption allegation.Following a three-hour meeting held at NCP president Sharad Pawar’s residence here, Patil said there is no need to divert attention from the main incident of bomb scare outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the killing of Mansukh Hiran, a Thane-based businessman.The focus is on these two events and after that appropriate steps will be taken, he said.“The question of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh resigning does not arise,” Patil said. During a media briefing earlier in the day, Pawar said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will decide the fate of Deshmukh. His comments came amid speculation in Maharashtra political circles that the state may soon have a new home minister.The top brass of the NCP met here against the backdrop of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh levelling allegations of corruption against Deshmukh. Singh has claimed that Deshmukh wanted police officers to collect Rs 100 crore monthly from bars and hotels in Mumbai.Pawar held the meeting with senior leaders Supriya Sule and Praful Patel, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, NCP Maharashtra chief and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil.The NCP along with the Shiv Sena is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra, and the home minister belongs to the Sharad Pawar-led party.The allegations levelled by Singh against Deshmukh are serious and require an in-depth probe, Sharad Pawar said.Before the meeting at Pawar’s residence here, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had also met him. Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath also met Pawar separately. Singh, a senior IPS officer, who was transferred to the low-key Home Guards on March 17 following the arrest of police officer Sachin Waze in the case related to the bomb scare near Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia, in a letter to the Maharashtra chief minister had claimed that he was made a scapegoat.In the eight-page letter to Chief Minister Thackeray, Singh alleged that Deshmukh used to call police officers to his official residence and give them a “collection target” from bars, restaurants and other establishments.The Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Office, in a release on Saturday, said Singh’s “unsigned letter to Thackeray” was not sent from his official email ID and efforts were on to contact him to verify it.

22-03-2021||New Delhi||Ashoka University acknowledges 'lapses' in institutional processes over resignations of Mehta, Subramanian||Ashoka University on Sunday acknowledged "lapses in institutional processes" and expressed "deep regret" at the recent events surrounding the resignations of political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta and noted economist Arvind Subramanian from its faculty.Meanwhile, Mehta wrote a letter to students, urging them to not "press" for his return asserting that the circumstances that led to his resignation will not change in foreseeable future.The university in Haryana's Sonipat became the centre of a controversy earlier this week, when Mehta, who had resigned as its vice-chancellor two years back, chose to step down as professor, saying that the founders made it "abundantly clear" that his association with the institution was a "political liability".Subramanian, the former chief economic advisor to the government, had resigned from the university two days later in solidarity with Mehta."We acknowledge that there have been some lapses in institutional processes which we will work to rectify in consultation with all stakeholders. This will reaffirm our commitment to academic autonomy and freedom which have always been at the core of the Ashoka University ideals," the institution said in a statement."Ashoka has been privileged to have been led, guided and counselled by Pratap first as Vice Chancellor and then as senior faculty. Subramanian brought eminence, stature, fresh ideas and energy to the university and his exit leaves a void that will be hard to fill," it added.The statement has been jointly issued by the university chancellor, vice-chancellor and the chairman of the Board of Trustees, along with Mehta and Subramanian."Pratap and Arvind would like to emphasize that Ashoka University is one of the most important projects in Indian higher education. They are sad to be leaving Ashoka, especially its outstanding students and faculty. They continue to believe strongly that Ashoka University should embody a liberal vision and commitment to academic freedom and autonomy. "And they remain lifelong friends and well-wishers of the institution and are committed to its success wherever they are," the statement said, adding that the two professors will remain "available for advice and consultation to the university in the future".The students have called for a two-day boycott of classes from Monday in protest over the developments. Mehta, however, said he wants to close this chapter."The underlying circumstances that led to the resignation will not change for the foreseeable future, in my case, at any rate. So I must close this chapter. I urge you not to press on this matter. I know you will be disappointed. But if I may exercise one last bit of professorial discretion: your mission is larger than the fate of two Professors,” Mehta said in his letter addressed to the students."The poise and articulacy with which your defended important values and demanded accountability should make anyone want to associate with this university. You are its beating heart and soul and nothing can damage that," he said."Second, it is not for me to intercede in this matter. But I imagine your voice will, in the long run make Ashoka a better university and get it to recommit to its ideals and values. So your outpouring is already a victory of sorts. You have taught us by example, what we were badly trying to teach you by lectures," he added.Chancellor says founders never interfered         Meanwhile, Ashoka University Chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee has said the institution remains committed to academic freedom and intellectual independence, and its founders have never interfered with academic freedom.Days after Mehta chose to step down as professor, Mukherjee wrote to faculty and students clearing the air.“Today when the Founders are being attacked for trying to compromise and curtail academic autonomy and freedom of expression, I find it necessary as Chancellor and given my association with Ashoka from its inception, to state unambiguously that the Founders have never interfered with academic freedom: faculty members have been left free to construct their own courses, follow their own methods of teaching and their own methods of assessment,” he wrote.They, he said, have also been left free to carry out their own research and publications.“There are only two points that the Founders have insisted upon. One, that Ashoka should not compromise on intellectual standards; and two, that the Foundation Courses should be integral to Ashoka’s academic offering,” he wrote on March 20.
