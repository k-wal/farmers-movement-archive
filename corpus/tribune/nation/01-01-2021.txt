With its peak intensity on January 4 and 5, there is a possibility of heavy rain/snow over Jammu and Kashmir. Hailstorm at isolated places is also likely over western Himalayan region during this time," the IMD said.Minimum temperatures over the north Indian plains are between one to six degrees Celsius except at isolated places in  south Haryana and north Rajasthan where it is between zero to minus one degree Celsius."These are very likely to increase gradually by three to five degrees Celsius over these regions during the next three days and no significant change (is expected) thereafter for the subsequent three days," said the IMD."Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are prevailing over many parts of the plains of northwest India and adjoining central India. These are likely to continue over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during the next 24 hours and abate thereafter," it said.Dense to very dense fog in isolated pockets are likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and north Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours of January 2 and 3, and likely to abate thereafter, the IMD said.

Operations till 23 Jan will be restricted to 15 flights per week each for carriers of the two countries to and from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad only.”The Civil Aviation Ministry had last week suspended all flights between that country and India from December 23 to December 31 over the mutated variant of the virus. The suspension was further extended till January 7 to prevent the spread of a new strain of the virus, considered to be much more infectious.However, there was heavy demand from the air-passengers to resume operation between the two countries. Before the temporary suspension came into effect, over 60 flights a week were carrying almost 2,500 passengers a day.Airlines like Air India, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, and Vistara operated over 60 weekly flights between the two countries from Indian cities like Chenna, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Amritsar, apart from Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Currently, normal international scheduled commercial flights remain suspended at least till 31 January.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-uk-flights-to-resume-from-january-8-says-civil-aviation-minister-192300

The detailed order became available on Thursday.Judge LS Chavan noted in the order that Kangana, who owns three flats on the fifth floor of a 16-storey building in the Khar area of the city, merged them into one.In doing so, she covered the sunk area, duct area, common passage and converted free Floor Space Index (FSI) into habitable area, the judge observed."These are grave violation of the sanctioned plan for which the permission of the competent authority is required," the court said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had in March 2018 issued a notice to the actor for "unauthorised constructions" at her Khar flats.Another notice asked her to restore the structure to its original position as per the original plan, warning that otherwise the unauthorised portion would be demolished.Kangana challenged the demolition notice and also requested the court to restrain the civic body from carrying out demolition. The court had then ordered status-quo.In the latest order on December 23, Judge Chavan rejected the actor's application, saying the "interference of this court is not required".However, the court has given her six weeks to approach the Bombay High Court against the order.On September 9, the BMC had demolished parts of Kangana's bungalow in the Pali Hill area for alleged "unauthorised" construction. She moved the High Court against it.The High Court later termed the BMC's action as illegal and malicious.

There was no document/agreement in support of these payments made to Pravin Raut.”More to it as per the HDIL’s ledger, the funds were given to Pravin Raut for acquiring land in Palghar area, the official added.“Investigation also revealed that Pravin Raut paid an amount of Rs 1.6 crore to his wife Madhuri Pravin Raut from the proceeds of the crime and out of this money she transferred Rs 55 lakh on December 23, 2010 and Rs 5 lakh on March 15, 2011 as interest free loan to Varsha Raut, the wife of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut,” the ED said in a statement, while adding that the amount was further utilised for purchase of a flat in Dadar East, Mumbai.“The ED investigation also revealed that Varsha Sanjay Raut and Madhuri Pravin Raut are partners in M/s. Avani Construction. Varsha Sanjay Raut has received Rs 12 lakh from this entity (as overdrawn capital converted to loan) on a contribution of mere Rs 5,625. The loan amount of Rs 12 lakh still remains outstanding,” read the statement.Investigation under the PMLA was initiated on the basis of an FIR registered by the Economic Offences wing of the Mumbai Police under various sections of the IPC against HDIL, Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Sarang Wadhawan, Waryam Singh, Joy Thomas (Chairman and Managing Director of PMC bank Ltd.) and others for causing loss to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore to PMC Bank and corresponding gain to themselves.Earlier, the ED had attached several properties of Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Wadhawan Family trust and others totaling to Rs 293 crore and jewelry worth Rs 63 crore.A prosecution complaint has been filed in the case against Wadhawan and others for the offence of money laundering under the PMLA, said the agency officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-72-crore-of-pravin-raut-in-pmc-bank-loan-cheating-case-192297
01-01-2021||New Delhi||Will take firm steps if January 4 talks fail, say farmer unions||Upping the ante ahead of the next round of talks, farmer unions on Friday warned that they will start shutting all malls and petrol pumps in Haryana if the government fails to resolve their main demands for the repeal of three new farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP in the January 4 meeting.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border protest site, representatives of farmer unions said that only five per cent of the issues raised by them have so far been discussed in meetings with the government.They outlined multiple protest actions over a month if their main demands are not met, in an announcement a few days before Republic Day celebrations.Farmer leader Yudhveer Singh said if the central government thinks the farmers’ protest will go the Shaheen Bagh way, then it is mistaken. “They (government) cannot make us leave this place like they did in Shaheen Bagh,” he said.Hundreds of protesters had camped at Shaheen Bagh for several months against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and later, the site was cleared by the Delhi Police following the coronavirus-induced lockdown in March last year.At the press conference, farmer leaders made it clear that they will have to take firm steps if the government does not take a decision in their favour in the January 4 meeting.Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav said that the government has not moved an inch on the two main issues—repeal of three agri laws and legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP).He claimed that the government has denied giving in-principle commitment to the issue of legal guarantee for MSP.Spelling out their next course of action, Yadav said that while talks with the Union government will go on, farmer unions will intensify the protest simultaneously and take it to every corner of the country.“If the January 4 meeting with the government fails to end the deadlock, we will announce dates for shutting all malls, petrol pumps in Haryana,” another farmer leader, Vikas, told reporters.At a meeting of Samkyukt Kisan Morcha—an umbrella body of around 40 farmer unions protesting at several Delhi border points—several decisions were taken.According to the unions, if the results of the talks on January 4 are not satisfactory, a tractor march will be taken out from the protest site to the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway on January 6 and a call will also be given to those farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border to move towards the national capital.Rallies, dharnas, sit-ins and press conferences will be ogranised across the country from January 6 to January 20 to counter alleged government propaganda that the protest was Punjab-centric.Farmers will celebrate Women’s Day on January 18 and the modalities will be discussed later, farmer leaders said, adding that programmes will be held on to mark birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose on January 23.After the sixth round of formal negotiations on Wednesday, the government and farm unions reached some common ground to resolve protesting farmers’ concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.After the talks between three union ministers and a 41-member representative group of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi borders, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said at least 50 per cent resolution has been reached with mutual agreement on two out of four items on the agenda and discussions would continue on the remaining two on January 4 at 2 PM.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against these three new laws.The government has presented these laws as major agriculture reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income, but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations have left them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the MSP and mandi systems.

01-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Another Adhikari joins BJP in West Bengal||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, January 1The New Year, while holding out hope for the Covid-ravaged world, started on a disappointing note for West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) as another member of Kanthi’s influential Adhikari family left the party on Friday and joined BJP.Soumendu Adhikari, who was recently removed from the post of administrator of the Kanthi Municipality by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, joined the BJP on Friday following the footsteps of his elder brother Suvendu Adhikari.Soumendu, who was the chairman of the municipality, was appointed administrator by the state government after the expiry of the term of the committee.Fourteen others, who were councillors of the municipality having a total strength of 21, also joined BJP along with Soumendu in a meeting convened by the senior Adhikari.Suvendu, who was the Transport Minister in the Mamata cabinet and also a former Lok Sabha member, was welcomed to BJP by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on his visit to the state last month.Differences with Abhishek Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and political heir, apparently prompted Suvendu to part ways with the TMC.With Soumendu joining the BJP, the Adhikari family has split into two halves between TMC and BJP. While Suvendu and Soumendu have embraced the saffron party, their father Sisir Adhikari and brother Dibyedu Adhikari, both TMC Lok Sabha members, have continued to cling to their old affiliation with the Mamata Banerjee-led party.Suvendu, who played a key role in the agitation against forcible acquisition of arable land in West Bengal which propelled Mamata Banerjee to power, was challenged by TMC leaders Saugata Roy and Firhad Hakim to get any of his family members to join BJP.While Soumendu, who has challenged in the court his unceremonious removal from the post of administrator of the Kanthi Mnicipality, joined the BJP, the saffron party is also hopeful of roping in the family patriarch Sisir Adhikari.The TMC on Thursday showed faith in Dibyendu Adhikari, Lok Sabha member from Tamlook and elder brother of Suvendu, by appointing him as a member of the Board in the Haldia Development Committee.The Haldia Development Committee oversees developmental works in the industrial town of Haldia and its adjoining areas in East Midnapore district.Addressing the crowd at the joining ceremony of his brother Soumendu and the elected councillors, Suvendu attacked the TMC for calling him a traitor.“People of Midnapore, where giants such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was born, are not traitors,” Suvendu said and appealed to the people to avenge the affront.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-adhikari-joins-bjp-in-west-bengal-192279

01-01-2021||New Delhi||India calls for urgent assistance for 39 Indian sailors on board two ships in Chinese waters||India on Friday called for "urgent, practical and time-bound" assistance to 39 stranded Indian sailors on board two ships in Chinese waters considering the "grave" humanitarian situation developing in the vessels.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Indian bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand has been on anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province of China since June 13 and it has 23 Indian sailors.Another vessel, MV Anastasia, with 16 Indian nationals as its crew is on anchorage near Caofeidian port in China since September 20, he said.Srivastava said both these vessels have been waiting for discharge of their cargo and there is a growing stress on the crew members on account of the long delay."Given this and our concern for the increasingly difficult conditions for our crew members, these two cases are being pursued vigorously," he said responding to a media query on the matter.Srivastava said the Indian Embassy in Beijing continued to remain in close and continuous touch with the Chinese authorities in Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin, adding the MEA is also following up on the matter through the Chinese Embassy here for "an early resolution"."We have noted the statements of the Chinese side, expressing their willingness to extend their assistance in this matter. We expect that this assistance will be provided in an urgent, practical and time-bound manner, given the grave humanitarian situation that is developing on board the ships," Srivastava said.He said the Indian Embassy has repeatedly taken up the issue with both the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs and the local provincial authorities, requesting that the ships be allowed to dock and/or the crew be allowed to be changed."They have been following up this matter for the last few months. The Indian Ambassador has personally taken up this issue with the Vice Foreign Minister. The Ministry has also been following this issue with the Chinese Embassy," Srivastava said.He said the Chinese authorities have conveyed that on account of various COVID-19-related restrictions imposed by the local authorities, change of crew is not being permitted from these ports."While the shipping companies are examining the logistics of sailing the ships away from their current points of anchorage, our embassy is liaising with relevant authorities in Tianjin for berthing approvals to facilitate the crew change," Srivastava said.He said the shipping companies have been requested to ensure that they submit their plans for crew change at the earliest for approvals by the local Chinese authorities."We also understand that MV Anastasia is exploring the possibility of a crew change at sea at its current point of anchorage in Caofeidian. Our Embassy has yesterday written to Chinese authorities proposing this alternative and sought approval for the same," he said.NHRC notice to MEA secy, DG Shipping The National Human Rights Commission has issued notices to an MEA secretary and the director general of Shipping in the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways over the issue, officials said on Friday.The NHRC has given them two weeks to submit a report on the action taken in the case. Taking suo motu congnisance of reports regarding difficulties of the seafarers  "without any rescue mission in sight" , the Commission observed that they amount to violation of human rights.In a communique, the Commission said it expects that the MEA may take up the issue with the authorities, through Indian Embassy in People’s Republic of China, so as to ensure immediate relief and security of the stranded  seafarers with "promptitude".Issuing the notices, it observed that the reports give a very sordid picture of lack of promptness from the side of the authorities to return back to the country."This has resulted in unfathomable anxiety and uncertainty on their release or discharge from the Chinese waters," the commission said. It observed that "prima facie, it appears that the rights to life, dignity, equality and liberty of Indian seafarers have been trampled down by a Member nation of United Nations in derogation of international human rights law and International Covenants applicable in the field of human rights". --- With agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-calls-for-urgent-assistance-for-39-indian-sailors-on-board-two-ships-in-chinese-waters-192272
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Nobody can question Mumbai Police’s efficiency: Maharashtra Chief Minister||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday praised the Mumbai Police saying nobody can raise question marks over their efficiency, and added that he would never allow anyone malign their image.He also said that the police force led from the front during the coronvirus pandemic in order to ensure the safety of common man.Thackeray was speaking during a programme held at the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s office here, in which people were returned their belongings that were recovered by the police following thefts.“There is no end to the accomplishments of the Mumbai Police and the tradition of policing dates back to 150 years.With this long tradition and their efficiency, no matter how much one tries, he will not be able to malign their image and I promise that if anyone attempts to do so, I will not allow that to happen,” he said.“The mouths of those who tried to defame the Mumbai police were shut as the police’s accomplishments are huge,” he said, a reference to Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut.Controversy’s child Ranaut had kicked up a storm last year when she said she feared Mumbai Police more than the movie mafia, irking Thackeray’s Shiv Sena and sparking a prolonged feud between the two sides.“During the pandemic, police worked hard, due to which thousands of these personnel contracted the infection, with some of them getting martyred in the line of duty,” he said.It is only because of police and other frontline workers that the COVID-19 situation came under control, the CM said.“During the lockdown, we had asked everyone to work from home. But imagine what would have happened if the police were also allowed to do so,” Thackeray said.“The threat of COVID-19 still persists. The pandemic is far from over yet. But some people criticise us for keeping some places shut. People should at least understand their responsibility while police, doctors, nurses are performing their duty in such difficult times,” he added.Citizens can celebrate their festivals only because of the police, who remain alert all the time and keep the common man safe, he said.During the programme, the CM felicitated some COVID-19 warrior police personnel.

As such, I am of the considered opinion that applicants are also entitled for grant of bail in the matter on the ground of parity because role assigned to them is on same/identical footing as the co-accused persons.“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case in totality, both the applicants namely Kasif and Wasif are admitted to bail in the matter...,” the judge said in his order passed on December 24.The court directed the accused not to tamper with evidence and to install “Aarogya Setu” app on their mobile phones.Advocate Nasir Ali, appearing for both the accused, had said they had been falsely implicated in the matter and sought bail on the ground of parity.Special Public Prosecutor D K Bhatia, appearing for the police, had opposed the bail pleas saying both the accused were allegedly involved in several cases of rioting in the area and may threaten the witnesses in the cases if released on bail.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashesbetween citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-two-men-192264

This necessitates putting in place efficient cross-border procedures for speedy evacuation of the vaccines,” it said.Importers have been advised to indicate the unique identifier of the container and the accessories during import in the Courier Bill of Entry (CBE-V) and also at the time of re-export in the Courier Shipping Bill (CSB IV) for facilitating clearance. The CBIC, in a letter to field offices, has said since multiple stakeholders will be involved in the process of clearance of the vaccines, effective coordination among the stakeholders would be necessary.It also asked for setting up of a task force, headed by a Joint/Additional Commissioner of Customs rank officer and comprising relevant stakeholders, for a coordinated approach for efficient clearance of vaccines relating to Covid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-lifts-all-import-export-curbs-on-covid-vaccine-192263
01-01-2021||United Nations||India set to begin its two-year tenure as non-permanent member of UNSC||India, which has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the UN Security Council, will begin its two-year tenure as a non-permanent member of the powerful organ of the world body on Friday.India will sit in the 15-nation United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the 2021-22 term as a non-permanent member—the eighth time that the country has had a seat on the powerful horseshoe table.On Friday, India, Norway, Kenya, Ireland and Mexico will join non-permanent members Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam and the five permanent members China, France, Russia, UK and the US.India will be UNSC President in August 2021 and will preside over the council again for a month in 2022.The presidency of the council is held by each of the members in turn for one month, following the English alphabetical order of the Member States' names."As the largest democracy…we will be promoting very fundamental values like democracy, human rights and development," India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti told PTI.India's message will also be to ensure "how do we let diversity flourish in a united framework, which is in many ways the United Nations itself. This is something which India as a country, as what it stands for, will take to the council.Tirumurti said India will "definitely" emphasise a greater need for cooperation in the council, which should not be a place where because of any paralysis of decision making, urgent requirements do not get properly focused."We would like to have a more cooperative structure in which we genuinely look out and find solutions and go beyond the rhetoric," the envoy said.India will also underscore the importance of respect for rule of law and international law."The current multilateralism is not factoring in multipolarity. When you have a structure, which is able to accommodate the multipolarity in a multilateral framework, then automatically (there is) a more responsive, more rule-bound and more inclusive process," he said, adding that this will lead to reform in the multilateral system."Broadly these are some of the messages which we will carry in various degrees…We will be a country which will reinforce multilateralism. That would be the biggest strength of India in many ways when it gets into the Security Council," he said.Tirumurti has outlined counter-terrorism, peacekeeping, maritime security, reformed multilateralism, technology for the people, women and youth and developmental issues, especially in the context of peace-building, as India's priorities for the UNSC tenure."I feel India's presence in the Security Council is needed at this juncture when there are deep fissures between P-5 themselves and also between other countries. The UN is losing coherence and we hope to bring this back by focusing on issues of priority to all Member States," Tirumurti said.India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the council, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century.On the long-delayed UNSC reforms, Tirumurti criticised the lack of progress and said that hardly anything has happened in the last decade."Not a single thing has moved. Is this the type of process we want or can we collectively come to a slightly better process which will yield results," he said.He underlined that it was time for a "genuine process" wherein Member States work with a single text for negotiations.Tirumurti also said that in the last few months, he has tried to define India's interests a "bit more sharply", including on the question of terrorism."We have said that let us pursue terrorism with a single-minded determination and not start giving excuses and justifications for these," the Indian envoy said.India will also look at very specific issues which are on the agenda of the council, relating to countries, specific topics, he said."What will happen is that the trend of the last few months of trying to define our interests a bit more sharply will continue as we go into the UNSC," he said.Tirumurti has emphasised that in the Security Council, India will be a strong voice for the developing world.He cited the example of issues related to Africa, including peacekeeping mandates, and said that India has always maintained that Africa should have a say in decisions pertaining to it and not have other countries alone decide.Similarly, "if Afghanistan wants a peace process, let Afghanistan have a say in it. We will be a country which will stand up for developing countries," he said.Addressing the virtual high-level General Assembly session in September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that as a Security Council member, India will not hesitate to raise its voice against the enemies of humanity, including terrorism, and will always speak in support of peace, security and prosperity.Modi had also asserted that reform in the responses, processes and in the very character of the United Nations was the "need of the hour” as he questioned that for how long will India, the world's largest democracy and home to 1.3 billion people, be kept out of the decision-making structures of the UN.India, the endorsed candidate from the Asia-Pacific States, won 184 votes out of the 192 ballots cast in the elections in June for the five non-permanent seats of the Security Council. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-set-to-begin-its-two-year-tenure-as-non-permanent-member-of-unsc-192257

But, it cannot give the feel and positivity provided by an actual classroom. Not just schools and classrooms, I really missed my teachers and friends," she said.But, the strict instruction of keeping distance from other students and admission of only one student in a bench made some students a tad unhappy.It was after a gap of nine months that the schools opened in the southern state, in compliance with strict COVID protocols.All these months, students were attending online classes through the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education's (KITE)- Victers channel.They were greeted with digital thermometers at the entrance of schools to measure their body temperature, which is mandatory as per the guidelines issued by the authorities.They were admitted into the school campus only after collecting consent letters from the parents.Schools in Kerala was remained closed since the coronavirus-induced lockdown in March.A recent high-level meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had decided to reopen educational institutions, including schools and colleges, in adherence with COVID guidelines.In its guidelines, the General Education Department directed that only 50 per cent of students be allowed at a time in schools and that classes be arranged as one student per bench in the first week.It is better to allow 25 per cent of the students at a time in schools, where their strength exceeds 300 in number in classes 10 and 12, according to the guidelines issued by the Director of Public Instructions (DPI).In the detailed instructions given, authorities in Kerala have asked the school managements to ensure masks, sanitiser, digital thermometer and soaps in their institutions.Students should be asked to maintain a distance of two metres between each other and classes may be conducted in shifts of limited hours if necessary, it said.Articles in classes should be disinfected every two hours and children should be admitted in classes only with the consent of parents.As per the present plan, the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) and Higher Secondary (HSC) second year board exams would be held from March 17 to 30 in strict compliance with COVID protocols.Meanwhile, an official statement said here that a total of 1.75 lakh new students have taken admission in classes 1 to 10 in state-run schools this academic year in Kerala.

01-01-2021||Islamabad||India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations||Pakistan and India on Friday conducted the annual practice of exchanging the list of their nuclear installations under a bilateral arrangement that prohibits them from attacking each other's atomic facilities.The exchange was made in accordance with Article-II of the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India, signed on December 31, 1988, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement here.It said that “the list of nuclear installations and facilities in Pakistan was officially handed over to a representative of the Indian High Commission at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, at 1100 hrs (PST).”"The Indian Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi handed over the list of Indian Nuclear installations and facilities to a representative of the Pakistan High Commission at 1130 hrs (IST)," it added.The agreement contains the provision that both countries inform each other of their nuclear installations and facilities on January 1 every year.This has been done consecutively since January 1, 1992, according to the FO.The exchange of information comes despite the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.The relationship dipped after India's warplanes pounded a terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.Tensions between the two nations spiked further after New Delhi abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations with India and expelled the Indian high commissioner following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019.Asserting that the abrogation of Article 370 was its "internal matter", India has defended the imposition of restrictions in the Kashmir Valley on the grounds that they were put to prevent Pakistan from creating more mischief through proxies and terrorists. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-192250
01-01-2021||New Delhi||Modi lays foundation stone of Light House Projects in 6 states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the Light House Projects being executed with modern technologies in six states will show a new direction to the housing construction sector in the country and further strengthen cooperative federalism.Modi laid the foundation stone of six LHPs under the Global Housing Technology Challenge-India (GHTC-India) that, he said, has given a scope to innovate and incubate with new technology.The programme seeks to build over 1,000 houses each in six cities in 12 months.“These six projects will show a new direction to the housing construction in the country,” he said.Participation of states from northern, eastern, western and southern parts of the country in this campaign “is strengthening the feeling of our cooperative federalism further”, Modi said.Speaking at the event organised virtually, Modi said housing for the poor and the middle class has been a priority for his government.He said various measures taken by his government in the last six years has restored the confidence of the common man that he can own a house.Earlier, he said, people’s dream of having a house of their own was shaken as despite spending money they would often not get the promised home in time and were not sure of legal support, if needed. High interest rate was also a dampener, he added.Construction sector acts as a force multiplier for the economy, he noted and added that his government has taken a number of steps to boost the real estate sector and will continue to do so.Speaking of the Light House Projects, he said these will be made up of modern technology and innovative processes and reduce the construction time and make a more resilient, affordable and comfortable house for the poor.He said modern construction practices from countries like France, Germany and Canada will be put into practice.They will serve as incubation centres, he said, urging architects, planners, engineers and students to visit these projects.He said today, the country has chosen a different approach, adopting a different route and a better technology to complete the projects faster.He stressed the importance for the ministries not to have large and sluggish structures, but to be fit like startups.He expressed happiness on the active participation of more than 50 innovative construction companies from around the world. He said this global challenge has given us a scope to innovate and incubate with new technology.The prime minister also announced winners under the Affordable Sustainable Housing Accelerators - India (ASHA-India) and gave out annual awards for excellence in implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) Mission.During the event, he also released a certificate course on innovative construction technologies named ‘NAVARITIH’ (New, Affordable, Validated, Research Innovation Technologies for Indian Housing) and a compendium of 54 innovative housing construction technologies identified through GHTC-India.Besides the prime minister, the housing and urban affairs minister, chief ministers of Tripura, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh were present on the occasion.The Light House Projects (LHPs) showcase the best of new-age alternative global technologies, materials and processes in the construction sector for the first time in the country at such a large scale, the government has said.They are being constructed under GHTC-India which envisages to provide an ecosystem for adoption of innovative technologies in the housing construction sector in a holistic manner.The LHPs are being constructed at Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Rajkot (Gujarat), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Agartala (Tripura) and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh).They comprise about 1,000 houses at each location along with allied infrastructure facilities.Talking about its benefits for the middle classes, Modi said they are getting rebates on home loan interest.The prime minister also recounted the measures taken recently to help the real estate sector.Measures like reduction of tax on cheap houses from 8 to 1 percent, GST reduction from 12 to 5 per cent, recognising the sector as infrastructure for making it eligible for cheap loans have taken country’s ranking for construction permit from 185 to 27, he said, adding that procedure for construction permissions have been taken online in more than 2,000 towns.He also said that more than two crore housing units have been constructed in rural India and effort will be on to accelerate the speed of rural housing this year.Talking about new technologies being adopted for the six Light House Projects, he said that for example, the project in Indore will not have brick and mortar walls, instead they will use the prefabricated sandwich panel system.The light houses in Rajkot will be built using french technology and have monolithic concrete construction technology using tunnel and the house will be more capable of withstanding disasters, he said.In Chennai, US and Finland technologies will use the precast concrete system, which will construct the house faster and cheaper. In Ranchi, houses will be built using Germany’s 3D construction system. Each room will be made separately and then the entire structure will be added in the same way as Lego Blocks toys.

01-01-2021||New Delhi||Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine set to become first to get approval in India||An expert panel on COVID-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is set to recommend granting emergency use authorisation for the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, being manufactured by Serum Institute of India, sources said on Friday.The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has tied up with AstraZeneca to manufacture Covishield.The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on Wednesday had approved the COVID-19 vaccine developed by scientists at Oxford University and produced by AstraZeneca for human use.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 of the CDSCO, which had earlier sought additional safety and immunogenicity data from SII, deliberated on its application seeking emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the shots on Wednesday, and met again on Friday to review the matter.After SII’s application, the SEC has started reviewing the EUA application by Bharat Biotech for its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin but is yet to take a final decision on the matter, sources said.“In terms of safety, Covishield was well tolerated with respect to solicited adverse events...majority of solicited reactions were mild in severity and resolved without any sequelae.“Therefore, Covishield is safe and can be used effectively for prevention of COVID-19 in the targeted population. Thus, the benefit to risk ratio strongly supports the widespread use of Covishield,” the EUA application signed by Prakash Kumar Singh, Additional Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute of India (SII), had stated.SII had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for EUA for Oxford COVID-19 vaccine on December 6, while the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech had sought the nod for its indigenously developed Covaxin on December 7.Pfizer had applied for regulatory approval for its vaccine on December 4.

01-01-2021||Kollam||From part-time sweeper to panchayat prez, a rise thanks to democracy||When A Anandavalli entered the Pathanapuram Block Panchayat in Kerala nearly a decade ago as a part-time sweeper, she would never have dreamt she would rise to head the local body one day.Symbolising empowerment of oppressed classes, the 46-year-old CPI(M) member belonging to scheduled caste has become the president of the Panchayat after the recent local body elections."I never thought that I would occupy such a high post, that too in an office where I had been doing a part-time sweeper's job," Anandavalli, a mother of two, said.The CPI(M)-led LDF, which won the majority of the seats in the recently held civic polls, proposed her name for the Pathanapuram block panchayat president's post.Fielded by CPI(M), Anandavalli had won the SC general seat with a comfortable margin from the Thalavoor division in the polls.In the 13-member block panchayat, the LDF won seven seats while the main opposition, the Congress-led UDF got six.After being elected as the LDF leader in the council, she took charge as the president on December 30.The president's post was reserved for SC/woman."My villagers are very happy," she said when asked about the response from the family, friends and locals about her achievement.Anandavalli belongs to a CPI(M) family.Her husband Mohanan is a local committee member of the party.She said all officials in the block office, whom she used to serve tea till last week, were also "very happy" to see her take up the top post of the block panchayat."They all had encouraged me to contest the elections.I was a bit reluctant then. It was because of their persuasion, I decided to fight the election. They all supported me," said Anandavalli, who is a branch committee member of the CPI(M).Anandavalli said her focus now is to pick up the basics of administration and serve the people better.When she worked as a part-time sweeper, she used to do the job of an attendant also.She used to enter the hall where project review meetings were held to serve tea and water for the then president, officials and council members."I used to listen to the points being raised by the members during the review meeting then. I had a lot of ideas about it. Now, I will study everything-- from the official procedures to the necessary paperwork," she said.Anandavalli, who studied up to pre-degree, said she would be able to do justice to the post with the help of her party colleagues and the officials."I hope I will be able to do good work for the people who elected us. That is my only prayer," she said.Anandavalli joined the panchayat office as a part-time sweeper in 2011.She used to draw a meagre Rs 2,000 till 2017. It was hiked to Rs 6,000 later.

01-01-2021||New Delhi||Protesting farmers stay put in severe Delhi cold as stalemate continues||Thousands of farmers dug in their heels at protest venues outside several Delhi gateways, undeterred by the biting cold and firm in their resolve to not return home till their demands are met, as the New Year dawned with the minimum temperature dipping to 1.1 degrees Celsius.The government and the farm unions had reached some common ground on Wednesday to resolve the protesting farmers' concerns over the rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.After the sixth round of negotiations between three union ministers and a 41-member representative group of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi borders, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said at least 50 per cent resolution has been reached with mutual agreement on two out of four items on the agenda and discussions would continue on the remaining two on January 4.Security remained tight at the national capital's borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border points, where the farmers have been camping for more than a month now, braving the severe Delhi winter.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 1.1 degrees Celsius on Friday, the lowest in 15 years for the month of January.Meanwhile, the Samkyukt Kisan Morcha is likely to meet during the day to discuss its next course of action.There is, however, no question of withdrawing from the two issues which are legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) and repealing of the farm laws, senior farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni has said."The government has addressed our demands to drop penal provisions against farmers in an ordinance relating to stubble burning and to put on hold a proposed electricity amendment law," he said.The sixth round of talks was originally scheduled for December 9, but it was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah. Tribune Photo: Manas Ranjan Bhui."But, we want to make it clear that there is no alternative to our two remaining demands which include repeal of the three agriculture laws and legal guarantee for MSP," Chaduni added.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the protesting farm unions, has issued a statement saying the Centre's appeal to farmer leaders to suggest an alternative to repeal of the laws is impossible."The new laws will hand over control of agriculture markets, farmers' land and food chain to corporates," it added.The sixth round of talks was originally scheduled for December 9, but it was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough. The protests have also led to traffic congestions, forcing the police to divert vehicular movement.Taking to Twitter on Friday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed owing to the agitation and suggested them to take alternative roads."Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement. Jhatikara Borders is open only for LMV (Cars/ Light Motor Vehicles), two-wheelers and pedestrian movement," it tweeted."The Chilla and Ghazipur Borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Apsara, Bhopra & Loni Borders."Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli & Mangesh borders closed. Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44," it said in a series of tweets."Available Open Borders to Haryana are Jharoda (Only Single Carriageway/Road), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders," the Delhi Traffic Police said in another tweet.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middleman and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers.In Jind, 14 khap panchayats adopted resolutions to boycott BJP Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assembly. They have also decided to boycott BJP's public meetings, and said they would hold up black flags to BJP lawmakers visiiting the district.  They also called for a boycott of products made by the Ambani and Adani Groups, as well as Patanjali. — TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protesting-farmers-stay-put-in-severe-delhi-cold-as-stalemate-continues-192232
01-01-2021||Lucknow||Probe ordered into Pakistani woman working as village head in UP||An inquiry has been ordered after a 65-year-old Pakistani woman was found running the affairs of a village panchayat as its interim head in Etah district.Investigations were afoot to find out how she got the Aadhaar, voter ID and other documents while staying on a long-term visa.An FIR has also been lodged against her.According to reports, Bano Begum, a resident of Karachi, Pakistan came to India 35 years ago at her relative's home in Etah. Later, she got married to an Indian, Akhtar Ali.Since then, she had been staying in Etah on a long-term visa, and had applied for Indian citizenship on several occasions.During 2015 local body elections, Bano managed to get elected as a member of Guadau gram panchayat. Five years later, on January 9 last year, the pradhan, Shehnaz Begum, passed away and after a few days, Bano took over as interim pradhan on the recommendation of the village committee.According to sources, the matter came to the fore after a villager, Quwaidan Khan, filed a complaint saying that Bano is a Pakistani national.Though Bano resigned from the post, the District Panchayat Raj Officer (DPRO) Alok Priyadarshi raised the matter with Etah District Magistrate Sukhlal Bharti, who ordered an FIR and a probe.Alok Priyadarshi said, "Investigation on the basis of a complaint received against Bano Begum found that she is a Pakistan national. She got an Aadhaar card and voter ID made on her name by fraudulent means." He said that the recommendation to appoint Bano as head of the village committee and designating her as interim Pradhan was made by village secretary Dhyanpal Singh. He has been removed from the post.District Magistrate Bharti said, "Orders have been issued to investigate how she managed to get an Aadhaar card and other documents for contesting election to become gram panchayat member. Strict action will be taken against those found guilty of helping her." --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/probe-ordered-into-pakistani-woman-working-as-village-head-in-up-192230

01-01-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow man resorts to barbecue protest to grill MC over 'mounting' garbage pile||In a seemingly weird manner of protest, a resident of the Indira Nagar locality in Lucknow, actually hauled the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) over the garbage, instead of the proverbial coals.The resident, Ashutosh Singh, 32, set up a portable barbeque grill, using garbage as fuel, outside his house.He was protesting against the mounting pile of garbage that had not been removed despite pleas to the local municipal authorities.He then grilled cottage cheese and vegetables and served them to friends with tea. The protest continued for three hours on Thursday afternoon.A passer-by shot a video of the act and made it viral.Ashutosh later told reporters, "People here throw garbage in open because door-to-door garbage collection is very poor here. We wake up every day only to see garbage piles all around and are forced to bear the stench. Our complaints to the municipal officials have failed to elicit any response."The local residents supported Ashutosh in his protest and said that there would be more such 'unusual 'protests' if the area was not cleared up.The state capital had witnessed a similar protest in November last year, when a college student stood at a garbage dump near City Station all day. Authorities swung into action after his video went viral.Meanwhile, when contacted, a zonal municipal official, Vidya Sagar Yadav, said, "We will take action against the private agency hired to ensure household garbage collection in the area. The garbage pile will also be cleaned up within two days." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lucknow-man-resorts-to-barbecue-protest-to-grill%C2%A0mc-over-mounting-garbage-pile-192216

We will learn more about this through effectiveness studies currently being designed by the WHO and of which India hopefully will be a part,” Kang said today.

These things have in no way impacted,” Yediyurappa said in response to a question on talks about leadership change and its impact on administration.He said after BJP general secretary in charge of the state Arun Singh made it clear that there are no issues for the next two-and-half years and Yediyurappa will continue as Chief Minister, such questions do not arise at all. There has been speculation in some quarters that the BJP high command is mulling leadership change in Karnataka in the days to come considering Yediyurappa’s age (77 years). —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-remain-at-helm-till-term-ends-karnataka-cm-192037

A crucial meeting to consider clearance for candidates of the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech is scheduled for Friday.5 more infected with mutant virusFive more UK returnees have tested positive for the new variant genome of SARS-CoV-2, taking the total number of mutant-infected flyers to 25, the Union Health Ministry said. “All are in physical isolation,” it said.“We will probably have a happy New Year with something in hand,” VG Somani, Drug Controller General of India said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also hinted at quick possibility of vaccines on a day when the government announced a pan-India dry run in all states on January 2 to test rollout preparedness.Recovery highest at 96 %India’s recovery rate on Thursday touched 96.04 per cent with 98,60,280 recoveries of the total 1,02,66,674 confirmed cases. There were 21,822 cases and 26,139 recoveries in the past 24 hours.“Preparations are in final stages to take the indigenous vaccine to every nook and corner of the country. Just like 2020 was about preventing infections, 2021 will be about India making the largest vaccination drive successful,” PM Modi said during the virtual foundation stone-laying ceremony for AIIMS-Rajkot.The national drug regulator, meanwhile, clarified that the clearance of a vaccine by one country did not automatically qualify it for another. The UK had yesterday approved Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.“We have our own rigorous scrutiny and won’t compromise on safety and efficacy,” Somani said. About the UK mutant strain’s impact on vaccine efficacy, Somani said: “We may not have to repeat the entire process. We could cut it short with few additional chemical studies. The matter would need wider deliberations.” “Minor mutations will not impact the vaccines. But if these mutations keep accumulating, there may be a slightly different story. That won’t happen unless many vaccines are rolled out together and there is vaccine-induced pressure on the virus,” says leading virologist Shahid Jameel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expect-some-good-news-soon-dcgi-on-vaccine-192001

Its only loss was to Japan in the early 90s.“Not a single thing has moved. Is this the type of the process we want or can we collectively come to a slightly better process which will yield results?’’ asked TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, about India’s aspiration to become a permanent member. “We will be a country which will reinforce multilateralism. We will like to have a more cooperative structure in which we genuinely look out and find solutions and go beyond the rhetoric,’’ he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan to convert India’s non-permanent presence at the UNSC from 2021 to 2022 into a permanent membership is in disarray due to hostilities with China and a quasi-estrangement with Russia.“The current multilateralism is not factoring in multipolarity. When you have a structure, which is able to accommodate the multipolarity, then automatically (there is) a more responsive, more rule-bound and more inclusive process,” he said.Tirumurti also said India would play a balancing role at a time when the five permanent members were badly divided. “The UN is losing coherence and we hope to bring this back by focusing on issues of priority,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-focus-on-multipolarity-at-un-192008

He was 87 years of age and one of the most respected mountaineers, who was awarded the Kirti Chakra, the second highest peace time gallantry award.It was in 1981 that Col Kumar surveyed each mountain pass atop the glacier and hoisted Indian flags. Three years after his report, the Indian Army captured the strategic icy frontier. It was he who, following a secret expedition, had made a report on strategic importance of Siachen which had prompted then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to okay operation Meghdoot on April 13, 1984. The glacier was captured as Indian troops raced to hold the ridgeline beating Pakistan Army to the top.The 109-km actual ground position line (AGPL) that separates India and Pakistan on the glacier is the result of Col Kumar’s mountaineering expedition.Born in Rawalpindi, now in Pakistan, Col Kumar was commissioned into the Kumoan regiment. The Army had named the launch base of the expedition as “Kumar base”, a rare honour for serving officer.
