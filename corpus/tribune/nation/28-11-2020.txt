I accordingly deny consent,” Venugopal said in his November 8 letter addressed to advocate Sunil Singh which became public on Saturday.Singh, a Supreme Court lawyer, had sought the Attorney General’s consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Bhushan for a tweet connecting “the personal life of CJI SA Bobde with a pending case before him.”On November 12, Venugopal had given his consent to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra for his tweets insinuating the Supreme Court after it gave bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case.Terming Kamra’s tweets as “highly objectionable”, Venugopal had said in his opinion it “constitutes criminal contempt of court.”Kamra’s tweets were not only in bad taste but clearly crossed the line between humour and contempt of court, said the Attorney General who has recently refused to give consent for initiating contempt of court proceedings against several persons, including Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ag-venugopal-declines-consent-to-initiate-contempt-proceedings-against-prashant-bhushan-177208
28-11-2020||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Shah's offer to protesting farmers: Move to designated site, talks can be early||Amid intense protests against the newly passed farm bills, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said his government was willing to hold talks with the protesters on their objections to the recently passed farm laws. Home Minister Amit Shah asked protesting farmers to clear roads and national highways, instead offering them Burari ground to hold their protests.In an appeal he issued through news agency ANI, he said Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar had called a meeting on December 3 to discuss their objections to the Bill, and asked farmers to move their protests to the ground where he said they would be permission to continue their protests against the central government’s farm laws. “The central government is willing to hold talks with you (farmers),” he said on Saturday. “I ask my farmer brothers who have been holding protests at national and state highways in the cold that the Delhi Police will offer you a ground to hold your protests. Please move there. You will be given the permission to protest, you can build a stage there to protest, you will have toilet facilities, water and security. Additionally, ambulances will be on standby there”."The central government will hold talks with you the very next day after you move to Burari,” he said.Shah's statement came as thousands of farmers continued to hold protests at the Tikri and Singhu interstate borders on Saturday.Farmers choose Jantar MantarBharatiya Kishan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) however rejected the offer, saying they would instead go to to Jantar Mantar.In a statement issued soon after, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) said that the home minister met BKU (Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan with the offer, which the latter turned down.“Joginder Singh Ugrahan announced to start indefinite protest at Jantar Mantar. He said that the protest will continue till our demands are met,” the statement said.“Ugrahan told that the caravan of protesters includes substantial number of women and youth. He added that despite the capacity to choke the national capital they plan to start indefinite protest at Jantar Mantar so that local residences suffer no inconvenience. He has given call to farmers and farm workers from all over India to join the protest,” it said.‘Talking is the only way’Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh urged the protesters to heed to Shah’s appeal.A press release from the chief minister’s office said that he thought it was in the “best interest of the farming community and the nation at large” and that it would pave way for talks.“Shah’s offer to advance talks with farmers from December 3, and his statement reflecting the Centre’s willingness to listen to the farmers was a welcome step,” the press statement quoted the chief minister as having said.‘Since the Home Minister had made it clear that the Government of India was ‘ready to deliberate on every problem and demand’ of the farmers, and would hold talks the day after the farmers shifted to the designated site in Delhi for their protest, the Kisan leaders should also move forward,” the chief minister said. “Only by sitting across the table can both sides come to a solution to the problem.” --- With agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shahs-offer-to-protesting-farmers-move-to-designated-site-talks-can-be-early-177205

28-11-2020||New Delhi||Applying for emergency use of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in two weeks: Serum Institute of India||The Serum Institute of India (SII) will seek emergency use authorisation for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in about two weeks.Adar Poonawalla, Founder and CEO, SII said on Saturday that SII is in the process of submitting the data for the clinical trials to the DCGI and will seek emergency use authorisation.He said there will be no delays in the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout as the trials are more than enough for establishing efficacy and it will not affect emergency use authorization in Europe and certainly not in India. There was a recent error in dosage during trials which AstraZeneca is trying to correct, as per reports."What we might have to do is trials for under 18 candidates. That is way all vaccines go. You first have to establish safety for adults and then go for studies on the impact on children," he added.Speaking after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the SII facility in Pune, Poonawalla said PM Modi discussed in detail the vaccination scenario and reviewed the vaccine production status."Had a good interaction with the team at Serum Institute of India. They shared details about their progress so far on how they plan to further ramp up vaccine manufacturing. Also took a look at their manufacturing facility," PM Modi said in a tweet.He said 50-60 per cent of the world's vaccines are made in India and with Atmanirbhar Bharat in mind, SII today showcased the largest pandemic facility at their facility in in Pune.He added that the implementation plan for AstraZeneca and Oxford vaccines, Covishield will be clear only after emergency use authorisation is received. SII is in the process of submitting to DCGI. There are plans to roll out hundreds of millions of doses in the second quarter but only after all regulatory approvals are received.He said so many different vaccines were discussed with PM Modi and their logistical and pricing issues. As of now, there is nothing in writing from the Indian government but Health Ministry has announced a target of 300-400 million doses by July 2021, which SII is scaling up for, he added.SII is in the process of applying of emergency use licence in two weeks. It will be distributed in India initially and then the Covax countries of Africa. On the other vaccine, Novavax, where SII has a tie up, Poonawalla said it is two months behind Astrazeneca and the same process will be followed in terms of trials and approvals.The third one, Codagenics is way behind and will take at least a year to get into licence stage. It is only starting stage 1 trials in UK in December so that will take a year, Poonawalla said.He said both these vaccines can be stored at temperatures of 2-8 celsius for which India has a lot of capacity. He said that for vaccines which much lower temperatures India's capacity for storage is negligible.SII is currently producing 50-60 million doses a month which by January-February will be scaled up to 100 million doses a month.Issues about how to distribute and where to distribute the vaccine will become clear after the vaccine gets emergency use authorisation which will take a few weeks to happen, Poonawalla added.He added that a delayed approval in UK does not have much impact as stock piling and manufacturing is going on and a delay of a couple of weeks will not make much impact.The AstraZeneca vaccine has shown zero hospitalisation and reduced the virus by 60 per cent. So those who got infected were not passing it on and there was no severe attack of coronavirus requiring hospitalisation.

A larger ground must be provided and necessary arrangements must be made for their stay and food, they said.In a separate move, AAP asked the Union Government to initiate talks with the farmers to address their concerns forthwith."The government has already delayed in opening talks with the agitating farmers," said AAP Haryana in-charge Sushil Gupta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-parties-ask-centre-to-provide-place-to-farmers-in-national-capital-to-protest-177183

The ED has demeaned itself into (sic) an institution which engages in politically motivated interference,” Isaac told the media.He reiterated his earlier allegation that the ED was leaking select details to the media and his claim on the message sent by the officials to the media was not denied by the agency.The CAG had submitted a report to the assembly suggesting that the KIIFB’s borrowing model was unconstitutional.Isaac had earlier described as one-sided the CAG finding that the state-run investment fund board’s borrowing model was unconstitutional.KIIFB is the primary agency of the state government for financing large and critical infrastructure projects and had last year raised Rs 2,150 crore through its debut masala bond issue as part of its plan to mobilise Rs 50,000 crore to fund large and critical infrastructure projects in the southern state. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kiifb-row-%C2%A0kerala-finance-minister-hits-out-at-ed-177182

At present, there are around 200 of them. They are sitting at UP Gate,” said Jasmeet Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Police (East).Amid heavy police presence, thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri border points for the third consecutive day on Saturday even after being offered a north Delhi ground to hold peaceful demonstrations.Numbers swelled at the Singhu border point as farmers gathered there were joined by more protesters and they refused to move towards the Sant Nirankari Ground.After a meeting at the Singhu Border, a farmer leader said they would continue their protest there.“We will not move from here (Singhu Border) and continue our fight. We will not return home. Thousands of farmers have come from Punjab and Haryana to join the protest,” he said.Farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.The Centre has invited several Punjab farmer organisations for another round of talks in Delhi on December.

28-11-2020||---||Chirag downplays BJP fielding Sushil Modi for seat won by Ram Vilas Paswan||Patna, November 28Cold-shouldered by the BJP in the by-election to a Rajya Sabha seat in Bihar, LJP president Chirag Paswan said on Saturday that it belonged to the saffron party and it was free to take a decision about whom to field.The seat had fallen vacant following the death of Chirag Paswan’s father and Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan. The BJP has nominated former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi for the seat.Sushil Modi is likely to win uncontested unless the opposition Grand Alliance fields a candidate to challenge him.In that event, the polling will take place on December 14.A union minister, Ram Vilas Paswan had got elected from the seat last year after it fell vacant following his cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad’s election to the Lok Sabha from Patna Sahib.“The seat belonged to the BJP and it is for the party to decide which candidate from which party to field in the by-election,” the 37-year-old leader told reporters at a function held to celebrate his party’s 20th foundation day.Chastened by the drubbing in the recent Bihar elections, Chirag Paswan asked the party rank and file to gear up for the next assembly polls which could take place “any time”.He reiterated it in a letter addressed to LJP workers and shared with the media.Responding to questions, Paswan maintained that he saw “fresh elections taking place any time in Bihar, given the way the new government is functioning”.In a written message to party workers, Paswan defended his decision to go solo in the assembly polls, saying, “We had to make a choice between accepting the NDA’s offer of only 15 seats despite being a party with six members in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha, or engage in a friendly fight to preserve our honour”.In the one-page letter, Paswan refrained from making any remark against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the JD(U) boss whom he had targeted all through the elections and repeatedly accused of being unfair and brusque towards his late father while he was alive.The letter contained no reference to the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi to whom Paswan has proclaimed loyalty despite his steadfast support to Nitish Kumar.The Jamui MP also deplored the heated exchanges between the chief minister and Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav on the floor of the assembly on Friday and said both shared the blame for the unsavoury turn of events.“I would not like to take sides in this matter. From both sides many personal attacks were made. I do not think the discourse in Bihar assembly has ever touched such depths,” said Paswan.The LJP chief, under whose stewardship the party fought more than half of the seats in the 243-strong assembly but won only one, tried to perk up his supporters and asked them to focus on the bright side.“We could win only two seats in the previous assembly elections even though we had contested as part of the NDA.This time, we were alone, without an army of star campaigners to canvass in our favour. But we secured 28 lakh votes and now our party is being talked about across the state,” Paswan said in his letter.“It was the dream of the LJP founder, my late father, to help the party come of its own. We have taken a step in that direction. Let’s keep marching,” Paswan, who took over the party mantle from Paswan Sr a year ago, added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-downplays-bjp-fielding-sushil-modi-for-seat-won-by-ram-vilas-paswan-177175
28-11-2020||New Delhi||'Delhi Chalo' march: Cong hits out at govt; Rahul says PM should talk to farmers||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that a soldier was pitted against an old farmer due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “arrogance”.The Congress also said it would have been better if the Prime Minister talked to the protesting farmers instead of getting “himself photographed in corporate offices”.“This is a very sad photo. Our slogan was ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, but today a soldier is standing against the farmer due to PM Modi’s arrogance. This is very dangerous,” he said in a tweet in Hindi along with the picture of a soldier showing a baton to an old farmer.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana continued their protests against the new farm laws, with many of them blocking traffic on the national highway after the police stopped them from their ‘Chalo Delhi’ march.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Modi of getting pictures clicked in corporate offices while farmers are protesting on Delhi roads.“Wish the PM talks to farmers on the road instead of flying in the aircraft,” he said in a tweet, after Modi visited a company in Ahmedabad which is engaged in the COVID-19 vaccine research.Another spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi claimed whoever protests against the Modi government is “deemed a terrorist”.“Poor farmers from Punjab pointing out genuine grievances have been labelled khalistani. Why doesn’t Modi come out and address the Annadata however, only demands of them during elections,” he tweeted.Party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also tweeted similar pictures of farmers being prevented by the police from marching towards Delhi, where they wish to hold a protest against the new farm laws.She said it is right if the government frames laws against farmers, but it is wrong when farmers wish to make their voice heard in Delhi.“Look at the state of affairs in the BJP government. When super rich friends of the BJP come to Delhi, a red carpet is laid to welcome them, but the roads are being dug up when farmers wish to enter Delhi,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre’s new agri laws stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri border points for the third consecutive day on Saturday amid heavy police presence even after being offered a north Delhi ground to hold peaceful demonstrations.Numbers swelled at the Singhu border point as farmers gathered there were joined by more counterparts from Punjab and Haryana and they refused to move towards the Sant Nirankari Ground, one of the biggest in the national capital.

Please avoid outer ring road from Signature Bridge to Rohini and vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu border," it tweeted."We appeal to commuters to avoid travelling towards the Singhu and Tikri borders, Mukarba Chowk, NH-44, GT-Karnal Road and Outer Ring Road," Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Meenu Chaudhary said.With Saturday being a holiday for most office goers, the traffic situation in other parts is better than Friday, she said.On Friday, the Delhi Police curtailed movement at several places, including Dhansa, Jharoda Kalan, Tikri, Gurgaon, Singhu and Chilla, to prevent the protesting farmers from entering Delhi.Sections of Outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GT Karnal Road, NH-44 were also closed.The restrictions led to chaos and confusion among commuters who remained on roads stuck for hours.But some of the chaos eased out later in the day after police allowed the farmers to enter the national capital.Farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, had called a 'Delhi Chalo' March through several routes—Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa.They have been demanding that the central government repeal the new farm laws, which, they said, should be replaced with another set of legislations framed after wider consultation with the stakeholders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/traffic-movement-hit-in-key-roads-of-delhi-as-police-keep-singhu-tikri-borders-closed-177170

28-11-2020||New Delhi||UP police repression condemned; UP, Uttarakhand farmers plan to reach Delhi in huge numbers||The Samyukt Kisan movement of AIKSCC, RKMS, BKU (Rajewal), BKU (Chaduni), and other farmers’ organisations has called upon the GOI to immediately address the issues of the farmers and solve them, rather than create subterfuges about talks, with no solution in mind.This was stated in the combined press release of all struggling organisations, even as tens of thousands of farmers continued their march into Delhi, surmounting huge obstacles and repression by police under the direction of BJP government.The waiting lines of their rally are already extending more than 80 km from Delhi borders.The joint morcha of farmers criticized the Uttar Pradesh government for its brutal, barbaric repressive behaviour against farmers’ protests in the state.Protestors from Uttarakhand have also been camping in Uttar Pradesh since they have been disallowed to proceed further and detained by the UP police, a statement saidThis massive gathering is part of the process of events in this historic and unprecedented movement of farmers who are here to protest in Delhi till their demands are met. Farmers bodies stated the farmers have not come to stay, but to get their demands fulfilled.The Govt should not sidetrack this main issue.The farmers' bodies came down heavily on the GOI for complete failure to address the issues being raised by the farmers, viz. annulling the 3 Acts and withdrawing the Electricity Bill 2020.While the Govt. is still justifying these Acts as helpful to farmers and their income, farmers all over the country want these Acts repealed. These Acts will not only undermine Govt. procurement and MSP, but they will also completely subjugate entire farming to Contracts by Companies, Indian and foreign corporations and deprive farmers of their land and respectable livelihood.Experience of contract farming has been disastrous and farmers know how it increases indebtedness and sale of their land.Farmers leaderships have attacked these laws also for destroying the PDS system, loss of control over food costs, promotion of black marketing and undermining food security.Countering the government propaganda that farmers are being egged on by vested interests like political parties and commission agents in this agitation, farmer organisations pointed out that this movement is beyond party politics and any sponsored event would never have seen such massive groundswell of mobilization, or calm determination to get demands met, or such a sustained movement for months on end.They said that the Govt. should stop spreading canards and get down to sincerely addressing farmers’ demands rather than avoid them.They questioned the government’s sincerity in offering talks since what the GoI is keen on doing is to defend what it has already done.This is apparent from the fact that the Govt. goes on saying that it will “explain” the benefits to the farmers, without presenting any concrete agenda even once that they are fully ready to go back on what has been enacted.“The lack of sincerity of this government is apparent in numerous ways. Empty assurances and statements will not be believed by farmers any more. The government chose to ignore farmer protests for months on end now, and tried to malign it in numerous ways. It spent crores of rupees of taxpayers’ money in a publicity blitzkrieg in the name of ‘farmers being misinformed’. This very attitude and approach of the Govt. is unacceptable”, said the statement.The farmers’ leaders also countered the fact that these protests are mainly Punjab-centric.The Govt. also had extended its invitation for December 3rd talks only to Punjab farmer unions, pretending and arguing that other farmers are happy with their reform.“It is clear by now from the fact that farmers from various states are attempting to get into Delhi including from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, that the resistance is pan-India”, the statement read.Further, while national media may choose to ignore, state governments will vouch for the fact that agitations are underway in numerous states including in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and so on.The argument that reforms are painful but needed is untenable since no evidence of the positive outcomes for farmers, in India or in other countries, has been shown by the Govt. so far to show that farmers have not been further indebted, they have not been deprived of their landholdings, prices for farmers have been remunerative, incomes have shot up and that the government need not support farmers any more, once left to so-called free markets.Farmers are not naïve to believe that agribusiness corporations are not out to profiteer and are there with farmers’ best interest as their key objective.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-police-repression-condemned-up-uttarakhand-farmers-plan-to-reach-delhi-in-huge-numbers-177153
28-11-2020||New Delhi||Slogans, songs and drumbeats as hundreds of farmers gather at Burari ground||Shouting slogans, singing songs and carrying flags in reds, greens and blues, about 400 farmers from various groups and states on Saturday gathered at north Delhi’s Burari ground where the government had allowed them to hold a peaceful protest against the new farm laws.While thousands of farmers sat it out at various border points into Delhi for the third consecutive day, many made their way into the national capital and gathered at the Nirankari ground, one of the largest in the city.The farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana and also from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, arrived in trucks and tractors.Slogans such as “Dharti Mata Ki Jai”, ‘Narendra Modi Kisan Virodhi” and “Inquilab Zindabad” could be heard from different parts of the vast, dusty ground. As some farmer leaders gave speeches, farmers danced to drumbeats and the strains of “Hum Honge Kaamyab” could also be heard.Amid the cheerful cacophony from farmers who said they were determined to make their point, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti struck up a chorus of “Chahe Kuch Bhi Karlo Hum Badhte Jaenge”.The Bangla Sahib gurdwara set up a ‘langar’ to feed the protesters. Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party government had also made provisions for food. An e-rickshaw moved around spreading awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of wearing masks.“The unprecedented unity of the farmers will put pressure on the government to withdraw the three anti-farmer acts,” social activist Medha Patkar, who was at Burari with a group of men and women, told NDTV.She said it was a decentralised movement and the protest was against the “vulgar inequity” in the country.Farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.

28-11-2020||---||Union ministers appeal to farmers to stop agitation, come for talks; organisations decide to stay put at Delhi borders||New Delhi/Bathinda, November 28Union ministers, including Home Minister Amit Shah, appear to have called up farmer leaders to convince them to proceed to the Nirankari Ground in Burari. This has been claimed by several organisations camping on the Delhi borders.However, so far, they have not been able to convince farmers who believe that moving to Burari would adversely affect their current advantageous position on the highways and weaken the agitation against the three “black farm laws”.Farmers are demanding permission for either Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Ground to register their protest.Also read: LIVE: After night's halt, Punjab farmers resume march towards Delhi‘Delhi Chalo’ explainer: What the farmers’ protest is all aboutSinghu, Tikri borders in Delhi still shut; farmers reluctant to go to BurariPunjabi MPs in Canada, UK condemn use of force on farmers; come out in supportSlogans, songs and drumbeats as hundreds of farmers gather at Burari ground1,000 farmers booked in Rohtak for rioting, violation of Covid guidelinesDespite facing teargas, farmer helps cop drink water; netizens all praise for it as video goes viralNavdeep Singh, hailed as ‘hero’ for turning off water cannon during farmer protest, charged with ‘attempt to murder’BKU Ekta Ugrahan, too, has refused to go to Burari Maidan to protest.In a decision that could further complicate the situation for the BJP-led Centre, the Jathebandis are said to have decided to stay at borders.Farmers say they will seal the borders and hold a meeting every day to decide the next course of action and added that they were ready to stay put at the borders for “as long as it takes”.The decision has been taken by the 30 jathebandis. BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan has claimed that Union Home Minister Amit Shah called him and asked him to stage the protest at Burari Maidan but he refused his proposal asking him to give farmers the permission to stage a protest at Jantar Mantar.Joginder said they would not go to Burari Maidan. He added: “Five hundred farmer organisations had called for a demonstration at Jantar Mantar and they will reach there at any cost. If they were stopped, they would block the roads of Delhi by staging a dharna.”निरंकारी ग्राउंड, बुराड़ी में किसानों के लिए की जा रही सारी व्यवस्था का जायजा लेते हुए।मुख्यमंत्री @ArvindKejriwal जी के निर्देशो पर दिल्ली सरकार की ओर से किसानों के लिए सारे इंतजाम किए जा रहे हैं। pic.twitter.com/6QOP1Lwi3B  He demanded immediate reconsideration of the application submitted by the 500 farmer organisations for the approval of the demonstration which was rejected by Delhi Police.Giving an ultimatum to the Centre, he said if it did not approve the earlier application of the farmer organisations till Sunday, they would take the next decision on the spot and reach Jantar Mantar in any case.“They should come to us and take back the ‘three black Acts’,” farmers said.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again appealed to farmers to stop the agitation and come for scheduled talks on December 3.Tomar asked the political parties to stop playing politics on the issue of agriculture laws.The food on our platter is because of the hard work done by farmers 🙏🏻 We are thanking the food-growers of Punjab and Haryana by supporting their protest and serving them Langar at Delhi border.

28-11-2020||Chandigarh/New Delhi||‘Delhi Chalo’ explainer: What the farmers’ protest is all about||Thousands of farmers have reached the national capital on their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles, responding to the “Delhi Chalo” call against the agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre in September.On Saturday morning, it wasn’t clear if they will agree to move to the Burari ground on the outskirts of the city, where police said they could continue with their protest. Many protesters were demanding a better venue in the centre of Delhi. Originally, the protest was meant to be on November 26 and 27.A look at the protest so farDay 1:On Thursday, thousands of farmers crossed from Punjab to Haryana. At border points, the Haryana police tried to stop them, using water cannons and teargas. But later they were allowed through. There were skirmishes with police at other points as well on the highway to Delhi as it passed through BJP-run Haryana. A large group of protesters camped for the night near Panipat.Day 2:Protesters assembled at Delhi’s border at Tigri and Singhu. Police used teargas and water cannons to stop them from breaking through barricades, which included sand-laden trucks. In the evening, they offered to let them into the city and continue their protest at Burari ground. But many appeared reluctant.Day 3:The standoff continued on Saturday morning at Delhi’s border. More farmers were making their way from Punjab and Haryana.What farmers fearFarmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time, big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue.Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the “arthiyas” — commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them — will be out of business.Their demandsThe key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them.Key playersThe “Delhi Chalo” call was given by the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.  Several other organisations, including Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), came out in support.The march is being held under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha. The Rashtriya Kisan Mahasanghathan, Jai Kisan Andolan, All-India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha, Krantikari Kisan Union, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), BKU (Rajewal), BKU (Ekta-Urgahan,) BKU (Chaduni) are among the participants.Most protesters are from Punjab but there is a substanial number from Haryana as well. There have been scattered support for the “Delhi Chalo” protest from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.Earlier protestsBefore “Delhi Chalo”, farmers in Punjab and Haryana held sit-ins and blocked roads in sporadic protests. Punjab farmers’ unions then announced a “rail roko” agitation, which lasted for about two months, leading to a suspension of trains to the state and shortages in critical areas, including coal for thermal power stations.At one point, the unions relaxed the agitation to let goods trains through but the Railways insisted that they will either run both freight and passenger trains or none.The contentious lawsThe Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The Congress-majority Punjab Assembly reacted to these central laws by passing Bills meant to “negate” their effect in the state. The Punjab Bills, however, are still awaiting assent of the state Governor.What the Centre saysThe Narendra Modi government says the new laws will give more options to the farmers to sell their crops and get them better prices. It has assured that there is no move to end the MSP system, and the new Acts do not refer to it.Before the “Delhi Chalo” agitation began, the Centre had invited representatives from over 30 farmer unions for a meeting with Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on December 3. An earlier meeting on November 15 had remained inconclusive. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-chalo-explainer-what-the-farmers-protest-is-all-about-177141

28-11-2020||New Delhi||Early cold spell pushes winter wear sales, trends show||The sudden drop in temperature in North India has seen buyers make a beeline and stock up on their winter needs. With the early onset of winter and with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting a colder than usual winter this year, shoppers are stocking up on winter essentials to keep themselves warm and safe.The overall sales in the winter items category for mid-October to mid-November this year is more than double the sales in the corresponding period last year, notes online marketplace Snapdeal. Over the last fortnight, shoppers have focused on buying thermals, fleece sweatshirts, sweaters, and sweatpants. Socks, woolen caps, and gloves were also picked. High fashion winter items like block heel boots, leather jackets, furry coats in clearance sale were a hit, it said.The trend is more for casual winter wear this year and is different from winter fashion of last year when quilted jackets, V neck sweaters, blazer jackets, Nehru jackets, shawl, and turtleneck tops were top-selling winter fashion.Concerns around health from pollution and COVID-19 are reflected in the higher than usual sales for items like windproof full-face masks made of fleece material, which are worn by cyclists and bikers. There is also increased sales of generic HEPA filters, which are priced at an almost 50% discount to branded filters.Other popular winter items seeing higher sales are "head spa steamer caps", which can guard the hair against damage from the skyrocketing pollution levels in winter. Heel repair silicone caps were bought along with foot care creams to prevent cracked heels.Traditional winter favourites like hot water bottles and heating pads continue to receive traction this year. Winter immunity boosters with ingredients like giloy, ginger, garlic, turmeric, laung, and tulsi and dry fruits are also seeing sales climb with the onset of winters.Modern barbeques, which are portable, don't take up too much space and can be handled by home chefs, were being picked. Kettles and egg boilers are another winter favourite. Users are also buying beds, jackets and fish-based food for their pets.The demand for winter products is highest in north India as well as parts of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, said the e-commerce site.

To get the global response back on track will require putting people first and tackling the inequalities on which epidemics thrive." Although some countries in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Botswana and Eswatini, have done remarkably well and have achieved or even exceeded the targets set for 2020, many more countries are falling way behind.The report highlighted that insufficient investment and action on HIV and other pandemics left the world exposed to COVID-19.Had health systems and social safety nets been even stronger, the world would have been better positioned to slow the spread of COVID-19 and withstand its impact.COVID-19 has shown that investments in health save lives but also provide a foundation for strong economies."No country can defeat these pandemics on its own," said Byanyima."A challenge of this magnitude can only be defeated by forging global solidarity, accepting a shared responsibility and mobilising a response that leaves no one behind. We can do this by sharing the load and working together." IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/25-million-couples-in-india-couldnt-access-contraceptives-due-to-coronavirus-177131

Also, some of them have been asked to disgorge illegal gains made from trading in the shares when they were in possession of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI).The directions follow a probe conducted by the markets’ regulator between September 2006 and June 2008 wherein various violations of insider trading regulations were found.The amount has to be paid jointly or severally by them along with 6 per cent interest from April 17, 2008, to the date of actual payment.“All entities have violated the Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) Regulations,” Sebi said in three separate orders passed late on Friday.Sebi noted that Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy together made a gain of Rs 16.97 crore while indulging in insider trading in the shares of New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV) while in possession of the UPSI relating to the proposed reorganization of the company.Prannoy Roy was the chairman and whole-time director and Radhika Roy was the managing director during the period under investigation and was part of the decision making chain that had led to the crystallisation of the UPSI.Discussions pertaining to reorganisation of the company started on September 7, 2007, and the disclosure was made on April 16, 2008.Hence, September 7, 2007, to April 16, 2008, was the UPSI period.Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy sold shares on April 17, 2008, when the trading window for them was closed and made a profit of Rs 16,97,38,335.By doing so, they violated PIT norms and also acted in contravention of NDTV’s code of conduct for prevention of insider trading which prohibited them from trading at least till 24 hours after the information was disclosed to the stock exchanges.The Roys have been restrained from accessing the securities market for two years and directed to disgorge illegal gains along with 6 per cent interest per annum.Vikramaditya Chandra, who was the group CEO and executive director during the relevant period, made a profit of Rs 6.67 lakh; Ishwari Prasad Bajpai, who was senior advisor-editorial and projects, made an illegal gain of Rs 8.82 lakh; while director finance and group CFO Saurav Banerjee incurred a loss of Rs 47,000 while trading in NDTV’s scrip during the UPSI period.The shares which were sold during the UPSI period were acquired by them pursuant to allotment under ESOPs.Sebi has thus directed disgorgement of respective illegal gains along with 6 per cent interest per annum and barred Chandra, Bajpai and Banerjee from accessing securities market for one year.Also, Sanjay Dutt’s wife Prenita Dutt and entities connected to him — Quantum Securities Private Limited, SAL Real Estate Private Limited and Taj Capital Partners Private Limited — had made a wrongful gain of Rs 2.2 crore through insider trading while in possession of UPSI.Sanjay Dutt was an on-call and in-house adviser/team member of NDTV group the scope of his work included responsibility and accountability for the corporate finance and strategic planning function of the firm.During the period of investigation, the firm had filed six price sensitive information to exchanges.He was in possession of or has had access to price-sensitive information and had communicated the same to his wife, Prenita Dutt, and entities connected to him — Quantum Securities, SAL Real Estate and Taj Capital Partners — which, in turn, traded in the shares of NDTV during the UPSI period and made illegal gains of Rs 2.2 crore.Therefore, Sebi has directed disgorgement of the illegal gains which is to be paid by them jointly or severally along with 6 per cent interest and also barred all the entities including Sanjay Dutt from accessing securities market for two years.

28-11-2020||New Delhi||CBI raids 45 locations in 4 states in illegal mining and theft of coal case||The CBI on Saturday carried out a massive search operation at 45 locations in four states after registering a case against alleged coal pilferer Anup Manjhi who was suspected to be acting in collusion with two general managers and three security personnel of Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL), officials said.The searches were spread across West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, they said.The CBI registered the case on Friday against Manjhi, ECL General Managers Amit Kumar Dhar (of then Kunustoria area now Pandaveswar area) and Jayesh Chandra Rai (Kajor area) besides ECL Chief of Security Tanmay Das, Area Security Inspector, Kunustoria Dhananjay Rai and SSI and security in-charge Kajor area Debashish Mukherjee.It is alleged that accused Anup Manjhi alias Lala is involved in the illegal mining and theft of coal from leasehold mines of ECL in Kunustoria and Kajora areas, they said.During the searches, the agency recovered Rs 40 lakh cash, documents, electronic devices and instruments of financial transactions, they said.The Central Bureau of Investigation acted on information from “reliable sources” indicating illegal excavation and theft of coal in the leasehold area of ECL in “connivance” with the officials of ECL, CISF and Railways.The vigilance department of the ECL and its Task Force had also noticed illegal mining from May 2020 and onwards with the help of large excavation machines and vehicles for transportation that were seized by the team.“Several instances of installation of illegal weighbridges in concrete form were also detected which confirms illegal coal mining and transportation from ECL areas in an organised manner at a very large scale.“It is further revealed by the source that illegal mining is going on at the leasehold area of ECL behind Topsi village under Kunustoria Area and at Lachhipur Village under Kajora Area by the coal mafias in active connivance with officials of ECL and those of CISF,” the CBI alleged in its FIR.The departmental raids on August 7, 2020 led to the recovery of over nine MT of stolen coal from the Railway siding of the Pandaveswar area. Similar recoveries were also made from other locations.“It is learnt that this illegal activity is being run at Railway sidings by the criminals with the active connivance of unknown Railway officials,” the agency alleged.The CBI has alleged Anup Manjhi alias Lala is the kingpin of most of the coal pilferage in the area arising out of illegal mining.The Standard Operating Procedure for Action Plan Illegal Mining and coal theft of CIL dated August 08, 2020, issued a day after raids by ECL teams, stated that the main role of all the raids and actions to be taken is of the Area Security Officer, Area Security In-Charge, Area Authorities under the respective Chief of Security ECL and Area General Managers”.It appears that illegal coal mining in the ECL leasehold area is going on along with theft of coal from Railway sidings in an organised manner, the CBI said.It alleged that the accused officials and security officers of ECL and CISF, in connivance with unidentified Railways officials, allowed Anup Maji alias Lala to misappropriate the national property entrusted to them, committing criminal breach of trust.Meanwhile, ECL sources said that a security official of the company died on Saturday after “falling ill” during a search operation by the CBI at his residence.Dhananjay Roy, the security inspector of the state-run firm in the Kunustoria area in West Bengal’s Pashchim Bardhaman district was taken ill when the search operation was underway, they said.He was rushed to a hospital where he died, the sources said.

28-11-2020||Lucknow||UP Governor gives assent to ordinance against forcible religious conversions||Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on Saturday gave assent to an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions that provides for imprisonment up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 under different categories.The promulgation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, came four days after the Yogi Adityanath Government had approved the draft of the legislation which also curbs religious conversions only for the sake of marriage.               The new law, however, did not go down well with the opposition Samajwadi Party.                         Hours after the Governor’s nod, SP president Akhilesh Yadav said his party will oppose the Bill when it comes up in the UP Legislature for passage.                 “The Samajwadi Party is not in favour of any such law. We will oppose it (when it comes up in the assembly),” the SP leader said in reply to a question at a press conference here.According to the ordinance, a marriage will be declared “null and void” if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate.It also has a provision under which if someone returns to their original religion, it shall not be deemed a conversion.While the onus to prove that the conversion has not been done forcibly will lie on the person accused of the act and the convert, it said.In case of contravention of the law, the ordinance says that the court shall grant appropriate compensation payable by the accused to the victim of conversion which may extend to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh in addition to the fine.                The ordinance says no person shall convert, either directly or indirectly from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.An aggrieved person, his/her parents, brother, sister, or any other person who is related to him/her by blood, marriage or adoption may lodge an FIR about such conversion, according to the ordinance.                   In cases of mass religious conversion, the registration of the social organisations will be cancelled, and strong action will be initiated against them.If those previously convicted under the ordinance are caught again for the same offence, they shall be subjected to double punishment, it said.                                                       Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, all the offences under this ordinance shall be cognisable and non-bailable and triable by the sessions court, the ordinance said.In recent weeks, BJP-run states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have revealed plans to enact laws to counter alleged attempts to convert Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage, which Hindu activists refer to as “love jihad”.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet’s approval to the ordinance followed the announcement by Adityanath that his government would come out with a law to deal with “love jihad”. Addressing bypoll rallies in Jaunpur and Deoria last month, Adityanath had used the Hindu funeral chant of ‘Ram Naam Satya Hai’ to threaten those who do not respect daughters and sisters.The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission had submitted a report last year suggesting a new law to check the forcible religious conversions.

28-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||JD-U 'played role' in LJP being denied Rajya Sabha seat, nomination of Sushil Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 28NDA’s ally JD-U, mainly Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, is believed to have played a major role in the Rajya Sabha seat being wrested from the LJP, sources in are indicating.The BJP on Friday nominated former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi as its candidate for the Rajya Sabha by-poll after Nitish Kumar reportedly refused to support a candidate from the LJP, whose chief Chirag Paswan led an acrimonious campaign against him in the recent Assembly elections in which JD-U suffered major losses.Sources said efforts to persuade Nitish Kumar failed and the seat went to the former Bihar deputy chief minister who is now also believed to be among top contenders for the several vacancies in the Narendra Modi Cabinet for which names of several leaders, including that of Jyotiraditya Scindia, are doing the rounds.The LJP had claimed this seat for Reena Paswan, wife of Ram Vilas Paswan, it is said.However, the JD-U persisted with its opposition to the LJP. It remains to be seen if the LJP, which is part of the NDA at the Centre, is henceforth given any assignment in the Narendra Modi cabinet.After the exit of the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal, Ramdas Athawale of the RPI is the sole NDA ally in the central council of ministers.The seat had fallen vacant following the death of LJP patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan, who was a Cabinet minister in the Modi government. With the LJP out of the Bihar NDA after its decision to contest separately, the BJP’s decision to reclaim the seat has put a question mark on future of Chirag Paswan.It is said some new faces might be inducted from West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Assam and Uttar Pradesh in the expansion expected “soon”.Some ministers from these states may also be dropped, it is being speculated.Ram Vilas Paswan was elected to the Upper House by the NDA under the ‘seat-sharing formula’ finalised during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by the three parties. The BJP and the JD-U had contested 17 seats each while the LJP was given six seats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jd-u-played-role-in-ljp-being-denied-rajya-sabha-seat-nomination-of-sushil-modi-177116
28-11-2020||New Delhi||Singhu, Tikri borders in Delhi still shut; farmers reluctant to go to Burari||Traffic movement on both sides at Singhu and Tikri continued to be disrupted for the second day on Saturday as farmers planning to hold protest in Delhi rallied at these interstate borders and were reluctant to move to Burari where they were allowed to move in.Delhi Traffic Police diverted traffic from Mukarba Chowk and GTK Road to prevent inconvenience to commuters due to rallying farmers, who have been travelling towards Delhi in buses, trucks and tractor-trolleys.The farmers who had gathered on the Delhi borders were allowed only to move towards Burari ground, that too escorted by police. However, a large number of protesters at Singhu and Tikri asserted that they wished to go either to the Ramlila Maidan or Jantar Mantar in central Delhi to protest.Police officers, meanwhile, were trying to convince farmers to proceed to the Burari ground but the farmers seemed adamant, fearing that camping at the Burari ground would weaken their agitation against the three central farm laws.Meanwhile, a section of Delhi-bound farmers who had gone to the Nirankari ground in north Delhi's Burari later returned, saying "it is a strategy to confine us"."The police are not letting our tractor-trolleys to come out once we enter the ground. We don't want to go there now. We will lay a siege at the border entry/exit point only. We won't go to Burari," said a protesting farmer.Meanwhile, arrangement of water and other necessities were made for farmers to camp at Burari ground on Friday evening.Senior police officers were supervising the protest site at Burari even as a constant vigil was on at Singhu and Tikri borders. IANSSloganeering by farmers continues at Delhi bordersNew Delhi: The Saturday sun rose as farmers at Delhi's Singhu and Tikri borders woke up ready to push through another day of protests, and slogans of "black laws" greeted the chilly morning air.Amid high security arrangements, the sloganeering continued on both the borders - Singhu and Tikri - with thousands of farmers sticking to their demands seeking rollback of the Centre's three farm laws.In an unusual sight, the farmers were self-barricading themselves so that peace and harmony could be maintained as the agitations continued. But the road blockade led to problems to commuters as traffic was diverted at various routes heading towards these borders.Kisan Ekta group members, who were protesting at Tikri border, say they could sit in protest for six months if their demands are not fulfilled."We have arrangements for food and other things for the next six months. We can easily sit here in protest for months if our demands are not met," said the group that came from Fatehabad.Security forces have been kept busy in preparing deployment arrangements with senior officials briefing them how to handle the situation as the agitation entered the weekend after the marches started on Thursday from Punjab, Haryana and four more states.With the possibility of more farmers approaching the border and trying to enter the national capital, concrete slabs, concertina wires, and trucks filled with sand are still in place.Edgy policemen fired teargas rounds on Friday to keep huge throngs of agitating farmers at the Singhu and Tikri borders at bay in a day-long face-off.Later in the evening, the administration finally relented and offered the Nirankari Samagam grounds at Burari in north Delhi to farmer leaders protesting on Singhu border on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway.A few farmer leaders reached Burari ground late while several stayed back at the barricades.The Tikri border also witnessed similar clashes the whole day on Friday as farmers were targeted with water cannons by police when they tried to move into the national capital with their trucks and tractors.The police also blocked farmers’ way through concrete slabs.

This format is being revived after six years and is aimed at consolidating the existing partnership between the three countries on maritime security against the backdrop of Colombo’s unwillingness to reduce the salience of China in its infrastructure development.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited both countries last month after participating in the 2+2 talks in India. While Maldives is receptive to partnering the US in defence cooperation, Colombo was cold to Pompeo’s suggestion that Chinese influence is malignant.In Seychelles, Jaishankar handed over a letter from PM Narendra Modi to the newly elected priest of Indian origin Ram Kalawan.

Govt affidavitIn an affidavit in the Supreme Court (SC), the Centre said the Delhi Government was lax in containing Covid and its failure to enforce measures led to massive rise in infection and increased strain on the capacity of medical infrastructure in hospitals.“Ten states contribute to almost 77 per cent of the active caseload in the country. These are Maharashtra (18.9%), Kerala (14.7%), Delhi (8.5%), West Bengal (5.7%), Karnataka (5.6%), Uttar Pradesh (5.4%), Rajasthan (5.5%), Chhattisgarh (5.0%), Haryana (4.7%) and Andhra Pradesh (3.1%),” it stated.The affidavit has been filed in response to a suo motu PIL initiated by a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan. On Friday, the Bench took suo motu cognisance of the Rajkot hospital fire that claimed six lives. Terming the incident shocking, the Bench sought a report from the Gujarat Government by Tuesday. It said relevant guidelines were not implemented by states and there was laxity in the inspection of electrical lines.The SC has asked states to follow the Covid protocol.The Centre said, “Despite repeated exhortation in the wake of rising Covid cases, the Delhi Government did not take steps to enhance the testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RT-PCR tests for a long time.”“The containment measures, as prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, including house-to-house surveillance, contact tracing, quarantining and clinical management, were also not followed properly, which has led to the spread of virus. Patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced.“The government was aware that the confluence of winter, festival season and pollution were likely to witness a surge in Covid cases. This foreknowledge ought to have led to strict enforcement of Covid rules. However, this was not done,” it said.“While there were regular advertisements on the achievements of the Delhi Government, including on dengue prevention and control, ads on Covid appropriate behaviour were nowhere to be seen. People, at large, were also not apprised of it through regular outreach measures,” the Centre submitted.“The report of a high-powered committee headed by Dr VK Paul, member, Niti Aayog, had recommended that Delhi should plan for a surge of around 15,000 cases per day and accordingly provide for about 6,500 ICU beds. Against this recommendation, the government did not take any timely measure to increase the ICU beds from the present level of around 3,500,” stated the affidavit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lax-kejri-govt-failed-to-check-covid-surge-centre-tells-sc-177010

There are several tribunals in India that were constituted for delivering speedy, inexpensive and decentralised adjudication of disputes in various matters such as service, tax, railway claims, environment and defence service.The SC has also held that the secretary of the department concerned against whom orders are to be passed by the tribunal shall not have a say or vote in the selection of members for the tribunal.Legal experts said the decision would free all tribunals from executive control and ensure their independence and boost confidence of litigants.

Under its influence, heavy-to-very-heavy rain with isolated extremely heavy rain are very likely over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal on December 2 and 3. Sea conditions will be rough to very rough from November 28 onwards in different parts as the system progresses through the Bay,” it addedThere has been an increase in the number and intensity of storms over the recent years due to changing climatic conditions. Sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal have been steadily increasing over the last decades, a factor driving rapid intensification. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, driving extreme rainfall during cyclones, increasing threat of flooding, experts say.High temperatures are generally conducive for cyclogenesis. There is also a correlation between cooler phase of ENSO, known as La Niña, and increased tropical cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal. 2020 being a La Niña year (which is also reason for a harsher and longer winter) is another underlying cause behind increased activity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-nivar-another-cyclone-brews-over-bay-of-bengal-176994

If rejected, they can move the top court.The top court criticised the Bombay High Court for failing to notice the contents of the FIR and making a prima facie evaluation and abdicating its role, functions and jurisdiction when seized of a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC.The High Court should not have refused to exercise its powers “when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personal liberty in an excess of state power”.The top court lamented that 91,568 bail applications were pending in High Courts, while 1.96 lakh such pleas were hanging fire in district courts.Maintaining that “Liberty is not a gift for the few”, the top court asked High Courts and District Court’s to monitor pendency of bail applications to ensure protection of personal liberty of ordinary people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evaluation-of-fir-against-arnab-doesnt-establish-charge-says-sc-176988
