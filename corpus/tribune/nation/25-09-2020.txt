New Delhi has maintained that issues related to Jammu and Kashmir are internal matters to India.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status on August 5 last year and bifurcating it into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution was its internal matter.

25-09-2020||New Delhi||Centre is authority competent to transfer IAS officer from one cadre to another: SC||The Supreme Court Friday said that the Central government is the authority competent to transfer a 2013-batch IAS officer, who took on transport mafia in Bihar, from one cadre to another.The apex court granted liberty to the IAS officer, who is fighting a legal battle for his inter-cadre transfer, to make a fresh representation to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) within two weeks in this regard in light of the Delhi High Court's last year decision.The High Court had in July last year asked the Centre to initiate the process of inter-cadre transfer of IAS officer Jitendra Gupta forthwith and issue an order transferring him to a cadre outside the Bihar cadre.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the representation might be considered by the competent authority “sympathetically” and appropriate decision be communicated within two months from the date of receipt of representation.“The proceedings of inter-cadre transfer are awaiting finalisation for the last more than two years. The appellant (Gupta) who is ready to render his services in any other state, which state needs to utilise his services for the welfare of the people,” the Bench, also comprising Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah, said in its order.“There is no doubt that it is the Central Government which is authority competent to transfer the appellant from one cadre to another,” the Bench observed.The apex court delivered the order on Gupta's plea challenging the High Court's order of December 24 last year which had rejected his plea seeking initiation of contempt action against the authority concerned for allegedly not complying with the directions given by a division bench of the high court in its July last year verdict.In its order, the top court said that the officer could not insist that he should be transferred to Haryana.“We, however, are inclined to grant a liberty to the appellant (Gupta) to make a fresh representation to the Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India in reference to letter dated December 13, 2019 within two weeks from today with regard to his inter-cadre transfer in light of judgment of Delhi High Court dated July 2, 2019,” said the Bench.“It shall be open for the appellant to give his willingness/consent with regard to any other state. The representation may be considered by the competent authority sympathetically and appropriate decision be communicated at an early date preferably within two months from the date of receipt of the representation,” it said.After the High Court's July last year order, a letter dated December 13, 2019 was issued by the Centre to Gupta to convey his willingness or consent for inter-cadre transfer to Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh or Manipur cadre which are having the maximum shortage of IAS officer as on date so that the matter could be considered further in the department.During the arguments before the apex court, Gupta's counsel had argued that the High Court's July last year order had not been complied with by the authority.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that no contempt was committed by the authority and under the High Court's July last year order, the Centre was to take decision regarding inter-cadre transfer of Gupta as per law. “In the facts of the present case, we are of the view that present was not a case of any willful disobedience of the direction of the High Court dated July 2, 2019 and the high court rightly refused to initiate contempt proceedings,” the Bench said, while disposing of the appeal.It said that the apex court had earlier passed two orders in the matter with the hope that the matter “may be amicably settled”.A Division Bench of the high court had in July last year said that “willingness/consent” of Gupta be also sought for inter-cadre transfer as per law and the entire process be completed within four weeks."If we fail in our duty to protect a man, who has had the nerve to stand up against a mafia and the State machinery, we would be doing great disservice to the system and setting a bad precedent, where no officer would gather the courage to stand up against the wrongdoers,” said the High Court had said.Before the High Court, Gupta had sought transfer to Haryana alleging threat to his life for acting tough against the transport mafia in Bihar.The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) had earlier directed the Centre to consider the case of the officer for inter-state deputation to Haryana or for Central Government deputation.Thereafter, Bihar Government had challenged the CAT order before the high court.In 2016, Gupta was arrested in a corruption case and was sent to jail. He was later granted bail and the FIR was quashed following Patna High Court's order.

25-09-2020||---||COVID-19 lockdown: SC reserves verdict on PIL seeking full refund for cancelled tickets||New Delhi, September 25The Supreme Court on Friday reserved its orders on a PIL seeking full refund for airline tickets cancelled due to COVID-19 lockdown.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan reserved its verdict after hearing counsel for petitioner Pravasi Legal Cell, various airlines, the Centre and Directorate of Civil Aviation.On behalf of the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta clarified that credit shell, i.e., voucher facility can’t be availed by travel agents who booked tickets during the lockdown.The Bench wanted to know if the voucher was not used within the deadline who would get the money – passenger or the agent.Noting that it would depend upon the contract between the passengers and agents, Mehta said the government didn’t control contractual obligations between them.The court had on Wednesday asked the Centre to clarify the modalities of refund of air tickets to passengers and travel agents for flights cancelled during COVID-19 lockdown.As advocates representing airlines talked about massive losses faced by them due to COVID19 lockdown, air travellers’ counsel asserted that they can’t be made to suffer and their money has to be refunded.The Bench – which is seized of a PIL seeking air tickets refund for flights cancelled due to COVID-19 lockdown – posed several questions to the Centre and Directorate General of Civil Aviation regarding refund.The DGCA had earlier told the top court that full refund shall be provided by airlines immediately for tickets booked during the COVID-19 lockdown for domestic or international travel within the lockdown period.If airlines were not able to refund on account of financial distress, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected and this shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket for domestic travel directly or through an agent including online platforms, the DGCA had said.Passengers entitled to full refund for air tickets booked during Lockdown 1 & 2 during which air travel was banned due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre had earlier told the Supreme Court.“If the tickets have been booked during the first lockdown period, i.e. 25th of March, 2020 to 14th of April, 2020 for the journeys to be undertaken in both first and second lockdown period i.e. from 25th of March, 2020 to 3rd of May, 2020, in all such cases, full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately,” the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had said regarding domestic airlines’ tickets booked directly by the passenger with airlines.Similarly, for international travel when the ticket has been booked on an Indian carrier and the booking is ex-India, it had said, “If the tickets have been booked during the lockdown period for travel within the lockdown period, in all such cases full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately. This amount shall be passed on immediately by the Agent to the passengers, as the case may be.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-lockdown-sc-reserves-verdict-on-pil-seeking-full-refund-for-cancelled-tickets-146460

25-09-2020||Lucknow/Noida||Farm Bills: Protests held across UP; farmers stage ‘panchayat’ at Delhi-UP border||Farmers and agitators held protests across Uttar Pradesh on Friday against the farm Bills passed by Parliament, alleging that the “anti-farmer” legislations are meant to benefit multinational companies and industrialists.Farmers under the banner of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Samajwadi party and the Congress held protests in various districts of the state.Hundreds of farmers sat on protests on the UP-Delhi border after they were stopped by police personnel from moving towards the National Capital, disrupting traffic in Noida and Ghaziabad.A heavy deployment of police personnel in riot gear was made to ward off any disturbance during the protest, a part of the nationwide demonstration against the three farm Bills passed during the monsoon session.Some organisations allege the Bills are “anti-farmer”, but the government argues that the farmers have been “misled” and the Bills actually free them to sell their produce outside the APMC mandis.Samajwadi Party members held protest in all the districts of the state and sent a memoranda addressed to Governor Anandiben Patel, requesting her to ensure that these are not implemented in the state as they are “anti-farmer and anti-worker”.                             “On the directives of party’s national president, SP workers sent memoranda to the governor thorough their respective district magistrates, demanding that the anti-farmer and anti-workers bills should not be implemented in the state,” SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury said.In a statement issued here, party chief Akhilesh Yadav said his party has always been at the forefront of raising issues of public interest and always stood against the ruling party for their anti-people stand. He said in the present regime while youth is unemployed, big capitalists have their eyes on the farmers’ land.“Laws are being made in Parliament only for multinational companies and a few industrialists. The BJP government has first introduced a Bill for exploitation of farmers to benefit capitalists and now a Bill of labour exploitation to benefit industrialists. They brought the Bills without taken any suggestions,” Akhilesh said.Congress workers also held protests against the three Bills at several places while terming them “anti-farmer”.In Noida, the farmers were at the Noida Gate in Sector 14A near Chilla, at the UP-Delhi border, where they were stopped by the Gautam Buddh Nagar police around 12 noon, officials said.The farmers under the BKU banner alleged that the Bills were “anti-farmer”.“Today’s protest is part of a bigger statewide and nationwide agitation by farmers against the farm-sector-related Bills passed in Parliament recently. The farmers are opposed to these ‘black laws’. Our demand is that a law should be made that fixes the MSP (minimum support price) as the lowest amount for purchasing crops from farmers,” BKU’s Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana told PTI.Barricades came up amid heavy deployment of police personnel at the Noida-Delhi border where the farmers, who travelled on foot, two-wheelers and tractor trolleys, staged a demonstration and held a ‘panchayat’ addressed by regional farm leaders and BKU office-bearers.The gathering disrupted traffic movement on the key road between Noida and Delhi.In Ghaziabad, the protestors led by BKU’s state unit vice president Rajbir Singh and secretary Harendra Nehra submitted a memorandum outlining their demands to Additional District Magistrate (City) Shailendra Kumar.Some members of BKU (Ambawat) staged a protest march and raised slogans against the Bills and handed over a memorandum to Assistant Superintendent of Police Keshav Kumar near Bhopura trisection at Loni road.In Gorakhpur division, including Gorakhpur, Deoria, Kushinagar and Maharajganj districts,  the BKU, the Congress and the Samajwadi Party workers held protests and demanded that the government roll back the Bills immediately.In Gorakhpur, BKU and the Congress party held a demonstration at Rani Laxmibai Park in Nagar Nigam campus. When the Congress workers tried to move towards the collectorate, police stopped them near the Nagar Nigam gate.In Deoria , BKU, SP and the Communist parties along with others held a protest at Subhash Chowk. They were also stopped by the police when they tried to move towards the collectorate. Over two dozen protesters also submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate.In Kushinagar, the demonstration was held at the district headquarters and in Maharajganj, protestors marched from Anandnagar Sugar Mill to Vishnu Mandir Chauraha at Anand Nagar in Farenda Tehsil and submitted a memorandum to officials.In Jalaun, BKU activists held a demonstration by blocking traffic jam at the toll plaza on the national highway.The agitating farmers also submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Prime Minister, to the district administration officials.Due to the agitation, traffic snarls were witnessed on the national highway, while the movement of vehicles was stopped. The traffic was affected for over half an hour.Opposition parties and farmers in some states have been opposing the farm Bills but the government has assured that the legislation would benefit crop-growers.The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, now await Presidential assent.

Normally a press briefing is done by CBI. But in this case, till today, CBI has not done a press briefing on what they have found out. This is a very serious issue," Singh alleged at a press conference.He also claimed that a doctor, who is part of AIIMS team, had told him "long back" that Rajput's photos—sent by the lawyer himself—indicated that it was allegedly death by strangulation, not suicide.As far as the narcotics angle is concerned, the senior advocate further claimed that such a case can be made only if certain quantity of drugs is seized from someone.Singh further alleged that Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is conducting a "fashion parade" of Bollywood stars to divert media attention."An offence can not be proved until some quantity of contraband is recovered. The only case made out is that of casual consumer and proving anyone guilty is almost impossible," he told reporters.Singh had earlier in the day taken to Twitter saying he was getting "frustrated" by the delay in CBI taking a decision on the case."Getting frustrated by the delay in CBI taking a decision to convert abetment of suicide to Murder of SSR (Sushant Singh Rajput)."The Doctor who is part of AIIMS team had told me long back that the photos sent by me indicated 200 per cent that it's death by strangulation and not suicide," Singh tweeted.Rajput, 34, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 following which the Mumbai Police had lodged an Accidental Death Report (ADR).On July 25, Rajput's father K K Singh lodged a complaint in the matter with Patna police against Sushant's actor-friend Rhea Chakraborty, her parents Indrajit and Sandhya, her brother Showik, the late actor's then manager Shruti Modi and his house manager Samuel Miranda.He accused them of cheating and abetting his son's suicide. He also claimed that the accused persons had siphoned off Rs 15 crore from his son's bank accounts.Based on this allegation, the Enforcement Directorate is probing money laundering charges.The FIR lodged by Patna police was later transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), while the NCB is probing drugs angle in the case.

25-09-2020||New Delhi||Lancet cautions India on giving ‘too much positive spin’ to Covid-19||The renowned medical journal Lancet has criticised India on the danger of presenting the current situation in India with too positive a spin. It not only clouds reality but also hampers vital public health initiatives.It said that perpetuating unrealistic claims or failing to honestly report negative news creates uncertainty among the public and healthcare professionals, discouraging people from taking preventive action or taking public health messages seriously.India has the expertise in medicine, public health, research, and manufacturing to lead the nation through the Covid-19 pandemic."To capitalise on these attributes, the country's leaders must respect scientific evidence, expert commentary, and academic freedom, and not provide false optimism," Lancet said in a criticism directed at the government.Hope is important, and recognising successes is vital, especially during a pandemic, it added.The epidemic in India is far from over, with a potentially huge burden of mortality and morbidity to come unless public health measures are used and adhered to. Without clear and honest communication of the risks of Covid-19 to the population, stemming the epidemic will be impossible."Most crucially, the rapidly growing case numbers, alongside the continuing relaxation of restrictions, are creating an atmosphere of fatalism mingled with false optimism that undermines effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masks and physical distancing," said Lancet.Lancet said according to news reports, hours before announcing the national lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told owners and editors from India's largest media organisations that it was important to tackle the spread of pessimism, negativity, and rumour.This pressure to avoid negative news, and to offer reassurance, appears to have been felt by several professional scientific organisations in India.Lancet has slammed ICMR. "The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been singled out by experts for straying from scientific evidence, appearing at worst politically motivated and at best overly optimistic," it said.A letter from the Director General of the ICMR, Balram Bhargava, said that the ICMR envisaged launching a coronavirus vaccine on August 15 – Indian Independence Day, a deadline considered unrealistic by most medical experts.The ICMR has supported treatment with hydroxychloroquine despite insufficient evidence and news reports claim that data on coronavirus infection were removed from a scientific paper.It has also pointed towards issues with Covid numbers. "Transparency of the data on Covid-19 cases and deaths, especially those underpinning the case fatality rate, has also been questioned, as detailed in a recent World Report. The Indian Government reports a case fatality rate of 1.8%, much lower than the reported rate in other countries, but it is difficult to know if the numbers are comparable," said Lancet.

25-09-2020||Hyderabad||Hyderabad shocked over honour killing after 28-year-old man murdered||A 28-year-old man was killed in what is being seen as an honour killing, shocking the residents of Hyderabad.The man was allegedly murdered by hired killers at the instance of the girl’s father. The police have arrested 12 members of the girl’s family for conspiracy and murder.The victim, Yoga Hemanth Kumar, was an interior designer working for a private company. He was in a relationship with 23-year old Avanti Reddy for the past four years. Since the two belonged to different castes, the girl’s father opposed the alliance after which the two got married on their own.According to the police, Hemanth was abducted by a group of around ten people from his residence on Thursday and his body was later found in Sangareddy area today.After the deceased was identified, Avanti told the media that she suspects her father’s involvement in the murder. She said that while the two were cooking in their Gachibowli residence, her uncle accompanied by some people came and forced her to pack her bags and began beating Hemanth.She said that the men came in three cars and dragged the couple to one of the cars. As the cars moved, Avanti managed to jump out of the car and escaped, the abductors took Hemanth with them.“After getting into the car, I jumped out of it. When I tried calling my father, he did not pick up, but he was responding to my uncle’s calls, which means he knew everything and was doing this on purpose,” Avanti said.Sources said that Hemanth belonged to Vaishya community while Avanti was a Reddy, a forward caste in Andhra Pradesh. Avanti’s family wanted her to get married only to a Reddy. But Hemanth and Avanti, who were neighbours, fell in love four years ago. But since the family of the girl did not approve of the match, the couple got married on their own on June 11.The police said that the men abducted Hemanth and soon, they received a call from Avanti about herhusband’s abduction. When the abductors reached Gopannapalli, Hemanth allegedly managed to escape.However, the police said that Yugander Reddy – Avanti’s uncle – who was in the car, followed Hemanth and captured him again.“By that time, we were already looking for Hemanth near the Ring Road and nearby places.

25-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Bihar elections: A trial by fire for BJP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 25While BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it has not been doing so well in Assembly elections since 2018. Beginning with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in 2018, the trend continued in Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi and Jharkhand in 2019. And this despite a spectacular performance in General Elections spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the year.Though the saffron party has managed to topple governments in Karnataka and MP and form one in Haryana in alliance with a party it fought against – the JJP – decrease in vote share in states like Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand in 2019 could be a cause for worry.  The Election Commission (EC) on Friday announced three-phase schedule beginning October 28 for Bihar Assembly elections for which the counting will take place on November 10. Notably, the “surprising” result from neighbouring Jharkhand in 2019 was partly attributed to a substantial dip in BJP's vote share in urban areas. This may be a cause of concern for the NDA allies in Bihar (BJP, JD-U and LJP) who by the way are yet to resolve seat-sharing and other issues.  The BJP believes it has an upper hand given the state of the Opposition in Bihar but political observers believe “the ground situation in Bihar, like it was in Jharkhand, is far from what it appears”.“If you think Sushant Singh Rajput (late Bollywood star from Bihar) is an issue, think again. Ram Mandir is also no issue. It is a state where anything related to caste still has the potential to change the scenario as it happened in 2015,” they say.Also read: Bihar to go to polls in 3 phases from Oct 28 to Nov 7The bottom-line is votes of backward classes, EBCs, Muslims, etc. and issues will decide the fate of parties in these elections where the contentious agriculture reforms also have the potential to form another cornerstone, even though BJP leaders, who expect great dividends from the agri-reforms, claim “MSP and APMC are not an issue in Bihar”.All this apart, while upper castes have grievances against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, it seems migrants who returned home amid the Covid lockdown are also not too happy with him.  Besides the massive ant-incumbency faced by Nitish Kumar, floods and damage to farm lands are other issues that are expected to affect the results.BJP’s focus areas include Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s self-reliance pitch – Atmanirbhar Bihar – and monetary help, rations and MNREGA jobs to migrants after they reached Bihar in the lockdown.With JD-U's Nitish Kumar as face, BJP president JP Nadda is learnt to have asked party MPs to work not only for ensuring victory for saffron party candidates but also nominees of all the NDA constituentsWhether status quo in Bihar or winds of change, as the BJP prepares to roll out its high pitch e-blitzkrieg powered by money and resources, the question also remains whether rivals can match it. In those terms the saffron party has a certain edge given its past experience with digital/social media and high-tech campaigns, though according to political observers, the combination of coronavirus pandemic, migrant crisis, job losses, floods and farmers’ issues have the potential to cause “some unexpected results”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-a-trial-by-fire-for-bjp-146439
25-09-2020||New Delhi||Bihar to have rallies with distancing norms||Political parties and candidates can hold rallies as part of their campaigning for the Bihar Assembly polls and the grounds where such meetings will be held will have white circles to ensure distancing norms.Addressing a press conference to announce the schedule for Bihar Assembly elections, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said he wants to dispel doubts that there will only be virtual campaigning in the state.The “propaganda” that only virtual meets will take place during campaigning is way off the mark, he said.Arora said the district election officers have already identified places where gatherings can take place. The exercise of putting markers to ensure distancing norms is on.District election officers and district superintendents of police should ensure that the number of attendees does not exceed the limit prescribed by the State Disaster Management Authority for public gatherings, an EC statement later said.DEOs will depute sector health regulators to oversee that COVID-19 instructions are being followed during such meetings.Political parties and candidates concerned should ensure that all COVID-related requirements such as face masks, sanitisers and thermal scanning are fulfilled during each of these election activities, the commission said.Anyone violating the norms will face action under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code, the EC warned.As part of restrictions put in place to check the spread of the virus, the EC has reduced the number of people who can undertake door-to-door campaigning.A group of five people, including candidates, but excluding security personnel, is allowed to campaign from door to door.For road shows, the convoy of vehicles should be broken after every five vehicles instead of 10 vehicles.The interval between two sets of convoy of vehicles should be half an hour instead of a gap of 100 metres.The EC has revised the norms of the number of people accompanying the candidate and number of vehicles at the time of nomination.It has also created an optional facility to fill the nomination form and the affidavit online and submission of the same, after taking a print, before the returning officer concerned.For the first time, the candidates will have the option to deposit the security amount for contesting the elections online.

Is the situation right for elections?” he asked.The Election Commission on Friday announced dates for the Bihar assembly elections, which will be held in three phases -- on October 28, November 3 and November 7 -- while the counting of votes will take place on November 10.Raut said the issue of passage of farm sector Bills in the Parliament will have no impact on the elections in Bihar as the state votes “only on the basis of caste and religion”.Replying to a question if actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death will become an election issue in Bihar, the Shiv Sena MP alleged, “The government there does not have any issues related to development or governance to speak about.”       “What happened to the CBI probe in Sushant case? The Bihar DGP has now resigned and will be contesting Assembly polls,” Raut claimed.Former Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey has been in line of fire of non-BJP parties in Maharashtra after he sought a CBI probe into Rajput’s death and then opted for voluntary retirement amid speculation of his electoral foray in that state. Pandey stepped down late on Tuesday night.When asked about the proposed film city in Uttar Pradesh, Raut said, “It’s a good proposal. Uttar Pradesh is an important state in the country and the entertainment business offers employment opportunities.”He said film cities should come up in all states.“With the abrogation of Article 370, a film city should also be set up in Kashmir valley,” he said.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently announced that the country’s “biggest” film city would be set up in his state.

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut's bungalow: HC asks if BMC demolished only ongoing construction||The Bombay High Court on Friday asked if all the structures at actor Kangana Ranaut's bungalow which the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished on September 9 were under construction, or if they existed earlier.A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla, hearing the actor's petition against the demolition, also asked why the BMC pulled down several structures on the ground floor.As per the BMC, Ranaut had carried out several alterations without permission at her Pali Hill bungalow here, which were first noticed on September 5.The court wanted to know whether alterations, illegal or not, existed prior to that, because under section 354 A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, the BMC can stop only "ongoing" illegal construction.Ranaut has already stated in her amended petition that she had photos from a pooja ceremony conducted in January 2020 and photos from Elle Dcor magazine issue of April-May 2020 which show that demolished portions existed back then.Therefore, the BMC's allegation that illegal work was going on was false, her plea said.The actor maintained that she did not carry out any illegal construction, and whatever alterations were made, they existed prior to the BMC's action.Ranaut's lawyer, senior counsel Birendra Saraf told the bench on Friday that when the civic body served a demolition notice, only some waterproofing work was going on, and she had the requisite permissions for it."Notwithstanding the fact that there has never been any illegal work carried out, the portions that the BMC has said to be ongoing illegal construction, existed prior to when the illegality was allegedly detected," Saraf said.He also pointed out that the photos submitted in court by the BMC on Friday did not have any digital time stamp but only a note dating them to September 5.The court asked senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who appeared for the BMC, to ask the BMC officer who took the photos to submit his phone to the court, so that it can be ascertained when the photos were taken."We will be examining whether this work was an ongoing work," the court said and asked Ranaut's lawyer to inform, on the next date, whether all demolished portions existed in the same form in January 2020.The court also noted that the BMC in its affidavit had said that Ranaut had changed the position of the entrance of the ground floor, but many more things on the ground floor were demolished."What we are thinking is, how was the ground floor demolished if there is no ongoing work there. The only thing shown is that the position of the entrance gate is changed, there is no ongoing work shown on the ground floor."Whatever they have alleged in the affidavit regarding the ground floor, is all already done (in the past). So how was the ground floor demolished," it asked.Saraf said the entire action was malicious, which was proved by the fact that the BMC took action after Ranaut made some critical remarks about the Maharashtra government.The arguments will continue on Monday.

It is implemented at every government and government-aided primary school. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cag-finds-deficiencies-in-gujarat-mid-day-meal-implementation-146427

No manufacturing of blended edible vegetable oil with mustard oil as an ingredient shall be allowed with effect from this date,” the FSSAI said.

25-09-2020||---||Pak, Nepal PM’s address to precede Modi's UNGA speech||New Delhi, September 25India will keenly watch the addresses by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and Pakistan at the UN General Assembly on Friday night as it seeks to consolidate partnerships in the neighbourhood following deterioration in its bilateral ties with China.Prime Ministers KP Sharma Oli and Imran Khan will be addressing the high level segment of the UN General Assembly a day before PM Narendra Modi delivers his speech on Saturday by video conferencing.Oli’s address would reveal whether Nepal has been suitably mollified with the activation of the SAARC mechanism in which it is the chair.A birthday phone call from Oli to PM Modi besides Nepal putting the map controversy on the backburner suggests a reduction in diplomatic hostilities over a strip of land with India.Having crossed swords at every multilateral meeting, sources here do not expect Pakistan to give up its criticism of the situation in Jammu & Kashmir but Imran Khan’s speech will be too late in the night to elicit an Indian response, which will in all likelihood be wrapped in PM Modi’s speech the next day.India, Nepal and Pakistan are caught in an interesting triangle as far as the SAARC is concerned. Nepal found itself in the regional spotlight when it chaired a meeting of the SAARC Foreign Ministers and it will find itself at the forefront as more and more of the regional organisation’s mechanisms are activated.However, more of such meetings will propel the SAARC towards holding a summit, which by turn will be held in Pakistan. This is a possibility that India wants to avert until Pakistan stops abetting cross-border terrorism.India with the help of Maldives managed to avert a discussion on a possible Summit during Thursday’s SAARC Foreign Ministers’ video-conference. One of the agenda items was the next Summit be hosted by Pakistan but Maldives set the pace by observing that the ongoing pandemic was not the right time to take up such a proposal.As the SAARC, like most multilateral bodies, operates by consensus, even one objection can stall a proposal. In this case, other countries too agreed with Maldives, nixing the move for now.Speaking at the SAARC Foreign Ministers’ meeting, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had indicated the template Pakistan needed to follow in order to be eligible for holding the SAARC summit. “Cross-border terrorism, blocking connectivity and obstructing trade are three key challenges that the SAARC must overcome,’’ he had said in his opening remarks.Pakistan PM’s observations during his UNGA speech will likely set the tone for PM Modi’s reply the next day. But the hostile statements exchanged after the SAARC Ministerial meeting do not suggest a rapprochement with Pakistan is at hand while India is actively mending fences and financially bailing out neighbours in fiscal trouble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-nepal-pms-address-to-precede-modis-unga-speech-146415

That the new Japanese PM puts India high up on his dialing list confirms the next regime’s interest in sustaining the close ties.“The two leaders agreed that the India-Japan Special Strategic and Global Partnership has made great advances over the last few years and expressed their intention to further strengthen this relationship based upon mutual trust and shared values,’’ said an official news release.The two leaders concurred that the partnership between the two countries is even more relevant in today’s times given the global challenges, including that of the Covid pandemic.“They emphasised that the economic architecture of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region must be premised on resilient supply chains, and in this context, welcomed cooperation between India, Japan and other like-minded countries,’’ added the statement.The PM invited Suga to visit India for the Annual Bilateral Summit, after improvement of the situation caused by the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-japans-suga-yoshihide-speak-over-phone-agree-to-boost-ties-146413

25-09-2020||Mumbai||Rhea Chakraborty procured drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput through her brother Showik: NCB||Rhea Chakraborty used to procure drugs through her brother Showik and supply them to her boyfriend and actor Sushant Singh Rajput, a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officer said here on Friday.The probe into drugs angle of the Rajput death case led the bureau to the discovery of several "linkages" or drug supply networks, he said.The NCB is probing the drugs case related to Rajput's death as well as an alleged nexus between Bollywood and drug peddlers.Showik Chakraborty's name came up during the interrogation of alleged drug peddler Basit Parihar, a resident of suburban Bandra, the official said.Parihar allegedly revealed that he used to procure `bud' (a curated form of marijuana) and weed for his friend Showik.During questioning, Showik accepted that he used to procure weed and bud through Parihar and Kaizan Ebrahim and pass them to his sister Rhea who gave it to Sushant, the official said.Rajput's manager Samuel Miranda and cook Dipesh Sawant used to collect the contraband and make `joints' (marijuana cigarettes) for the deceased actor, he claimed.The starting point of the entire probe was some WhatsApp chats about drugs that the Enforcement Directorate came across in its money laundering probe against Rhea and her family. The ED informed the NCB about these conversations."Based on network analysis undertaken on technical level, the linkages were explored and one of the nodes of the drugs network was busted on the intervening night of August 27 and 28," the official said.Abbas Lakhani and Karn Arora were arrested during this raid and bud were seized from their possession, he said.It led the NCB to Zaid Vilatra, who runs an eatery in Bandra. Zaid was held and Rs 9.55 lakh, USD 2,081, 180 British Pounds and 15 Dirhams were recovered from his possession, the official said.Zaid allegedly disclosed that these were proceeds of drug peddling. He also said that his eatery business suffered greatly during lockdown, so he took to peddling drugs, mainly bud.It was his interrogation which led the NCB to Basit Parihar, the official said.Kaizan Ebrahim's questioning led the bureau to Anuj Keshwani, his alleged drug supplier. From Keshwani's house in Bandra, 585 gm of charas, 270 gm for ganja and small quantities of THC and LSD were also seized along with Rs 1.85 lakh in cash.Following his arrest, "Karanjeet, Fernandis, Gupta, Aftaab Mohammad, Ankush and Sanket" were apprehended, the official said.Rhea and Showik are now in judicial custody alongwith other arrested accused.The NCB has so far recorded statements of Bollywood talent manager Jaya Saha, Rajput's former manager Shruti Modi, producer Madhu Mantenna, fashion designer Simone Khambatta actor Rakul Preet Singh and actor Deepika Padukone's manager Karishma Prakash.

Most of these 27 seats fell vacant when rebel Congress members resigned from the party and the assembly to join the BJP. With the resignations of the Congress members, the Kamal Nath-led government fell and the BJP returned to power.The bypoll to the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar has been pending.One assembly seat each in Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka and West Bengal; two seats each in Assam, Jharkhand, Kerala, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu and Odisha; five assembly seats in Manipur and eight each in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are also vacant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/call-on-bypolls-on-september-29-cec-arora-146402

The last email received from the concerned summoned person is only regarding joining the investigation."Deepika was summoned on Wednesday by the NCB to appear before the drug law enforcement agency in a drugs related case after her alleged chats with her former manager Karishma Prakash came to light.Deepika was earlier asked to join the probe on Friday, however, on her request the agency asked her to depose before it on Saturday.An NCB source said that Deepika will be questioned if she consumed drugs. If yes she will be asked since when and from where she used to procure the drugs for her consumption. How did she make the payment for the drugs, who all along with her consumed the drugs, whether the drugs were meant for her consumption alone or also for others, the source added.Following the summons Deepika, who was shooting in Goa for her upcoming film, travelled back to Mumbai late in the evening accompanied by her husband by a chartered flight.In the alleged chats, the actor was asking her manager if she has "maal" weed and not hash. The alleged chats date back to October 28, 2017 between Karishma and Deepika in a group, where late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's former talent manager Jaya Saha was also a group member.Besides, Deepika, actors Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan will also be questioned by the NCB on Saturday.Earlier in the day, the NCB recorded the statement of Bollywood actor Rakul Preet Singh who was questioned for over 4 hours, while Dharma Productions executive producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad and Deepika's former manager Karishma were also questioned for several hours.The NCB has already arrested Sushant's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik along with 18 others in the drugs case.The NCB registered the case on the basis of the Enforcement Directorate probing the money laundering charges in Sushant's death case after it recovered several alleged chats related to drug consumption and procurement.

25-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Bihar elections: why BJP/NDA definitely needs to win the upcoming polls||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 25Though the BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the fact is the saffron party has not been faring well in Assembly elections almost since 2018. The trend that started with the Assembly elections in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in 2018 and continued with Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi and Jharkhand in 2019.And this happened despite a spectacular performance by the party in the Lok Sabha earlier in the year under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Since then, the party has managed to topple governments in Karnataka and MP and form one in Haryana in alliance with the party it fought against, the JJP. The decrease in vote share in Jharkhand in 2019 may be a cause for worry in neighbouring Bihar, where elections were today announced by the Election Commission.Notably, the Jharkhand result was partly attributed to the huge dip in BJP’s vote share in urban areas which benefited the JMM and its allies. This may be a cause for worry for the NDA allies in Bihar (BJP, JD-U and LJP), who are yet to resolve seat-sharing and other issues.Though the BJP believes that it has the upper hand given the state of the Opposition in Bihar, those associated with grass-roots believe “the ground reality there, like in Jharkhand (Assembly elections). is far from what it appears from far”.“If you think Sushant Singh Rajput (late Bollywood star from Bihar) is an issue, think again. Ram Mandir is no issue in the state where anything related to ‘Mandal Commission’ (reservation) still has the potential to knock down a party as it happened with the BJP in 2015.“The backward classes, the EBCs, the Muslim community etc, their votes and issues will decide the fate of parties, upper castes have their own grievances. The floods have played havoc and large tracks of farmlands have been submerged, parties have to keep all that in mind,” they say.BJP’s focus areas include Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s self-reliance pitch (Atmanirbhar Bihar) and monetary help, rations and the MNREGA jobs to migrants after they reached Bihar during the COVID lockdown.With JD-U’s Nitish Kumar as its face, the party also expects dividends from the three agri-reform bills. The MSP and the APMC are not an issue in Bihar but anti-incumbency is a factor, leaders say.BJP president JP Nadda is learnt to have asked the party MPs to work not only for ensuring victory for the party candidates but also the nominees of constituents of the NDA and project unity in the alliance.Whether status quo in Bihar or winds of change, as the BJP prepares to roll out its high pitch e-blitzkrieg powered by money and resources the question is can the rivals match it to turn the situation in their favour.‘Digital raths’ and ‘e-electioneering’ are the new normal in the COVID times. So far, the saffron party is concerned, it has an edge over the others on digital and social media, and high-tech campaigns as it is more experienced than others.The upcoming Bihar elections will not just test parties but also voters of the state where caste combinations, social situations and poverty continue to be the biggest issues.This time, there is more.According to political observers, the combination of coronavirus pandemic, resultant migrant crisis and job losses, and recent floods have the potential to lead to “some unexpected results”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-why-bjp-nda-definitely-needs-to-win-the-upcoming-polls-146383

25-09-2020||New Delhi||Nearly seven crore tests conducted in India for detection of COVID-19||A record 14,92,409 tests have been conducted for detection of COVID-19 in a span of 24 hours, taking the total tests done so far in the country to nearly 7 crores, while the national cumulative positivity rate stands at 8.44 per cent, the Union Health Ministry said on Friday.    The Tests Per Million (TPM) stand at 49,948 as of today, it said.    This exponential surge in the daily testing capacities strongly demonstrates the determined escalation of the testing infrastructure in the country, the ministry said."Evidence has revealed that higher numbers of testing subsequently leads to lowered positivity rate. States that are testing the highest numbers are also reporting a gradual decline in the positivity rate," the ministry said."India has scaled a historic peak in the fight against COVID-19. In a landmark achievement, for the first time, a record-high number of nearly 15 lakh COVID-19 tests have been conducted in a single day taking the cumulative tests conducted so far to 6,89,28,440," it said.With the expansion of the testing infrastructure, the daily testing by states and UTs have also increased. As many as 23 states and UTs including Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Punjab and Telangana have better tests per million than the national average (49,948).As reiterated by the prime minister while reviewing the status and preparedness of seven states and UTs with a high burden of caseload recently, testing forms an integral pillar of COVID-19 response and management.  The Centre's three-pronged strategy of 'test, track and treat' begins with testing. With the "Chase the virus" approach, the Union Government aims to catch every missing person through testing to curb the spread of the infection.  Several measures have been taken by the Union Government through calibrated steps to widen the testing net and ensure easier and more accessible testing by all across the country. States/UTs have been empowered with the flexibility to ensure higher testing. They have been advised that all symptomatic negatives of Rapid Antigen Tests are mandatorily subjected to RT-PCR.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nearly-seven-crore-tests-conducted-in-india-for-detection-of-covid-19-146372

In COVID-19, we inject heparin drug subcutaneously which ultimately reaches the blood stream, and this is done to prevent embolism in these patients which can prove fatal," he told PTI.Embolism is sudden blocking of an artery which can obstruct flow of oxygen, and that is why some patients get complications even after treatment, the doctor said.RGSSH is a dedicated COVID-19 facility run by the Delhi government."In dengue, on the other hand, platelets infusion is needed in cases where its count has fallen to dangerously low level. So, it's kind of opposite. And, therefore, we can't inject heparin if a COVID-19 patient has dengue too," Sherwal said.So, for a treating doctor or it is like "walking a tight rope" and a very "finely balanced approach" is needed, he said.Sources at LNJP Hospital said "there is no standard protocol" for  treatment of double infection of COVID-19 and dengue, and treatment is "patient-specific".LNJP Hospital is the largest hospital under Delhi government and a dedicated COVID-19 facility."The patient's age, condition, co-morbidities and other factors are taken into account for treatment of both the ailments," a source said.Asked if there are any side effects of treatments in cases of a "double infection", the source said, "any treatment can have a side effect, but the treating doctor decides the methodology for it".A dengue patient, if his or her platelets level falls dangerously below the normal level, needs external platelets infusion.A normal platelets level is considered in the range of 1.5-4.5 lakh, according to doctors."If a patient needs plasma for COVID-19 treatment, he can be administered that, and if he needs platelets that too can be infused. The treating doctor will decide the course of treatment," the source said.       Common symptoms of COVID-19 are high fever, breathlessness, cough, body fatigue and loss of sense of smell and taste.In dengue, a vector-born disease caused by aedes agypti mosquito, a person runs high fever, suffers red rashes on skin, pain behind eye sockets, joint pain and in serious case internal bleeding which can prove fatal."In about 10 per cent of dengue cases, a patient suffers haemorrhagic fever which leads to deaths. Internal bleeding can manifest through nose, gums and those are danger signs," Sherwal said. Recently, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain, himself a COVID-19 survivor, had told reporters that about 2-3 patients of COVID-19 in Delhi had shown dengue infection too."We have managed to contain dengue the year. Our campaign '10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute' was very effective last year, and this year too dengue situation in Delhi is in control," he had said.

The new agriculture laws will enslave our farmers,” former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted with the hashtag ‘I Support Bharat Bandh’.A flawed GST destroyed MSMEs.The new agriculture laws will enslave our Farmers.#ISupportBharatBandh  Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi also hit out at the government, saying the three farm bills brought by it are reminiscent of the “East India Company rule”.The MSP (minimum support price) of the farmers would be “snatched away” and they would be forced to become slaves of billionaires through contract farming, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.“Neither will they get the price nor respect. Farmers will become labourers in their own land,” she alleged.किसानों से MSP छीन ली जाएगी। उन्हें कांट्रेक्ट फार्मिंग के जरिए खरबपतियों का गुलाम बनने पर मजबूर किया जाएगा।न दाम मिलेगा, न सम्मान।किसान अपने ही खेत पर मजदूर बन जाएगा। भाजपा का कृषि बिल ईस्ट इंडिया कम्पनी राज की याद दिलाता है।हम ये अन्याय नहीं होने देंगे।#BharatBandh  “BJP’s agriculture bills are a reminder of the East India Company rule. We will not allow this injustice to happen,” she added, using the hashtag ‘Bharat Bandh’.Congress’ chief spokesperson Surjewala said the party joined farmers in their struggle.“Farmers are protesting with Bharat Bandh. Their livelihood is being snatched away and the Modi government has attacked their farms,” he said in a video message. “There is chaos everywhere. Modi ji swears by farmers but stays true to his friendship with crony capitalist friends,” Surjewala alleged.The Congress and farmers would struggle together and would never allow the Modi government to “mortgage farmers and agriculture at the doorstep of crony capitalists”, he said.पेट में अंगारे और मन में तूफ़ाँ लिए देश का अन्नदाता किसान और भाग्यविधाता खेत मज़दूर #भारत_बंद करने को मजबूर है।अहंकारी मोदी सरकार को न उसके मन की व्यथा दिखती न उसकी आत्मा की पीड़ा महसूस होती।आइये, भारत बंध में किसान-मज़दूर के साथ खड़े हों, संघर्ष का संकल्प लें।#BharatBandh pic.twitter.com/I7I23v9bpp  The three bills are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The Congress, along with many other opposition parties, has claimed that the farm Bills would harm the interest of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted the bills will be beneficial for farmers and increase their income.

25-09-2020||New Delhi||Farm Bills to benefit small, marginal farmers most, says Modi||Hitting out at the opposition at its attack on his government over the farm bills issue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that those who always "lied" to farmers are now "shooting from their shoulders" and misleading them for their own political benefit.Addressing BJP leaders and workers on the birth anniversary of party's ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay, Modi asked them to reach out to farmers on the ground and inform them about details and benefits of the new agriculture reforms and how these would empower them.“Our ground connect will finish off the propaganda being spread about the reforms,” he said.Modi said small and marginal farmers, who constituted 85 per cent of the peasant community, would benefit the most from these reforms which, he added, gave them an option to sell their produce outside agriculture 'mandis' for a better price.Attacking the Congress, which has been trying to mount a nationwide protest against these bills, Modi said hollow slogans were given in favour of farmers and workers for many decades since Independence and governments at the Centre and states were formed in their name.All that farmers and labourers got was a jumbled web of promises and laws, he said.Modi said those who always lied to farmers are now "shooting from their shoulders" and misleading them."They are spreading rumours. Saving farmers from such rumours and explaining the importance of the agriculture reforms is the responsibility and duty of all BJP workers because we have to make the future of farmers bright," Modi said.The three bills passed by Parliament are the Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The Congress, along with many other opposition parties, has claimed that the bills will harm the interest of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted that the proposed laws will be beneficial for farmers and increase their income.The Prime Minister also lauded the new labour laws passed by Parliament in the Monsoon session, asserting that they would ensure timely salary for over 50 crore organised and unorganised workers.In his address, Modi said his government had been very clear that it should not excessively interfere in the lives of those who did not need the government."The government must use its resources more on the deprived and the marginalised," he said."This birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal ji is even more relevant as the reformist decisions taken by the government in recent times had the imprint of the vision shown by him," he said."Every BJP government, Central or state, is trying to ensure that every individual feels included in the growth of the nation and doesn't feel ignored," he said, adding that "this is our motivation moving ahead".It is fitting that faceless assessment of tax filings, one of the biggest reforms in our tax system, comes into effect from today on Deendayal Upadhyay's birth anniversary, he noted. "Our mantra and karma is nation first," he asserted. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-bills-to-benefit-small-marginal-farmers-most-says-modi-146353

25-09-2020||New Delhi||NCB 'cloned' mobile phones of Rhea Chakraborty for access to WhatsApp chats of film stars||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) cloned the mobile phones of Rhea Chakraborty and others, which gave them access to the WhatsApp chats of film stars.The cloning of Rhea's mobile phone was done by the NCB during an investigation into a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case.Now concerns have been expressed over the safety of WhatsApp chats on social media. Some have questioned whether Facebook is making a genuine claim that WhatsApp's privacy is guaranteed by end-to-end encryption, citing that probe agencies are now using WhatsApp chats as evidence.WhatsApp released a late-night statement on Thursday to clarify its stand on the matter.In the statement, WhatsApp spokesperson said, "WhatsApp protects your messages with end-to-end encryption so that only you and the person you're communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between can access it, not even WhatsApp. It's important to remember that people sign up on WhatsApp using only a phone number, and WhatsApp doesn't have access to your message content."WhatsApp follows guidance provided by operating system manufacturers for on-device storage and we encourage people to take advantage of all the security features provided by operating systems such as strong passwords or biometric IDs to prevent third parties from accessing content stored on device."  The NCB's investigation in the drugs case linked to Sushant Singh Rajput's death case has caught up with several Bollywood A listers after their WhatsApp chats over banned drugs surfaced.Some WhatsApp chats have surfaced in the media, reportedly between Rhea and others, and the probe agency is now focused on a group chat from 2017, allegedly between Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone and her manager Karishma Prakash.The WhatsApp chats seem to have been retrieved from Jaya Saha, who was interrogated by the NCB. Jaya was also Sushant Singh Rajput's talent manager. Jaya, who is part of the Kwan Talent Management Agency, was also on this WhatsApp group with Deepika and Karishma.So how are WhatsApp chats, which were considered private, coming out now?WhatsApp says on its security settings that there is end-to-end encryption for all their messages, but the media and message back-up on Google Drive or any such Cloud services aren't protected by WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption.End-to-end encryption means that the messages are visible only to the sender and the recipient, and not even to WhatsApp.To access encrypted WhatsApp data, security and investigating agencies can take a user's phone and create a 'clone' of it on another device. This gives them access even to deleted messages with a 'mirror image' of a phone after which all data can be transferred to the separate device.Thereafter, it is only a matter of retrieving data, which agencies do by involving forensic experts. They retrieve all kinds of data like phone call records, messages, images, WhatsApp chats, as well as the data on the phone's Cloud service, like Google Drive or iCloud, including anything that has been deleted.The NCB has said that Jaya was questioned about her chats with several other celebrities. The NCB is now probing whether Jaya procured narcotics and banned drugs for these celebrities.Jaya's name emerged after a chat about drugs between her and Rhea, who is in jail in connection with the drugs case, was accessed by the Enforcement Directorate in the PMLA case mentioned earlier.The defence can say that the phone was not used by them during the chat. Or as Rhea said that it was Sushant who asked her to send those messages from her phone.Analysis of WhatsApp chats of Rhea with other entities reflected the angle of conspiracy, the NCB said.Actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor are set to appear before the NCB at its Mumbai office on Saturday in connection with the drugs case. Actor Rakul Preet Singh has also been summoned to appear before the NCB on Friday.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-cloned-mobile-phones-of-rhea-chakraborty-for-access-to-whatsapp-chats-of-film-stars-146339
25-09-2020||Kolkata||Mamata insists on adequate caution for Durga Puja||Marquees open from all sides, applying sanitisers on the hands of the spectators at least half a kilometre ahead of the venue and distribution of free masks to spectators who might too poor to afford one, are some of the measures suggested by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to the organisers of the Durga Puja festival here.Durga Puja – the biggest annual religious and cultural event in the state’s calendar – is slated to take place in the last week of October. Known for attracting huge crowds, the festival is seen as fraught with danger this time owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing a gathering of puja organisers at the Netaji Indoor Stadium in the city, Mamata admitted that she was at the horns of a dilemma with regards to “Durga Puja”. Without naming the BJP, she said there were people who would criticise her if Durga Puja was not allowed this year. But, at the same time, she would be held responsible if the puja was followed by a spike in corona cases, Mamata rued.The Chief Minister, however, said she had no right to stop people from celebrating the festival. However, it should be organised with adequate caution so that the festival does not lead to an increase in the number of coronavirus cases, she said.Over 37,000 public pujas would be held in the state this year. Areas falling under the jurisdiction of Kolkata Police would see 2,509 pujas while 34,700 pujas would take place in areas controlled by the state police. There will also be 1,706 all-women pujas.The Chief Minister requested the organisers to keep all four sides of the marquees open and ensure that those who enter the marquee to see the idol maintain sufficient distance from each other. Volunteers carrying sanitiser bottles should apply sanitisers on the hands of all those coming to see the idols. Volunteers should also carry masks and offer the masks to those not wearing one. Women should not hesitate to wear masks, the Chief Minister said.Banerjee also announced a slew of benefits for various sections including puja committees. She announced Rs 50,000 (fifty thousand) dole for each committee – a 100 per cent jump over what they got last year. The Chief Minister said since puja committees were not getting enough sponsorship and advertisement from corporates owing to the slowdown, so she decided to come to their aid.Mamata also announced Rs 2,000 (two thousand) as a one-time grant for hawkers. The hawkers suffered heavily during the lockdown, she said. Eighty-one thousand (81,000) hawkers would benefit from the step.The Chief Minister also announced increasing the monthly salary of the ASHA (National Rural Health Mission) workers and Civic Volunteers by Rs 1000 and post-retirement benefit of Rs 3 lakh for the Anganwadi workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-insists-on-adequate-caution-for-durga-puja-146337

I appreciate the sentiments of your daughter Ishita Achar towards our jawans and her awareness of the safety measures during the COVID-19. I wish your daughter all the best for her future endeavours,” the letter said.Ishita Achar told the media that she was extremely happy and excited to have received a personal letter of appreciation from the Defence Minister himself.Ishita Achar had stitched the masks during the lockdown period, responding to a call from Bharat Scouts and Guides state commissioner and former Minister PGR Sindhia asking its members to prepare face masks for Class 10 students appearing for the SSLC examination.The masks were sent to the jawans as suggested by a family friend as there was enough stock for students, Ishita's mother said.

25-09-2020||Washington||Trump hopes India, China would be able to resolve border differences||US President Donald Trump hoped on Thursday that India and China would be able to resolve their current border disputes as he reiterated his offer to help the two Asian giants."I know that China now, and India, are having difficulty, and very very substantial difficulty. And hopefully, they will be able to work that out," Trump told reporters at the White House."If we can help, we would love to help," he said.The president's remarks in this regard come days after senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held talks aimed at resolving the months-long standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The two countries agreed to stop sending more troops to their disputed border in the Himalayas.Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that the border conflict is pushing India to look for an asymmetric response: flexing its naval might."India is intensifying joint naval maneuvers with the US and its allies while building new ships and setting up a network of coastal surveillance outposts that would allow New Delhi to keep an eye on the Indian Ocean's maritime traffic," the newspaper said.A "Grand Tamasha" podcast with senior fellow and director of the South Asia Program of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, eminent American expert on India and South Asia Ashley Tellis said the Trump administration has taken a very transparent position of support for India in this crisis."And, of course, it is motivated in part by the opportunities to confront China on a grander scale, which sort of makes it part and parcel of the US's own bilateral problems with China. But I think there is something more going on here. And the more is that I do not think the United States had the alternative of doing otherwise."That is, Chinese aggression in this instance has been so blatant that the United States could not stand by and either ignore it or not come to India's defence," said Tellis, the Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs."What are the issues here? We all agree that those borderlands along the Himalayan territories are undefined. We all agree that they should be negotiated, delimited, demarcated through a peaceful process. We all agree that the agreements that China and India have repeatedly reached among themselves since the 1990s actually offer a good enough framework for how to resolve this dispute over the long term," he added.What China has done is that it has thrown all those understandings overboard, Tellis said."And it is very important to recognise this that whatever the provocations may have been, the provocations created by Article 370 or whatever, I do not think they justified a reaction of this kind. Because a diplomatic provocation should have, you know, elicited a diplomatic response, rather than a quick jump to military action, which has enormous risks."By China taking the step to move quickly to military action, which has now resulted in loss of lives, I think it has put itself on the opposite side of the United States, which is arguing more loudly than ever for a rules-based community," he added."And so, even beyond the Trump administration's own bilateral problems with China, I think they were left in absolutely no position but to support India on this count and I think even a Democratic administration would have done the same in these circumstances," Tellis said.

We have allocated additional USD 3.5 billion from the state budget for this cause. Work is being executed in mission mode,” he said.“This would significantly contribute to the global efforts to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius target,” he said.Kumar said Bihar looks forward to support from the international community to design and achieve a carbon-neutral future.Citing Mahatma Gandhi, who had said that the Earth has enough to satisfy everyone's need, but not everyone's greed, Kumar stressed that the “global community should remember this while formulating any development strategy.”Kumar was speaking in the segment titled ‘Aligning Nationally Determined Contributions, long-term low emission development strategies, COVID-19 recovery packages and business plans with the 1.5C and carbon neutrality by 2050 goals'.Speaking at the event, Guterres called for every government, business, civil and international organisation in the world to develop a transition plan to net-zero emissions, and boost ambition in finance and adoption as an equal priority to cutting emissions, and the only way to reach the 1.5C temperature goal.“All actors - governments, cities and companies, NGOs and international organisations need to have their own transition plans to net-zero before 2050,” said the Secretary-General.To harness the growing momentum, the Roundtable also included the announcement of a virtual Climate Ambition Summit on the 5th Anniversary of the Paris Agreement on December 12.“The fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on December 12 , 2020, which will gather leaders from governments, business and civil society, will be an important moment to continue raising climate ambition. I look forward to working closely on this event with the leaders of Chile, the United Kingdom, France and others to deliver increased ambition,” the Secretary-General said.The Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Climate Finance Mark Carney said of the private finance: "It's not just moving, it's moving fast.”“The private financial sector is moving. We are at a tipping point. It is not just momentum. The decisiveness of your climate policies and the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions), and the decisiveness of the action you take over the course of next year will allow the private sector to amplify and pull forward that adjustment in a virtuous cycle. That can help us achieve our goals.”Carney also said there were calls from every major bank, the world's largest insurers, biggest pension funds and top asset managers for the disclosure of climate-related financial information.He said this support is truly global, stemming from almost 60 countries and with a market cap of almost USD 13 trillion and financial institutions responsible for assets of 150 trillion pounds.

But it raised the Kashmir issue at another regional meeting of foreign ministers held on Thursday under the CICA format.Pakistan and some of its fellow travellers, principally Turkey and Malaysia, have chosen to be irredentist over Kashmir at several multilateral forums even though convention strictly bars them from raising bilateral issues.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar sought to turn the tables by listing the three key challenges that have inhibited SAARC from achieving a fraction of its potential — cross-border terrorism, blocking connectivity and obstructing trade. Though Jaishankar did not mention Pakistan, it is universally acknowledged that Pakistan army has been discouraging connectivity and trade, while encouraging border terrorism.“Only then we will see enduring peace, prosperity and security in our South Asia region,” he said.For most of the conference, individual ministers spent most of their allotted time in stressing on the need for a regional approach to stop the spread of Covid and highlighting their country’s efforts in this direction.While SAARC saw countries eschewing bilateral agendas, another virtual meeting of foreign ministers saw Pakistan raking up the Kashmir issue with India exercising its right to reply to rebut its claims and charges.The two countries were participating in the 27-member Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/saarc-needs-to-deal-with-terrorism-says-jaishankar-145984

The meeting was critical to ensuring stability on the ground, he said. It was decided not to increase troops on the border or unilaterally change the status quo. These steps were essential in view of the past two instances of extreme aggression that led to shots being fired on the LAC.The way ahead: MEAIt is unusual for the Foreign Office to comment on the meeting of senior military commanders although the last round of talks was not a purely military affair and included representation from the MEA.Srivastava hoped the way ahead would be to refrain from making any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo, while the two sides continue their discussions to achieve complete disengagement. He said the two sides have decided to hold the next meeting of the senior commanders at the earliest, besides a meeting of the inter-ministerial MEA-led working mechanism on consultation and coordination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-committed-to-disengaging-at-lac-145985
