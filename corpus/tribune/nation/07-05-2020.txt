Jaishankar had a 30-minute conversation with his Japanese counterpart Motegi Toshimitsu during which both touched on the most pressing agenda for diplomats during the epidemic – repatriation of each other’s nationals.The Japanese Foreign Minister also called for the resumption of activities by Japanese companies in India.As was the case with Khalilzad, during which Doval and Jaishankar discussed the situation in Afghanistan, the Jaishankar-Toshimitsu talks touched on core foreign policy issues of further tightening their security and defence ties in the context of a volatile situation in the South China Sea.Motegi expressed his intention to strongly resume the advancement in bilateral relations, including the follow-up on the Japan-India 2+2 Foreign and Defence Ministerial Meeting, as well as the economy and economic cooperation, once the situation calms down, said a Japanese Foreign Office readout of the talks via videoconferencing.“Discussed return of our nationals in the COVID situation. Also dwelt on economic recovery challenges, including supply chain resilience. Our Indo-Pacific partnership will be even more important in the coming days,” Jaishankar posted on the social media.In talks with Khalilzad, the MEA said India emphasised that putting an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries (in Pakistan) was necessary for enduring and sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan. India also said it was deeply concerned at the upsurge in violence and supported the call for immediate ceasefire.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-representative-meets-s-jaishankar-ajit-doval-81710

I am the president elected lawfully and will continue to serve you till my term is over. This attempt violates every cannon of procedure and law and has no legs to stand,” Dave said in a communication to SCBA members.Terming Arora’s action as “illegal and improper”, he said it was unfortunate that the meeting was being organised despite the SCBA Executive Committee not called for it. Maintaining that he was elected by SCBA members, Dave said it was only the members who will have the power to oust him from the post as the president, and “not some person carrying personal agenda”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/infighting-in-scba-secy-ashok-arora-calls-gbm-to-oust-president-dushyant-dave-81709

We continue to support all British nationals who require assistance.”          The FCO said its flights are aimed at British nationals and depart from regions of India with the highest demand. The focus is also on helping vulnerable non-British UK residents with Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) or permanent residency where possible. Other visa categories may also be accommodated where possible, the FCO said.Seats on the charter flights are allocated to those already registered, with confirmations of the flight sent directly alongside information on how to get to airports once the seat is confirmed.The latest tranche of UK flights comes as the Indian government also began the repatriation process for its nationals stranded abroad, with specially commissioned Air India flights set to fly between London Heathrow Airport and Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru from this weekend.

07-05-2020||New Delhi||Policy on vehicle scrapping soon, says Gadkari||The vehicle scrappage policy is likely to be finalised soon to boost the automobile sector, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday.The Minister for Road Transport and Highways also said his ministry had fixed a target to build highways worth Rs 15 lakh crore in the next two years."The scrapping policy will be finalised soon. It is going to boost the industry. It is going to reduce the production cost. Yesterday also, I had a discussion with the Secretary and we will make it as early as possible," Gadkari said in a video-conference with the members of SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) Institute over impact of COVID-19 on the automobile sector.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in February had said a policy for scrapping of old vehicles “is in the works” and will be announced after concerned ministries “fine tune” it.The vehicle scrappage policy is awaiting the final clearance from the Union Cabinet, which will focus on eliminating the fleet of old polluting commercial vehicles plying on the country's roads.The proposed policy, once approved, will be applicable to all vehicles, including two and three-wheelers.Earlier, the policy was sent for a fresh round of consultation with stakeholders on the direction of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).Gadkari had earlier said once the policy was approved, India could emerge as a hub for automobile manufacturing as key raw material available from scrapping like steel, aluminium and plastic are bound to be recycled, bringing down automobile prices by "20-30 per cent".The government on July 26, 2019 had proposed amendments to the motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.In a draft notification, the government proposed renewal of fitness certificates for vehicles older than 15 years every six months instead of the current time-frame of one year.The notification also provided that the newly purchased motor vehicles will be exempted for payment of fees for registration certificate and assignment of new registration mark, if the purchaser produces scrapping certificate of the previously-owned vehicle of the same category issued by the authorised scrapping centre/agency.In May 2016, the government had floated a draft voluntary vehicle fleet modernisation programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road.Addressing SIAM members, Gadkari said for highways, he had set a target of building Rs 15 lakh crore worth of roads in the next two years and added that the road construction pace had reached 30 km a day now.He also suggested exploring cheaper credits, including foreign capital for enhancing liquidity in the automobile manufacturing sector."We should look at foreign funds, pension funds, foreign banks, foreign agencies, World Bank, ADB.... NHAI track record is very good. Now we have 480 bankable projects worth more than Rs 4 lakh crore. These are projects which are economically viable and the internal rate of return is good,” he said."By adding land acquisition cost to the projects the banks can finance these for 30 years," the minister said, adding that he had a meeting with the RBI Governor in this regard for permitting finance to infrastructure projects for 30 years.The minister suggested to focus on enhancing liquidity in business saying ups and downs are common and urged the industry to convert COVID-19 into an opportunity of expanding global market share.He stressed that one needs to plan for bad times while working for growth, and added that the industry should focus more on innovation, technology and research skill to become competitive in global market.The minister said his ministry was working overtime to clear all arbitration cases with concessionaires.On the question of BS-IV vehicles, he said the government was bound by the Supreme Court verdict on the same. However, on industry suggestion, he would get the matter examined afresh.Regarding relaxations sought on other regulations, Gadkari stated that he would endeavour to provide relief wherever possible.Gadkari responded to the questions from representatives and assured all possible help from the government. He informed that he would take up the issues at the appropriate level in the government and other departments.The video-conference was also attended by the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways VK Singh and Secretary, Road Transport and Highways, Giridhar Aramane, among other senior officials.During this interaction, members expressed concerns regarding various challenges being faced by industry amid COVID-19 pandemic along with few suggestions and requested support from the government to keep the sector afloat.Gadkari urged them to work with commitment during these challenging times to win the corona war and make India super economic power.

For example, in automobile sector, the companies must use only the ancillary goods manufactured in India.Reports suggest that the Centre is working on a package to attract companies from countries like the USA, Japan and Korea, which are trying to shift base from China to hedge their security in the backdrop of the corona contagion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliates-sound-cautionary-note-to-centre-81688

The sentiments of the followers of Shiv-Shahu (Chhatrapati Shivaji and Shahu Maharaj), including mine, are hurt.”            Replying to the tweet by Chhatrapati Sambhaji, Fadnavis said, “I had asked my office to make the change in the tweet when I learned about the earlier mistake. The thought of disrespecting him (Shahu Maharaj) cannot ever come into my mind. I admit that sentiments of people are hurt. I apologise for it.”In his tweet posted on Wednesday as a tribute to Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, king of the erstwhile princely state of Kolhapur, on his death anniversary, Fadnavis had called him as a “social worker”.Shahu Maharaj, a highly respected social reformer, championed the cause of social equality.Fadnavis, who is currently the Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Assembly, had deleted the tweet after being trolled and criticised over it.However, the screenshot of the BJP leader’s tweet was widely circulated on social media with several political leaders, including Sachin Sawant, general secretary of Maharashtra unit the Congress, criticising him over his post.“Such reference to social reformer Shahu Maharaj reflects the regressive school of thoughts from where he (Fadnavis) comes.

07-05-2020||New Delhi||At over 70,000 in a week, Gujarat sends home most migrant workers in special trains||More than 70,000 migrants, stranded in Gujarat, have been sent home on 65 Shramik Special trains in the last seven days, making it the largest movement of workers from any state on the special services being run during the nationwide lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.According to official data, the state also has 12 more such services planned whereby it will transport more than 13,000 more workers.More than 21,000 migrants from Maharashtra have been able to return home in 21 such trains and around 5,000 more are likely to be transported in four such services which are in the pipeline.As many as 19 trains, carrying more than around 19,000 workers, have left Rajasthan while 18 trains carrying a similar number have left Telangana in the last seven days.Officials said the 24-coach trains carried 54 passengers (72 in normal times) in each coach and had a capacity of 1,200.The guidelines issued by the Railways on the Shramik Special trains said that the responsibility for food, health scanning, providing tickets to the stranded and collecting the fare would be with the state from which the train was originating. It has, however, taken the burden of providing one meal to passengers whose journey will be of 12 hours or more.The Railways had started the migrant special trains on May 1 after the Central Government gave its approval for transportation of stranded workers on the railway network during the lockdown.Earlier, the announcement of the COVID-induced lockdown had resulted in large scale exodus of workers from cities to their home states mostly in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal.So far, Uttar Pradesh has received 38 trains, Bihar 37 trains, Odisha 13, Jharkhand 10 and West Bengal two trains.As of May 8, while Bihar has 13 more trains planned, Uttar Pradesh has 12, Odisha has two and Jharkhand has one service in the pipeline.West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra have no trains planned for arrival of migrants as of May 8, the data shows.Normally, the national transporter said in the guidelines, the Shramik Special trains would be run for distances more than 500 km and would not stop at any station before the destination.Amidst a political slugfest over allegations that the Railways was charging migrants for journeys, the Railways has said it was bearing 85 per cent of the cost of operating these trains, leaving 15 per cent for the states.While the Railways is yet to issue any clarification on its operating costs, officials say that each service is costing the national transporter around Rs 80 lakh.

07-05-2020||Visakhapatnam||Vizag gas leak: What is styrene and how harmful is it||The leakage of Styrene from LG Polymers' plant here in the wee hours of Thursday has brought focus on the nature of the gas and its effects.Used in the manufacturing of polystyrene plastics, fiberglass, rubber, and latex, Styrene is a flammable liquid.According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the US, short-term exposure to Styrene can result in respiratory problems, irritation in the eyes, irritation in the mucous membrane, and gastrointestinal issues.Long-term exposure could drastically affect the central nervous system and lead to other related problems like peripheral neuropathy. It could also lead to cancer and depression in some cases.The symptoms, depending on the degree of exposure, include headache, hearing loss, fatigue, weakness and difficulty in concentrating.According to AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, “Absorption of this compound can affect the central nervous system causing headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. People become unsteady, have difficulty in walking and sometimes also can fall over.”High exposure can lead to coma, pulmonary oedema and irregular heartbeat, he said, adding the syndrome is known as styrene sickness."This gas is not poisonous and hence there is nothing to worry to that extent. If inhaled in large amounts it may be fatal. Gas by itself gives you irritation and causes irritation in mucus membrane," said Director General of Police Gautam Sawang.He said water acts as an antidote to styrene and those with exposure should douse themselves with water and drink a lot of water.The police chief said as per their primary information, styrene is stored in a tank and a level is maintained to ensure that it does not evaporate."There was a neutraliser, but for some reasons it did not act. We will know the reason in the investigations," the DGP said.Preliminary investigations by Andhra Pradesh officials said failure of refrigeration led to gasification and it spread in the villages around the plant. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vizag-gas-leak-what-is-styrene-and-how-harmful-is-it-81679
07-05-2020||Panaji||Plaint against ex-MP for ‘misbehaving’ with intern dentists in Goa||A complaint has been lodged against a former Congress MP for allegedly misbehaving with two female intern dentists at a government-run dental hospital near Panaji after they sought his detailed history as per the COVID-19 guidelines when he went there for treatment, a police official said on Thursday.The complaint was lodged against former Rajya Sabha MP John Fernandes, who was also the Goa unit chief of the Congress in the past.It was filed by Dr Ida de Ataide, dean of the state-run Goa Dental College and Hospital (GDCH), at Agassaim police station on Tuesday.As per the complaint, the incident took place on April 30 when Fernandes arrived at the GDCH, located near Panaji, for his dental treatment.In the complaint, the dean said due to the COVID-19 guidelines, the hospital has started screening the patients who come for treatment at their facility.“Around 10 am, John Fernandes walked into the college with some dental complaints. As per the regulation, a detailed case history was being taken by two female interns at the triage area,” it said.“Fernandes felt he should not be asked such history. However, as the interns insisted on following the protocol, he started using bad words against them and insulting them,” a senior official of Agassaim police station said, quoting the complaint.While asserting that the hospital does not want to involve the interns in the case, the dean said in the complaint that the behaviour of the patient was “unacceptable” and his act of hurling abuses amounts to insulting their modesty.The senior police official said that they are investigating the case.“We will record the statements and also summon the accused,” he said.When contacted, Fernandes said that he has been intimated by the police about the complaint.“The police have told me about the complaint lodged against me. I will record my statement on Friday,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plaint-against-ex-mp-for-misbehaving-with-intern-dentists-in-goa-81676
07-05-2020||New Delhi||Long-term health effects due to styrene vapour exposure less: AIIMS director||The chances of long-term health effects because of exposure to styrene vapour, which leaked from a chemical plant in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, are less, and illnesses caused by the gas was not universally fatal, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Thursday.As far as the treatment was concerned, there was no specific antidote or a definite medicine for reversing the effect of this compound, he said, adding that therapy remained mainly supportive.As many as 11 people have died and 1,000 others exposed to styrene vapour that leaked from a chemical plant in Visakhapatnam in the early hours of Thursday and quickly spread to villages in the five-kilometre radius.A large number of people had been admitted to a hospital, with most being in a stable condition, and hopefully would make a good recovery, Dr Guleria said.Replying to whether the impact of the exposure can be long-term as was in the Bhopal gas tragedy, Dr Guleria said, “The gas doesn’t stay for a very long time. The chances of long-term impact are less as the compound metabolises and leaves the body quickly. This is an acute exposure rather than a chronic exposure. But we will have to follow up and see. As of now, the data doesn’t suggest any significant long-term effect.”Those, who have had a very close exposure, are the ones with a higher chance of experiencing severe effects, he said, adding that a house-to-house visit in the surrounding areas had been initiated to see if anybody had developed medical problems.Dr Guleria said inhalation and ingestion of styrene could affect the skin and the eyes.“Absorption of this compound can affect the central nervous system causing headache, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. People become unsteady, have difficulty in walking and sometimes also can fall over. High exposure can lead to coma, pulmonary edema and irregular heartbeat,” he said, adding the syndrome was known as styrene sickness.“Effect on the skin is usually mild and in the form of irritation, itching and some degree of dermatitis. It causes irritation in the airways, and depending on the degree of the exposure, the effect can be much higher,” the AIIMS director added.He said the first thing that had to be done was to remove individuals from the affected area, as had been done aggressively. Eyes needed to be washed with water while tissues or towel could be used to clean the deposition in the skin, Dr Guleria added.“Individuals have to be monitored for any breathing difficulty or drowsiness because the compound can affect the lungs and the brain,” he said“The main treatment strategy is to watch out for any breathing difficulty and airway management. Some of these patients will be required to be incubated and put on ventilator. Many will just require oxygen therapy and can be monitored in terms of their oxygen requirement, respiratory rate and their CNS depression,” Dr Guleria added.At a press briefing, the Director General of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), SN Pradhan, said leakage from the factory was now minimal but the force’s personnel would be at the spot till it was totally plugged.Pradhan said 500 people belonging to 200 to 250 families living in a 3-km radius had been moved to safer places.Kamal Kishore, member, National Disaster Management Authority, said about 1,000 people living in nearby areas of the factory had been exposed to the gas leak.

07-05-2020||Yash Goyal||More than 150 bats killed in Rajasthan owing to fear of COVID-19 spread||Our Correspondent Jaipur, May 7Fearing the spread of COVID-19 by bats, people in four districts of Rajasthan have been spotted killing Indian bats, affecting their breeding season and useful role in agriculture and environmental balance.“Killing of bats by local villagers, fearing the spread of COVID-19, with the help of forest workers in Churu, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, and Nagaur districts’ old monuments and ‘havelis’ in Rajasthan, has been very frequent in the past fortnight,” Dr Dau Lal Bohra, conservationist and member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Rajasthan, said.As many as 45 bats were killed in Sadulpur of Churu district, and over 150 in Lohargarl area of Jhunjhunu district recently, Bohra, a key researcher on bats and vultures, visiting Sambhar Lake, disclosed to The Tribune.“There are two reasons of hunting bats — one, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the other being number of myths that bats are inauspicious in family life if seen near their domicile. Both reasons are baseless and non-scientific as bats found in India are ‘fruit bats’ and good for pest control in agriculture and environmental balance,” Dr Bohra added.“People should shed their belief and stop killing bats as they are not a vector of SARS CoV-2 to human beings in India. If their ongoing breeding season is disturbed, fruit bats will face extinction in the north-west of Rajasthan as mostly male bats were knocked down allegedly by the people,” Bora apprehended, adding SARS-CoV-2 was carried by Horseshoe bats of Rhinolophidae family in China.“Even the recent report from the ICMR on the discovery of coronaviruses in two species of South Asian bats poses no known health hazard. The viruses found in the study are different from SARS-CoV-2 and cannot cause COVID-19. People have misinterpreted the ICMR’s other report on bats,” he quoted.Reverse Transmission“As per the International Union for Conservation of Nature study, there is a chance of reverse transmission from infected human to domestic animals and even to bats. In a severe community spread conditions of COVID-19, like in Maharashtra and Gujarat, there might be a possibility of reverse transmission if this deadly virus is mixed in to sewage, ponds, water body and any other waste material. No country is aware of this warning, but it should be dealt carefully by government agencies. This may be more disastrous after lifting of the lockdown in hotspot cities in the country,” Bohra warned.“To protect bats during the COVID-19 pandemic, earlier the Karnataka government and now the Rajasthan government’s Wildlife Warden has issued guidelines and warning that bats should not be hurt or killed by any means as bats fall under Schedule-V of the Indian Wildlife Act, 1972. To date, there was no provision of punishment for killing them, but now harming bats will attract a legal action against offenders in Rajasthan,” the Chief Wildlife Warden, Arindam Tomar, said in his order issued on Wednesday.Reacting on the government’s intervention, Bohra hailed saying ‘better late than never’. Now, the Wildlife Department would depute its guards and other officials to prevent the alleged hunting of bats for betterment of their growth and natural way of pest control management, leading to balanced ecosystem.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-than-150-bats-killed-in-rajasthan-owing-to-fear-of-covid-19-spread-81668

Now, all four patients are free of COVID-19 infection,” Dr Dosi said.Consent was obtained from all four patients prior to the clinical trial of plasma therapy, he added.The Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO), Indore, Praveen Jadia, said, “At SAIMS, the use of plasma therapy was done on some COVID-19 patients and according to the doctors there, it helped them in the recovery.”He said plasma therapy would also be used on some positive COVID-19 patients at a government-run hospital in Indore soon.“We hope it will help patients in their recovery,” Jadia added.Convalescent plasma therapy involves injecting patients with plasma from people who have recovered from the COVID-19 infection. The theory is that the plasma will have the antibodies required to boost a sick person’s immunity response to the virus.Dosi said after the treatment and plasma therapy under the prescribed protocol, the repeat samples of four patients tested negative for COVID-19.In addition, reports of the CT scan of their lungs also confirmed that they had been free of the COVID-19 infection, he added.Dr Dosi, however, said, “We are not yet announcing any results regarding the effect of plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients. We want to try this clinical trial on a few more patients. We will share the results of the clinical trial with the ICMR.”He also said more than 30 people, who were free from the infection after the treatment, had expressed their desire to become plasma donors.The experts said the antibodies developed in the blood of the people fully recovered from COVID-19, which helped them to fight the disease in the future.Indore is among the worst-hit districts by COVID-19 in the country.As per the official information, as many as 1,699 patients of this epidemic have been found in the district so far, of whom 83 people have died, while 595 others have been discharged from hospitals after recovery.

The petition is likely to come up for hearing on May 11.Petitioner Sajag Nijhawan referred to various media reports highlighting instances of crowds gathering at liquor shops since they opened on May 4, without maintaining social distancing and leading to law and order situation.      It alleged there was a failure on the part of the AAP government in taking appropriate steps to control the large gathering in and around 150 government-run liquor shops which were opened after 47 days.Hundreds of people turned up outside liquor shops, creating a complete chaos as social distancing norms were not adhered to and forcing the police to use mild force to disperse the unruly crowd, it said.The petition, filed through Simran Kohli and Abheehshek Bhagat, sought direction to the Delhi government and its Excise Department to take immediate steps in view of the coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic to control the crowds outside the liquor shops and to ensure strict adherence to social distancing.It sought direction to the Delhi government to evolve a proper policy to start the online sale of liquor and deliver it to the consumers’ homes at a time when the entire machinery of the country is tirelessly working to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.The petition said it does not seek closing of these shops considering the burden on the government to deal with major revenue dip, but was seeking judicial order for appropriate steps to balance the need of revenue generation as well as social distancing.                            Another PIL was filed by NGO Civil Safety Council of India in the high court on Wednesday seeking direction to the Delhi government to close the liquor shops in the national capital until the situation of COVID-19 pandemic is under control. It is likely to come up for hearing on Friday. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-delhi-hc-to-start-online-sale-of-liquor-to-ensure-social-distancing-81653

07-05-2020||New Delhi||Indian Meteorological Department's forecast lists PoK, Gilgit-Baltistan||The IMD’s Regional Meteorological Centre has started including cities under Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir in its forecasts, a departure from its earlier format, officials said on Thursday.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has started including Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, which are parts of PoK, under the Jammu and Kashmir meteorological sub-division since May 5, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the Regional Meteorological Department that gives forecast for the northwest meteorological division of the IMD.IMD Director-General M Mohapatra said they have been mentioning areas under PoK under its daily weather bulletin ever since the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in the two union territories August last year.However, officials said it’s now being mentioned explicitly under the Jammu and Kashmir subdivision.These cities of PoK have now found a place in the overall forecast of the northwest division.The northwest division consists of nine sub-divisions – Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi-Chandigarh-Haryana, Punjab, east Uttar Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan and west Rajasthan.The development assumes significance as New Delhi has been of a position that the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir belongs to India.The inclusion of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan in the forecast comes amid Pakistan’s Supreme Court allowing elections in Gilgit-Baltistan this week. India had strongly reacted to the development.Sources added that internally, it was pointed out that since IMD has been mentioning these cities under the PoK in its daily national weather bulletin and also the local bulletins, they should also find a place in the forecasts of the RMC.Mohapatra said that the IMD, being the World Meteorological Department-nominated Regional Meteorological Centre, provides severe weather warnings to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan detailing forecasts for the next five days.

It merged with McDowell & Co. Ltd of UB Group in 1978, according to the company's website.Taken over by LG Chem (South Korea), Hindustan Polymers was renamed LG Polymers India Private Limited (LGPI) in July, 1997. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vizag-gas-leak-chilling-scenes-bring-back-memories-of-bhopal-gas-tragedy-81645

We will seek an explanation from the airline (private operator) as to how it happened. BOI (Bureau of Immigration) has a very stringent protocol for dealing with such deviations, which must have been acted upon," said a senior official of aviation regulator DGCA.It is not clear if the businessman and his cook were deported or sent to a quarantine facility within India.India has been under lockdown since March 25 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. All scheduled commercial passenger flights have been suspended during the lockdown.However, cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special flights permitted by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have been allowed to operate during this time.

Slowly the vapours are reducing. It was not arrested fully. They are using neutralisers such as TBC (4-tert-Butylcatechol (TBC)," Joint Chief Inspector of Factories, Visakhapatnam, J Siva Sankar Reddy told PTI.Exposure to styrene, also known as ethenylbenzene, vinylbenzene can affect the central nervous system (CNS), causing headache, fatigue, weakness, and depression.It is primarily used in the production of polystyrene plastics and resins, according to experts."The spread may be two or three kilometres wide. It depends on the wind speed. We cannot exactly say how many kilometres it has spread to. If the wind flow is heavy, there is a chance that it will spread more in the air," the official added.Reddy said the chemical plant was not operational due to the lockdown."The company was planning to reopen it soon. There were just a few employees -- security guards and maintenance personnel there at the time of the incident," he said.According to Reddy, the firm, which has 350 to 400 employees, has all necessary permits to operate.LG Polymers was established in 1961 as "Hindustan Polymers" for manufacturing Polystyrene and its Co-polymers at Visakhapatnam.

07-05-2020||New Delhi||Covid mortality lowest in India, only 582 on ventilators: Harsh Vardhan||As India on Thursday reported 52,952 coronavirus cases, with 1,783 fatalities and 15,266 recoveries, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said India’s COVID mortality was the lowest in the world.Flagging challenges in COVID response at a time when the disease graph has been gradually peaking instead of regressing—as the government had hoped amid the lockdown—Vardhan said the challenge was to prevent the disease from making its way to unaffected districts.There are presently 319 unaffected districts in the green zone, 130 red districts and 284 orange ones.Vardhan said India’s mortality from COVID was 3.3 per cent, the lowest globally.He also pointed out that the satisfactory sign was a steadily improving recovery rate which should give people the confidence to report symptoms and seek care.Around 28.8 per cent of all COVID patients have now recovered and gone home, the minister said.Another “satisfactory“ development he noted was less severity of the disease considering only 1.1 per cent of all COVID patients are on ventilators, 3.3 per cent on medical oxygen and 4.8 per cent on ICU beds.In absolute numbers this means only 582 of India’s 52,952 COVID patients are on ventilators; 17,47 on oxygen support and 2,541 on ICU beds.India’s doubling rate calculated today as of the trends over the last 14 days is 10.6, while trends over the last seven days show a doubling rate of 10.2 days.However, more and more districts, Vardhan said, were now managing to prolong the period of reporting of new infections, with 180 districts having no case between seven to 13 days; 164 districts with no case between 14 to 20 days and 136 districts with no case from 21 to 28 days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-mortality-lowest-in-india-only-582-on-ventilators-harsh-vardhan-81632

Very shameful. Since the patients have died of COVID-19, this will cause the spread of infection," BJP MLA Nitesh Rane said in a video statement.With the opposition gunning for the Shiv Sena, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar said a probe had been ordered into the incident.Deputy Municipal Commissioner Dr Daksha Shah told reporters that bodies were there for just half-an-hour before being removed."There is some time gap before the bodies are removed to the morgue. The video was shot in this period," claimed Shah.However, Sion Hospital Dean Pramod Ingale pointed out that the morgueat the Sion Hospital was full and the relatives of the deceased were hesitant in taking the bodies. “We subsequently removed the bodies and have ordered a probe into the incident," said Ingale.This is second such video in around two weeks. Earlier videos shot by patients of the Cooper Hospital showed bodies lying in beds overnight while patients occupied the neighbouring beds.The BMC subsequently made it mandatory for bodies to be shifted out of thehospital beds within 30 minutes and disposed of within 12 hours.The Sion Hospital is one of the major hospitals in Mumbai which has been designated as a COVID-19 facility. According to officials, most of the patients at the hospital are from Dharavi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/video-shows-bodies-lying-near-covid-19-patients-at-mumbai-hospital-bjp-slams-bmc-81631
07-05-2020||Washington||American families adopted 241 Indian kids in 2019: Report||American families adopted 241 Indian kids in 2019, an official US report said on Wednesday.In fiscal 2019, consular officers issued 2,971 immigrant visas to children adopted abroad (2,677) or to be adopted in the United States (294) by American citizens, the State Department said in its 12th annual report on the issue.The report shows a decline in the total number of inter-country adoptions by American families, Special Adviser for Children’s Issues Michelle Bernier-Toth   told reporters during a news conference.Most of that decline he attributed to a decrease of inter-country adoptions from just two countries: China (a decrease of 656) and Ethiopia (a decrease of 166). In both cases, the reductions result from “continued social, economic or legal changes that we have previously reported on regarding those countries”, she said.“We believe that most of the continuing worldwide decline is due to countries prioritising domestic placements for vulnerable children before considering inter-country adoption, or countries such as Russia, Guatemala and Ethiopia, which have unilaterally suspended or banned inter-country adoption,” she said.At the same time, some countries noticeably increased the number of inter-country adoptions to the US, including Ukraine (+50), Liberia (+21), Hungary (+17) and Colombia (+15), the report said.However, Chinese kids still top the list of adoptions with 819 in 2019. China is followed by Ukraine (298), Colombia (244), India (241) and South Korea (166).Responding to questions, Bernier-Toth said adoptions have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but that is not to say that they have stopped.“Although our embassies and consulates abroad have suspended routine visa processing, adoption cases remain a priority, and to the extent that they are possible given the circumstances within each country and the stage at which each case is, we are continuing to process adoption cases and have had a number of families return to the US with their children just within the past month,” she said.According to the report, in 2019, families outside the US adopted 56 children from America to seven countries: Canada (24), the Netherlands (17), Mexico (six), Ireland (five), Belgium (one), Switzerland (one) and the United Kingdom (two).The report said Peru on an average takes a maximum of 899 days to complete the adoption process. Peru is followed by Guinea (848 days), Dominican Republic (834), Burundi (825) and Burkina Faso (808 days). India on an average takes 457 days to complete the adoption process.

07-05-2020||London||UK universities reach out to Indian students for COVID-19 support||UK universities have urged distressed Indian students, whether still in Britain or in India, to get in touch with their university support services if they need help or guidance during the coronavirus-related lockdown.On Monday, the Indian government announced plans to begin phased repatriation of its citizens stranded abroad from May 7.Air India will operate 64 flights from May 7 to May 13 to bring back around 15,000 Indian nationals stranded abroad amid the COVID-19-induced lockdown, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in New Delhi on Tuesday.As the Indian government’s first phase of repatriations from the UK to India begins from Thursday, many Indian students in the UK still face a long wait before they can fly home. The UK universities said they wanted them to know that the support continues to be available.“We are aware that many Indian students are concerned about money and accommodation, are missing their families and are understandably distressed to be far from home during this global pandemic. My message to those students is: please, please speak to your university,” said Vivienne Stern, Director of Universities UK international, which represents 143 UK university leaders.“We may not be able to fix everything, but there are people on hand who will do everything they can to make things easier for you. Universities are providing support in the form of funding, food, accommodation and advice and guidance. We are in this together, please don’t struggle alone,” she said.Universities UK said that support offered by universities includes delivering food to students, providing hardship funds for students in financial difficulty, waiving accommodation fees or moving international students into accommodation where they can look after them by providing cleaning, security and catering. Universities are also providing pastoral and mental health support.Jaspreet Singh, an Indian student at Birmingham City University (BCU), had some advice for his fellow BCU students: “I know being an international student how worried our parents can be. I send them regular updates and say I’m safe here. Make sure you are in touch with your lecturers and the amazing support team which BCU has got – make sure you use them.”Universities UK also highlighted a range of specific steps taken by a snapshot of universities around the UK to support international students who may feel stranded as a result of the coronavirus crisis and need support.The University of Bath has moved all students in university owned accommodation around the city into campus accommodation and is providing three free meals a day to all students who remain on campus. It has also enhanced the availability of financial assistance to students who find themselves in hardship.Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland has implemented a dedicated helpline for students, which operates seven days a week, and has introduced a fund to support students through the COVID-19 crisis as well as waived rent for April and May. Solent University and the University of Bangor have been supporting students stuck in the UK to access hardship funding.Indians make up one of the largest groups of international students from outside the European Union (EU) studying at universities in Britain, after Chinese students. Thousands of these Indian students have found themselves stranded as India imposed a ban on international flights in the middle of March.Indian students’ representative groups such as the National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK) and Indian National Students Association (INSA) have issued advisories and have been organising food deliveries and other assistance through the lockdown.The UK Home Office had confirmed that any foreign students or professionals on visas that had expired or expiring would be given an extension at least until May 31. Many of the stranded students, from different parts of India including Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, expressed their relief at that extension but remain concerned about the limited resources at their disposal.A ticket on one of the initial seven Air India repatriation flights organised by the Indian government are set to cost around Rs 50,000, which combined with the cost of quarantine to be borne by the passenger on landing in India, is a new cause for worry among this group as they await their turn to be flown back to India.

During questioning, he said he was added to the group by one of his friends, the official said.Since Tuesday, at least 15 members of the group have been questioned so far.The juveniles, who are part of the group, are being quizzed at their home in the presence of their parents and members of NGOs.So far, the identified members were found to be using their own cell phone for the purpose and if any other device comes to notice during the course of the investigation, it will be seized for verification, police said. The devices used to engage in the "offensive and vulgar communication" have been seized from the group members, police said, adding that students from at least four-five schools were found to be involved."The CyPAD unit has sought information about the alleged group and it's members from Instagram. Their reply is awaited. The devices of the identified members of the group have been seized and sent for forensic analysis," said Anil Mittal, Additional PRO of Delhi Police.The role of other group members is also being ascertained, he said. The identified members, who are major, are being examined.The minor members of the group are being dealt with as per the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act, police officials said.The apprehended juvenile has not been presented before the Juvenile Justice Board so far as the courts are closed due to lockdown imposed to control the spread of COVID-19.Notices have been issued to all the identified members of the group to join the probe, they said.Police said they are still verifying if the sole motive of creating the alleged group was to share such obscene messages and morphed photographs of underage girls or it was created just like a normal group but later sharing of thee messages and pictures started.Instagram had earlier said it takes the issue "very seriously" and does not allow such behaviour. It had said the objectionable content featuring minor girls was removed from the platform as soon as it was made aware of it.The Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) had issued a notice to Instagram and Delhi Police, taking cognizance of the matter.Some of those involved are from reputed schools in the national capital, police said. Information about the group came to light after a girl shared screenshots of its activities, following which it started being called out on social media.The police said during social media monitoring, it was noticed that the group was being used by the participants to share obscene messages and morphed pictures.A case under relevant sections of IT Act and IPC was registered on Monday, officials said.Further action will be taken on the basis of material evidence that is gathered in the course of the investigation, they added. PTIMeanwhile, Bollywood expressed shock and concern over the mindset of certain teenage boys in Delhi after the Boys Locker Room controversy exploded.Leaked screenshots of a private Instagram chat group comprising some teenage school students from the Capital has stirred up a storm over rape culture in India.Many of these boys were allegedly seen sharing photos of underage girls, objectifying them, and planning "gang rapes"."This a multi-faceted problem. Because everyone is still squeamish about sex education in our populous/moralistic country, teenagers are confusing porn for sex education! And now data is free. How dangerous! This will explode in our faces in the next five years sadly, I reckon," tweeted Richa Chadha.Swara Bhasker expressed: "#boyslockerroom a telling tale of how toxic masculinity starts young! Underage boys gleefully planning how to rape & gangrape minor girls. Parents & teachers must address this with those Kids.. Not enough to 'hang rapists'.. we must attack the mentality that creates rapists!"Chandan Roy Sanyal shared: "15 year old School Boys from distinguished delhi schools talk about raping the girls in their own class. Shocked to the core !!" Meanwhile, the Cyber Cell of Delhi Police have detained a 15-year-old student of a prominent school in South Delhi in connection with the Instagram chat group where rapes were glorified and photos of underage girls were being shared and objectified.Instagram row: Parents must teach kids proper social media useInstagram chat group Bois Locker Room wherein rapes were glorified and underage girls were objectified shook the national consciousness and now, leading behavioural experts have urged the society to strongly consider the application of gender sensitization and social media literacy for the school-going children.The incident came to light after a girl from South Delhi shared a screenshot of the group chat on social media.Meanwhile, another alleged version of a girls' locker room started trending on Twitter. Many screenshots shared on the platform alleged that just like the boys' version, there is a similar chat group that sexualises and objectifies boys and talks trash about their bodies.According to Dr Samir Parikh, Director, Mental Health & Behavioural Sciences, Fortis Healthcare, there is immense exposure that young minds have to the media."While it may be difficult for parents to continually monitor what media their children come across directly or indirectly, it is possible to have the right conversations with them to help them build a good understanding of how the media can influence their perceptions, understanding and their behaviours," Parikh told IANS.Annoyed at such growing incidents on social media, the British government last year announced an "online harms" white paper that aimed to make online platforms liable to protect their users, especially children."The impact of harmful content and activity can be particularly damaging for children, and there are growing concerns about the potential impact on their mental health and well-being," said the joint proposal from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and Home Office.The interim codes of practice, and more detailed proposals on the online harms regulation, are expected to be published in the spring.According to experts, it is a must that parents discuss sex, sexuality, gender-related issues and take steps within their own homes to ensure there is a sensitive approach towards these."At the same time, these need to become serious aspects which are more robustly taken up within schools and not just through training programs by trainers, teachers and counsellors but also through the utilization of peer influencers within the schools," explained Parikh.Technology is not all bad and similarly, social media also serves a useful purpose of connectivity."However, excessive usage of technology/virtual social platforms at the cost of one's sleep-wake cycle and one's overall health is not desirable," said Dr Sameer Malhotra, Director and Head, Department of Mental Health & Behavioral Sciences, Max Healthcare.Lack of discipline, disobedience and excessive screen time go hand in hand.It is important to maintain certain rules at home for all, including limited screen time, division of labour, encouraging age-appropriate self-help skills, avoiding screen usage around mealtime and bedtime and engaging in healthy conversations with family."Consistent and patient handling by parents, who themselves serve as role models, shall be helpful," said Malhotra.With Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/admin-of-instagram-group-bois-locker-room-arrested-swara-bhasker-says-toxic-masculinity-starts-young-81595

07-05-2020||United Nations||At 20.1 million, India expected to have highest births since COVID-19 declared as pandemic: UNICEF||India is projected to record the highest number of births in the 9 months since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March, with more than 20 million babies expected to be born in the country between March and December, according to top UN body.The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) warned that pregnant mothers and babies born during the pandemic across the world were threatened by strained health systems and disruptions in services.An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF said on Wednesday, ahead of Mother's Day, observed on May 10.These babies are projected to be born up to 40 weeks after COVID-19 was recognised as a pandemic on March 11.The highest numbers of births in the 9 months since the pandemic was declared are expected to occur in India, where 20.1 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. Other countries with the expected highest numbers of births during this period are China (13.5 million), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million), it said."Most of these countries had high neonatal mortality rates even before the pandemic and may see these levels increase with COVID-19 conditions," UNICEF said.It is estimated that there will be 24.1 million births in India for the January-December 2020 period.UNICEF warned that COVID-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk.Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis. In the US, the sixth-highest country in terms of the expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16."New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities," UNICEF said, adding they include global containment measures such as lockdowns and curfews; health centres overwhelmed with response efforts; supply and equipment shortages; and a lack of sufficient skilled birth attendants as health workers, including midwives, are redeployed to treat COVID-19 patients."Millions of mothers all over the world embarked on a journey of parenthood in the world as it was. They now must prepare to bring a life into the world as it has become – a world where expecting mothers are afraid to go to health centres for fear of getting infected, or missing out on emergency care due to strained health services and lockdowns," UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said."It is hard to imagine how much the coronavirus pandemic has recast motherhood," Fore said.UNICEF said its analysis was based on data from World Population Prospects 2019 of the UN Population Division.An average full-term pregnancy typically lasts a complete 9 months or 39 to 40 weeks. For the purposes of this estimate, the number of births for a 40-week period in 2020 was calculated.The 40-week period of March 11 to December 16 is used in this estimate based upon the WHO's March 11 assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic.UNICEF warned that although evidence suggests that pregnant mothers are not more affected by COVID-19 than others, countries need to ensure they still have access to antenatal, delivery and postnatal services.Similarly, sick newborns need emergency services as they are at high risk of death. New families require support to start breastfeeding, and to get medicines, vaccines and nutrition to keep their babies healthy, it said."This is a particularly poignant Mother's Day, as many families have been forced apart during the coronavirus pandemic, but it is also a time for unity, a time to bring everyone together in solidarity. We can help save lives by making sure that every pregnant mother receives the support she needs to give birth safely in the months to come," Fore said.Issuing an urgent appeal to governments and health care providers to save lives in the coming months, UNICEF said efforts must be made to help pregnant women receive antenatal checkups, skilled delivery care, postnatal care services, and care related to COVID-19 as needed.Ensure health workers are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment and get priority testing and vaccination once a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available so that can deliver high-quality care to all pregnant women and newborn babies during the pandemic, it said.While it is not yet known whether the virus is transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and delivery, UNICEF advised all pregnant women to follow precautions to protect themselves from exposure to the virus.Closely monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 and seek advice from the nearest designated facility if they have concerns or experience symptoms. Pregnant women should also take the same precautions to avoid COVID -19 infection as other people: practice physical distancing, avoid physical gatherings and use online health services, it said.UNICEF said even before COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes.The agency called for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.

What criteria is the government using to judge how long the lockdown is to continue?”Backing Sonia, ex-PM Manmohan Singh said, “CMs need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of the Centre to get the country out of the lockdown.”The CMs flagged fiscal distress with Congress media chairperson Randeep Singh Surjewala later saying they would again write to the PM for financial help. “The CMs were unanimous in saying that the Centre was pushing them towards fiscal stress by not providing economic assistance,” Surjewala said.Punjab CM Amarinder Singh told Gandhi, “We are making arrangements to send 10 lakh migrants home. We have booked 400 trains. The Railways is charging Rs 870 a ticket which Punjab is paying. Since our industry is starting now, some migrants out of 10 lakh might stay back to work.”He added that the Centre should leave the decision of deciding red zones with district magistrates. “Some joint secretary sitting in the Home Ministry cannot decide which district or zone has to be red in the state. They do not know the ground reality,” Singh said apprising Gandhi of the Montek Singh Ahluwalia-led committee he has set up to recommend economic revival of Punjab.According to Punjab CM, around 20,000 international travellers and 12,000 from other states were expected to return.

07-05-2020||Sandeep Dixit||Country to miss noted Germany-based Indologists||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 6Covid-impacted months of March and April have been cruel for Indology as they snatched away two masters of this field—Michael Leibig and Dietmar Rothermund, both from Germany.Michael Leibig (69) was a German scholar of Kautilya, who passed away on April 15 after a long illness. A month earlier, Dietmar Rothermund, one of the world’s top scholars on Indology and senior to Leibig by nearly two decades, also passed away in Germany.Fittingly, Leibig, a fan of Kautilya’s Arthashastra, was Fellow and Lecturer at the world’s oldest university in Heidelburg where Rothermunn was Professor Emeritus at its prestigious South Asia Institute (SAI).It was after a visit to India that he decided to study Kautilya and approached Arthashastra as a political scientist, comparing the English and German translations and developing new insights that connected with the observations that Max Weber offered in his 1916-17 essays on Hinduism.Thereafter, Liebig worked closely with IDSA’s major “Indigenous Knowledge” project, its leading scholars, and others. The focus was on concepts embedded in Kautilya’s 6,000 aphorisms of sutras. . This included acknowledging Kautilya as the first proponent of a raison d’état doctrine, entirely original in his analysis of warfare, paralleling the much sparser text in Sun Tzu’s Art of Warfare.Rothermund, a classicist academic unlike Leibig who drifted in from journalism, Rothermund is especially remembered for co-authoring “A history of India” that examined the major political, economic, social and cultural forces shaping the history of the subcontinent with the fourth volume also taking into account the recent developments such as in Kashmir.Exploring the historyMichael Liebig’s works include ‘Kautilya’s Arthashastra: An Intellectual Portrait’ and ‘Comparing Kautilya with Sun-Tzu, Nizam al-Mulk, Barani and Machiavelli’.

The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Nearly 5,00,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status. “Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,” said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled “H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels” says 60% of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage.

But many more could have returned home but for the absence of cooperation between countries, said sources. The Ministry of External Affairs’ directives to pay the full fare in advance has not gone down well with a section of the media though officially it has been said that the purpose of charging passengers is to ensure that only deserving cases take the flight back home. Although videoconferences by international and regional organisations – UN, WHO, G-20, BRICS, NAM – underlined the need for cooperation during the epidemic, sources said many stranded Indians would have returned more than a month back had there been an understanding between the respective civil aviation authorities. For instance, Israel sent half a dozen flights since March 21 to evacuate its nationals. Sources said besides its national carrier El Al, Israel also took the services of Air India. But no stranded Indian has returned from Israel from any of these flights. Given India’s modest beginning with phase one of evacuation, it may be a while before anyone of them returns. Similarly the US has sent two dozen flights to India with none of them bringing back stranded Indians.  Germany, Britain, Canada and Russia, all have substantial numbers wanting to return to India, have had to wait it out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lack-of-cooperation-delays-evacuation-81410

07-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Infections rise in Modi’s home state||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 6Even as the BJP-led Centre is accusing the Chief Minister of the TMC-ruled West Bengal for the Covid-19 “data cover-up”, in saffron-ruled Gujarat, which is close to the top on the list of states with highest number of cases and mortality, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani is facing no such visible political crisis.The home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah has also been witness to unrest and violent protests by migrant labourers. On Monday, a large group clashed with the police in Surat, demanding that they be sent home. It was the fourth such instance in the city.Rupani’s response to the crisis as also the time his government “wasted” in organising the ‘Namaste Trump’ event and “engineering defections” to deny the Congress one seat in Rajya Sabha is under criticism. But with rivals seemingly in disarray, especially after the Rajya Sabha episode, there is no immediate threat to the government.Modi’s “popularity” and Home Minister Shah “direct control” is holding Gujarat for the BJP, say state leaders. “Gujarat is being run by officials handpicked by Modi and Shah,” they add.Observers warn that the BJP will have to redefine itself if it wants to retain the state. The Lok Sabha elections may be four years away but a CM not seen delivering at the time of crisis is bad news, they say citing the example of non-BJP CMs like Amarinder Singh in Punjab, Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala, Uddhav in Maharashtra and Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan, who all have been appreciated for their proactive response.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/infections-rise-in-modis-home-state-81413

07-05-2020||---||Three lawyers write to SC, seek judicial intervention||New Delhi, May 6The controversy surrounding the ‘Bois Locker Room’ scandal reached the Supreme Court today with a letter petition by three lawyers seeking judicial intervention in the matter.“This incident raises the issue of not only privacy, safety and well-being of women, but also of sensitisation and counselling of juveniles who are engaging in such conduct,” the letter petition by advocates Anand Varma, Kaustubh Prakash and Shubhangi Jain read.The controversy relates to an Instagram group allegedly run by teenage boys from certain Delhi schools sharing objectionable pictures of women and minor girls. Terming the incident as “horrific”, the trio wanted the Supreme Court to take up the matter on the judicial side. “It involves harassment of women”, they said.Maintaining that social media platforms had bridged the communication gap, the petition said such incidents proved that it had become a platform of public harassment of women and cyber bullying.“It is appalling how boys as young as 15 years of age glorify rape, discuss techniques of raping and gang-raping women,” the petition read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-lawyers-write-to-sc-seek-judicial-intervention-81419

In Mumbai, local ward officers have been given powers to take over hospitals and nursing homes in the private sector to put up ICU beds.More than 25,000 doctors, who operate as private practitioners in Mumbai, have also been asked to sign up to treat Covid patients or risk having their licenses cancelled. “The number of patients testing positive for the virus has increased as we have increased the number of tests. The number of patients who are being cured of the disease has also gone up,” Thackeray said in a statement. The CM said the Central government expects the number of patients to rise in May and hence the state government wanted to be ready with the maximum number of ICU beds for Covid patients.He added that the state government had already set up huge facilities for treating patients affected by the pandemic at Nehru Science Centre, Mahalaxmi racecourse, Nehuru Planetarium, Bombay Exhibition Centre, MMRDA grounds at Bandra-Kurla Complex and other places. However, the number of patients is likely to increase as people are likely to return to Maharashtra, Thackeray added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-military-hospitals-to-be-taken-over-as-maharashtra-runs-out-of-icu-beds-81411
