In fact, they sat on the dais with a roof where cultural programmes of the school are held.”He said one of the students was a Hindu.The DEO said students were made to sit according to their roll numbers and not by taking into account their names.“That is why, the question of discrimination does not arise,” he added.Makwana said 54 other Muslim students wrote their exam with children of other faiths on Wednesday in rooms of the same school as they did not come from containment areas.Meanwhile, the incident took a political hue with Congress spokesman Ameenul Khan Suri on Thursday evening seeking a probe into the entire episode.As many as 3,933 people have tested coronavirus positive in Indore district so far, according to the health department.Twenty-eight areas have been designated as containment zones in the district to stem the coronavirus spread.

He, too, stressed on the need to initiate a drive to capture the expanding global market for ventilators.Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chairman Sathish Reddy said necessary freedom and handholding had spurred innovations for high-quality and cost-effective ventilator solutions in the last three months among the start-ups.While, Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) chairman and managing director MV Gautam said the progress made by the ventilator sector in the last few months was an example of how a facilitative environment could scale up manufacturing through the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

11-06-2020||New Delhi||India asks UK not to consider any request for asylum||India on Thursday said it has asked the UK not to consider any request for asylum by fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya as there appeared to be no ground for his persecution in the country.Last week, the UK government indicated that Mallya is unlikely to be extradited to India anytime soon, saying there is a legal issue that needed to be resolved before his extradition can be arranged.“We have been in touch with the UK side for his early extradition. We have also requested the UK side not to consider his asylum, if requested by him, because there appeared to be no ground for his persecution in India,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing.In May, Mallya lost his appeals in the UK Supreme Court against his extradition to India to face money laundering and fraud charges.Srivastava said India has been in touch with the UK after Mallya’s application for leave to appeal to the UK’s Supreme Court was rejected.The UK top court’s decision marked a major setback to the 64-year-old businessman as it came weeks after he lost his High Court appeal in April against an extradition order to India.A spokesperson in the British High Commission here said last week that there was a legal issue that needed to be resolved before Mallya’s extradition can be arranged.“Under United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. The issue is confidential and we cannot go into any detail. We cannot estimate how long this issue will take to resolve. We are seeking to deal with this as quickly as possible,” the official had said.Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.The High Court verdict in April upheld the 2018 ruling by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018 that the former Kingfisher Airlines boss had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-asks-uk-not-to-consider-any-request-for-asylum-97782

He allegedly runs a major racket in forged degrees.According to Kasganj Superintendent of Police Ghule Sushil Chandrabhan, the gang had earlier managed to get a job in the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) in the Purvanchal region for a young woman named Deepti Singh. Then, he got his brother a job in a similar manner.Like Anamika Shukla, it now emerges that there are multiple teachers with the name of Deepti Singh. The Department of Basic Education is now verifying their credentials.According to a preliminary investigation, the gang has managed jobs for around two dozen persons with forged degrees and documents.The matter first became known when teachers with the name Anamika Shukla were found to be teaching in multiple schools. The father’s name and address of all of them were the same.The first Anamika Shukla was arrested from Kasganj on June 6 when she had come to the Basic Shikha Adhikari’s office to submit her resignation. From Anamika, she became Priya and finally, her father said her name was Supriya.She has been booked for cheating and forgery under IPC Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).According to the police, the woman admitted that she had paid Rs 5 lakh to one Raj, a Mainpuri-based man to get this job.She used Anamika Shukla’s credentials to get the job while her real name is Priya, daughter of Mahipal, a resident of Lakhanpur village of the Kaimganj police circle in Farrukhabad district.Meanwhile, the real Anamika Shukla is an unemployed homemaker in Gonda, who lodged an FIR against unknown persons on June 9 for misusing her documents to take up jobs in KGBVs across several districts of Uttar Pradesh.She told reporters that though she had applied for job in the KGBV, she could not go for the counselling as she had delivered a child around the same time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brother-of-schoolteacher-recruitment-fraud-arrested-in-manipuri-97780

Clearly, Imran Khan needs a new set of advisers and better information,” MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said during an online media briefing.“We all know about their debt problem (almost 90 per cent of GDP) and how much they have pressed for debt restructuring. It would also be better for them to remember that India has a stimulus package, which is as large as Pakistan’s annual GDP,” he said.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package for various key sectors to deal with the adverse impact of the pandemic.In his tweets, Khan said his government has successfully transferred Rs 120 billion in nine weeks to over 10 million families in a “transparent manner” to deal with the fallout of COVID-19 on the poor.“I am ready to offer help and share our successful cash transfer programme, lauded internationally for its reach and transparency, with India,” the Pakistan prime minister added.

Nine TDP leaders and activists were killed. Seven others were forced to commit suicide.”“Properties of 56 TDP leaders were destroyed. False cases were filed against 95 persons and another 167 families were put to harassment,” he claimed.Naidu further said, “By illegal sand transportation to other states, YSRCP leaders were plundering hundreds of crores. The natural resources were being looted. Over 13 lakh tonne sand was stolen by ruling party leaders in one year.”The former Chief Minister went on to say Jagan Mohan Reddy had lured one TDP MLA with financial benefits and another MLA with mining leases and business concessions.TDP MLCs were being lured with financial benefits and also some were threatened if they didn’t shift loyalties, he claimed.“This is totally contrary to the CM’s statement in the Assembly that if anybody was taken from TDP, they would be first made to resign from their posts. YSRCP should explain why it has not asked the three MLAs and two MLCs to resign. The CM should explain why it has not disqualified the defected MLAs and MLCs,” read the letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrababu-naidu-writes-open-letter-alleging-misrule-by-ysrcp-97766

The bank has alleged that the companies trading in coal allegedly availed the facilities on the basis of forged documents and diverted the loan funds to companies having common directors. The bank noted that the chartered accountant who was signing the financial records of the accused company was clearing the financial documents of companies suspected to be receiving funds from them. In an unrelated case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked a Bhubaneswar-based company—Global Trading Solutions Ltd—and its Managing Director Abinash Mohanty along with three other former and sitting directors, besides three senior PNB officials in a case of cheating the public sector bank of around Rs 32 crore, they said. The CBI carried out searches at official and residential premises of Punjab National Bank (PNB) officials and the company executives in Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), Kolkata (West Bengal), Jammu (Jammu and Kashmir), Bhubaneswar and Cuttack (both in Odisha), the CBI said in a statement. "It was alleged that the said PNB officials had entered into a conspiracy with the Bhubaneswar-based private firm through its said Director(s) in the matter relating to fraud perpetrated in processing, sanctioning and disbursing CC facility, bill discounting and issuing Letters of Credit to the Bhubaneswar firm during 2010-15," CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said in a statement. The PNB alleged that the company had illegally diverted the funds received from the bank to its sister/group companies in India and abroad in "such a clandestine manner" that it could not be detected during routing banking operations. The company allegedly round tripped funds among companies having common directors with a criminal conspiracy to defraud the bank, causing a loss of around Rs 32 crore, it added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-registers-separate-cases-against-3-firms-for-defrauding-pnb-of-over-rs-125-cr-97760

This will help in better management of the species and guide the holders about proper veterinary care, housing and other aspects of well-being of the species, say officials.The database of exotic animals will also help in control and management of zoonotic diseases on which guidance would be available from time to time to ensure safety of animals and humans.The declarer will not be required to produce any documentation in relation to the exotic live species if the declaration is made within six months of the date of issue of the advisory.For any declaration made after six months, the declarer will be required to comply with the documentation requirement under the extant laws and regulations.Exotic live species are animal or plant species moved from their original range (location) to a new one.“These species are introduced to a new location most often by people.

11-06-2020||---||Government optimistic of positive growth next year||New Delhi, June 11The Centre on Thursday said it agreed with the assessment by two international rating agencies of India’s GDP growth rate easily crossing eight per cent next year.The forecast by the two agencies – Standard’s and Poor and Fitch – that India can clock economic growth of 8.5 to 9.5 per cent is heavily predicated on the government carrying out the structural reforms announced during the unveiling of the Rs 20 lakh crore Covid stimulus package.“That is the path we are quite likely to go in the future,” the government’s Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian told newspersons over video conference.While there will be a contraction this fiscal, there will be a jump next year but the official was unwilling to predict whether the GDP growth will touch near zero during 2020-21 or enter into negative territory.At the same time, he acknowledged that the expectations of the rating agencies were heavily based on the government carrying out the radical changes it had promised in an array of sectors from agriculture to public sector enterprise.He, however, declined to give any estimates for economic growth during the current financial year on grounds that many chips were yet to fall in place.In case the recovery begins in the second half of this year, India may escape with a bottom of the barrel growth rate, he suggested.Asked to respond to reports that banking will be catgeorised as a strategic sector in which the government would restrict public sector companies to a maximum of four, Krishnamurthy said work was on in the government to identify the sectors but mentioned that world-over banking was seen as a strategic sector.In case, the government follows the global example, public sector banking will see a major round of privatisation and mergers.Talking about another global rating agency, Moody’s, having effected a country downgrade, he pointed out that this rating was a mapping of probability of default which is a function of willingness to repay the borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay.“In India’s case, its willingness to pay is nothing short of gold standard. Its ability to pay is also gold standard. It is part of our cultural upbringing of paying back all our debts,” he explained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-optimistic-of-positive-growth-next-year-97751

We don’t have money to pay salaries to our employees and meet our expenses. Spectrum is very valuable and can be the best guarantee for the payment of our dues.”Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Bharti Airtel, said that as per their calculation, they had paid 70 per cent of the dues and only minimal amounts remain, which would be cleared after consulting the government.He said the company would file a detailed affidavit. The bench said the government had suggested 20 years for payment of dues by the telecom companies but no one had seen the future and what would happen if any of the companies went into liquidation.It said the litigation started in 1999 and 20 years had already gone and now another 20 years was being sought, could it be termed reasonable. Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for interim resolution professional said three telecom companies were facing insolvency proceedings and were in the process of resolution.Justice Shah told the counsels for the telecom firms that despite earning so much not a single company deposited anything towards COVID-19 relief funds.While Airtel said it had paid Rs 100 crore in the COVID fund, Tata Group said it paid Rs 1,500 crore.Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Group’s self-assessed dues to the government are a whopping Rs 82,300 crore, which is short of what DoT calculated after the Apex Court’s October 24 ruling on the AGR.In its submission before the Apex Court seeking relief in payment tenure, DoT had pegged Bharti Airtel’s dues at Rs 43,980 crore, Vodafone Idea at Rs 58,254 crore and Tata Group at Rs 16,798 crore.

The Commandant’s Parade marked the culmination of the training of 90 foreign gentlemen cadets from nine countries 333 Indian cadets and was the full-dress rehearsal for the passing out parade scheduled to be held on June 13.Owing to the precautionary guidelines to combat COVID-19, only the IMA staff and other trainees witnessed the immaculate parade that was reviewed by the IMA Commandant, Lt Gen JS Negi.“Once commissioned, you shall be put in a furnace of testing your strength and purity. Remember purity of action results from purity of intention. Hence, be genuine in your concerns for your men. If you show them your competence, your men will respect you, but if you show them your concerns, they will trust you and happily take a bullet for the task you assign,” he said while addressing the cadets.“The path to gain that unflinching trust passes through professional competence, concern, character, conviction and courage, both physical and mental, integrity and selflessness. Understanding your men by capitalising on their strengths and weaknesses is a continuous learning process and an important human resource management skill which you need to master from your experience. This holistic development will enable you to converse, convince and command large troops in times to come,” he added.Reiterating the IMA’s credo: “The safety, honour and welfare of your country come first, always and every time. The honour, welfare and comfort of the men you command come next. Your own ease, comfort and safety come last, always and every time,” Lt Gen Negi exhorted the cadets to maintain these high ideals and pursue excellence at all times and uphold the Army’s core values of character, competence, commitment and compassion.The Commandant also extended his compliments to the 90 cadets from the foreign countries for having endured the rigorous regimen of training, exhibiting excellent transformation and now getting ready to don the ranks in their respective armies, as well-groomed officers.He addressed them specifically, stating that the strong bond of togetherness that they had developed in the IMA would foster into a bond that would keep the diplomatic and military ties between our nations stronger and vibrant.“Soon, you will become a part of your great traditional armies. I am confident that the spirit of the Indian Military Academy will guide all of you in your future courses of action. You must always endeavour to achieve greatness in whatever you do,” the Lt General added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commandants-parade-held-at-ima-for-outgoing-cadets-97733

The river defines the border between the two countries.Also read: Nepal MPs unanimously approve new mapOli's claim comes in midst of a raging boundary row between the two countries with India sternly asking Nepal not to resort to any "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims after Kathmandu released a new political map laying claim over Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepalese officials say that Nepal had control over the area before 1962 when the India-China war took place. At that time India stationed its army seeking permission from then Nepalese rulers for a temporary purpose, but it never removed its forces, they claim.Although there are border issues in other areas such as Susta but the government has given priority to Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepali territories have not been captured by deploying army in other parts of its international border, Oli said in response to a question in Parliament.Earlier this week, the Nepalese Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider a constitution amendment bill to pave way for putting the new political map that includes Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal's national emblem.A discussion on the issue started in the Parliament since Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Shivamaya Tumbahanfe tabled a bill for the second amendment to the Nepalese Constitution to incorporate the new political map of Nepal on May 31.Prime Minister Oli said he was happy to learn that the unprecedented unity has been shown both within and outside the Parliament on the issue of national unity and territorial integrity."Our ancestors founded and saved this country through their struggles. We will be able to establish our territorial integrity if we remain firm," he said.Prime Minister Oli also raised objection to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's reported remark that Nepal should not repeat the mistake which Tibet made."If Adityanath spoke about that, it was not appropriate," he said."It is not appropriate to threaten Nepal in that way... This should not have been spoken by a chief minister of UP," he said. "It is a deplorable matter, if he spoke so."Oli also complained about India's unwillingness to receive the joint report prepared by Eminent Persons' Group (EPG) of India and Nepal.Nepal is ready to receive the report, but it would be meaningless unless both the governments receive it, he said."As per the condition, India should first receive the report but it has not shown any interest to receive the report which was prepared two years ago," he claimed.

The sample for the study consisted of 26,400 people across 28,595 households in 83 districts.The virus prevalence was the lowest in rural areas. Urban slums were found to be the most at risk with 1.85 times higher COVID-19 prevalence than rural areas while urban centres reported a prevalence that was 1.09 times higher than in villages.Though the prevalence in people was found to be low, the survey also indicated that large sections of Indian people were still susceptible to the virus with densely populated urban slums most vulnerable.DG ICMR Balram Bhargava while analysing the data said, “Around 0.73 per cent people in the 83 districts we studied showed prevalence of past exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus which means the lockdown in initial days kept the disease low and checked a rapid viral spread. The survey findings also show large proportions of population are still susceptible to the virus. Another good news is that infection fatality rate in the 83 districts was very low at 0.08 per cent.”Bhargava said the way forward was strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions like physical distancing, masks and face covers, respiratory and hand hygiene.He also said the state governments cannot lower the guard at the moment.“Infection in containment zones has been found to be high, and therefore, local lockdown measures need to continue. The states cannot lower their guard and need to keep implementing effective surveillance and containment strategy,” said DG ICMR.Pointing to low COVID prevalence, Bhargava also said there was no community transmission of COVID-19 in India.Sero surveillance by ICMR tested blood samples from individuals to see if the samples contained antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Presence of antibodies is a sign of past infection.Putting the data in perspective, Member Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul said, “Less than 1 per cent people had past infection as shown by the survey which presents the picture till April 30. The survey was done in the third week of May and normally antibodies take 15 days to appear.”The experts said India was showing clearly low mortality rate and recoveries had now touched 49.12 per cent with more people cured than currently infected.Bhargava also said there was ample testing capacity in the country at two lakh samples a day and it remained under-utilised. He urged states to ramp up testing.More surveys are in the pipeline, said Bhagrava adding that the second part of the sero survey will detect COVID prevalence in hot spots to provide guidance to states and tell them where they need to focus more.The tests were done using ICMR developed indigenous antibody testing kit Elisa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/less-than-1-pc-people-got-virus-in-early-days-indias-maiden-covid-trend-survey-97731
11-06-2020||New Delhi||Remdesivir, tocilizumab being considered for 'restricted use' on severely ill COVID-19 patients||Anti-viral drug remdesivir and tocilizumab, an immunomodulator, are being considered for "restricted use" on severely ill COVID-19 patients on "emergency and compassionate grounds", according to revised clinical management guidelines to be released soon.The much-touted anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine will continue to be used while azythromycin may be dropped from the treatment protocol, sources in the know of the developments told PTI.A clinical management guideline issued on March 31 had recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin on COVID-19 patients who require ICU management."Since COVID-19 is a new disease and there is no drug or vaccine for it as of now, treatment protocols are being revised from time to time based on emerging evidence," a source said.Tocilizumab, an immunomodulatory drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning, will be used on an experimental basis. Based on the evidence, some more drugs to be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine may be added to the protocol, but no consensus has been reached regarding them as yet, the source said.The new clinical management guidelines for COVID-19 is in the process of being finalised by the experts of the National Task Force on COVID-19, which last held its meeting on Sunday.India's drug regulator had last week granted US pharma giant Gilead Sciences the marketing authorisation for its drug remdesivir for "restricted emergency use" on hospitalised COVID-19 in the country, sources said.The approval process for remdesivir was accelerated in view of the emergency situation and the unmet need for medicines in light of the coronavirus outbreak."This medicine, which is administered in the form of an injection, has been approved to be sold by retail on the prescription of specialists for use in a hospital or in institutional set-up only. It has been approved for use for a maximum of five days," a source said.India currently does not manufacture remdesivir.The four companies—Hetero, Jubilant Life Sciences, Cipla and Mylan NV—with which Gilead Sciences Inc have entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements are still awaiting permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for manufacturing and distribution remdesivir in the country.Remdesivir has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 illness.

11-06-2020||Lucknow June 11||Special flight carrying 180 migrants from Mumbai lands in Lucknow||A special flight arranged by actor Amitabh Bachchan to ferry 180 migrants from Mumbai landed at the airport here on Thursday morning.On arrival, the migrants hailing from Unnao, Gonda, Lucknow and other districts of the state thanked the Bollywood star for helping them reach home.Airport Director, AK Sharma, said 180 passengers have arrived by the special flight.There were six flights scheduled to take off from Mumbai and on Wednesday four flights with about 700 people took off for Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Varanasi.                The remaining two flights left for Lucknow and Allahabad on Thursday, sources close to the actor said.The actor originally wanted to book a train for the migrants but decided to arrange for special flights after logistics for train travel did not work out.The flights were “organised” on Bachchan’s directive by his close aide Rajesh Yadav, managing director of his home production company AB Corp Ltd.             Yadav, on Bachchan’s behalf, had also recently flagged off 10 buses for 300 migrants to reach their villages in Lucknow, Allahabad, Bhadohi and other places in Uttar Pradesh. This was done in partnership with the dargahs in Mahim and the Haji Ali, a statement said.                    The coronavirus-triggered lockdown, which began on March 25, left lakhs of migrants stranded in different parts of the country. With no money and no work, many walked, cycled or hitchhiked their way to villages hundreds, sometimes thousands, of kilometres away.

11-06-2020||New Delhi||Hotter, drier weather linked to lower survival of coronavirus on surfaces: IIT-B study||Using a computer model, scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay have shown that a hotter and drier weather is linked to lower survival chances of the novel coronavirus on surfaces, a finding that may lead to better sanitisation guidelines for public spaces across the world.  The study, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, assessed how long the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, remains viable for infection after someone with COVID-19 coughs or sneezes.In order to calculate this, the researchers, including Rajneesh Bhardwaj and Amit Agarwal from IIT-Bombay, examined the drying time of respiratory droplets from infected subjects on various surfaces in six cities around the world, including New York and Singapore.These droplets, which are about the size of the width of a single human hair, are expelled from the mouth or nose when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or even speaks moistly, the study noted.Once the droplets carrying the virus evaporate, the scientists said the residual virus becomes inactive, so the survival and transmission of COVID-19 are directly impacted by how long the droplets remain intact.Based on their analysis, the researchers said the growth rate of COVID-19 is weakly linked to the outdoor weather, adding that the chances of the survival of the virus “increases roughly by five times under a humid condition as compared to a dry condition.”         In the study, the scientists used a mathematical model to assess the drying time for the droplets under different conditions and showed that ambient temperature, the type of surface, and humidity play critical roles.Citing an example, they said higher ambient temperature helped to dry out the droplet faster, and drastically reduced the chances of virus survival.The researchers added that in places with greater humidity, the droplet stayed on surfaces longer, and the virus survival chances improved.They also determined the droplet drying time in different outdoor weather conditions and examined if this data connected to the growth rate of the COVID-19 pandemic in six cities across the world—New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, Sydney, and Singapore.When the scientists plotted the growth rate of COVID-19 patients in these places with the drying time of a typical droplet, they found that in the cities with a larger growth rate of the pandemic, the drying time was longer.“In a way, that could explain a slow or fast growth of the infection in a particular city. This may not be the sole factor, but definitely, the outdoor weather matters in the growth rate of the infection,” said Rajneesh Bhardwaj, one of the co-authors of the study.“Understanding virus survival in a drying droplet could be helpful for other transmissible diseases that spread through respiratory droplets, such as influenza A,” said Amit Agrawal, another author of the study.Citing the limitations of the study, the scientists said they assumed air to be stationary in their model along with the consideration that the evaporation time is expected to reduce in the presence of air currents.“The value of the predicted evaporation times is on the conservative side, and the actual evaporation time will be smaller than that obtained here,” the researchers noted in the study.Despite these drawbacks in the model, they believe that surfaces like smartphone screens, cotton, and wood, should be cleaned more often than glass and steel surfaces since the latter are relatively hydrophilic, and the droplets evaporate faster on these materials.

11-06-2020||New Delhi||NIA arrests two for stealing computer hardware from INS Vikrant||Almost eight months after theft on board the indigenous aircraft carrier in Kerala's Cochin Shipyard, where INS Vikrant, is under construction, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested two suspects from Bihar and Rajasthan.An NIA spokesperson said the agency arrested Sumit Kumar Singh (23), a resident of Bihar's Munger district, and Daya Ram (22), a resident of Rajasthan's Hanumangarh, from their houses.The two were allegedly involved in the theft of computer hardware components from the under-construction Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) at the Cochin Shipyard Ltd. The theft on board the vessel was reported in September last year.According to NIA officials, four computers were dismantled and hard disks, RAMs and processors were stolen from the IAC in September last year.The stolen items included five micro-processors, 10 RAMs, five Solid State Drives (SSDs) from the Multi-Functional Consoles (MFCs) aboard the ship.The MFCs form part of the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) of the project.IMPS is a computerised system used onboard ships to monitor the working and course of the vessel and to warn against safety risks.The spokesperson said that during multiple searches in Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat conducted on Wednesday, some stolen electronic devices were recovered and incriminating materials seized.The case was first registered by Kerala Police on the complaint of the Cochin Shipyard authorities about the criminal trespass and theft of certain critical electronic components installed onboard the IAC.The NIA took over the probe on September 26 last year under several sections of IPC and Information Technology Act.The NIA had taken up the case following concerns over national security as sensitive information was stored in these hard disks.An NIA spokesperson said it conducted a detailed investigation into the "blind case" and analyzed fingerprints and palm-prints of more than five thousand persons, who had worked for the IAC project during the relevant period.A large number of witnesses were also examined.The NIA had also announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh in March this year for giving credible leads in the case.INS Vikrant is the first indigenous aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy. The work on the ship's design began in 1999, and the keel was laid in February 2009. As of 2019, the ship is expected to start sea trials in February 2021 and enter service as early as 2023. The project cost has neared Rs 20,000 crore.With the completion of INS Vikrant, India will join the ranks of US, UK, Russia, France and China in the construction of flight carriers.

11-06-2020||New Delhi||PIL in Delhi HC for imposing lockdown in City due to steep rise in COVID-19 cases||A PIL has been moved in the Delhi High Court seeking a direction to the AAP government to impose a strict lockdown in the National Capital in view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases here.The plea, by a lawyer and his office boy, has said the Delhi government itself admitted there would be around one lakh COVID-19 cases in the National Capital by the end of June and the number would escalate to around 2.25 lakh by mid-July and over 5.5 lakh by July-end.In such a scenario, the government should consider imposing strict lockdown in Delhi, the plea by lawyer Anirban Mondal and his employee Pawan Kumar has contended.The petition, filed through advocate Mridul Chakravarty, has also sought a direction to the Delhi government to consider constituting an expert committee of doctors, medical specialists and virologists to prepare a “detailed blue print” for controlling or containing the spread of the virus.The petitioners have sought imposition of lockdown on the ground that during the earlier lockdown period the rate of increase in cases was low.They claimed that by allowing movement of people and activities in the National Capital like reopening of public transport, religious places, malls, restaurants/ hotels, “the spread of the virus has severely spiked, resulting in a sharp rise in numbers of the daily cases of COVID-19”.The petition also alleged that there already exists a huge deficiency in the number of adequate beds/ ventilators/ICU wards/testing facilities in Delhi for dealing with COVID-19 and therefore, with increase in infections the situation in Delhi could get “darker” and “unmanageable”.It has also contended that the forthcoming rise in cases could send the health care infrastructure in Delhi into disarray.“That, primary focus/efforts/ resources of the State, as of right now should not be on the monetary/ economic aspects, but on health and safety of its people,” the petition has also said.

11-06-2020||London||Nirav Modi remanded in custody till July 9 by UK court||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, fighting extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case, was remanded in further custody until July 9 by a UK court on Thursday.The 49-year-old jeweller, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year, appeared via videolink for the remand hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London.He was remanded in further custody until July 9 as part of the regular 28-day “call-over” hearing."The next hearing will be a similar video link call-over towards the next stage of your extradition proceedings scheduled for September 7,” District Judge Samuel Goozee told Modi, who spoke only to confirm his name and nationality.Last month, Judge Goozee presided over the first part of the extradition trial, held in a partial remote setting due to the coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with the second part scheduled for a five-day hearing from September 7."I hope Mr Modi by the time we get to September, the current restrictions on movement from prisons have been eased and you can be in court in person to follow the proceedings,” the judge had told Modi, at the end of a four-day partial hearing of the case on May 14.Modi had been following the court proceedings from a room at Wandsworth Prison and could be seen taking notes during the course of the trial.The first part of the case focused on establishing a prima facie case against him but the schedule had to be re-timetabled as the government of India submitted a further set of documents as “corroboratory evidence”.The judge allowed the additional evidence to be introduced but agreed that Modi's defence team would require enough time to “digest” them.Therefore, a hearing already planned to deal with a second extradition request, made by the Indian authorities and certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this year on two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, has been effectively extended to conclude the prima facie case arguments.The judge has indicated that the two requests are “inextricably linked” and therefore he would be handing down an overall judgment after the second hearing, scheduled between September 7 and 11.The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by the Punjab National Bank (PNB), known as “letters of undertaking” (LoUs).Modi's team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems trade and that the LoUs were standard practice.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian government, has been laying out the case that several PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion.

The Centre has supported their plea for staggered payment. Asking them to pay the entire amount at once will adversely impact the telecom industry, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said.However, the Bench expressed reservations over their offer to make the payment in 20 years.During the hearing, the court raised several questions over DoT's AGR demand from PSUs.Clarifying that the issue of dues by PSUs was not dealt with, the Bench said its verdict on AGR issue was misinterpreted.The SC termed as 'totally impermissible' demand of DoT seeking several lakh crore rupees as AGR dues from PSUs.The DoT submitted that it would file an affidavit explaining why AGR demands had been raised against the PSUs.The Supreme Court had in January agreed to hear PSUs' pleas on the court's October 2019 AGR verdict which made non-telecom firms having licences for internal communications and signalling liable to pay licence fees on their entire revenue. This was despite the fact that they didn't offer telecom services.DoT had demanded over Rs 2,63,000 crore as AGR from non-telecom PSUs holding spectrum licence for internal communications, besides the Rs 92,000 crore that private telecom companies were supposed to pay.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agr-sc-asks-dot-to-reconsider-demands-made-to-non-telecom-psus-97703

Stating that leadership is composite of a number of qualities, the most important of which are self-confidence, moral ascendancy, self-sacrifice, fairness, initiative, decision, dignity and courage.He added that it is important for an officer to maintain a competitive streak within the parameters of sportsmanship and fairplay at all times.

11-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||Some in Bihar BJP want Nitish Kumar dumped, vie for a saffron CM face||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 11Union Home Minister Amit Shah, at his recent virtual rally for Bihar, attacked Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress and reiterated his party will contest the next Assembly elections in the state with incumbent Nitish Kumar of the JD-U as the Chief Minister face.This at a time when the Nitish Kumar-led government, of which the BJP is a partner, is facing anti-incumbency and his ratings are at an all-time low owing to the migrant labourer crisis and the rising corona cases in rural Bihar.A section of the state leadership, however, believes it's time for the BJP to go it alone and give people the option of a saffron CM--like Shah wants one for Odisha.In fact, the decision to back Nitish has come as a surprise to many given that JD(U) and Lalu Prasad’s RJD may no longer come together this time.“People will not accept the JD(U)-RJD combination after the coalition fiasco last time. Moreover, the ED sword will prevent that from happening. Plus, Nitish Kumar is not what he used to be. His ratings are at an all-time low, rural Bihar is upset with him, urban areas will welcome the change and there is enough space for the BJP to have its say,” opine observers. So why is the BJP backing him when it can easily fill the gap with smaller allies like Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP?Observers believe in Bihar the BJP is still identified as an upper caste party. Nitish Kumar’s presence gives it the advantage of non-Yadav OBCs and Extremely Backward Classes. Also, to dump him at this stage will be like accepting his failures while he was the CM of the government of which the BJP is a partner, they say. The interesting part will be the seat-sharing formula, they opine. This is when the BJP will make the political kill by ensuring it contests enough seats to be in a commanding position after the elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-in-bihar-bjp-want-nitish-kumar-dumped-vie-for-a-saffron-cm-face-97685

The incident occurred in Gadchinchile village, allegedly in the presence of police.The victims were identified as Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri (70), Sushil Giri Maharaj (35), and their driver Nilesh Telgade (30).The Maharashtra government opposed the petitions, saying similar pleas were pending before the Bombay High Court and the state police had arrested over 100 people in the case.On May 1, the Supreme Court had refused to stay the probe being conducted by the state police. While hearing another petition seeking a CBI probe, it had asked the state government to file a status report on the investigation.Apprehending bias on the part of Maharashtra police, the latest petitions sought transfer of the case to CBI/NIA.“Several video clippings have emerged on social media and news reports which very clearly demonstrate the active involvement of the police present, who can be seen handing over the three persons to the unlawful assembly of persons gathered,” one of the petitions read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-maharashtra-govt-to-respond-to-petitions-seeking-cbi-nia-probe-97674
11-06-2020||Kolkata||Covid crisis an opportunity, time for bold decisions and investments: Modi||Insisting that the COVID-19 crisis should be turned into an opportunity to create an 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said this is the time to make bold decisions and investments.Addressing the 95th annual plenary session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Kolkata through video-conference, he said steps had to be taken to ensure that products imported from abroad are manufactured in the country."In the last five-six years, India's goal of self-reliance has been paramount in the policy and practice of the country. The COVID-19 crisis gave us lessons on how to speed up efforts in that direction...This is not the time for a conservative approach; this is time for bold decisions and investments."This also is the time to move from command and control economy to plug-and-play and to build a competitive global supply chain," he said.While noting that people-centric, people-driven and planet-friendly development had become part of the BJP-led Central government's way of governance, the prime minister said recent decisions by the Centre had freed the farmers and rural economy from years of "slavery" as they now had the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country."India is fighting multiple challenges along with COVID-19, including floods, locust attack, earthquakes...We have to turn crises into opportunity for creating an Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat and take steps to ensure that products which we import from elsewhere are manufactured in India," Modi said.Quoting Swami Vivekananda, who had once written that Indians should produce for themselves and find markets in other countries, the prime minister said they had for long wished the country to become self-reliant in areas like medical equipment manufacturing, defence manufacturing, coal and minerals, edible oils and many more.Lauding the resolve of the countrymen to turn disaster into opportunity, the prime minister said the pandemic "will be a turning point of the country"."We have to make it a big turning point.....a turning point for creating a self-reliant India," he said.The prime minister also said that the country had already ushered in several reforms like changing the definition of MSMEs, decriminalising certain things (under the Companies Act), introducing Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, bringing in more competition in coal mining, altering the APMC and the Essential Commodities Act.Modi said time had come to revive Bengal's pre-eminence in manufacturing."It is the government's initiative to help the east and the north-east where Kolkata can emerge as the fulcrum to lead the entire development process," he added.He also urged MSMEs to enter the solar energy sector.Modi said banking services had now reached the "have nots". Initiatives such as Jandhan and Aadhaar had made it possible to reach necessary support to millions of people without leakage, he added.

The state has an estimated 78,000 polling booths, according to PTI. The digital rally was held shortly after Cyclone Amphan had torn into West Bengal, killing 72 people and “completely devastating” two districts in the state.On Twitter, the Congress and the AAP criticised the BJP for holding the rally amid the coronavirus pandemic and when “it did not have enough money to send migrants home.”BJP National General Secretary (Org), B L Santhosh, however, tweeted: “People in remote villages of West Bengal listening to @AmitShah during #BJPJanSamvad .

11-06-2020||Aurangabad||Lonar lake colour changes to pink; experts, locals surprised||The colour of water in Maharashtra’s Lonar lake, formed after a meteorite hit the Earth some 50,000 years ago, has changed to pink with experts attributing it to the salinity and presence of algae in the water body.Located around 500 km from Mumbai, the Lonar lake in Buldhana district is a popular tourist hub and also attracts scientists from all over the world.Of late, the change in colour of water of the lake, having a mean diameter of 1.2 km, has not only surprised locals, but also nature enthusiasts and scientists.Experts say this is not the first time that the colour change has happened, but this time it is more glaring.The lake, which is a notified national geo-heritage monument, has saline water with pH of 10.5, Gajanan Kharat, member of the Lonar lake conservation and development committee, told PTI.“There are algae in the water body. The salinity and algae can be responsible for this change,” he said.“There is no oxygen below one meter of the lake’s water surface. There is an example of a lake in Iran, where water becomes reddish due to increase in salinity,” he noted.Kharat said the level of water in the Lonar lake is currently low as compared to the few past years and there is no rain to pour fresh water in it.“The low level of water may lead to increased salinity and change in the behaviour of algae because of atmospheric changes...this may be the reason for colour change. This is not the first time that the colour of water has changed,” he said.Dr Madan Suryavanshi, head of the geography department of Aurangabad’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, said looking at the scale of this colour change, “this cant be a human intervention”.“In case of a natural phenomenon, there are fungi which generally give a greenish colour to water most of the times. This (the current colour change) seems to be a biological change in the Lonar crater,” he said.During the lockdown phase, there may not have been any disturbance to water which led to this change, he said.“Season-wise changes occur in water and this might be case with the Lonar lake. We can examine the change if we go there in a week...then we can say more about the change,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lonar-lake-colour-changes-to-pink-experts-locals-surprised-97645
11-06-2020||Jaipur||BJP offered Rs 25 crore to Rajasthan Cong MLAs: Gehlot||The Congress on Wednesday charged the BJP with attempts to destabilise the Rajasthan government with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot claiming that some of the party MLAs were offered Rs 25 crore each.Gehlot's statement came hours after the Congress took its MLAs to a Jaipur resort for a meeting ahead of the elections to three seats of the Rajya Sabha in the state on June 19. Claiming a heavy transfer of cash to Jaipur, Gehlot said there were reports about the BJP's plan similar to that of Madhya Pradesh and some of the party MLAs were offered Rs 25 crore in cash with Rs 10 crore in advance.But the party MLAs were 'alert and united', he said, adding that the condition of those who left the Congress to join the BJP was not good.He also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the Rajya Sabha elections were postponed under pressure because the BJP could not poach MLAs in Rajasthan and Gujarat.About the meeting with the MLAs, Gehlot said it was fruitful and they will meet again on Thursday. Earlier in the day, Congress' national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, who arrived in Jaipur to attend the meeting of the Congress MLAs and Independent legislators, said 'repeated assassination' of public mandate has become the BJP's character.The BJP's conspiracy in Rajasthan will not succeed, he said, adding that the Congress MLAs are 'fearless', therefore, they are not going to fall into any temptation and the BJP will get the 'right reply' through democracy.Stressing that the party has an absolute majority, he said no one can 'defeat the public mandate or democracy'.Alleging a bid to poach the party MLAs and the independent legislators backing the government, government chief whip Mahesh Joshi too forwarded a written complaint to the DG, Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). He sought action against 'identified' elements for the corrupt conduct and attempts for destabilising the government.“It has come to my knowledge that like Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, attempts are being made to destabilise the government in Rajasthan,” Joshi said in the complaint.However, he did not specify who is making the attempts. ACB DG Alok Tripathi said action will be taken on the complaint. Amid this, the MLAs who were called at chief minister's residence in the evening for a meeting for the Rajya Sabha elections were taken to the Shiv Vilas resort on the Delhi highway in Jaipur, where the meeting was held.“The meeting was fruitful today. The MLAs were asked to go tonight and we will meet again tomorrow,” Gehlot told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday night. AICC general secretary Avinash Pande and the party's Rajya Sabha candidate from Rajasthan K C Venugopal will also remain present in the meeting on Thursday.On the other hand, state BJP president Satish Poonia said the Congress in Rajasthan is "feeling insecure"."Their own house is not in order. They do not trust their MLAs," Poonia said.The Congress has nominated K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi for the Rajya Sabha elections scheduled for June 19 while the BJP fielded Rajendra Gehlot and Onkar Singh Lakhawat.In the assembly of 200, the Congress has 107 MLAs, including six those who defected to the party from the BSP last year. The party enjoys the support of 12 of the 13 Independent MLAs in the state. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-offered-rs-25-crore-to-rajasthan-cong-mlas-gehlot-97634
