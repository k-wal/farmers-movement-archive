It reflected an intent to change the facts on ground in violation of all our agreements to not change the status quo,’’ said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastav.He recalled that at the meeting of senior Military Commanders held on June 6, an agreement was reached on de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC. But the PLA took premeditated and planned action that was “directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties suffered by both sides”, he said.Given its responsible approach to border management, India is very clear that all its activities are always within the Indian side of the LAC. “We expect the Chinese side to also confine its activities to its side of the LAC,” added Srivastav.The two sides remain in regular touch through their respective embassies and foreign offices while at the ground level the two sides have maintained communication at the commanders’ level.  Meetings of other established diplomatic mechanisms such as Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on Border Affairs (WMCC) are under discussion.While we remain firmly convinced of the need for maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the borders areas and the resolution of differences through dialogue, at the same time, as PM Modi stated, we are also strongly committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.Read also:Indian troops on border duty carry arms: Jaishankar to RahulIndian, Chinese armies hold Major General-level talks for third straight dayWhy Indian soldiers were sent 'unarmed to martyrdom' in Ladakh: RahulChina brushes aside questions on attack by its troops on Indian soldiers, damming Galwan river||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-activity-on-indian-side-led-to-galwan-valley-clash-mea-100922

18-06-2020||---||China to lose two Indian public sector tenders after Galwan Valley clash||New Delhi, June 18In what could be a sign of things to come, two large public sector undertakings are on the verge of cancelling contracts given to Chinese companies, including some linked to the People’s Liberation Army which had killed 20 Indian soldiers in a clash in Galwan Valley.In one case, the ostensible reason for the railways deciding to terminate the contract of a Chinese company is poor progress. But “ownership pattern” is the cause for BSNL being asked not to permit Huawei and ZTE to participate in the tenders for upgrading the 4G network.The railways contract of Rs 471 crore to Beijing National Railway R & D Institute of Signal on the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, that is itself making slow progress, is being cancelled for completing only 20 per cent of the work so far.In case of telecom sector project, Department of Telecom (DoT) has hinted at the “ownership pattern” of the two Chinese telecom companies as the reason for asking BSNL to steer clear of them. The DoT may also ask private companies to also not use equipment by such Chinese companies. Both Huawei and ZTE have faced hurdles in other countries because their owners have had connections to PLA.In case of the railways, officials cite poor performance and inability to deliver the project on time as the reasons since it is a World Bank-funded project. Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation Limited (DFCCIL) has already written to the World Bank for terminating the contract. The Chinese company is also being charged with not sharing technical documents and not posting engineers at the project site.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-to-lose-two-indian-public-sector-tenders-after-galwan-valley-clash-100888
18-06-2020||New Delhi||After a brief lull, Monsoon to reach NCR, Haryana by June 25: IMD||The southwest monsoon appears to be taking a break and is not likely to progress further till June 21. However, conditions are likely to become favourable for its further advance into Uttar Pradesh and parts of the western Himalayan region from June 22 to June 24.It is likely to reach Haryana and National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) around June 25, the IMD said on Thursday.During its progress, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/thundershowers with isolated heavy falls likely over Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh between June 22 and 24.Under favorable meteorological conditions, there had been steady progress of monsoon during the past week (between June 11 and 16).Seasonal rains have covered the entire Northeast and East India, most parts of West and Central India and some parts of Uttar Pradesh during this period.The Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) is passing through Kandla, Ahmedabad, Indore, Raisen, Khajuraho, Fatehpur, Bahraich since June 16 where it remained till Thursday, that is June 18.Meanwhile, the IMD has predicted heatwave to severe heatwave conditions over Rajasthan and heatwave conditions over Punjab during the next two days.Widespread rainfall activity very likely along the West Coast with isolated heavy to very heavy falls over Coastal Karnataka and Konkan & Goa, Northeast, East and adjoining Central India during next 3-4 days.As per private forecaster Skymet, until now the 2020 Monsoon has progressed almost in the "copybook style"."It kept its date with the normal onset over Kerala. The onset over Gujarat is well ahead of time. Usually, monsoon reaches parts of Kutch around June 25, this time it is almost 10 day early. Likewise in the Central and Eastern parts of the country, either it is on time or slightly ahead by a day or two," said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.While the initial push to monsoon over west coast came via Nisarga, in the second week of June, the low-pressure area over Bengal became instrumental in boosting its progress in Eastern and Central parts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-a-brief-lull-monsoon-to-reach-ncr-haryana-by-june-25-imd-100879

The aircraft is shown at an altitude of 31,000 feet and speed of 440 knots or roughly 800 kmph.IAF midair refuellers, that are based at Agra, have also been tracked flying in the northern sector recently by some plane spotting sites.Built on a Boeing 737 airframe, the P-8I is a long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare platform used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions as well as for other critical missions like search-and-rescue, anti-piracy and supporting operations of other arms of the military.In February this year, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat had revealed that the P-8 aircraft had also been deployed to carry out extensive surveillance on the movement and deployment of Chinese troops during the 73-day-long standoff between India and China at Doklam on the tri-junction of India-Bhutan-China in the east in 2017.The person who had posted Thursday’s image of the Naval P-8I had on Wednesday re-tweeted satellite pictures of escalating build-up of Chinese forces on May 19 showing armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, command posts, trucks and other equipment about 43 kms south east of the LAC in Galwan Valley area.According to sources, the Navy’s P-8Is have been used on surveillance missions in support of the Army in various sectors on earlier occasions, including during the current stand-off in Ladakh as well as in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack. They use the synthetic aperture radar, inverse synthetic aperture radar, electro-optic instruments and infrared to map surface areas as well as their onboard electronic warfare suites to scan the electromagnetic domain.The P-8Is were inducted into the Indian Navy in 2013, Of the 12 aircraft ordered so far, India has received eight, making India the second largest operator of this aircraft in the world. Another four aircraft are on-schedule to be delivered in 2020. The Navy operates these aircraft with Indian Naval Air Squadron 312, The Albatross, at INS Rajali near Arakkonam in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plane-spotters-post-on-twitter-track-of-indian-navys-surveillance-aircraft-moving-towards-ladakh-100873
18-06-2020||Beijing||China brushes aside questions on attack by its troops on Indian soldiers, damming Galwan river||Parrying questions about the brutal attack carried out by its troops on the Indian soldiers with iron rods and spikes on June 15, China on Thursday also declined to respond to queries on reports of it building a dam on the Galwan river at the Sino-Indian border to obstruct its flow.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian in his media briefing skirted questions for a second consecutive day about the casualties suffered by the Chinese troops in their clash with the Indian soldiers at the Galwan Valley on Monday night.Asked about allegations that Col Santosh Babu and other Indian soldiers were brutally attacked with iron rods and spikes by Chinese soldiers and whether the confrontation started when the Indian troops arrive to demolish structures set up by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Zhao reiterated China's allegation, squarely blaming the Indian troops for the incident."The right and wrong of this case is very clear and responsibility doesn't lie with the Chinese side," he said, adding that China has provided the details of the case.India has trashed China's claim of sovereignty over the Galwan Valley, saying such "exaggerated" and "untenable" claims are contrary to the understanding reached during a high-level military dialogue on June 6.China's foreign ministry as well as the military this week claimed that the Galwan Valley has always been a part of the country.In a sharp reaction to the claim by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava referred to an agreement reached between the Chinese and Indian militaries on "disengagement" during the Lt General-level talks on June 6."Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding," he said in a statement in New Delhi early on Thursday.The Galwan Valley was the site of the violent clash between the two militaries on Monday night in which a Colonel and 19 other Indian Army personnel were killed. China's official media has acknowledged casualties on the Chinese side without mentioning numbers.To a question about satellite photos taken on June 16 showing China building a dam on the Galwan river blocking its water flow and whether it violated any agreement with India, Zhao said, “I am not aware of the specifics you mentioned”.During Thursday's press briefing, Zhao referred to Wednesday's telephone talks between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during which, he pointed out that, "both sides agreed to deal with the serious situation caused by the conflict in a just manner and jointly observe the consensus reached at the commander level meeting, de-escalate tensions as soon as possible”.  The two ministers have also agreed based on the agreements reached by the two countries reached so far to maintain the peace and tranquillity in the border areas, he said.  "I would like to stress the Indian troops at the western section of the boundary and some other areas crossed LAC and tried to unilaterally change the status quo," he alleged."The Chinese troops are committed to uphold peace and tranquillity along the border areas. They have been exercising restraint. They are determined to safeguard our national sovereignty and security”, he said."We urge the Indian side to immediately withdraw their personnel crossing the line, strictly restrain its troops and observe consensus reached by the leaders of two countries and agreements existing so far and jointly work with us to uphold peace tranquillity in the border area," he said.After this incident, both sides are in communication and coordination on the matter through diplomatic and military channels, he said."Both sides agreed to deal with the serious matter caused by the conflict at the valley in a just manner, jointly observe the commander level talks consensus and deescalate the tensions as soon as possible and safeguard the peace and tranquillity," he said."Currently the overall situation is stable and controllable. We believe under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries the two sides can deal with the relevant matter jointly safeguard peace and stability at the border areas and work for the sound development of bilateral relations”, he said.During the briefing, the spokesman read out the whole press statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday on the telephonic conversation between Wang and Jaishankar.A large number of Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in Galwan Valley and certain other areas of eastern Ladakh for the last five weeks, including in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh.Monday's face-off was the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed in the face-off.The Indian Army has been fiercely objecting to the transgressions, and demanded their immediate withdrawal for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the area. Both sides held a series of talks in the last few days to resolve the row.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.

He had earlier attacked Modi, asking why he was "hiding".Hitting back, Patra said Gandhi wants to show that India left its unarmed soldiers to die and then cited a 1996 agreement between China and India, when Deve Gowda was prime minister, that prohibited armies of both countries from using any weapon within two km of their border. "You are the most irresponsible politician India has yet seen. Read, understand and then speak. Just don't rant against your country. Don't make such unfounded and misleading claims against your own country to launch your politics," he said. Patra claimed that the country will 'fight all three Cs" together and emerge victorious if the Congress stands against its sentiments. The three Cs were the coronavirus, the stand-off with China and the Congress, he claimed. The prime minister is not merely a person or is of a party, but he represents the entire country, Patra said, attacking Gandhi for his "immature and irresponsible" tweets. Modi has asserted that there will be no compromise with Indian territorial integrity, the BJP spokesperson noted, and said Gandhi does not trust the prime minister, defence minister or even Army chief, who had recently commented over the issue. "You need to deescalate this politics of misinformation and propaganda. India will not forgive Rahul Gandhi for this sort of escalation," he said. Gandhi had also cast doubts on surgical strikes and air strikes against terrorists inside Pakistan, Patra alleged. He also referred to a 2008 MoU between the Congress and the ruling Communist party of China and asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul to explain its details.  Rahul Gandhi, a Congress general secretary then, and Xi Jinping, the current Chinese president who was then a general secretary of his party, had signed it, Patra said. The MoU, he claimed reading from news reports, was aimed at building relationship between the Congress, the "Nehru Gandhi family in particular", and China's ruling party.  During the 2017 Doklam stand-off between India and China, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had a dinner meeting with the Chinese envoy, Patra said, noting that the Congress had first denied it before acknowledging it. Rahul Gandhi's fresh attack on the government came a day after he asked Defence Minister Rajnath Singh why he did not name China in his tweet and why it took him two days to condole the deaths of 20 Army personnel."China has committed a big crime by killing unarmed Indian soldiers. I want to ask who sent these bravehearts towards danger without arms and why. Who is responsible for this," he asked in a video message.

18-06-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi to launch Rs 50,000 cr 'Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan' for migrants in 116 districts: FM Sitharaman||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch a Rs 50,000 crore PM Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhyan from Khagaria district on Saturday to provide 125 days of employment to returned migrants in 116 districts of six states, said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at a press conference on Thursday."We have found that migrant workers returned in large numbers to 116 districts, spread over six states—Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan. The Government will pool 25 different projects to give jobs to migrant workers who have returned amid coronavirus crisis. The government will front-load Rs 50,000 crore for the cause. The top priority of PM Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan is to provide immediate relief to migrant workers who have gone home,’’ said the Finance Minister.Activities which are otherwise spread over 25 schemes in a period of six months to one year will be frontloaded so that there no dearth of money. "No issue will hamper the scheme. As we go along, we will see how many will stay back for continued employment,’’ added the Minister.Officials later revealed that the cut off for including districts is a minimum of 25,000workers per district. The Government has not included West Bengal because when the scheme was drawn up on June 15, migrants had not "settled down’’. Though UP had more returning migrants, only 31 of its districts have been included as against 32 from Bihar.Sitharaman said the Government had mapped the skill sets of migrants, many of whom were adept in the construction sector. Nearly three-fourths of the surveyed the returning migrants were skilled and they will be offered employment in construction of wells, roads and village houses, laying of fibre optic cables besides horticultural activities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-launch-rs-50-000-cr-garib-kalyan-rojgar-abhiyaan-for-migrants-in-116-districts-fm-sitharaman-100861
18-06-2020||This article was first published in The Tribune on  October 15||Why India and China went to war in 1962||by Zorawar Daulet Singh(The writer is author of Himalayan Stalemate: Understanding the India China Dispute)INDIAN historian John Lall once observed, "Perhaps nowhere else in the world has such a long frontier been unmistakably delineated by nature itself". How then, did India and China defy topographical odds to lock into an impasse that was ultimately tested on the battlefield?In retrospect, certain fundamental factors can be identified that framed the context of India-China interactions in the 1950s. Despite attaining a bloody independence in 1947, a truncated India viewed itself as the inheritor of the legacy of British India's frontiers. While the Nehru regime was acutely aware of the changed geopolitical context, its perception of the northern frontiers was based on the institutional memory of a century of frontier making by British strategists.The bone of contentionThe border with China runs 3488 km. It can be divided into three sectors:Western Sector: This includes the border between Jammu and Kashmir and Xinjiang and Tibet. India claims that China is occupying 43,000 sq km in this sector, including 5180 sq km illegally ceded to it by Pakistan.Central Sector: This includes borders shared by Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand with Tibet. Shipki La and Kaurik areas in HP and areas around Pulam, Thag La, Barahori, Kungri Bingri La, Lapthal and Sangha are disputed.Eastern Sector: China disputes India's sovereignty over 90,000 sq km, mostly in Arunachal Pradesh. Tawang, Bum La, Asaphi La and Lo La are among the sensitive points in this sector. Strategically vital Tawang holds the key to the defence of the entire sub-Himalayan space in this sector. Let's briefly deconstruct this legacy. It is now accepted that British India's frontier policies had failed to produce a single integrated and well-defined northern boundary separating the Indian subcontinent from Xinjiang and Tibet. The legacy, however, was more nuanced. In the eastern sector, the British had largely attained an ethnically and strategically viable alignment via the 1914 Simla conference of India, China and Tibet, even though the Chinese repudiated the agreement itself.The underlying rationale for British policy was to carve a buffer around an autonomous 'Outer Tibet' not very dissimilar to the division of Mongolia in 1913 that Russia and China had agreed upon. While this policy of an attempted zonal division of Tibet never materialised, the fortuitous byproduct of this episode was the delimiting of a border alignment between India and Tibet that mirrors more or less the de facto position today. It is instructive to note that China's principal concern back then was not the precise boundary between Tibet and India but the borders and the political relationship between Tibet and China. In contrast, the legacy of the western sector was more blurred. This sector, the crux of the dispute, was never formally delineated nor successfully resolved by British India. The fluid British approach in this sector was shaped by the geopolitical and geoeconomic goals of its empire, and was never designed to meet the basic requirements of a sovereign nation state.NEW POWER EQUILIBRIUMThere were almost a dozen attempts by the British to arrive at exactly where the boundaries should lie. Most, however, were exploratory surveys by frontier agents reflecting British expansion in the north-west frontiers rather than a concerted pursuit of an international border. And, they varied with the then geopolitical objectives of London, vis-à-vis the perceived Russian threat. For instance, when Russia threatened Xinjiang, some British strategists advocated an extreme northern Kashmiri border. At times, opinion favoured a relatively moderate border, with reliance even being placed on Chinese control of Xinjiang as a buffer against Russia.The only serious, albeit futile, attempts by the British to map the border east of the Karakoram pass with China were made in 1899 and 1905. The Chinese never responded to these proposals. Interestingly, Alastair Lamb's 1973 study argues that the 1899 line when plotted on a modern map rather than on one relying on surveys done in the nineteenth century would place the eastern portion of Aksai Chin, including the area covering the Xinjiang-Tibet road, in China.In 1947, no definite boundary line to the east of the Karakoram Pass existed. On the official 1950 India Map, Kashmir's boundary east of this pass was expressed as ‘Boundary Undefined’, while the 1914 McMahon Line was clearly shown as the boundary in the eastern sector. The only two points accepted by India and China was that the Karakoram Pass and Demchok, the western and eastern extremities of this sector, were in Indian territory. Opinion differed on how the line traversed between the two points. Thus, in effect, India and China were faced with a ‘no man's land’ in eastern Ladakh, where the contentious Aksai Chin lay.Read also: This situation would have sufficed had Chinese power remained weak and relatively ambivalent to its southern periphery, as it had during most of the British colonial experience in India. But across the Himalayas, the restoration of Chinese power in 1949 and its thrust into Tibet in 1951, showed that Mao's China had awoken after its ‘century of humiliation’.Adjustment to the new power equilibrium was unavoidable. Path dependence and institutional memory of previous British Indian frontier policies and its attendant impulse for a forward presence had to be reconciled with the reality of a rejuvenated China. The dilemma for India was to reconcile the colonial legacy that had produced the foundation for a strategically secure northern frontier and special relations with the smaller Himalayan states, with the post-colonial reality that obliged India to discard the symbols of the very policies that had bequeathed these privileges to India. A bit of hypocrisy was unavoidable if an independent but weaker India was to secure itself against a stronger China.The essence of the Indian response was an uneasy combination of realism and accommodation of Chinese interests. And in the absence of military modernisation constrained by economic and institutional resources, diplomacy and soft external balancing via an attempt to leverage the superpower rivalry assumed the major burden of advancing India's diplomatic position and preventing conflict. Little effort was expended on internal balancing until after 1962.Further, the spillover of the Cold War into South Asia, largely via an American decision in the early 1950s to buttress Pakistan as a regional client, reduced India's options of external balancing. It made an alignment with the West unappealing to the nationalist consensus among the Indian elites that had produced the philosophy of non-alignment.CHINESE FAIT ACCOMPLINehru's response to the 1954 US-Pakistan alliance exemplified this: "The United States imagines that by this policy they have completely outflanked India's so-called neutralism and will thus bring India to her knees. Whatever the future may hold, this is not going to happen". This explains much of India's early efforts to forge an accommodation with China, and the 1954 agreement over Tibet must be viewed in such a context rather than simply as an idealistic expression of Nehru's pan-Asian vision.The 1954 agreement was essentially a Chinese fait accompli extracting a de jure Indian endorsement of China's sovereignty over Tibet and India relinquishing its special British-era privileges. The agreement was valid for eight years, till June 1962, and as relations turned sour, China would have to wait another five decades for a reiteration of the 1954 Indian position. This came in 2003 in a joint declaration at Beijing. Curiously, this important shift in the Indian position was once again undertaken without a reciprocal Chinese concession other than a tacit acknowledgment of India's sovereignty over Sikkim.Returning to the April 1954 agreement, where India erred was in extracting a quid quo pro. Some have interpreted 1954 as an implicit trade-off that resolved the border issue. Indeed, the Nehru government seemed to believe it had addressed all Sino-Indian questions.On 1 July 1954, shortly after the agreement, Nehru, through a note to the Secretary-General and Foreign Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, stated that, "All our old maps dealing with the frontier should be carefully examined, and where necessary, withdrawn. New maps should be printed showing our northern and northeastern frontier without any reference to any ‘line’. These new maps should also not state there is any undemarcated territory…Both as flowing from our policy and as a consequence of our Agreement with China, this frontier should be considered a firm and definite one which is not open to discussion with anybody". As it turned out, this was a significant decision because the new maps of 1954 publicly committed India to a cartographic position over territory in the western sector that was known to have been of ambiguous provenance.MILITARY CONFRONTATIONThe central puzzle, of course, is why did India not bring up the border issue during the 1954 negotiations with the Chinese? Archival evidence reveals that Nehru's unwillingness to unilaterally raise the boundary issue at the time was based on an assumption that Beijing might respond by offering to negotiate a fresh boundary, which could have been disadvantageous to India. Nehru instructed his negotiators that if the Chinese raised the boundary issue "we should express our surprise and point out that this is a settled issue". By not explicitly linking China's ownership over Tibet with a reciprocal and wider agreement on the frontiers was an extraordinary error of judgment.Further, India gave no expression to its revised 1954 maps showing a settled northern border. Unlike in the east, where India proactively extended its sovereignty over Tawang in 1951, which was not contested by China at the time, and reaffirmed close relations with Bhutan, Nepal, and Sikkim, India did little to alter the ground reality in the west. Though historical record did not support Chinese claims in Aksai Chin, the Chinese by virtue of their expanded presence in Tibet would henceforth view Aksai Chin as a strategically located area to maintain their supply lines to Tibet. That Delhi knew little of these remote eastern parts of Ladakh was evident in the subsequent course of events such as the discovery of the Xinjiang-Tibet road after it was written about in a Chinese magazine in 1957!India officially claimed Aksai Chin in a note to the Chinese Ambassador in Delhi in October 1958. A few months later, a rebellion in Tibet led to the exodus of the Dalai Lama to India. The first armed clash with China occurred at Longju in the east on 25 August 1959. On 21 October 1959, at the Kongka Pass in the west, Chinese guards killed nine members of an Indian patrol team and took ten prisoners. The wheels of dispute were set in motion though it would still take an unfortunate international conjuncture to transform a political disagreement into a military confrontation.From genesis to nemesis— Compiled by Vijay MohanOctober 1950: Chinese troops cross the Sino-Tibetan boundary and move towards Lhasa.April 1954: Sino-Indian Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between India and Tibet region of China signed by Jawaharlal Nehru and Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai in Beijing.May 1954: China and India sign the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence or Panchsheel.June 1954: Zhou Enlai visits India for the first time, stresses on the adherence to the five principlesMarch 1955: India objects to the inclusion of a portion of India's northern frontier on the official map of China, calling it a clear infringement of PanchsheelNovember 1956: Zhou Enlai visits India for the second time on a goodwill mission.September 1958: India officially objects to the inclusion of a big chunk of Northern Assam and NEFA (now Arunachal Pradesh) in China Pictorial.January 1959: Zhou Enlai spells out for the first time China's claims to over 40,000 square miles of Indian territory both in Ladakh and NEFA.April 1959: Dalai Lama escapes from Lhasa and crosses into Indian territory.August 1959: Chinese troops open fire on an Indian picket near Migyitun in eastern Ladakh, killing an Indian soldier.

18-06-2020||New Delhi||Indian, Chinese armies hold Major General-level talks for third straight day||Indian and Chinese militaries held Major General-level dialogue on Thursday for the third consecutive day on disengagement of troops as well as restoration of normalcy in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, official sources said.Galwan Valley was the site of a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops on Monday evening that resulted in the death of a colonel and 19 other Indian Army soldiers. Around 18 Indian Army soldiers also sustained serious injuries in the clash.The talks between the two sides near Galwan Valley ended in a stalemate on Tuesday as well as Wednesday, sources said.On Wednesday, the two sides discussed ways to implement the disengagement of troops from the region as agreed to during a high-level military dialogue on June 6.Sending a strong message to China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said India wanted peace but is capable of giving a befitting reply if instigated.The clash in Galwan Valley is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while the death toll on the Chinese side was over 300.The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of the eastern Ladakh since May 5 when the two sides clashed on the bank of the Pangong Tso.After the standoff began, the Indian military leadership decided that Indian troops would adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The trigger for the face-off was China's stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.

18-06-2020||New Delhi||SC stays Lord Jagganath's Rath Yatra due to Covid||The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the famous Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Temple, Puri in Odisha scheduled to commence June 23 in view of rising number of Covid-19 patients."A procession of this magnitude cannot be permitted at the time of a pandemic... Lord Jagannath will not forgive us if we allow this to continue," a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said while ordering a ban on all activities related to the Rath Yatra 2020."We consider it appropriate that in the interest of public health and safety of citizens to restrain the Respondents from holding the Rath Yatra this year. We direct that no Rath Yatra will be held in the temple area of Odisha", said the Bench—which also included Justice Dinesh Maheshwari and Justice AS Bopanna.The Puri Rath Yatra festival—which attracts a large number of Indian and foreign tourists—is attended by lakhs of devotees and goes on for almost 20 days. Last year an estimated one million people had taken part in it.The order came on a PIL filed by Odisha Vikas Parishad seeking this year's festival in view of Covid-19 which has already claimed more than 12,000 lives in India.The petitioner NGO said all the rituals leading up to the Rath Yatra such as ‘Akshay Trutiya' and ‘Snana Purnima' had been allowed to be performed by the Odisha government. If Rath Yatra might was allowed, it will have catastrophic impact, the NGO submitted.On behalf of the petitioner, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said such a huge congregation of nearly 10 lakh people can't be permitted during a pandemic.  Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, wanted the court to allow some rituals but it was opposed by senior Advocate Harish Salve who appeared for the state government. Salve cautioned against dangers of such a congregation.""We have experience that anytime something is allowed, people gather," the Bench said and went on to order stay on the Rath Yatra.It cited the example of Tablighi Jamaat's religious congregation held in March in Delhi that had led to spike in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-lord-jagganaths-rath-yatra-due-to-covid-100850

You (Rahul Gandhi) need to de-escalate your misinformation because India will not forgive you,” Patra said. Patra further alleged that there was “an agreement” between India’s main opposition, the Congress party, and the Communist Party of China (CPC), the ruling party in China, to consult on important issues.India will fight and win against all “three Cs”, Corona, a stand-off with China, and Congress and its misinformation, Patra said.Meanwhile, BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda said the party had cancelled all its political programmes including virtual rallies for next two days to honour the “supreme sacrifice” of the 20 soldiers who laid down their lives for India in a violent face-off with the Chinese army in Ladakh.“The supreme sacrifice of our brave soldiers while guarding our motherland in Galwan valley will always be remembered. The nation is indebted to them. I pay homage to the martyrs. BJP has decided to postpone all its political programmes including virtual rallies for next two days,” Nadda tweeted.The supreme sacrifice of our brave soldiers while guarding our motherland in Galwan valley will always be remembered.

18-06-2020||Arun JoshiJammu||China rattled by ‘boycott China’ campaign launched by Ladakhis, echoed by rest of India||China is rattled by the “boycott” Chinese products campaign in India, which had began with prominent Ladakhi voices in the middle of the stand-off in eastern Ladakh, but has now cascaded into a wave of national anger after the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in clashes with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on Monday.These voices had started from Ladakh where a prominent environmentalist Sonam Wangchuk was the first to call for the boycott of Chinese products. He had started the slogans: ‘Boycott China', 'Boycott Made in China', 'Anywhere but China’ which is now finding an echo all across the country.There is a deluge of articles and comments in the Chinese media on Beijing’s worry over the 'boycott China' campaign. These articles have advised, suggested and requested Indians not to resort to this ‘extreme step’. There is a constant reminder to Indians that their relations with China have progressed through centuries.Also read: (From The Tribune archives) Why India and China went to war in 1962The worry for Beijing has increased as Indians have started cancelling their bookings with the companies allied with Chinese counterparts. This sentiment among Indians has grown as body bags and the graphic description of the violent clashes—with rocks and batons wrapped with barbed wire—has injured their national pride.Liu Xiaoxue, an associate research fellow at the National Institute of International Strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in Global Times, the mouthpiece of China’s all-powerful Communist Party,"While assessing the new tensions at the border, India should understand that China’s restraint is not weak." India should curb ‘boycott China’ voices after border clash. Blindly associating border issues with investments and trade is illogical. Both sides need to cherish precious development opportunities amid #COVID19 uncertainty. https://t.co/ZzNJIoh2mx pic.twitter.com/cZLJWHfprk  The author reminds India of the pandemic-imposed stresses on the global economy and the greater vulnerability of the developing countries like India as he writes: “If border tensions escalate and adverse factors increase, investment may withdraw.”A grim picture of India is painted by reading the pandemic-infected nations’ table in the article titled ‘India should curb ‘boycott China’ voices after border clash’. The article says: “India currently has the fourth most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, but it is not continuing its lockdown. That shows its economy is facing great pressure - particularly when it comes to the country’s large number of people living in poverty. Many face an immediate threat to survival if they lose their jobs during the lockdown.”There is clear hypocrisy in the Chinese strategic thinking, as it is reluctant to settle the border issue in Ladakh, where the sentiments have flared up, and at the same time does not want India to take any economic action against it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-rattled-by-boycott-china-campaign-launched-by-ladakhis-echoed-by-rest-of-india-100836
18-06-2020||New Delhi||Modi launches auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opens India's coal sector for private players, and termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance.Launching the auction of mines for commercial mining, that is expected to garner Rs 33,000 crore of capital investment in the country over the next five to seven years, the Prime Minister said India would win the coronavirus war and turn this crisis into an opportunity, and the pandemic would make India self-reliant.The launch of the auction process not only marks the beginning of unlocking of the country's coal sector from the “lockdown of decades”, but aims at making India the largest exporter of coal, the Prime Minister said.At present, despite being the world's fourth-largest producer, India is the second-largest importer of the dry-fuel, he said."Allowing private sector in commercial coal mining is unlocking resources of a nation with the world's fourth-largest reserves," he pointed out.Major scams had taken place in coal action earlier, but the system had been made "transparent" now, the PM said lambasting past policies of keeping the sector closed.The PM said this auction process would result in major revenues to states and create employment besides developing the far-flung areas.The commencement of auction process of these blocks, part of the series of announcements made under 'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan', is likely to contribute Rs 20,000 crore revenues annually to the state governments.In line with the Prime Minister's self-reliance call, the aim behind the auction process is to achieve self-sufficiency in meeting energy needs and boosting industrial development.The government had taken an important decision to open up coal and mining sector to competition, capital and technology, he said.Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi, who was also present during the launch event, said Rs 50,000 crore is being invested in the sector to jack up India's coal output to 1 billion tonne.With a view to achieving self-reliance in the coal sector, the Ministry of Coal in association with FICCI launched the process of auction of 41 coal mines under the provisions of Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act and Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act.Upon attainment of peak-rated capacity of production of 225 million tonnes (MT), the government said, these mines would contribute about 15 per cent of the country's projected total coal production in 2025-26.It will also lead to employment generation for more than 2.8 lakh people - direct employment to approximately 70,000 people and indirect employment to approximately 2.1 lakh people, as per the government.

On Wednesday, he asked Defence Minister Rajnath Singh why did he "insult" the Army by not naming China over the killing of Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley."If it was so painful: Why insult Indian Army by not naming China in your tweet? Why take 2 days to condole? Why address rallies as soldiers were being martyred," he said.On Thursday, he added, "How dare China kill our UNARMED soldiers? Why were our soldiers sent UNARMED to martyrdom."               Twenty Indian Army personnel, including a colonel, were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night, the biggest military confrontation in over five decades that has significantly escalated the already volatile border standoff in the region.The clash in Galwan Valley on Monday night is the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La in 1967 when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.On Wednesday morning, the defence minister tweeted, "The loss of soldiers in Galwan is deeply disturbing and painful. Our soldiers displayed exemplary courage and valour in the line of duty and sacrificed their lives in the highest traditions of the Indian Army."

Noting that states with high downloads of AarogyaSetu App have shown positive results, the PM said more people must be encouraged to download it while cautioning that approaching monsoon season would add to pressure in dealing with challenges of health.Stressing the importance of telemedicine, he said efforts should be made to ensure that everyone, be it the people in home quarantine or isolation, or those suffering from other diseases, got its benefit.“There is also an emotional aspect of the fight against corona. We also have to find ways by which we can pull our citizens out of the stigma born out of the fear of the virus… If someone contracts coronavirus, he/she must not panic,” he said.Priority, he said, should be to provide essential services and ensure the required facilities to corona warriors, such as our doctors and other healthcare workers. “It is the responsibility of all of us, the entire nation, to look after them at every level.”Minister fined for not wearing maskGandhinagar: Gujarat’s Minister of State for Cooperation, Youth and Cultural Affairs Ishwarsinh Patel had to pay a fine of Rs200 to the Gandhinagar municipal corporation for not wearing mask while entering the state secretariat building to attend a weekly meeting of the Vijay Rupani cabinet on Wednesday afternoon.

18-06-2020||New Delhi||Reassess actions, take corrective steps: India||In the first high-level contact after the fatal Galwan valley clash, India and China used strong language against each other while seeking to defuse the tension on the ground.The unprecedented loss of lives on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will have a serious impact on the bilateral relationship, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told his counterpart Wang Yi during a telephonic conversation on Wednesday. The need of the hour was for the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps, he added.How did China occupy our area, asks SoniaToday, when there’s so much anger over the martyrdom of our soldiers, the PM should tell how the Chinese managed to occupy Indian territory and why our soldiers got killed? —  Sonia Gandhi, Congress chiefAdmitting to fatalities on the Chinese side as well, Wang also asked India “to thoroughly investigate and punish those responsible” for the clash and alleged that the Indian side had attacked Chinese officers and soldiers.The gulf between the perceptions of the two Foreign Ministers mirrored the different versions of the clash given by spokespersons of both Foreign Offices. However, India and Chinese readouts of today’s conversation concurred that both leaders agreed to handle the situation in a responsible manner and sincerely implement the disengagement understanding of June 6.The two ministers also agreed that neither side would take any action to escalate matters, but ensure peace and tranquillity as per bilateral agreements and protocols instead.In a rare authoritative account of the events on the ground, Jaishankar said an attempt by the PLA to erect a structure in the Galwan valley on the Indian side of the LAC became a source of dispute. The PLA took premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties. “It reflected the intent to change the facts on the ground in violation of all our agreements to not change the status quo,” he alleged.Wang said the “risky act” of the Indian Army had seriously violated the agreement reached by the two countries on the border issue. “The Indian side must not misjudge the current situation and must not underestimate China’s firm will to safeguard territorial sovereignty,” he cautioned.At the same time, the Chinese minister also spoke on the proper handling of the border situation through existing channels such as the Special Representatives on the Sino-Indian border. Wang is the Chinese Special Representative on the border issue and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is the Indian counterpart.They last met in December, after the reorganisation of J&K and an informal Xi-Modi summit, and had then agreed to introduce more elements of confidence-building in border management.Rajnath meets top military brassDefence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday morning reviewed the LAC situation in a meeting at South Block that was attended by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs.

18-06-2020||New Delhi||Possible military action could include short-term retaliation||After the bloody clash in the Galwan valley, New Delhi’s possible military action could include waiting for an opportune moment for a short-duration retaliation.The military action could be a part of the larger economic, diplomatic and political steps the ruling BJP-led NDA combine may choose to take, said a senior military official.Tweaking LAC normsat Line of Actual ControlThe standing instructions at present for soldiers confronting Chinese troops foreclose the option of opening fire.This morning Prime Minister Narendra Modi while discussing matters with chief ministers of states said: “Nobody should have any iota of doubt about this. India wants peace. But if provoked, India will give a befitting reply”.A senior military functionary said war or even a short skirmish might not be the correct answer for now.
