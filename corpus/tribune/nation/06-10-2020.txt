This number could also increase later, he added.JMM has no legislator in the outgoing house in Bihar.JMM which has made the lone RJD MLA in Jharkhand a minister was expecting kind treatment from Prasad’s party in the neighbouring state.Asked if this would have any impact on the ruling coalition of JMM-Congress-RJD in Jharkhand, Bhattcharya answered in negative.Bhattacharya who is also party’s chief spokesman said “RJD should not forget that we gave them a handsome number of seats in 2019 Jharkhand assembly elections more than its ‘Haisiyat’ (capacity) and also made the lone MLA of the party a minister”.Taking a swipe at RJD chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, he said “the man who has become a new leader of the party seems to have forgotten everything”.“We waited till today but the situation has become clear to us and we decided to fight the Bihar polls alone,” the JMM General Secretary said.While declaring the seat-sharing formula for Bihar elections on Friday last, Tejashwi Yadav had said that his party will accomodate JMM and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) from its quota of 144 seats out of total 243 seats.VIP has already pulled out of the grand alliance and is expected to be accomodated by the BJP from its share of seats.And now JMM has also decided to have no truck with the RJD-led coalition in the October-November polls in Bihar.Hemant Soren himself had met the RJD supremo in RIMS and held seat-sharing talks for Bihar elections.Prasad is in jail in Ranchi after being convicted in four cases of multi-crore rupees fodder scam.

The home department has now granted the seventh and final extension till December 31, 2020, to the commission and asked it submit its report,” the home department said in a notification.Commission secretary V V Palnitkar said they had written to the state government requesting to hold the notification till December and take the decision as per the future COVID-19 situation.“Even if we decide to resume our work by following social distancing norms, it would not be possible in a court room in Mumbai,” he told PTI.Palnitkar said several staff members of the commission are above 60 years of age and it would be difficult for them to travel in local trains.“It would not be feasible for witnesses to come to Mumbai and appear before the commission,” he said.The Elgar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima case is now being heard in the special NIA (National Investigation Agency) court in Mumbai.Violence had broken out near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial in Pune district on January 1, 2018.Dalits visit the memorial in large numbers as it commemorates the victory of British forces, which included Dalit soldiers over the army of the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of Pune in 1818.The police had claimed that provocative speeches at Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, led to the violence and Maoists were behind the conclave.They later arrested several Left-leaning activists including Telugu poet Varavara Rao and activist Sudha Bharadwaj for alleged links to Maoists. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/koregaon-bhima-panel-gets-final-extension-till-dec-31-151921
06-10-2020||New Delhi||Head of Afghan peace council Abdullah Abdullah in India on five-day visit||Head of Afghanistan’s peace council Abdullah Abdullah arrived here on Tuesday on a five-day visit during which he will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on the crucial peace initiative in the war-ravaged country.The visit of the influential Afghan leader to India comes in the midst of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha.Afghan officials said the visit is part of the efforts to build a regional consensus and support for the Afghan peace process.The Taliban and the Afghan government are holding direct talks for the first time to end 19 years of war that has killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged various parts of the country.Before leaving for India, Abdullah said India’s role in establishing lasting peace in Afghanistan is vital. He also mentioned about India’s continuous support to the government and people of Afghanistan.Last month, another influential Afghan leader Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum had visited India.India has been a major stakeholder in peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.On September 12, an Indian delegation attended the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha while Jaishankar joined it through video conference.India has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war in the country.The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001.India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate. India has been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future.

These are just a few examples,” he added.Jaishankar on the other hand did not mention China and focused on the need for “like-minded countries to coordinate responses to various challenges” and advance the security and the economic interests of countries with legitimate and vital interests in the region.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne like Jaishankar did not mention China nor was her tone rushed like that of Pompeo as she spoke of the Quad promoting a positive agenda. She described the Quad as a diplomatic network whose fundamental task was to work for an open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific. The host, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu, too, spoke of a rules based order in the maritime domain and the need to take on board countries like France and Germany besides some Southeast Asian nations that share the same values. Tokyo under a new Prime Minister is reported to be working out the dates for a visit by Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi later this month.Motegi’s formulation closely paralleled that of Jaishankar as he spoke of upholding the rules-based international order and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes. This was far removed from Pompeo calling on Quad to be “forceful in response, to be direct about expectations”.Jaishankar and Payne also dwelt on their respective expectations from the Quad which seemed to coincide: connectivity, infrastructure development, cyber and maritime security, health cooperation, and stability in the region. These are topics Pompeo did not touch upon though he has spoken on the economic aspects at other fora.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-quad-foreign-ministers-differ-on-way-to-tackle-china-151917
06-10-2020||New Delhi||Reluctance of police to arrest and produce lawmakers serious matter: SC||The Supreme Court Tuesday voiced concern over reluctance of police to arrest and produce lawmakers against whom criminal cases are pending and termed it as a “serious” matter.The top court said a number of cases are pending against Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies (MPs and MLAs) as police officers often do not enforce laws due to pressure from the legislators.“We have been told that sometimes the police is not enforcing the laws, in light of pressure of legislators accused. We understand this is a serious matter,” observed a bench headed by Justice N V Ramana, which also noted that various High Courts have been asking for video conferencing facilities for disposal of pending cases.The bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, also sought fresh details of cases against lawmakers and the high courts have to provide the details with regard to number of video conferencing facilities in states for speedy disposal of cases.Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who has been appointed as amicus curiae, said despite monitoring of cases, the number of cases pending against legislators is increasing and monitoring at micro level, by the High Courts is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal.Advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, who is the original petitioner, urged the bench to issue notice on the issue of “life time ban” on the legislators accused of serious crimes.However, the apex court said it is currently dealing with the issues at hand.The apex court was earlier told that criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers have increased over the last two years therefore strict monitoring, at micro level, by the High Courts is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases against legislators.The top court was apprised that the total number of cases against sitting and former lawmakers as per the latest reports are 4,859 while the total number of cases as per earlier reports filed in March 2020 were 4,442.“The number of cases pending against MPs/ MLAs (sitting and former) have increased over the last two years despite monitoring for expeditious disposal in the present proceedings.“It is, therefore, submitted that strict monitoring, at a micro-level, by the High Courts is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases against legislators,” the report filed by senior Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita, had said.The report was submitted in a petition which was filed in 2016 and raised the issue of inordinate delay in disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting lawmakers.Commenting on the action plan submitted by high courts to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases, the report stated that some of the High Courts favoured constitution of Special Courts in each District, both at Sessions and Magisterial level. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reluctance-of-police-to-arrest-and-produce-lawmakers-serious-matter-sc-151913

September 30 to October 6 week has seen 77,113 average new cases on a weekly basis.Asked if India had hit the COVID peak, Bhushan said predicting a peak was not the right thing to do from a public health perspective as it could lead to complacency in people which would then trigger a surge.“We see declining trends in new cases. What we also need to remember is that Kerala has seen the highest surge in daily new cases starting September 8 week when it saw 22,133 cases which rose to 84,958 cases as of the latest week. This surge in Kerala is linked to Onam,” Bhushan said as the festive season approaches along with winters providing fertile ground for respiratory viruses to flourish unless people religiously practise COVID appropriate behaviour.India today saw the sharpest month long decline in daily new COVID cases with 61,267 infections over 24 hours as against an average of 90,000 plus seen through September first week. Total COVID 19 load reached 66,85,082 with recoveries surpassing 54 lakh, the highest in the world.India’s active cases are 9,19,023 as of today and have remained below 10 lakh for two weeks starting September 23 in positive signs for disease management. India’s average daily positivity on a weekly basis has also dropped from 8.28 pc starting September 2 to 6.82 pc now.More than half of all active cases are in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/48-pc-covid-deaths-in-25-districts-ludhiana-among-these-151905

There are no qualifications. No expertise is required. A layman can become a journalist. There is no control like how the MCI exercises control for doctors. Journalism is not a profession, it is an activity,” Raju submitted.The Supreme Court on June 14 refused to stay the probe into a sedition case lodged against Dua by Himachal Pradesh Police but protected him from arrest in the case.It had asked Dua to join the probe and cooperate with the police in the process through video conferencing or online mode. Police can interrogate Dua at his residence in Delhi after giving him a 24-hour prior notice, it added.The Shimla FIR was registered at the instance of Himachal Pradesh BJP leader Ajay Shyam who filed a criminal complaint against Dua accusing him of instigating violence against the government by allegedly spreading fake news.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sedition-case-against-vinod-dua-sc-reserves-order-on-quashing-of-fir-151902

06-10-2020||New Delhi/Mumbai||Theatres get ready to abide by government SOPs but no new movies – at least for now||The government has given its green signal for cinemas to reopen in a new COVID-19 normal defined by rigorous dos and don'ts and theatre owners are getting ready too, but it may be a while before audiences get to see a new movie.On Tuesday, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar announced the standard operating procedures (SOPs) that cinema halls must put in place before they open on October 15 after seven months of being closed.The SOPs include one seat distance in theatres, 50 per cent capacity, masks at all time, proper ventilation and air conditioner temperature settings at above 23 degrees Celsius.“Cinema halls have been shut for the last seven months. They are now opening from October 15. For the safety of people, we have come out with SOPs to be followed,” Javadekar told reporters.It was good news for multiplex and theatre owners who have long maintained that it was time for the curtains to go up and also for movie aficionados missing their big screen experience.  But the wariness persisted. Was it safe? How many people would actually brave the threat of COVID-19? What about the cost factor involved in getting theatres ready for the corona era?Given the extreme caution, there is unlikely to be any fresh content in the next few months, industry insiders indicated. No one wants to take a chance.Sibashish Sarkar, Reliance Entertainment Group CEO, said reopening of cinemas was a positive sign for the industry but screening new releases would be difficult.  "We are not releasing any film on Diwali (on November 14)... It is not possible to release a film on Diwali. As of now, all cinema houses are not opening from October 15. Even if it opens on November 1, how can you release a film in a 10 or 15-day notice period?” he asked.Films such as Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif starrer “Sooryavanshi” and Ranveer Singh's “83” that are complete and ready for release won't be seen on the big screen anytime soon.While many films moved to the OTT platforms during the lockdown that started in March, the much awaited “Sooryavanshi” and “83” did not.“Sooryavanshi”, which was scheduled to release on March 24, just a day before the lockdown came into effect, was supposed to hit the screens on Diwali."We are not sure whether we will change both 'Sooryavanshi' or '83' or we will just shift one film... It is clear... from December to March is the realistic timeline,” Sarkar told PTI.In fact, some cinemas will screen old content even when they open.Raj Bansal, a multiplex owner from Jaipur, said the distribution and exhibition sector had been waiting since August for theatres to open but his own theatre would stick to old fare."We have 15 days to plan things. We have software for a few 'Dhoom' series, 'Golmaal', 'Munnabhai...', 'Hera Pheri' and some small films that are ready to be released in theatres," Bansal told PTI.He said the cost of operating cinemas would go up by at least 10 per cent as the premises will need to be sanitised regularly.Cinepolis India CEO Devang Sampat is clear that cinema halls can't get back to regular business unless there is fresh content.He said they have implemented stringent safety protocols in line with global best practices and were ready to welcome patrons back to a safe and secure, world class movie experience.“We request the state governments to provide clearance for cinemas to open in their respective states,” he added.T-Series president Vinod Bhanushali added that it is exciting to have cinemas make a comeback after months of uncertainty.In Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, theatres might open by November or pre-Diwali and the company is getting films ready for a theatrical release. The company has films such as “Indoo Ki Jawani” and the yet untitled biopic on badminton ace Saina Nehwal.      “We will be happy if our films that are to be released on OTT will come in theatres. However this decision is between OTT and exhibitors and distributors,” Bhanushali told PTI."We believe stars or superstars are made or born in theatres. The fun of watching films is on the large screen," Bhanushali added.Producer Boney Kapoor said it would take a couple of weeks for the audience to get used to coming to theatres."Footfall will increase gradually. Hopefully by Diwali, we should have a better understanding or how good the situation is. We will think of the release once we complete the shoot of our films. We are praying footfall in theatres show positive signs," Kapoor told PTI.Film exhibitor Akshay Rathi, who has cinema houses in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, said the audience would want a safe and secure environment and all SOPs would be implemented.“We will ensure the best of movies are released in theatres for audiences to come in big numbers. For this producers, exhibitors and distributors will have to work together to rebuild the movie-going habit," said Rathi.  Theatres across the country had to shut their doors in March due to the coronavirus-led lockdown. As the government started easing other businesses, theatre chains said they should be allowed to resume services as they were already facing losses to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore.“We are committed to ensure a safe, secure and a hygienic cinema going experience for the movie lovers of our country. As always, we would continue to assign topmost priority to the health and wellbeing of our guests and employees,” said PVR Cinemas CEO Gautam Dutta.“We look forward to welcoming back moviegoers to a safe and an amazing brand new experience at our cinemas,” he added.INOX Leisure CEO Alok Tandon is also hopeful of a turnaround in the industry.“We are completely geared up and prepared for the new normal, which would assign topmost priority to safety and hygiene,” said Tandon.Betting on the unique cinema culture of the country, Tandon said the announcement would help content producers chart a plan for their release.                    “India's unique cinema culture is something which makes us feel proud and optimistic at the same time. There is a huge amount of emotional, cultural and creative hunger prevailing in the country, which can now be satisfied with cinemas to a large extent. We know that the masses are yearning to step out and enjoy their favourite form of entertainment.”In the unlock guidelines issued on September 30, the Ministry of Home Affairs had  allowed the reopening of cinema halls from October 15.

A more realistic target is ensure that Pakistan remains under the lens by being kept under the grey list.A beneficiary of successive grace periods, Pakistan at its last assessment had missed 13 of the 27 action points suggested by the FATF. Islamabad has claimed that it has fulfilled the remaining action points and submitted reports to this effect both to FATF and its regional chapter.India has been straining to get Pakistan slotted in the “black list” of “high risk jurisdictions” which not only imputes global blackballing of a nation but grave difficulties for the country concerned to access funding from international banks.India has said despite the paperwork done at FATF by Pakistan, the fact remains that it provides active support and sanctuary to internationally listed terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT). It has also pointed out that Pakistan issued notifications listing nearly 100 terrorists and entities who had been indicted by the UNSC but the reality was that it was also sheltering many of them.Pakistan’s all-weather friend China is expected to provide Islamabad support even though it no longer holds the chair of FATF. The US, which has weighed against Pakistan at several FAT plenary meetings, may not push the envelope because of the delicate stage of the Afghanistan peace talks. Pakistan needs to get the nod of at least one-third of FATF members to extricate itself from the grey list.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fatf-meet-to-decide-pakistans-financial-fate-151877

We will form the next government in all the five states, including West Bengal,” he said.  Regarding Chirag Paswan-led LJP using the photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on its election posters, Gautam said PM Modi was a national leader and anyone can use his photograph.“If Congress also wants to use his photograph why should we have any objection,” he said. “The LJP must be having their own reason (for supporting the Prime Minister),” he added.     Regarding the Hathras incident, Gautam said the sad and unfortunate incident should be condemned by all but there should also be “no pick and choose” on such incidents.  “Crimes against dalits, women, poor should be condemned in whichever state, under whichever government, they happen. Whether they are in UP, Rajasthan, Kerala or MP, which is a state ruled by the BJP, they should be condemned but it hurts when there is pick and choose on such incidents, their (opposition parties) love of dalits becomes dangerous for society and the country,” said Gautam.Meanwhile, the newly constituted Team Nadda thanked PM Modi for steering the country out of the difficult corona period and turning the big challenge into an opportunity for the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-to-launch-kisan-jagran-abhiyaan-to-counter-dushprachar-on-farm-laws-151874

Manjunath, Sandeep Goyal, Ajay Garg, Rahul Yadav, Sameer Sandhir, Sushil Daga, C.V. Venugopal, M.V. Murali Krishna and Venketeshwara Rail Nirman Pvt Ltd under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The chargesheet was filed in a Special PMLA court in Chandigarh, a release said on Tuesday. The ED has also demanded punishment for those named in the chargesheet and confiscation of their assets.The ED case is based on the FIR and chargesheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Kumar, Singla, Goyal and seven other accused persons.The CBI had arrested Bansal’s nephew Singla red handed while accepting a bribe of Rs 89.68 lakh for favourable posting of Kumar, a 1975 batch officer of the Indian Railway Service of Signal Engineers (IRSSE) as Member (Electrical), Railway Board.“During the investigation it was revealed that Manjunath on behalf of Kumar had persuaded various Railway vendors/S&T manufactures/contractors for making arrangement of bribe amount for promotion of Kumar as Member (Electrical) by alluring them that all the contributors will be taken care of/benefited from the desired posting of Kumar,” the official said.It was also found that for the favourable posting of Kumar, the first instalment of the bribe amount of Rs 89.68 lakh was contributed by Manjunath, Krishna, Daga and Venketeshwara Rail Nirman Pvt. Ltd.The officer said Rs 50 lakh was contributed by Manjunath himself, Rs 25 lakh by Krishna, Rs 5 lakh by Daga and Rs 10 lakh from the account of Venketeshwara Rail Nirman Pvt. Ltd. by Rahul Yadav and Daga.“The said amount was routed through the account of various companies or individuals and with assistance of hawala agents,” the officer said, adding: “The amount Rs 89.68 lakh was finally made available at Delhi in the form of cash which was delivered to Singla at his office in Sector 28, Chandigarh by the employees of Daga and Yadav of Delhi.” The ED in July this year questioned Bansal for several hours in Chandigarh in connection with the case.In May last year, the ED had attached the Rs 89 lakh amount which the CBI seized from the office of Bansal’s nephew Singla in 2013 in the corruption case related to appointments at top positions in the railways, when the Congress leader was the Union Railway Minister in the United Progressive Alliance-2 regime.Bansal had to step down from the post after the controversy.“Singla demanded Rs 10 crore through Sandeep Goyal from N Manjunath to get Mahesh Kumar posted as Member (Electrical),” the ED had said, quoting the CBI probe. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-files-chargesheet-against-pawan-bansals-nephew-others-in-railway-bribery-case-151871

06-10-2020||New Delhi||Criminal cases against lawmakers: SC concerned over ‘pressure’ on police||As 4,859 cases remain pending against sitting and former lawmakers across India, the Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed serious concern over political pressure on police in such cases.“We have also been told that police sometimes do not enforce the laws because of pressure from legislators. This is a serious matter,” a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said.The Bench was hearing a PIL filed by Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini K Upadhyay in 2016 seeking directions for disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting legislators.Upadhyay requested the top court to issue notice to the Centre on his prayer for lifetime ban on convicted politicians. The Bench, however, chose to ignore it at this juncture, saying it was dealing with issues at hand.The Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the Centre had not fully furnished the information sought by it last time and that all courts were asking for technical assistance for video conferencing facilities.“We will also interact with the states. Funding may not be Your Lordships’ botheration,” Mehta assured the Bench which adjourned the matter for ten days.It also asked the high courts to send their recommendations and action plan so it can be sent to the ministries concerned.Senior advocate and Amicus Curiae Vijay Hansaria apprised the top court of the reports sent by various high courts and pointed out state-specific issues where improvements were needed.Highlighting the rise in the number of criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers in the last two years, a report filed in the Supreme Court on Monday suggested micro level strict monitoring by high courts for speedy disposal of cases against them.“The total number of cases as per the latest reports is 4,859; whereas, the total number of cases as per report filed in March 2020 was 4,442. Similar reports filed by high courts in December 2018 disclosed total number of cases as 4,122,” the report filed by Hansaria stated.“Thus the number of cases pending against MPs/MLAs (sitting and former) has increased over the past two years despite monitoring for expeditious disposal in the present proceedings,” the report submitted.According to the report, 33 such cases were pending in Punjab, 42 in Haryana, 44 in Himachal Pradesh, 7 in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh and one in Chandigarh. The trial of eight cases in Haryana and 10 cases in Punjab has been stayed by the high court, it added.There were 25 cases pending at sessions level and 62 at magistrate level in Delhi which included matters under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the like, it said.The report urged the top court to direct the Centre to file a status report with regard to cases investigated/initiated by CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other central agencies in terms of the court’s September 16 order.It suggested if any legislator didn’t appear before the court despite receipt of summons/warrant, he/she should be liable for contempt of the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/criminal-cases-against-lawmakers-sc-concerned-over-pressure-on-police-151869

06-10-2020||New Delhi||BJP, JD-U unveil Bihar pact; NDA gets a new ally||After days of suspense, the NDA on Tuesday declared its seat-sharing formula for the upcoming Bihar elections among partners-JD-U, BJP, HAM(S) and new entrant VIP.Making the announcement in Patna, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said JD-U will contest 122 seats and BJP 121 seats in 243-member Bihar Assembly. While JD-U will leave seven seats from its quota for Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM (S) the BJP will allot some (expectedly nine) to Mukesh Sahani-led Vikassheel Insaan Party which dramatically walked out of the RJD-led ‘Mahagathbandhan’ a couple of days back.Nitish Kumar said there is no confusion among NDA partners over seat allocation and that it has also been decided who will contest from where.Regarding Chirag Paswan led-Lok Janshakti Party, which parted ways with NDA in Bihar berating JD-U and backing BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar said, “I do not give importance to who says what…people have got freedom to speak.”“Ram Vilas Paswan (Chirag’s father and union minister) is unwell, we want him to recover. He is in hospital but may I ask could he go to the Rajya Sabha without support of JD-U,” he questioned.Meanwhile, putting to rest all speculations BJP said its alliance with JD-U is “unbreakable”. In an apparent message to Chirag, Deputy CM Sushil Modi added that state chief Sanjay Jaiswal has made it clear that “those who will not accept Nitish Kumar’s leadership will not be a part of NDA in Bihar”. “Nitish Kumar is the face of NDA in Bihar poll and he will be the CM face as well. Whoever (BJP and JD-U) gets what number (of seats) Nitish Kumar will be the CM...there are no ifs and buts over it,” he added. Sushil Modi was also quoted as saying that Chirag may not have taken such a step if his father was well. Paswan, who recently had a heart surgery, is currently recuperating in the hospital. Regarding the LJP using the photograph of the Prime Minister on its election posters, leaders said if need be they will write to the Election Commission that no other party, except BJP, JD-U, HAM(S) and VIP, should be allowed to use his pictures during campaign.In Delhi, BJP General Secretary Dushyant Gautam said PM Modi is a national leader and anyone can use his photograph. “If Congress also wants to use his photograph why should we have any objection,” he said, making light of LJP’s move. BJP’s first listThe BJP also released its first list of 27 candidates. The names include international shooter Shreyasi Singh from Jamui constituency and former MP Hari Manjhi from Bodhgaya.The BJP has fielded shooter Shreyasi Singh from Jamui.Singh, a gold medallist at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and a silver medallist at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, joined the BJP last week.All the candidates are for the election’s first phase in which 71 seats of the 243-member assembly will go to polls.The party released the list after the ruling NDA announced its seat-sharing formula for the Bihar assembly polls under which JD(U) will contest on 122 seats and BJP 121.

06-10-2020||Dimapur||NSCN(IM) wants Naga peace talks to shift to 3rd country||The NSCN (IM) has demanded direct involvement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the talks to resolve the festering insurgency in the northeastern state and insisted that the negotiations be held in a “third country”.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi written on February 25, but kept secret so far, Thuingaleng Muivah, the general secretary of the group and chief Naga negotiator in the talks with the government, also spoke about the framework agreement (FA) signed in 2015 and its proposal that the state should be allowed to have a Constitution and national flag.In the letter released to the media on Monday, the outfit said it was making public the letter for “lack of response” from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).Muivah, who is the Ato Kilonser (prime minister) of the self-styled Naga government, referred to the circumstances in which he and the then chairman of the outfit Isak Chishi Swu first arrived in India in 2002 and “patiently” stayed here since 2010 to conclude an “acceptable and honourable political settlement.He said the NSCN(IM) started political negotiation with the government only after it recognised the Naga problem as a “political issue” and stopped calling it India’s internal law and order issue.Referring to the framework agreement, Muivah said, ”We mentioned in our proposal that Nagaland shall use its National Flag, Anthem, Emblem and Insignia” and have a Constitution called ‘Yehzabo’.Though Muivah said it was not a “demand”, his letter spoke about how “sovereignty lies with the people” and the “peaceful co-existence” of “two entities” through “sharing of sovereign power”.Talking about the deal in implementing the framework agreement, Muivah said, “In the given circumstances and in order to save the political dialogue, the talks should resume at the highest i.e. prime minister level, without precondition, and outside India in a third country”.    Muivah also wrote about the “obnoxious” conduct of the Ministry of Home Affairs while dealing with the Naga question. “We are totally shocked and surprised that even after more than two decades of political negotiation, the MHA and its agencies have become obnoxious.“It has come as a total shock and surprise that the Gol has started branding and accusing the members of the NSCN who are in political negotiation as terrorist and with impunity they are arresting the members of the organization, he wrote.He dubbed as “serious provocation” the conduct of the home ministry, and said it went against the spirit of political negotiation and the framework agreement.Muivah was also bitter about the role of Nagaland Governor RN Ravi who, before taking up the new assignment, was the Government of India’s chief negotiator for the Naga talks.He alleged that Ravi was interfering with the law and order issues in “deliberate deviation” from his appointment as the Centre’s representative for the peace talks.“The activities of the Representative of the Gol is polarizing the Naga society instead of uniting the Nagas for an honourable political solution,” Muivah wrote.He alleged Ravi was meeting only a “certain section” of the Naga society that is not committed to a “genuine political solution and who do not represent the genuine aspiration of the Naga people”.Despite Muivah’s fulmination, several rounds of talks to restore peace in Nagaland have been held in New Delhi. The Indian side was largely represented by officers of the Intelligence Bureau (IB).“We have come to India on the invitation of the Gol and we are in Nagaland to meet our own Naga people vis-a-vis the peace process. If the MHA is trying to stop us from meeting our own people, then their negative intent against the peace process has become very clear,” he said.Muivah also wrote that the Indian government should allow him to leave the country if our stay in India is no more welcome. All necessary arrangements must be made for us to leave India and the political talks be resumed in a third country.The NSCN(IM) leader said the letter was released belatedly as he expected the PMO to respond “positively”.

06-10-2020||Chennai||ISRO plans to launch new rocket before Dec 2020||The Indian space agency is working towards launching its new rocket ‘Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)’ before December 2020, said a senior official. He also said necessary tests to check its biggest motor — booster motor fired by solid fuel — will be done in November.“The SSLV launch will be from the first launch pad at Sriharikota rocket port after the flight of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle C49 (PSLV C49). Post PSLV C49’s flight, the launchpad set up has to be reconfigured to suit SSLV,” S Somanath, Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), and part of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), told IANS.“Sometime next month, PSLV C49 will fly with about 10 satellites. The rocket will be carrying India’s RISAT-2BR2 and other commercial satellites. It will be followed by PSLV C50 with the GSAT-12R satellite in December. The rocket is being assembled at Sriharikota with various systems coming from different centres. It will fly from the second launch pad,” Somanath said.“From the drawing board to launchpad the time taken is only about two-and-half years. The SSLV is a three-stage engine rocket all powered by solid fuel,” Somanath added.The 34-metre rocket will have a lift-off mass of 120 tons. The rocket has the capability for multiple satellite launches at different orbits. The SSLV can carry a 500 kg payload for low earth orbit (LEO) and 300 kg for sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).According to Somanath, the development cost of the rocket is about Rs 120 crore.“The major development for SSLV is its brand new electronic systems with local components. All the qualifications of the systems have been done. The rocket also has a simple pyrotechnic system,” Somanath said.The new miniaturised telemetry system developed for SSLV has achieved 70 per cent mass reduction in the telemetry package.According to Somanath, in order to develop the rocket at a lower cost, ISRO with a simplified manufacturing process — for instance, cutting down the machining time wherever possible — went to the next level of vendors with the necessary capabilities.Somanath said the developmental cost of SSLV was low and only the third stage of the PSLV rocket had been adopted for the new rocket. The per kg cost of launching a satellite will be similar to that of ISRO’s other rocket PSLV.He said the first payload for SSLV had already been booked and some more payloads are being looked at as the rocket has a capacity to carry up to 500 kg.According to ISRO, the first satellite to be carried by SSLV will be 142 kg Mircrosat-2A to demonstrate launch on demand capability. The satellite is expected to meet the ever-increasing user demands for cartographic applications at cadastral level, urban and rural management, coastal land use and regulation, utility mapping, development and various other geographic information system (GIS) applications.Queried about a different name for the rocket as new private players have named their rockets as ‘Vikram’ and ‘Agnibaan’, Somanath said it is for the government to decide on that.

The government said a massive build-up of political and Dalit leaders after the girl’s death on September 29 led the Hathras administration to convince the victim’s family to cremate her at night with all religious rituals.The Congress demanded immediate dismissal of the Yogi government and said the state’s affidavit was nothing but “lies.”The family of the 19-year-old woman, who died after the September 14, has been alleging that the cops cremated her in the wee hours of September 30 by stealth, without their consent.The Congress slammed the affidavit for saying no rape had taken place and recalled the girl’s last statement to cops where she said she was gang-raped by four men.“Yogi government has been indulging in a cover-up since day one and has no right to continue in office. It should be dismissed immediately,” said Dev, who was accompanied by Congress leader Supriya Shrinate.The affidavit of UP government mentions a build-up of politicians and activists outside Safdarjung Hospital starting the announcement of the girl’s demise on the morning of September 29.The affidavit says the crowds “influenced” the girl’s family not to receive the body until their demands were met—among demands being “Rs one crore compensation, a house, a job for the kin and hanging of the four accused.”The affidavit goes on to say that cops transported the body from Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital to Hathras with difficulty due to mobilisation of gathering around the ambulance.“With much difficulty, they reached the victim’s village in Hathras at 12.45 am. Around 200 to 250 people were already present when the victim’s body reached and the policemen were controlling the crowd. They blocked the ambulance, gheraoed the family and started sloganeering to stop them from cremating the body. The body was kept till 2.30 am with the family.”The affidavit adds that after intelligence received by Hathras administration regarding the presence of massive crowds in the village the next morning the administration decided to convince the family to “cremate the body with full religious rituals at night, to avoid large scale violence in the morning as the body had been lying for almost 20 hours since her death and post mortem.”The state has said to the court that there was no objective, other than maintenance of laws and order behind cremating the body at night.“Once the post mortem had been done by Safdarjung Hospital Delhi there could have been no bad intention on anyone’s part to expedite the cremation except to obviate a potential violent situation resulting from planned caste divide by certain vested interests,” says the affidavit which the Congress today rejected as false.The affidavit also says the victim’s first statement on the day of the attack on September 14 said she was attacked by one accused who tried to strangulate her.The victim gave a second statement on September 19 alleging molestation by the same accused.She gave a third statement on September 22 accusing four boys of gang-raping her.The state affidavit says the Aligarh hospital where the victim was admitted first as well as FSL Agra did not conclude rape in their findings.The opposition Congress accused the state of falsehood in the matter and asked them to prove the girl they cremated on September 30 was indeed the Hathras victim.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-lies-says-congress-as-up-govt-tells-sc-hathras-victim-cremated-with-full-rituals-151851
06-10-2020||Satya Prakash||Stubble burning: Can a portion of MSP be withheld?||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 6The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine a suggestion that a portion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be withheld from farmers and released later only after a verification that they didn’t burn stubble.However, a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde sought to know, “Who is going to supervise and verify if a farmer has indulged in stubble burning?”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “Tinkering with the MSP may not be in the interest of farmers.”The Bench posted the matter for further hearing to October 16 after Mehta said the Centre would file a reply on the issue.”The court was dealing with a fresh application filed by Vikrant Tongad – a farmer and an environment conservationist—who demanded that “an alternative incentive mechanism be formulated for tweaking the amount of Rs 100 per quintal and its payment be deferred from within the MSP until it is verified that no stubble has been burnt…”He submitted that “robust monitoring be done of stubble burning incidents via satellite-based geospatial technologies; and a proper verification system be established by the concerned authorities to identify those farmers who have or have or have not burnt stubble on their fields through a network of Krishi Mitras”.Advocate Charanpal Singh Bagri, representing farmers, objected to the suggestion of withholding MSP for stubble burning. He pointed out that on November 5, 2019, the top court had ordered that compensation should be granted to those small and marginal farmers who refrain from burning farm residue.During the hearing, CJI Bobde asked, “Will the smoke from stubble burning kill coronavirus?“Corona pandemic will get aggravated because of pollution from stubble burning,” senior advocate Vikas Singh responded.The top court is seized of a PIL on air pollution in NCR. It has been asking states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the Centre to take measures to ensure farmers don’t indulge in stubble burning that converts the entire Delhi-NCR into a virtual gas chamber during October-November.Amicus Curiae Aparajita Singh told the Bench that states have failed to act despite having given assurances to the court to take steps to control stubble burning.Senior advocate Shyam Divan suggested replication of measures adopted to control forest fires to check stubble burning.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.State governments were now providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw. They’re also running awareness campaigns against stubble burning.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, stubble burning was an important factor behind air pollution in Delhi-NCR last year, contributing up to 44 per cent of the air pollution in November.Punjab Government had earlier told the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) that it has been utilising crop residue through biomass-based power plants and various bio-CNG projects are under process. It has proposed to set up a 25-megawatt solar-biomass project.Both Punjab and Haryana have set up thousands of custom hiring centres (CHCs) to give farm machinery on rental basis to farmers who cannot afford to buy high-end equipment for crop residue management.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-can-a-portion-of-msp-be-withheld-151850

At such a time, a conspiracy was hatched to defame Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharajs Maharashtra,” Deshmukh told reporters here.“...some parties tried to defame Maharashtra, Mumbai Police. They should apologise to Maharashtra or else, the people of Maharashtra will not forgive them,” the minister said without naming any party.He also asked Devendra Fadnavis, who is the BJP’s in- charge for the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls, whether he will campaign for former Bihar police chief and JD(U) leader Gupteshwar Pandey, who had “defamed” Maharashtra and Mumbai Police in connection with the case.

06-10-2020||Satya Prakash||Delhi HC initiates PIL to monitor pending criminal cases against MPs, MLAs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 6As 4,859 cases remain pending against sitting and former lawmakers across India, the Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed serious concern over political pressure on police in such cases.“We have also been told that the police sometimes do not enforce the laws because of pressure from legislators. This is a serious matter,” a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said.The Bench was hearing a PIL filed by Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini K Upadhyay in 2016 seeking directions for disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting legislators. Upadhyay requested the top court to issue a notice to the Centre on his prayer for a lifetime ban on convicted politicians.The Bench, however, chose to ignore it at this juncture, saying it was dealing with issues at hand. The Bench told Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta that the Centre had not fully furnished the information sought by it last time and that all courts were asking for technical assistance for video conferencing facilities.“We will also interact with the states. Funding may not be Your Lordships’ botheration,” Mehta assured the Bench which adjourned the matter for ten days. It also asked the high courts to send their recommendations and action plan so it can be sent to the ministries concerned.Senior advocate and Amicus Curiae Vijay Hansaria apprised the top court of the reports sent by various high courts and pointed out state-specific issues where improvements were needed.Highlighting the rise in the number of criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers in the past two years, a report filed in the Supreme Court on Monday suggested micro-level strict monitoring by high courts for speedy disposal of cases against them.“The total number of cases as per the latest reports is 4,859 whereas the total number of cases as per the report filed in March 2020 was 4,442. Similar reports filed by high courts in December 2018 disclosed the total number of cases as 4122,” the report filed by Hansaria stated.“Thus, the number of cases pending against MPs and MLAs (sitting and former) have increased over the past two years despite monitoring for expeditious disposal in the present proceedings,” the report submitted.According to the report, 33 such cases were pending in Punjab, 42 in Haryana, 44 in Himachal Pradesh, seven in Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, and one in Chandigarh. The trial of eight cases in Haryana and 10 cases in Punjab had been stayed by the high court, it added.There were 25 cases pending at sessions level and 62 at magistrate level in Delhi which included matters under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the like, it said.The report urged the top court to direct the Centre to file a status report with regard to cases investigated or initiated by the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate and other central agencies in terms of the court’s September 16 order.It suggested if any legislator didn’t appear before the court despite receipt of summons or warrant, he or she should be liable for contempt of the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-initiates-pil-to-monitor-pending-criminal-cases-against-mps-mlas-151839

Some day the youth will realise who the PM is waiving at inside the Atal to tunnel, while the youth who is watching the PM has no food on the table,” said Gandhi.He went on to allege that the BJP had captured the “soul of India.““Even in the weakest country the media would have made a noise about one country taking away land. Media is captured here. In UP, Administration is attacking the family. All this is the result of a complete and forcible capture of the soul of the country. That’s what we are fighting. This fight will become more and more aggressive,” Gandhi said, attributing the opposition frailties to alleged capitulation of India’s independent institutions.Gandhi, who has in the past also spoken of politics being a long battle, has often faced dissection in politics circles for not showing a killer instinct.Gandhi indicated he was ready to persevere for his 'anti-Modi' causes, putting his hope in people and believing that people will some day understand what the PM stands for.Gandhi has been expressing solidarity with farmers against the contentious new farm laws in Punjab and with the family of Hathras assault victim who was cremated by stealth at night by cops the day she died of grievous injuries sustained on September 14.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-banks-on-change-of-hearts-im-patient-some-day-people-will-realise-151838

This is not the principle of equal justice. This justice is not in line with Dr Ambedkar’s Constitution,” the editorial said.The Hathras episode has “exposed masks of many pretentious people”, it said.It also raised questions over the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to recommend a CBI probe into the Hathras case at a time when the victim’s family has sought a judicial enquiry into the matter.Wondering what the CBI will do in the Hathras case, the editorial alleged that the UP government “destroyed evidence” by cremating the victim.“Did the Hathras Police do this without asking the higher ups? All this happened in consensus,” it alleged.It also said those who tried to “defame” Maharashtra in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajputs death case have fallen into a pit themselves due to the Hathras episode.The Marathi publication said the entire Uttar Pradesh ministerial council should visit the Hathras victim’s family.“The situation would not have exacerbated this much had the government not engaged in hiding things.

06-10-2020||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court calls Hathras rape case 'shocking, extraordinary'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 6Amid allegations of pressure on family of Hathras rape case victim from various quarters, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Uttar Pradesh Government to file an affidavit spelling out if a witness protection plan was in place and if the family had hired an advocate.A Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde -- which took up a PIL on the case -- adjourned the matter to next week after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the UP Government, said the affidavit will be filed by Thursday.The top court said it will ensure that the probe into the case was smooth.It also sought to know how the scope of the proceedings before the Allahabad High Court could be widened.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appears on behalf of the UP Government said, "I am not opposing CBI probe. But the unfortunate incident should not be sensationalised. I am only praying that this court should supervise the probe.""There are narratives and narratives that may impede a fair probe. Let this court monitor the probe," said Mehta.The state government has already recommended a CBI probe even as it denied that the 19-year-old Dalit woman was raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14.The woman had died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment and her body was cremated at night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged the police forced them to hurriedly conduct her last rites – an allegation denied by police.In its affidavit filed hours before the crucial hearing, the UP Government said political parties and a section of media were trying to give a communal and casteist colour to the rape incident.The state government urged the top court to monitor the CBI probe into the case in a time-bound manner to ensure a free probe and rejection of false narratives.The state alleged that "vested interests" were attempting to ascribe motive to derail a fair probe and asserted that there were no signs suggesting rape.Provisional medical report of JJ Medical Hospital Aligarh didn't have prima facie findings of rape and FSL Agra too, in its final opinion ruled out rape, UP Government's affidavit stated.As senior advocate Indira Jaising appeared during the hearing, the CJI said, "We are hearing you because the incident is shocking and extraordinary. We are also appreciating your assistance but you may not have the locus. Let us hear the petitioners also.""Technically, even the petitioners may not have the locus. She wants trial to be shifted to Delhi, Jaising responded.When the petitioner's lawyer "We are shocked at the incident," the CJI said, "Everyone is shocked... That's okay but when a court asks you why are you here, you have to give different reasons. We understand your anxiety but it will be in your best interest if you keep quiet for a while.""This is a case of huge import. It is a horrible incident. But there is no need to duplicate the concerns," CJI told an advocate who sought to argue on behalf of a woman's lawyer group.During the hearing, Jaising demanded witness protection and said NALSA should handle this case as soliciting was happening."Ms Jaising is asking for witness protection but many people don't know that the witnesses are already under protection," Mehta said."Why are you pressing on NALSA? CJI is the patron in chief of NALSA. We can appoint lawyers," the CJI told Jaising.It pointed out that the Solicitor General made a statement before the court that he was not treating this as an adversarial litigation. "Why don't you all make your recommendations before him?" the Bench asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-calls-hathras-rape-case-shocking-extraordinary-151815

Col Amit Kumar and Col Annu Dogra from Jodhpur to Port Blair and Bathinda respectively, after a petition by Col Amit, averred that the posting orders were arbitrary and in complete violation of the standard operating procedure on the subject. Both are serving with the JAG Department.Expressing its inability to transfer them both to the same station, the Army has contended that the only potential station is New Delhi, but due to overall paucity of Colonels in the JAG's Department, posting both to Delhi will be at the cost of maintaining voids at formation HQs, which is not in organisational interest especially in view of the present operational situation along the borders.Pointing out that they had been granted a spouse coordinated posting at Jodhpur after about three years, the officer had claimed that they had remained separated for long durations in the past due to various factors that prevented spouse coordinated postings. Further, the tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) was a low-key appointment with the relatively little workload.The Army has contended that ANC is an independent and important command which is not under the JAG, therefore demanding the posting of an experienced officer and presently there is an operational situation which includes high security at all levels including ANC which requires strengthening of hands.In its affidavit, the Army has also pointed out that in 12 years of marriage, the officer and his wife were given three spouses coordinated posting, including the home station and extended tenures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-cites-border-situation-officer-shortage-to-deny-same-place-posting-to-its-first-colonel-couple-151812

According to the SEC, they have to conduct both phase-2 and 3 clinical trials and cannot directly hold the phase-3 trial for the vaccine in India,” a source said.The Indian pharma giant has collaborated with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine as well as for its distribution.Upon regulatory approval in India, RDIF shall supply to drug maker Dr Reddy’s 100 million doses of the vaccine, the firm had said last month.According to sources, it would be multi-centre, observer-blind, randomised controlled study.Sources said, meanwhile, the phase -3 trial of Sputnik V is underway in Russia since September 1 on around 40,000 subjects.Sputnik V has been developed by the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology and RDIF.Currently, two indigenously developed vaccine candidates, one by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR and another one by Zydus Cadila Ltd, are in phase 2 of the human clinical trials.The Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate, is also conducting Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the candidate in India.

Bad actors (cybercriminals) leverage consumers’ fascination with pop culture and drive unsuspecting fans to malicious websites that install malware on their devices, potentially putting personal information at risk,” Krishnapur said in a statement.“When consumers compromise on security in favour of convenience and freebies, they put their digital lives at risk. It is vital that fans stay vigilant, avoid suspicious links that promise free content and think twice before clicking,” he added.

Pleased to see the progress of our partnership in so many fields. Will work together for stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific," Jaishankar tweeted.It is learnt that Jaishankar and Pompeo also deliberated on overall ties, including evolving security scenario around India.In November 2017, the four countries gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.The first meeting of foreign ministers of the four countries under the 'Quad' framework had taken place in New York in September 2019.The second ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral coalition on Tuesday is expected to collectively affirm the importance of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.During his two-day visit to Tokyo, Jaishankar will also hold talks with his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi and Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne.India is also expanding bilateral cooperation with Japan, the US and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region.The US has been pushing for a greater role for India in the Indo-Pacific which is seen by many countries as an effort to contain China's growing clout in the region.

06-10-2020||Lucknow||Rectify mistake, focus on ensuring justice to Hathras victim's family: Mayawati tells UP govt||BSP chief Mayawati advised the UP government on Tuesday to seriously concentrate on ensuring justice to the family of the Dalit woman allegedly gang-raped and killed in Hathras or it will become difficult to prevent heinous incidents.She stopped just short of calling the Yogi Adityanath government's claim of some people trying to incite caste conflict in the aftermath of the incident an "electoral trick". However, she added, the government can "still rectify its mistake" and provide justice to the victim's family.On Sunday, Uttar Pradesh police lodged at least 19 FIRs across the state on charges ranging from attempt to trigger caste conflict to sedition in connection with the incident.One of the FIRs lodged at Chandpa police station in Hathras district against “unknown persons” mentioned alleged attempts to foment cast conflict, promoting enmity between groups and tarnish the image of the government and invoked section 124A of the Indian Penal Code -- the serious charge of sedition.The FIRs also deal with content posted on social media."Time will tell whether UP government's charge against the Opposition that it was conspiring to incite caste and communal riots to impact development under the guise of Hathras case is the right or electoral trick. But the public opinion demands that it is better if the government concentrates on bringing justice to the family of the victim," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.The 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped by four "upper caste" men on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment.The victim was cremated near her home on September 30. But her family alleged they were forced by the local police to conduct her last rites in the dead of the night. Local police, however, said the cremation was done "as per the wishes of the family"."There's a lot of anger and outrage across the country over the wrong and inhuman treatment given to Hathras victim's family. The government can still rectify its mistake and be serious about bringing justice to the victim's family, otherwise, it will be difficult to prevent heinous incidents," Mayawati added in another tweet.The state government has recommended a CBI probe and quoting an FSL report, it has denied the woman was raped.In his address to BJP workers on Monday, Chief Minister Adityanath referred to “recent incidents” and said “anarchist elements” were trying to trigger communal and caste violence in the state.

But its charge of formation of “exclusive clique” has been countered by pointing out that China too has invested in trilateral and quad groupings.The US sees the Quad in stark terms. Senior US State Department official David Stilwell, who participated in the preparatory meeting of senior officials on September 25, said the Quad seeks to establish, promote and secure Indo-Pacific principles, “especially as China’s tactics, aggression and coercion increase in the region”.New Japan PM Yoshihide Suga made his pecking order clear by putting Chinese President Xi Jinping seventh on his calling list after taking over from Shinzo Abe. He opted to first speak to leaders of the US, Germany, the UK, South Korea, Australia and India before putting in a call to Xi.A day ahead of the Quad talks, Pompeo described the US-Japan relationship as the “cornerstone of peace, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-foreign-ministers-to-meet-in-tokyo-discuss-beijings-tactics-151727

Eighteen more cases were also filed across the state.Edit: Hathras mess ‘link to CAA stir hinted at’The FIR at the Chandpa police station in Hathras listed 19 sections and also invoked the Information Technology Act of 2000 to crack down on a website called “Justice for Hathras” which, cops alleged, was created to destabilise the state government by provoking riots.The state police said the website was wrapped up overnight after raids by agencies but its “inflammatory material” was still in circulation on social media. The police suggested links “between anti-CAA protests and the Hathras plot”, not ruling out the role of the Popular Front of India in the matter.The development came as the Congress demanded a judicial probe into the tragedy, saying the CBI and the SIT would be of no help because the evidence stood “destroyed”. AICC general secretary (UP) Priyanka Vadra has led the demand for a probe by a sitting SC judge into the death of the 19-year-old Dalit girl from Hathras who was allegedly gang-raped on September 14 and left to die with grievous injuries. She succumbed in a Delhi hospital on September 29 and was cremated by cops allegedly against the family’s consent in the wee hours of September 30.“UP cops have already cremated the body of the victim and destroyed the evidence. What will the CBI and SIT do now? A judicial probe is a must and the DM of Hathras must be immediately removed for intimidating the victim’s family,” Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said today.In Hathras, a miscreant threw ink at the visiting AAP leader Sanjay Singh, calling him a “PFI agent”, while Gautam Buddh Nagar cops booked over 500 Congress workers for unlawful assembly on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border two days ago in violation of the Covid norms.Political party leaders, meanwhile, continued to visit Hathras today to express solidarity with the victim’s family.BSP chief Mayawati slammed the CM’s “arrogant attitude” and criticised the police for “manhandling” opposition leaders.The Allahabad High Court has summoned top state officials in the case on October 12.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-yogi-slaps-sedition-fir-on-unknown-protesters-151667

Ten nations make up 70 per cent of all cases/deaths and three account for half”. The US, India and Brazil account for half of the world’s cases.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who chaired the session, said: “There is a need to initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment and in consultation with the member states, a step-wise process for an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation, including using existing mechanisms, to review experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19.”The panel was formed in the wake of several countries led by the US raising questions on China’s role in reporting the pandemic. The US later pulled out of the WHO, accusing it of a delayed response.As the confirmed cases today reached 3,55,20,361 worldwide with 10,43,080 deaths, the WHO said about 10 per cent of the world’s population may have been infected by now.“Our current best estimates tell us that about 10 per cent of global population may have been infected by the virus. But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world continues to remain at risk. The pandemic will continue to evolve and the future will depend on the choices we make,” said WHO Emergency Response chief Michael Ryan.India’s Covid load today crossed 66 lakh with 55,86,703 recoveries and 84.34 per cent national cure rate. Confirmed cases as of today were 66,23,815, with 74,442 daily infections and higher daily recoveries at 76,737. The toll reached 1,02,685 after 903 deaths in a day.

But the GST Council decided not to levy differential GST on alcoholic and non-alcoholic sanitisers.“Nobody is being denied compensation arising out of the implementation of GST and also compensation arising out of Covid impact. The borrowing has to be done,” she said, while rebutting charges by 10 Opposition-ruled states that the Centre is shortchanging them of their legitimate GST dues.“The question was that 20 states have chosen an option but some have not chosen any. The argument of those who had not chosen any option was that the Centre should borrow. At the end of day, it was felt the GST Council can’t decide on the basis of the opinion of 20 states; we need to talk further,” she said, while explaining the long draw-out meeting and indicating that the Centre wanted consensus instead of a division to prevail.“I was gently reminded that I can’t take anybody for granted. I don’t take anybody for granted. Since there was a suggestion from a senior member (Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi) that some days be given, I have given clear eight days,” Sitharaman added.She also announced that from January 1, GST payers with annual turnover of less than Rs 5 crore need not file GSTR 3B and GSTR 1 every month.
