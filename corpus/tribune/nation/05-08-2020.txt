With the foundation stone of Shri Ram temple, the dream of the devotees of the whole world is coming true. Warm greetings and best wishes to all of you. Jai Shree Ram,” Govil, 62, tweeted.            इतिहास में आज का दिन स्वर्णिम अक्षरों में लिखा जाएगा। श्रीराम मंदिर के शिलान्यास से पूरी दुनिया के रामभक्तों का सपना साकार हो रहा है।आप सभी को हार्दिक बधाई और शुभकामनाऐं।जय श्रीराम🙏Chikhlia, 55, who became a household name after playing Goddess Sita opposite Govil on the show, uploaded a video on Instagram, saying the Ram Mandir ‘bhoomi pujan’ is a “matter of pride for all Indians”.“Home coming and welcoming the lord back after struggle of 500 years... Congratulations to all of us on the occasion of the bhumi pujan of Ram Mandir. ‘jyot se jyot jala te chalo, Ram ka naam japte chalo,” she said.        Actor Anupam Kher also celebrated the occasion as he posted a devotional song, dedicated to Lord Ram on the occasion.                 “Best wishes to you and your family for Ram Janam Bhoomi Pujan. Jai Shree Ram,” he wrote on Instagram. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath were among those who attended the event at the site where a large number of devout Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.     The prime minister arrived in Ayodhya in a helicopter where Adityanath among others received him.Before the function to lay the foundation stone of the “Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir”, the prime minister took part in prayers at the Hanumangarhi temple.From there, he travelled to the “Shree Ram Janmabhoomi” where he performed prayers at the “Bhagwan Shree Ramlala Virajman”.He also planted a Parijat (Indian night jasmine) sapling.

05-08-2020||---||Covid leads to low-key celebrations; Indian missions opt to highlight J-K||New Delhi, August 5The Covid pandemic led to low key but bright and vibrant celebrations of the Ram Temple ‘bhoomi pujan’ in different parts of the world.The Indian missions which play a proactive role in celebrating Yoga Day concerned themselves with more pressing matters of arranging for repatriation flights and highlighting the advantages of the changes brought about in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.Several temples in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, the US and Canada besides heavy concentrations of former indentured labour in the Caribbeans were reported to have held special observations with lights and kirtan. However, in keeping with national regulations, there were no calls for congregations that would have made the celebrations much more vibrant.Earlier in the day, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar tweeted that today was a “momentous day for the nation...A pledge redeemed…A heritage reaffirmed.’’ He ended his social media post with the hashtag of JaiShriRam and a mock up photo of the proposed temple.Only the Indian mission in France, headed by a new envoy in Jawed Ashraf, broke its series of tweets on the “transformation’’ of Ladakh and J&K by inserting a tweet of PM Modi’s live address from Ayodhya. Other missions stayed on the narrow course of promoting the country’s interests, ensuring the well-being of stranded fellow citizens and highlighting the anticipated benefits from the changes made in J & K exactly a year ago.However, at the time of going to the press, some missions were yet to get into their stride due to the time difference with India. Political point scoring at The Times Square in the form of a congregation celebrating the event and another protesting it will also take place later.In view of Covid, Hindutva proponents had opted for vans fitted with billboards going around some metropolitan areas in the US and Australia. In The Times Square, an attempt by secularists to block Hindutva organisations from hiring a billboard fell flat. Though it was one billboard among many that dot the Square and was not the iconic Nasdaq board with a wraparound, the issue had been raised to a prestige battle.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla as well as important missions in the US, Japan, Russia, Qatar, Mauritius, etc., were focused on highlighting J & K against a two-pronged diplomatic attack launched by China and Pakistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-leads-to-low-key-celebrations-indian-missions-opt-to-highlight-j-k-122561

After all, Lord Rama belongs to all and lives in all,” he said.“Many countries of the World are saluting Lord Rama, their citizens believe themselves to be affiliated to Lord Rama. Indonesia is the country that has the maximum number of Muslims in the world. They are having various unique versions of Ramayana i.e. ‘Kakawin Ramayana’, ‘Swarnadeep Ramayana’, ‘Yogeshwar Ramayana’ just like our country. Lord Rama is venerated and adored there even today.“There are ‘Ramker Ramayana’ in Cambodia, ‘Fra Lak Fra Lam Ramayana’ in Lao, ‘Hikayat Seri Ram’ in Malaysia and ‘Ramaken’ in Thailand. In Sri Lanka, the katha of Ramayana is taught and sung in the name of ‘Janaki Harana’ i.e. abduction of Janaki. Nepal is directly connected to Lord Rama through Mata Janaki,” he said.  Speaking about the connection between Lord Rama and different parts of India and religions, he said “thousands of years ago, Rama who was an inspiration to the ancient India as depicted in Valmiki’s Ramayana, Rama who was inspiring India through Tulsi, Kabir and Nanak in the medieval era, the same Rama was present in the Bapu’s bhajans during the fight for freedom in the form of non-violence and satyagraha. “Tulsi’s Rama was with form (sagun) while Nanak and Kabir’s Rama was formless (nirgun).“Lord Buddha was also connected to Lord Rama. At the same time, this city of Ayodhya has also been the centre of Jain religion for centuries. This is the ubiquity of Rama, it reflects the unity in diversity that is of India.“In Tamil, we have Kamb Ramayana while in Telugu we have Raghunath and Ranganath Ramayana.“We have Ruipad-KaterpadiRamayan in Odiya, while there is Kumudendu Ramayana in Kannada. In Kashmir, you will find Ramavatar Charit while Ramacharitam in Malayalam.“In Bangla, we have Krittibas Ramayana while Guru Gobind Singh has himself written Gobind Ramayana.“You will find Rama in different forms, in the different Ramayanas, but Ram is present everywhere, Rama is for all. That is why, Rama is the connecting link in India’s ‘unity in diversity’,” the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/you-will-find-description-of-lord-rama-and-rama-katha-even-in-iran-and-china-says-pm-122550

In light of the above unfortunate incident and circumstances, I had already submitted a written complaint in Malvani Police Station & ACP’s office vide letter dated: 13/07/2020 against derogatory posts and forwards being shared by the listed people in the said letter, leading to defamation of my deceased daughter and my family.”“In addition to the said letter, I would like to bring to your attention, the atrocities of journalists and media people on my family.”“The media people come unannounced at my house hiding their original brand in the name of interviews regarding the death of my daughter. They are providing the media with misleading news which are not only creating hindrance to the actual inquiry being conducted, but it’s also taking a toll on my family.”“We are being harassed by these people by repeatedly questioning our faith in Mumbai Police and their way of inquiries is conducted. We have already given our statement to the police that we do not suspect anyone of foul play.”“News about her involvement with any politician or attending parties with big names of film fraternity, rape, murder are all the stories cooked by these media people just to sell it to channels.

We are completely satisfied with the investigations being conducted by Mumbai Police and have faith in them.”“Through this letter, I would request you to take reasonable action against the concerned journalists, influencers, politicians and media for their insensitive act towards us.”The letter by Disha’s father comes a day after former Maharashtra Chief Minister and presently BJP Rajya Sabha member Narayan Rane alleged that both Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput and his former manager Disha Salian were murdered.Meanwhile, Mumbai Police have started looking for more information on Disha.

I believe that I will get justice. Even though a lot of horrible things are being said about me on the electronic media, I refrain from commenting on the advice of my lawyers as the matter is sub-judice. Satyamev Jayate, the truth shall prevail,” she had said in the message.The Supreme Court, while hearing Chakraborty’s plea for transferring the Bihar Police FIR to the Mumbai Police, on Wednesday said that truth behind the “unfortunate” death of a “gifted and talented artist” (Rajput) should come out even as the Centre apprised it of having accepted the Bihar government’s recommendation for a CBI probe in the matter.Rajput starred in films like ‘Shuddh Desi Romance’, ‘Raabta’, ‘Kedarnath’, ‘Chhichhore’ and ‘Sonchiriya’. His most prominent role was in cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s biopic ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.

05-08-2020||---||SC reserves order on contempt case against advocate Prashant Bhushan||New Delhi, August 5The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its order on a suo motu criminal contempt case initiated against activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan and Twitter Inc for his tweets allegedly scandalising the judiciary.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra reserved its order after hearing at length senior advocate Dushyant Dave, on behalf of Bhushan. He said no institution should be free from public criticism.On Tuesday, it had reserved its order in an 11-year-old contempt case against Bhushan in which the lawyer has expressed regret but refused to apologise.With regard to the suo motu contempt case, the top court Registry refused to accept a petition filed by 16 activists seeking to intervene in it.During the hearing, Dave tried to impress upon the Bench that Bhushan’s tweets critical of CJI SA Bobde and former CJIs didn’t amount to scandalising the Judiciary.“Mr Bhushan’s contribution to development of the PIL jurisprudence is immense. He criticises the court because of love and affection for the institution. He did not impute any motives. Please don’t misunderstand him,” Dave submitted.“Perhaps you (Bench) would have given him Padma Vibbushan for the work in the last 30 years,” he said, requesting the Bench not to proceed with the criminal contempt case.“Do you think we have broad shoulders?” asked Justice Mishra.“You usually have but maybe not in this case,” Dave replied.He said no one, including judges, can claim infallibility. “Hundreds of people tweeted after the photo was clicked of the CJI riding a bike. Is the court going to charge all of them with contempt?” Dave asked.On behalf of Twitter, senior counsel Sajan Poovayya said his client was only an intermediary in this case. “There are 50 crore tweets every day. It’s not possible for us to look at all of them. After the court’s notice we withheld the tweets in question. I (Twitter) should not have been impleaded at all,” Poovayya submitted.Dave also talked about sexual harassment case against the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi in which all the charges against the woman in question were been dropped and she was reinstated. Recently Bhushan had tweeted, “CJI rides a 50 Lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP leader at Raj Bhavan Nagpur, without a mask or helmet, at a time when he keeps the SC in Lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access Justice!”In another tweet, he had on June  27, said, “When  historians  in  future  look  back  at  the last  6  years  to  see  how  democracy  has  been  destroyed  in  India  even without  a  formal  Emergency,  they  will  particularly  mark  the  role  of the  Supreme  Court  in  this  destruction,  &  more  particularly  the  role of the last 4 CJIs.”The top court had on July 22 taken strong exception to both the tweets and initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against Bhushan.Referring to two of Bhushan’s tweets, a Bench had said, “We are, prima facie, of the view that the  aforesaid statements on Twitter have brought the administration  of justice in disrepute and are capable of undermining the dignity  and  authority  of  the Institution  of  Supreme  Court  in  general  and  the  office  of  the  Chief Justice of India in particular, in the eyes of public at large.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-order-on-contempt-case-against-advocate-prashant-bhushan-122540

Therefore, before the Ram Mandir gets constructed everyone should “build an Ayodhya in their hearts”, in other words shun all evils.“Isliye hame apne mann ki Ayodhya banani hai…wo Ayodhya jo jaat-paat, dharma, dosh, vilkaro, dwesh, shatruta se mukt ho (the Ayodhya that is free from all evils)."He further said: “Ram sabke hain, sabme hai Ram (Ram belongs to everyone and he resides in everyone).”Bhagwat said the foundation for the construction of Ram temple had been laid at a time when the whole world was looking up to India to lead it in the fight against coronavirus.“Atma-vishwas (self-confidence) is needed for India to become atma-nirbhar (self-reliant)”, he said, adding that laying of the foundation stone for the Ram temple in Ayodhya is the first step towards achieving that goal. Remembering those who made the sacrifices but couldn’t be in Ayodhya on Wednesday, he said: “Advani ji who led the Rath Yatra must be watching it from his home... If Ashok ji (former chief of the VHP) would have been here, it would have been a source of joy for us. There are also those who could come but couldn't be invited due to prevailing situation.” The ‘bhumi pujan’, he said was the culmination of 30 years of intense work put in by the RSS.He said the then sarsanghchalak Balasaheb Deoras had told pracharaks like him that building the temple would take 20-30 years of sustained efforts.“I remember the then RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras telling us that we will have to struggle for 20-30 years, only then will this resolution be fulfilled. We struggled and at the beginning of the 30th year, we have attained the joy of fulfilling our resolution,” said Bhagwat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhumi-pujan-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-recalls-contribution-of-lk-advani-ashok-singhal-122539

The man was thrashed brutally with hammers and police stood spectator at ‘naka’. The accused have not been arrested so we are scared of any crime of prejudice. We had a meeting and all Muslim traders decided to shut shops,” said Omar, a local meat supplier.“They started instigating us with music and slogans playing on loudspeaker. They even put balloons on our shops at night. We are not against anything but it’s our choice our shops. We approached our leaders and they asked us to avoid any trouble or controversy so asthey planned celebrations and marches we decided to shut shops,” added another trader Bismil Qureshi.“This is a regular feature in the BJP regime and day by day the humiliation and threat to Muslim community is rising even in a metropolis like Gurugram. There is no fear of law and communal crime is not taken seriously. The traders are scared as local Hindu outfits came toharass them and majority of times no action is taken. The recent attempted mob lynching has left us all scared and police should have been more cautious while allowing playing of instigating music or marches in the site where Nuh resident was attacked,” said Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muslim-traders-in-sadar-bazaar-area-shut-shops-as-gurugram-is-painted-saffron-122538

The decision has come a day after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar demanded such a probe.Officials in the government said a copy of the notification has been sent to the CBI asking it to probe the death of the actor, who was found dead in June at his Mumbai residence.“A notification has been issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), paving way for the CBI probe in Rajput’s death case,” a senior official said.A CBI spokesperson said, “We have received the notification and will soon take up the investigation into the case.”Sources said, the agency would most likely register an FIR by later late tonight or early morning tomorrow.Rajput, 34, was allegedly found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14 and since then the Mumbai police have been probing the case keeping in mind various angles.While hearing a case in connection with the actor’s death, the Supreme Court today said the truth behind the death of the “gifted and talented artist” should come out.The Bihar police had registered a case against Bollywood actor Rhea Chakraborty and five others, including three of her family members, under various Sections of the IPC. Besides Chakraborty, the others named in the FIR are three of her relatives — Indrajit Chakraborty, Sandhya Chakraborty and Shobhik Chakraborty— and two others, Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi.The registration of the case led to a turf war between the Mumbai police and the Bihar police over the jurisdiction of investigation. Uddhav Thackeray, the CM of Maharashtra, and the state’s Home Minister, Anil Deshmukh, had both earlier ruled out a CBI probe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-cbi-to-investigate-actor-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-122534
05-08-2020||Islamabad||Imran Khan says Pak will continue to raise Kashmir issue at world stage||Notwithstanding the unsuccessful attempts made by him to raise the Kashmir issue at the world stage, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said his country would continue to raise the matter at all international forums.Addressing the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Legislative Assembly on the first anniversary of India's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019, Khan claimed that many world leaders didn't even know what was going on in Kashmir.Khan said that it was due to his government's efforts that the Kashmir issue was highlighted and now, “the world was taking notice of it”.Significantly, Khan in the past admitted that there has been a "lukewarm response" to the Kashmir issue at the world stage due to what he described as the "commercial interests” of the Western countries in India, which is a big market.Khan said he personally briefed world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, about Kashmir.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing J&K's special status and bifurcating it into two union territories.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.Khan also defended the new political map of Pakistan and said that it was essential to respond to India's decision to include Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as part of India. India on Tuesday slammed Pakistan for unveiling a "so-called new political map" which claimed J&K and parts of Gujarat as its territories, asserting that it is a "political absurdity" and these "ridiculous assertions" have neither legal validity nor international credibility.

05-08-2020||Amaravati (AP)||Police Inspector suspended after video clip on his kicking a Dalit man goes viral||A police inspector in Srikakulam district was on Wednesday placed under suspension after a video clip of his purportedly kicking and abusing a Dalit man went viral.Director General of Police D G Sawang placed the Kasibugga inspector Venugopal under suspension and ordered an inquiry into the incident.This was the third such incident in the last fortnight where some police personnel were found behaving allegedly in a high-handed manner and in all these cases Dalit men were at the receiving end.The first incident happened in Rajamahendravaram, where a Dalit man had his head tonsured and was beaten up allegedly by police and the second at Chirala where a Dalit man died after local police allegedly beat him up.As former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu tweeted the Srikakulam video clip and alleged that the ruling YSR Congressmen were behind the incident, the DGP responded saying "there is no involvement of any political party as alleged."The Srikakulam district Superintendent of Police Amit Bardar visited the Dalit man Marri Jagans house and enquired about the incident.Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) Dharmana Krishna Das, who hails from the district, condemned the inspectors highhanded behavior and said the government was committed to the protection of Dalits.He said the Visakhapatnam Range Deputy Inspector General of Police has been asked to conduct an inquiry and submit a report.It all happened when Jagan went to lodge a complaint against an attack on him by some YSRC men after he questioned them over the house-sites issue.The video footage shows the inspector standing outside the Tekkali town police station when Jagan approaches with his mother.As Jagan is speaking, the inspector is seen kicking and also beating him.A video was later circulated in which Jagan claims there was nothing wrong with the inspector and it was he himself who spoke in a rash tone."The inspector chided me for speaking in such a tone.He was so courteous towards me. He made me sit inside the police station and gave me lunch and cautioned me against getting into any tussle with others," Jagan is purportedly heard saying, even as someone is heard prompting certain words.He said some Dalit organisations, media and political parties were trying to politicise the issue.Jagans mother claimed the inspector treated her like a mother and "he looked like my son."

But there was no further investment because of the barriers created by Article 370, she recalled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arun-jaitley-drafted-bill-to-abrogate-article-370-sangeeta-jaitley-122522

Ghee (clarified butter) lamps will be lighted in the Raj Bhavan in the evening. “Joy and ecstasy amongst millions all over globe- a dream come true.

05-08-2020||New Delhi||Ram Temple will remind and reinforce country’s ethos: Vice President Naidu||Vice President of India M Venkaiah Naidu expressed happiness over the “Boomi Pujan” in Ayodhya on Wednesday and said the Ram Temple will continue to remind and reinforce the country’s ethos which is universal in application “without any discrimination”.“August 5, the day of Bhoomi Pujan for such a monument will go down as a red-letter day in the annals of history of our country,” Naidu said in a Facebook post after reading the Ramayana along with his wife and family on the occasion of Bhumi Pujan.He complimented all those including the parties to the land title suit for enabling a judicial resolution of the long-standing dispute and making the temple a reality.He appreciated Iqbal Ansari, son of late Hashim Ansari—one of the parties to the land title dispute—for urging the people to forget the past and move on in the true spirit of India. His words of wisdom offer useful guidance for all, Naidu said.Naidu appealed to everyone to rededicate themselves to the principles of Ram Rajya, based on the concept of democratic-righteous governance which ensures peace, justice and equality of all.Besides, the ideal dispensation bestows happiness and prosperity for all, as envisaged by the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, he said.The construction of a temple for Lord Rama at his birth place of Ayodhya is more a re-coronation of the highest human values of truth, morality and ideals that the “Maryada Purushottam” epitomized during his life, he added.“As the King of Ayodhya, he led an exemplary life, worthy of emulation by the common men and other nobles,” he said.Rama’s conduct and values constitute the core of the consciousness of India, cutting across all kinds of divisions and barriers and are relevant for the present, Naidu said.He said that the construction of Ram Temple is much more than a religious affair. This temple will stand as a tribute to the best of the timeless human values, he emphasised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-temple-will-remind-and-reinforce-countrys-ethos-vice-president-naidu-122497

He died during treatment, police said.The couple had two children who are now being taken care of by another neighbour till their relatives arrive from their hometown in Bihar, they said.Investigations revealed that the accused had fights in the past with the couple and other neighbours. The accused had a young daughter and was apparently not happy with the victim's dressing sense. The accused had earlier objected to his wearing shorts and sitting in front of their house. This had lead to many fights, the officer said.However, the exact reason behind the quarrel on the night of the incident is still unknown and further investigation is underway to ascertain the exact reason behind the murder, he said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Gaurav Sharma said, "We received a PCR call regarding the murder around 2.40 am. On reaching the spot, the woman and her husband were found dead and the accused—Mohammad Mushtaq—had consumed poison after killing the couple. He later died during the course of treatment."  The knife has been recovered and legal action is being taken, he said.Another police officer said "When our team was inspecting the crime scene, the accused (who had consumed poison before the team reached) went up to the terrace and hid himself. But one of the neighbours alerted us about him, and he was nabbed."After he was caught, the accused confessed to killing the couple.

05-08-2020||New Delhi||HC says can’t interfere with govt decision on banning use of social media by defence officers||If the government has concluded that permitting the use of certain social networking websites, including Facebook and Instagram, by its defence personnel is enabling enemy countries gain an edge, the courts would be loath to interfere with the decision, the Delhi High Court said on Wednesday.It said warfare in today’s world was not confined to “accession of territory” but extends to affecting the economy and “inciting civil unrest” by enemy nations.The high court’s order came while dismissing a senior Army officer’s plea challenging the Indian Army’s recent policy banning armed forces personnel from using 89 social networking platforms.Also read: Delhi HC dismisses senior officer’s plea against Army ban on using social media platformsA bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon, while pronouncing the order, said: “Sorry we are dismissing. Thank you.”The high court, while considering the controversy for the stage of admission only, said other means of communication were still available to the petitioner officer and the ban was with respect to certain social networking websites only.It dismissed the petition of Lieutenant Colonel PK Choudhary seeking a direction to the Director-General of Military Intelligence to withdraw its June 6 policy by which all Indian Army personnel were ordered to delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and 87 other applications.“We may also notice that warfare and inter-country rivalries and animosities today are not confined to the accession of territory and destruction of installations and infrastructure of enemy countries but also extend to influencing and affecting the economies and political stability of enemy country including by inciting civil unrest and disturbance and influencing the political will of the citizens of the enemy country,” the Bench said.“In such a scenario, if the government, after complete assessment, has concluded that permitting the use of certain social networking websites by personnel of its defence forces is enabling the enemy countries to gain an edge, the courts would be loath to interfere. In the circumstances, no case for interference is made out. Dismissed,” the Bench added.The court said on perusal of the policy if it had found it to be suffering from the vice of non-application of mind of being not based on any material on a record or being without proper deliberations, it would have certainly proceeded to answer the legal issue raised in the petition on the ban.“However, once we are satisfied on the aforesaid parameters and find other means of communication to be still available to the petitioner and the ban being with respect to certain social networking websites only and more so, once we have found the petitioner himself to have been posting tweets which according to the ASG are in violation of the policy earlier in force qua use of social media, we do not deem it apposite to at the instance of the petitioner to go into the questions urged. Rather, we do not appreciate the pleadings of the petitioner as a senior officer in the Army, of army personnel being treated as slaves and the government not trusting its army,” the bench said.The court said it was evident from the records produced that the earlier advisories and directives qua conduct and behaviours of army personnel on social networking sites have not been abided by some.“The material produced shows certain army personnel to be unsuspectingly answering all kinds of questions relating to their postings and whereabouts and postings and whereabouts of others merely on being told by a person befriended on social networking sites, of a defence background and which information when collated from a number of sources can easily convey a full picture to an expert espionage eye,” it noted.The bench said even if there was any error in the authorities issuing this policy and direction, without complying with the procedure prescribed in the Army Act, considering that the issue has an element of urgency and concerns the safety and security of the entire country, “we do not deem it necessary to, for the grievance of the petitioner only, render an adjudication on the questions urged and which may require us to refer to the documents and materials shown to us in confidence”.The court said besides stating that Facebook and Twitter are more convenient, no answer was forthcoming as to why the filial and other social needs of Choudhary cannot be fulfilled by other means of communication cited by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, which is still available.The Centre, represented by standing counsel Ajay Digpaul, had earlier told the court that the policy decision was taken as it was found that Facebook was a bug and it was infiltrating as cyber warfare and there were so many instances of personnel being targeted.Choudhary, who is currently posted in Jammu and Kashmir, said that he is an active user of Facebook, uses the platform to connect with his friends and family as most of them are settled abroad, including his elder daughter.The officer had sought a direction to the Ministry of Defence to withdraw the June 6 policy to ensure that the fundamental rights of armed forces personnel are not abrogated amended or modified by arbitrary executive action which is not backed by the mandate of law, offends the provisions of the Army Act and Rules made thereunder and is unconstitutional.The petition had alleged that the policy which bans social media platforms is illegal, arbitrary, disproportionate and violates the fundamental rights of soldiers.

Now the CJI will constitute the Constitution Bench that will hear the matter.There are around 20 petitions challenging the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019, which paved the way for grant of reservation to the EWS candidates of general category. The petitioners have sought quashing of the law on the ground that backwardness for the purpose of reservation cannot be defined by “economic status alone”.The Centre has defended the EWS quota, saying it intended to uplift around 200 million people who were below the poverty line even after over 70 years of independence. Nobody can say such people should not be given a “helping hand” to uplift them, Attorney General KK Venugopal had submitted.“Poor people need the help of the state, not the rich ones,” the top court had observed.The law talks about a maximum of 10 pc of seats/posts in addition to the existing reservations for the SCs, the STs and the OBCs, taking total reservation to 59 per cent, much beyond the 50 per cent ceiling fixed by the Supreme Court in the Indra Shawney case popularly known as the Mandal Case.It also extends reservation to private aided and unaided educational institutions.The PILs — including those filed by Youth for Equality and Tehseen Poonawala — challenged its validity, contending it violated the basic structure of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refers-petitions-against-ews-quota-to-constitution-bench-122473

I pay my respects to all of them,” the Prime Minister said after the ground-breaking ceremony of the temple at the spot where many devout Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.“Despite efforts to eradicate Lord Ram's existence, he lives in our hearts and is the basis of our culture. Social harmony was the core principle of Lord Ram's governance,” the Prime Minister said.राम मंदिर के लिए चले आंदोलन में अर्पण भी था तर्पण भी था, संघर्ष भी था, संकल्प भी था। जिनके त्याग, बलिदान और संघर्ष से आज ये स्वप्न साकार हो रहा है, जिनकी तपस्या राममंदिर में नींव की तरह जुड़ी हुई है, मैं उन सब लोगों को आज नमन करता हूँ, उनका वंदन करता हूं: PM  The construction of the Ram temple, he said, was an instrument to unite the country.The Ram temple construction would lift the economy of the entire region, Modi said.The Prime Minister also unveiled a plaque and released a commemorative postal stamp.He arrived in Ayodhya in a helicopter where Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath among others received him.Before the function to lay the foundation stone of the ‘Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir’, marking the end of the BJP’s ‘mandir’ movement that defined its politics for three decades and took it to the heights of power, the Prime Minister took part in prayers at the Hanumangarhi temple.From there, he travelled to the ‘Shree Ram Janmabhoomi’, where he performed prayers at the ‘Bhagwan Shree Ramlala Virajman’.He also planted a Parijat (Indian night jasmine) sapling.

05-08-2020||Mumbai||Nothing to do with Sushant Singh Rajput case, says Aaditya Thackeray||Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday said he and his family are being targeted for no reason in actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case and stressed he is nowhere related to the matter.The Shiv Sena leader said dirty politics is being played following the death of the Bollywood actor and without naming anyone, added that the allegation being levelled is political stomach-ache stemming from frustration.The tourism minister said he is a grandson of Shiv Sena founder the late Bal Thackeray and will not commit any act that will hurt the image of Maharashtra and his family.In a statement he shared on Twitter, Aaditya Thackeray said the Maharashtra government is making all the efforts to combat COVID-19 and perhaps those who are sulking due to the MVAs popularity have started playing the dirty politics in connection with the death case.Mud-slinging is being indulged in against me and the Thackeray family for no reason in connection with Sushants suicide. This is a kind of political stomach-ache stemming from frustration.It is blot on humanity to seek mileage out of someones death. In fact, I am nowhere related to this episode, Aaditya Thackeray asserted.He said Bollywood is an important part of Mumbai and thousands of people are dependent on the film industry for employment.The 30-year-old son of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said he shares cordial rapport with many people from Bollywood and added it is no crime.He claimed efforts are being made to divert the probe into Rajput's death, an episode being investigated separately by the Mumbai police and their Patna counterparts.Aaditya Thackeray further said Rajput's death is unfortunate and equally shocking and added the Mumbai Police are probing the matter in detail.The Maharashtra Police are reputed in the world. But those who do not believe in law are stoking dust of baseless allegations to divert the probe.As a grandson of Hinduhridaysamrat (King of Hindus' heart) Balasaheb Thackeray, I want to tell, that I will not commit any act that will harm the reputation of Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena and the Thackeray family.Those who are making baseless allegations should understand this, he said.The minister further said anyone who has special information regarding the case should submit it to the police who will definitely probe in that direction.I am exercising restraint in this case even today.None should remain under the illusion that the government and Thackeray family can be defamed by engaging in mud-slinging thus. This much for now, he added.Earlier in the day, BJP leader Narayan Rane had said Rajput's death should be probed as "murder".Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. The Mumbai Police had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and an investigation is underway.

05-08-2020||Vibha Sharma||With Ram Temple comes true PM Modi's decades-old resolve on visiting Ayodhya||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 5A very few among the current active top BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and JP Nadda, can claim any direct link with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the 'Rath Yatra' that marked the party's official entry into the agitation, putting it at a commanding position in the country's political scene that it is today.Led by then BJP president LK Advani, the purpose of the yatra was to support the agitation started by Sangh Parivar affiliates like the VHP. Narendra Modi, the then BJP's Gujarat organisation secretary, was a part of the meticulous planning that went into the massive political and social movement.Advani, who along with late Vishwa Hindu Parishad chief Ashok Singhal, is counted among key figures of the movement lasting decades, some say centuries, for a Ram Lalla temple at his birthplace on the banks of Saryu river in Ayodhya where the Babri mosque stood.The yatra helped galvanise aspirations, energies and passions of its countless participants, say BJP leaders, putting the issue on the forefront. It is said that Modi, who was part of the planning, resolved that he would go to Ayodhya only when he was in a position to fulfil the aspirations of millions of Hindus. The day is today.In fact, today when he arrived in Ayodhya to lay the foundation of the grand Ram temple, a promise by the ruling BJP in multiple manifestos over the years. The historic event marked the culmination of decades-long movement that catapulted the saffron party to the political centerstage.The site of the temple, which until recently was disputed, is the place which devotees believe is the birthplace of Ram Lalla Virajman, the infant Lord Ram.The grand Ram temple at Ayodhya, the core to the ruling BJP's ideology, is being built over the site where once stood the 16th century Babri mosque before it was razed in 1992 by Hindu activists.In November last year, the Supreme Court ruled for the site to be handed over to Hindus for the building of the temple and an alternative five-acre site for Muslims for a mosque.Meanwhile, the BJP has asked its cadres to felicitate ‘kar sevaks’ who participated in the movement between 1989 and 1992, post on social media updates about the event and share pictures of programmes in respective states or districts. Any BJP functionary, MLA or MP who has taken part in the movement has also been asked to post pictures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-ram-temple-comes-true-pm-modis-decades-old-resolve-on-visiting-ayodhya-122459

He was there to do his job. You must do everything in a professional manner. Protect all evidence," said Justice Roy even as Maharashtra Government counsel alleged that actions of the Bihar Police were politically motivated.Under the CrPC, it was only the Mumbai Police that had duty, power and function to register and investigate the case, the Maharashtra Government counsel submitted.Justice Roy: Bihar police have already entrusted investigation to the CBI. SG Mehta has stated that in principle centre has accepted the CBI probe request. The Mumbai Police have been investigating the case since June 14 when Rajput (34) was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in the western metropolis. Last week, Rajput’s father KK Singh filed the criminal complaint in Patna against Chakraborty and six others, including her family members, accusing them of abetting the actor’s suicide. Rea wanted the Patna case to be transferred to Mumbai.On behalf of Rea, senior advocate Shyam Divan urged the court to ensure that no coercive action was taken against her.But the Bench said, "We will only say investigation in accordance with law by competent authority."Rea has contended that she has been falsely implicated in the case.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi represented the Bihar Government, which has filed a caveat in the matter. He wanted the court to hear it next week.Senior advocate Vikas Singh appeared for Rajput's father who has filed a caveat in the matter to pre-empt any ex-parte order."How is it that the entire Bollywood film industry is being called for questioning by the Mumbai Police, but the person who lowered body from ceiling has been allowed to go to Hyderabad..." asked Singh.He urged the court to direct the Mumbai Police to assist the Bihar Police while the matter was being heard by SC. "Their entire attempt is to destroy evidence by disabling the Patna Police," he submitted.The Bihar Government too filed a caveat in Rhea Chakraborty's petition to support Rajput's father in the top court and to oppose her plea for transfer of case filed in Patna to Mumbai.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-gifted-talented-artiste-has-died-under-unusual-circumstances-it-needs-to-be-probed-sc-on-sushant-death-case-122457

05-08-2020||Ayodhya (UP)||PM Modi lays stone of Ram Temple in Ayodhya, says Ram belongs to all||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday laid the foundation stone of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.The Prime Minister performed the 'bhoomi poojan' before laying the stone.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also took part in the 'bhoomi poojan'.After performing the ‘bhoomi pujan’, Prime Minister Modi said the wait of centuries has ended and India is creating a golden chapter in Ayodhya,Beginning his speech with “Jai Siya Ram”, the Prime Minister told the gathering that a grand temple will be built for “Ram Lalla”, the infant Ram, who had been living in a temporary tent for years.“Many people made sacrifices for the Ram temple. I pay my respects to all of them,” the Prime Minister said after the ground-breaking ceremony of the temple at the spot where many devout Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.Sending out the message that “Ram is everywhere, Ram belongs to all”, Modi said the temple symbolises India’s rich heritage and will be an inspiration for all of humanity.                    Despite efforts to eradicate Lord Ram’s existence, he lives in our hearts and is the basis of our culture, Modi said.“Social harmony was the core principle of Lord Ram’s governance,” the Prime Minister said.Citing Lord Ram’s message, Modi said the more powerful India gets, the more it will be loved and remain peaceful.The construction of the Ram temple is an instrument to unite the country, he said, adding that it would lift the economy of the entire region.“We have to join stones for construction of the Ram temple with mutual love, brotherhood,” he said, asserting that everyone’s sentiments have to be taken care of.‘Temple will inspire humanity’Lord Ram is revered in several countries, including Indonesia which has the largest Muslim population, and the temple here will serve as an inspiration for the entire humanity till eternity, the Prime Minister said.He listed the Ramayanas popular in countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Nepal.Modi said references to Lord Ram are also found in Iran and China, and ‘Ram kathas’ are popular in several countries.There are so many countries in the world where Lord Ram is worshipped and people consider themselves attached to him.The country with the world’s largest Muslim population is Indonesia and even there various Ramayanas are popular and Ram is revered, Modi said.In Sri Lanka, the story of Ramayana by the name ‘Janki Haran’ is told, while Nepal’s ties with Ram are connected through ‘Mata Janki’, the Prime Minister said.“Like this, there are several countries where Ram is part of their beliefs and past,” he said.“I believe that the Ram temple to be built here will inspire the entire humanity till eternity,” Modi said.He noted that it is important that the message of Lord Ram, the Ram temple and of our age-old tradition reaches the entire world.Keeping this in mind, the ‘Ram circuit’ is being made in the country, Modi said. Earlier, the Prime Minister arrived in Ayodhya in the morning dressed in a traditional dhoti-kurta.“PM Narendra Modi leaves for Ayodhya,” the PMO tweeted.Also read: Ayodhya’s tryst with Ram Temple todayIndian-Americans opt for muted celebrationSecurity beefed up on UP-Nepal border for Ayodhya eventSpecial security ring for PM Modi in AyodhyaIndia is creating a golden chapter in Ayodhya, wait of centuries ends today: PM ModiWith Ram temple, comes true PM Modi's decades-old resolve on visiting AyodhyaPM @narendramodi leaves for Ayodhya. pic.twitter.com/gIPyz7HCJJ  The PM first offered prayers at the 10th century Hanuman Garhi temple, where he did ‘aarti’ and a ‘parikrama’ of the shrine. Premdas Maharaj, head priest of the temple, presented a silver ‘mukut’ and a stole to the PM.The PM spent around 10 minutes at the Hanuman Garhi temple.

The Chinese side also suffered casualties in the clashes but it is yet to give out details.The number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35, according to a US intelligence report."The Trump administration is looking to ramp up arms sales to India in the wake of the country's deadly border clashes with China, opening a new front of tensions between Washington and Beijing," the Foreign Policy magazine reported based on interviews with US officials and Congressional aides.Quoting the officials, the magazine said the US in recent months has laid the groundwork for new arms sales to India that "go above and beyond what previous administrations considered, including longer-term weapon systems with higher levels of technology and sophistication, such as armed drones".President Donald Trump has officially amended rules that restrict the sale of military-grade drones to foreign partners like India, it said, adding that prominent among them being the recent announcement by the Trump administration changing its interpretation of the Missile Technology Control Regime.This will allow the US to consider the sale of armed drones, which had previously been restricted because of their speeds and payloads, to allow them to be considered alongside surveillance drones, the news report said."They are going to want to provide India with armed [category-1] Predators," a Congressional aide familiar with the matter told Foreign Policy, while referring to MQ-1 Predator drones that can carry more than 1,000 pounds of bombs and missiles.The aide, according to the magazine, said the State and Defence Departments had been pushing for a transaction."Part of the calculation behind the policy change was to free themselves up from the international and multilateral constraints so they could increase the sales pitch to India on [drones]," the aide told the magazine.Simultaneously, a legislative move has been made to bring India on par with North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies when it comes to sale of arms by the US, it reported.Friends of India in the Congress hope that their efforts go through the National Defence Authorisation Act this year. One of them being by senators John Cornyn and Mark Warner, who are co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus, according to Foreign Policy.US' defence sales to India has jumped from near zero in 2008 to over USD 20 billion this year. Some of the recent and significant prior defence sales are to include the MH-60R Seahawk helicopters (USD 2.8 billion), the Apache helicopters (USD 796 million), and the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (USD 189 million).India was the first non-treaty partner to be offered a Missile Technology Control Regime Category-1 Unmanned Aerial System – the Sea Guardian UAS manufactured by General Atomics.The US is advocating for the Lockheed Martin's F-21 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-15EX Eagle as part of India's future fighter aircraft acquisitions.The potential selection of any of these platforms would enhance India's military capabilities, increase US-India military interoperability, and protect shared security interests in the Indo-Pacific region.Since 2015, the US also authorised India over USD 3 billion in defence articles via the Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) processes, which licenses the export of the defence equipment, services, and related manufacturing technologies controlled under the 21 categories of the US Munitions List (USML).The top DCS categories to India during this period were military electronics (USML category XI); fire control, laser, imaging, and guidance equipment (category XII); and aircraft and related articles, it stated.In 2016, the US designated India as a Major Defence Partner.Commensurating with this designation, in 2018, India was elevated to Strategic Trade Authorisation Tier 1 status, which allows it to receive licence-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies regulated by the Department of Commerce, a top Pentagon official had earlier said.

05-08-2020||Neelam Mansingh Chowdhry||Ebrahim Alkazi — The man who revolutionised Indian drama||With his single-minded determination’ Ebrahim Alkazi (1925-2020) fashioned the contours of modern Indian drama by shaping its lexicon via an inimitable training regimen that spelt out Modernism. In order to successfully translate into an Indian environment, modernism needed to mutate as a self-sustaining genre, as only then could it transform the past and emerge as something new. Alkazi was responsible for creating this modernism, but without changing the fabric of society or ideology, but merely by creating new and self-sustaining perceptions.As head of the National School of Drama in New Delhi he taught us students that “bringing alive” was theatre’s primary purpose; bringing something alive for the audience, oneself, a character, history or even conceptual thought. Alkazi also taught us that “bringing alive” was something that required instinct, patience, creativity, knowledge and effort and was not merely something flimsy or whimsical.He combined the roles of teacher, director and NSD head for 15 years till 1977, all rolled into one.  He single-handedly fashioned modern theatrical sensibility, an innovation not even his most trenchant critics can erase or devalue. As NSD head from 1962 he embodied the radical spirit of the times, and moulded modern Indian theatre by questioning training, storytelling, space, language and myth.  He truly challenged and formulated existing theatrical assumptions like no one before or since. Alkazi was my teacher at the NSD and I closely observed  his  creative processes, driving passion and voracious appetite for work, seeking and seeing relevance in little else outside it. No scribe or dramaturge has documented his work in any systematic or orderly manner, and  whatever has been gleaned in passing is from interpretation, observation and anecdotal stories that resonate in NSDs corridors.One resolute lesson I learnt in the years he was my mentor, was that theatre work was in no way like joining a hobby class; it was more like enlisting in a profession that necessitated  dedication and, commitment, much like wanting to become a doctor or a lawyer.Before Alkazi joined the NSD, its students were exposed to one-act plays that were more akin to elementary class-room productions. Even though sometimes full-length plays were featured, they were never ever public performances played out to audiences.  Alkazi, however, linked production work to professional actor training in all aspects of performance: from analysing complex characters to contextualising them historically through sets, costumes and props. In transforming the contours of modern Indian drama, nothing was too much or too little for Alkazi. He thought nothing about scooping up a cigarettes stub off the floor, or a soiled paper napkin lying from the schools corridors. This rounded aspect of training was necessary for all his students to comprehend that from making tea, to swabbing the stage, ironing costumes, arranging the green-room and cleaning the toilets, were as much an integral aspect of training as creating a character. Alkazi ,  I recall him telling NSD students that after all shows actors must make themselves scarce and not wait around for demonstrative kudos  from their audiences.  Curtain-calls were not part of Alkazi’s theatre culture. In a certain way both the students and actors were not allowed to  think of themselves as public figures, or luxuriate in the indulgence of praise. They just happened to be professionals, performing theatre. During my days as an NSD student in the mid-seventies , Alkazi  directed three pays that are hailed as his definitive work, Andha Yug by Dharam Vir Bharati, Tughlaq by Girish Karnad and Razia Sultan by Balwant Gargi, all of which were staged at the grand Purana Qila in 1974. It was a coup for the School to have secured permission to perform against such a majestic backdrop. The depth of the stage was raised up to 35 feet, on top of a chasm, connected by seven interconnecting divisions. The brooding red sandstone edifice, resonated history while the monolithic arches, columns and stone plinths, platforms and steps were where all the mythic characters came to life in this brilliant drama of destiny and death.I recall an incident that made me recognize, how hard art can be. An actor playing a soldier in Tughlaq, hurtled down from a parapet in Purana Kila and a broken leg cut short his ‘military’ career, but in no way did it interrupt the theatrical proceedings., “As no one is dead, we continue,” Alkazi said matter-of-factly and the rehearsals continued. Within a short period the NSD became synonymous with Alkazi,, and with his cosmopolitan background and expertise in the visual arts, he exposed his students not only to theatrical arts, but also to the world of poetry, painting, literature and cinema. He emphasised the importance of the printed word and encouraged students to visit the School’s well-stocked library. Students would also be presented books by Alkazi. I have been a recipient of this largess, after which he would check if they had been read, or not. Often, he would even check the library records and shame us for our lapses, thereby prompting most of us to rectify them.Alkazi was endearingly called chacha, or uncle by his students, a somewhat colloquial moniker for a man who epitomised the highest standards of urbanity and sophistication He was always a topic of conversation amongst his students, who discussed him threadbare with the same passion as they dissected a Chekhov or Ibsen play in the hostel dormitories at night. He completely fascinated us all.  I feel stricken by the loss of Ebrahim Alkazi,  my most revered teacher. The last time I met him was at his daughter Amal Allana’s home for   lunch in 2018. I had taken two kurtas for him in beige and white. Amal, wanted to know, why I had brought such morose colors, as Alkazi  Sahib  loved his clothes to  be vibrant.  A few minutes later he was wheeled in looking handsome but frail. I was delighted to meet him and whispered my respects and fondness for him. He pressed my hand and seemed to communicate through delicate gestures, that what I was sharing was comprehended and valued by him. His loss is irreparable as he was a giant in the world of theatre. Legion of his students remember him and each one of us felt as if we shared a special relationship with him. (Chowdhry is a celebrated and internationally acclaimed theatre person.)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ebrahim-alkazi-%E2%80%94-the-man-who-revolutionised-indian-drama-122251

The UN Security Council discussed Kashmir, but behind closed doors last week with no records kept of the meeting, said India’s UN permanent representative TS Tirumurti. The “new political map” was another attempt to internationally project the Kashmir issue as a dispute ahead of the first anniversary of rearrangement of J&K, said sources.Qureshi said the “official map” would now be used in schools and colleges. He said Kashmir borders had been kept open-ended as it was a disputed territory. The map also includes an eastward shift of the disputed Sir Creek in Gujarat and a claim over the Siachen Glacier. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-pak-new-map-exercise-in-absurdity-122232

He also highlighted the need to provide face masks, sanitisers and PPE to them.On behalf of the Centre, senior advocate V Mohana submitted that states were already making efforts in this regard and this was not an adversarial issue.The top court said the elderly people should be given priority in the admission to government hospitals in view of their vulnerability for Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-disburse-pension-provide-face-masks-ppe-suits-to-elderly-122239

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.“Today I am signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule, hire American,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Monday before signing the order against hiring H-1B visa holders for federal contracts.

At the very outset, Justice Mishra asked Dhavan to demarcate the thin line between free speech and contempt of court. “How do we save the grace of the system and bring this to an end as well?” the Bench asked Dhavan. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-court-reserves-order-in-bhushan-contempt-case-122244

Prior to the ‘bhoomi pujan’, PM Modi will offer prayers at Hanumangarhi temple. He will later unveil a plaque to mark the laying of the foundation stone and release a commemorative postage stamp.Ayodhya has been decked up for the grand event keeping in mind safety measures amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The holy city is resplendent in rainbow colours — from multi-coloured arches welcoming visitors, to pink lights illuminating mandirs and ghats of the Saryu, with saffron and yellow marigold flowers decoration at the puja site and Ram ki Paeri adding dazzle.Worth the waitSometimes significant dreams take a long time to fruition, but when they are finally realised, the wait becomes very worthwhile.—LK Advani, BJP leaderThe Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra has invited 175 eminent guests for the ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony, which includes 135 saints from 135 spiritual traditions.Incidentally, Iqbal Ansari, the son of original litigant of the title suit, Hashim Ansari, was the first to get the invite. “I believe it was Lord Ram’s wish that I receive the first invitation. I accept it. May Hindus and Muslims live in harmony in Ayodhya,” he said. Another eminent citizen of Ayodhya, Padma Shri awardee Mohammad Sharif or ‘Sharif chacha’, has been invited. He is known for disposing of unclaimed bodies with dignity. The laying of foundation stone for the ‘grand Ram Temple’, a promise by the ruling BJP in its manifestoes over the years, will bring to end the decades-long movement that catapulted the saffron party to the political centre-stage.

Chakraborty’s lawyer Satishmane Shinde questioned the Bihar government’s decision. “There cannot be transfer of a case which had no legal basis to begin with for the Bihar Police to get involved. At the most, it would be a zero FIR which would then be transferred to Mumbai Police,” Maneshinde said.The SC is scheduled to hear on Wednesday the plea of Chakraborty seeking transfer of an FIR. — PTITwo PILs filed in Supreme Court‘Having friends in Bollywood no crime’"Mud-slinging is being indulged in against me and Thackeray family for no reason.

DNA vaccine candidate for Covid-19 developed by Zydus Cadila has also completed safely and early efficiency studies and has embarked on phase 2 trials at 11 sites and is progressing well.”Bhargava says once the vaccines become available, issues of priority distribution, logistics and training of vaccine administrators will have to be addressed. “Till we have a safe and efficacious vaccine and even once we have it, sustained behaviour change to practice social distancing and hand and respiratory hygiene will remain our best defence against Covid-19,” he added.25-30% rapid antigen testsThe Indian Council of Medical Research said 25 to 30 per cent of all Covid-19 tests are rapid antigen method tests.Bhargava said the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) test must be done to confirm the disease in a symptomatic person whose test report is negative through an antigen test which has been found to have good specificity of 85 to 90 per cent, but moderate sensitivity of 55 to 85 per cent.Delhi bans hookahsNew Delhi: The Delhi Government on Tuesday banned the use of hookahs, including herbal hookahs, in public places to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV2 virus that causes Covid-19 disease.

Contrary to what Qureshi has asserted, there has been no formal meeting of the UNSC on India-Pakistan issue since 1965,” he said.“Even the UN Secretary General, in his statement last August, clearly referred to the 1972 bilateral Shimla Agreement. Consequently, Pakistan’s efforts haven’t met any traction at the UNSC. Even if Pakistan persists, there are no takers here in the UN,” said Tirumurti.Moreover, it was a known fact that Pakistan was home to the largest number of listed terrorists, internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals, he pointed out.India will join the UNSC for a two-year membership from January 1, 2021, for the eighth time.Qureshi has also opposed India’s quest for permanent membership claiming that an expansion will “compound, not resolve, UNSC’s paralysis’”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-fails-to-rake-up-kashmir-again-at-unsc-122235
