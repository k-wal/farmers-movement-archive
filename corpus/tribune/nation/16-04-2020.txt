16-04-2020||Amaravati (AP)||AP top cop’s note on currency as COVID-19 carrier creates flutter||A communication from Andhra Pradesh’s top police officer suggesting coronavirus may spread through currency notes has created a flutter in the state.In a state with minimal digital transaction, the possibility of such a “phenomenon” rings “danger bells”, police said.Though the state police chief’s office issued a memorandum to this effect recently to all Superintendents of Police, city Commissioners and Range DIGs and Guntur IG, DGP DG Sawang said, “there is no proof or any established evidence of contamination” by currency notes.“There is no proof or any established evidence of contamination by currency notes of any kind whatsoever in the state,” he told PTI.He also denied, “first of all” having sent the memorandum but noted “our staff in office have incorporated (it) in one of the many routine messages which are sent on a daily basis to keep alerting units on the ground”.     It was just one of the possibilities of catching the infection, he added.The memo, however, caused a flutter in the bureaucracy, with IAS officers taking strong exception to it saying it could trigger “unwanted panic” when the state was fighting the pandemic.“This is a thoroughly baseless circular without any scientific thought. Police can’t act like an authority unto themselves in such sensitive matters,” a senior IAS officer remarked.The DGP’s memo made some interesting suggestions, but health authorities monitoring the coronavirus cases round the clock did not corroborate them.It said people in East Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts contracted the virus though they did not have any travel history or contact with primary\secondary contacts of any person who travelled within the country or abroad.It suggested they might have got infected as they have done business where cash transaction involving many people happens.Therefore, currency notes could have been the ‘culprit’ carrying the virus from infected people, it said.“This phenomenon rings danger bells in our state,” the top police official’s memo said.Cable TV operators, drinking water suppliers and milk vendors were among those collecting money from multiple customers.Petrol stations, kirana shops, vegetable and fruit vendors and pharmacists also collect money from customers and in the process “may come into contact with contaminated notes”.Referring to a case in Guntur district, the DGP office said medical practitioners who did not have awareness about the virus were treating and collecting money from patients which could possibly lead to infection.In the light of these, the DGP instructed all police unit officers to propagate online transactions and ask people to accept cash only after “sanitising themselves and the currency notes”.

16-04-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 testing ratio not low: ICMR after Rahul criticism||As coronavirus cases in India touched nearly 13,000, the Centre on Thursday defended its testing strategy in the wake of fresh criticism, saying the testing ratio is not low, adding there has been no COVID-19 infections in 325 of the 736 districts.The assertion by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) came in response to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s criticism that India was not conducting enough coronavirus tests even as the Health Ministry said 28 districts which earlier reported COVID-19 cases had recorded no infections in the past 14 days.With comprehensive testing holding key to controlling coronavirus, India also received the much-awaited five lakh rapid COVID-19 testing kits from China on Thursday, the government said.The death toll due to coronavirus in the country rose to 420 and the number of cases climbed to 12,759, registering an increase of 28 deaths and 826 cases since Wednesday evening, according to Union Health Ministry data. Out of this, as many as 1,514 people have recovered. The number of cases had risen by over 1,000 in the last two days.According to a PTI tally based on reports from the states, the total number of cases was 12,935 while 1,571 patients had recovered. The death toll stood at 436.Coronavirus cases crossed 1,000 in Madhya Pradesh (1,090) and Rajasthan (1,104) taking to five the states which have surpassed this mark.Maharashtra topped the tally at 3,081 with Mumbai (2,043) being the worst hit followed by Delhi (1,578) and Tamil Nadu(1,267). The cases in the country’s commercial capital have doubled in six days.28 districts that earlier reported cases have recorded no infections in past 14 days“In countries like Japan, one out of 11.7 tests turns out to be positive, which is among the highest in the world. Italy tests 6.7 persons for one positive test while the USA tests 5.3 persons and the United Kingdom 3.4,” said Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the ICMR.Dr Gangakhedkar said 2,90,401 samples have been tested so far, of which 30,043 were tested on Wednesday itself.Out of the tests carried out on Wednesday, 26,331 were done in laboratories under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) network and 3,712 in private labs, he added.Commenting on the testing capacity of ICMR network, Dr Gangakhedkar said, "Working in one shift, more than 42,400 samples can be tested each day. If we work in two shifts, we will be able to test more than 78,200 samples daily."“Taking their population base into consideration, it is difficult to comment about our testing rate. In India, we are conducting 24 tests out of which one comes out to be positive. Also, we have huge population and not all people belong to vulnerable groups. Hence, can’t say our testing ratio is low,” he told the daily press briefing.Endorsing the official’s assessment, Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary in the health ministry, said data can be interpreted in many ways and the government’s effort is aimed at ensuring not a single positive case is missed out.Rahul Gandhi said the scale of testing in India has been low so far at 199 per 10 lakh people—around 350 tests per district—which he said is not enough to tell which way the virus is moving.Gangakhedkar said the testing kits from China will be used for surveillance and to monitor whether coronavirus hotspots in the country are increasing or decreasing.Reacting to reports suggesting that the Chinese kits could be faulty, Gangakhedkar acknowledged that the sensitivity and specificity of such kits are less.“Rapid antibody tests are for monitoring surveillance, not for early diagnosis. Hence there is no concern with respect to the testing kits being faulty, that concern was with respect to immune response alone,” he explained.The Centre has declared 170 hotspots--123 hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 hotspot districts with cluster—in 25 states and Union territories.Besides, it has identified 207 non-hotspot districts with clusters in 27 states which can be potential hot spots if there is no containment strategies.At the briefing, Agarwal said that 325 districts in India have not reported any coronavirus case so far because of actions initiated at field level.Also, the implementation of containment strategies in some districts which earlier had reported COVID-19 cases have yielded positive results, he said. One such place is Mahe, an enclave of Puducherry in Kerala, where no case has been reported in the last 28 days.There are 27 other districts in the country also where no positive case has been reported in a fortnight, he added.

During the FY 2019-20, against the foodgrain production target of 291.10 million tonnes, higher production of about 292 million tonnes is anticipated mainly due to enhancement of area coverage and productivity of various crops,” as per Agriculture Ministry statistics.Addressing the National Conference on Kharif (summer-sown) crops 2020, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said all states should aim to achieve the kharif target and asked them to work in a mission mode to achieve the target of doubling farmers’ income.The IMD has forecast the June to September southwest monsoon rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be normal. This augurs well for rain-fed kharif crops. In view of the COVID-19 lockdown, the state governments were also informed about the exemptions given for farm activities.Speaking at the conference, senior officials said the sowing of kharif crops has already begun in some parts of the country. The ministry has set a target of 149.92 million tonnes of foodgrains production in the kharif season and 148.4 million tonnes in the rabi (winter sown) season, taking the total foodgrain target to record 298.3 million tonnes in the 2020-21 crop year.In the foodgrains category, rice production target has been fixed at 117.5 million tonnes in 2020-21 from estimated 117.47 million tonnes output in the current crop year.Target for wheat output has been kept at 106.5 million tonnes, same at the current level estimated. Similarly, coarse cereals production target has been set higher at 48.7 million tonnes in 2020-21, from estimated 45.24 million tonnes output in the current crop year.The target for pulses production is 25.6 million tonnes, up from 23.02 million tonnes in the current year.In the non-foodgrain category, the ministry has set a higher goal of producing 36.64 million tonnes of oilseeds as against 34.19 million tonnes in the 2019-20 crop year.Cotton output target has been fixed at 36 million bales compared with 34.89 million bales (of 170 kg each) this crop year.Sugarcane production target is 390 million tonnes during 2020-21, up from 353.8 million tonnes estimated in the current crop year.On Wednesday, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast that the country will receive “normal” monsoon rainfall this year, raising hopes for higher farm output.Tomar also assured the states that the Centre will remove any obstacles that they are facing.As regards the Rabi crops being harvested currently, Tomar said it has been decided that all states will ensure procurement at village/block levels as farmers are not allowed to move out of the block due to the lockdown. In addition, all states are taking steps for direct marketing/purchasing of crop produce from farmers, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-sets-foodgrain-production-target-at-record-298-million%C2%A0tonnes-72039

As for opportunity, he said, India could work on plans not only to reach out to others but also look for new places through enterprise.Advocating that India could consider limits on expenditure on the revenue side without slashing the capital expenditure, veteran columnist A K Bhattacharya said the working class would be hit the most and poor health on account of malnourishment during these difficult times would add to the problem of having a weak work force.Another lesson from this pandemic is that India suffered from concurrent planning and the policy planners should have come up with economic package quicker. He also visualised that post-lockdown many new business models would emerge especially with change of methods like work from home ad use of digital technology could give localisation a larger role to play.Taking part in the webinar, medical professional Arvind Kumar, Chairman for Chest Surgery and Lung Transplantation, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said the strategy to go for lockdown as to build up health infrastructure and train health professionals to cope up with the load of cases without which the sector would be unable to handle the pressure.With increased awareness and changing situation, the advisories to were altered to keep pace with the spread of the disease. The testing strategy itself was adapting to the situation and containment at hotspots.As for the another health problem that may emerge due to less treatment for those with life threatening diseases, he said, these could be described as collateral damage but the flip side was that there is a sharp decline in loss of lives in accidents reported in normal time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daily-wage-earners-require-special-care-even-post-lockdown-72038

A senior official should be in charge of each of the camps,” a senior official privy to the deliberation said.Bandra in Mumbai, Maharashtra and Surat in Gujarat have recently reported incidents of the migrant labourers showing desperation to go back to their respective native places with the work places shut due to the lockdown.Also, the official said, the camps are needed to be set up for the labourers, including those who are stranded at various places, to ensure they don’t become the targets of the pandemic.“A lot of videos have emerged of the migrant labourers stuck at places, crammed in small areas, with visible lack of social distancing norms. Therefore, it is imperative on the part of administration to address the issue in right earnest at the district-level across the country,” the official said.It was only yesterday that the empowered group of officials on economic and social welfare had also discussed the plight of the migrant labourers. The group is headed by the economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty. The group also looked into the concerns of the unorganised sector, which may face labour crunch once they are allowed to function after April 20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-states-to-appoint-district-level-nodal-officer-to-deal-with-migrant-workers-72032

We hope that foreign buyers can choose products certified by Chinese regulatory authorities and with production qualifications when importing relevant products,” she said.Recently, China introduced stricter regulatory measures, requiring exporters to provide written statements that their exports have obtained the registration certificate for medical device from the State Food and Drug Administration and met the quality standards of the importing country or region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-china-asks-mea-to-import-certified-testing-kits-ppe-72028

The first mega shipments from China and South Korea are expected to land later in the night.While the government had continued to evacuate foreigners stranded in India, with several flights leaving the country daily, it has advised its nationals stranded abroad to stay put. India has so far sent back 35,000 foreigners from 48 countries. However, for Indians stuck abroad, sources advice "patience", by hunkering down wherever they are currently based. Indian missions will be at hand to provide support and guidance.The government also has no plans to bring back over 3,300 stranded Indians who have tested positive for COVID. There is no word on the fate of the bodies of 25 Indians who have died abroad due to the epidemic. Sources denied that the inaction was due to the absence of quarantine facilities. They suggested that these infected persons had the potential to spread the virus if they were moved out from medical care in the countries where they are stranded."India has been recognised as a reliable global supplier of medicine during this humanitarian crises. We have reached out to many countries and will continue to do so,’’ said sources, while pointing out that the decision to export HCQ and paracetamol was taken after stock-taking by a committee consisting of officials from the Department of Commerce, ICMR, Drug Controller and MEA."We created a buffer and allowed the surplus to be exported,’’ said the sources.Chinese suppliers have sent a large consignment of 6.5 lakh testing kits, out of which 5.5 lakh are rapid anti-body testing kits and the rest RNA Extraction kits. A large consignment of PPE is expected shortly while more testing kits are arriving from Korea. The MEA has also taken quotations for PPE and testing kits from UK, Malaysia, France, Canada and the US and it has obtained leads from Germany and Japan.

Similarly, the IMF on Tuesday projected a GDP growth of 1.9 per cent for India in 2020, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s.The pandemic and consequent lockdown have hit various sectors, including MSME, hospitality, civil aviation, agriculture and allied sector.The government constituted an empowered group - headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty - which is entrusted with the task of suggesting measures that can bring back economy back on track quickly post the lockdown.Besides, it was also asked to work on relief and welfare measures for various sectors of the economy as well as for the poor and needy.In his address to the nation, the Prime Minister had expressed concern over problems being faced by poor and daily wagers and farmers."The government has made every possible effort to help them through Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana. Their interests have also been taken care of while making the new guidelines," he had said.To ease the pain and misery, the Finance Minister last month announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus that included free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor for three months, and cash doles to women and poor senior citizens as it looked to ease the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown.As per the announcement, 80 crore poor ration cardholders will each get 5 kg of wheat or rice and one kg of preferred pulses free of cost every month for the next three months, while, 20.4 crore women having Jan Dhan bank accounts would get cash help of Rs 1,500 spread over three months.Over 8.3 crore poor women, who were handed out free cooking gas connections since 2016, will get free LPG refills for the next three months, while poor senior citizens, widows and disabled will get ex-gratia cash of Rs 1,000. Sitharaman had hinted at more announcements if the need arises.In a bid to save resources, the government has already put restrictions on expenditure and funds are being diverted towards the fight against COVID-19.Besides, the Union Cabinet approved a 30 per cent reduction in salary and allowances of Members of Parliament for one year.President, Vice President and Governors voluntarily decided to take a pay cut as a gesture towards concerted effort to contain the spread of the deadly virus.At the same time, the government has decided to suspend MPLADS and funds would be directed towards improving medical infrastructure.An MP gets Rs 5 crore every year as part of the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS).

The Petitioner submits that stringent action must be taken against all deliberate violations of lockdown, in accordance with law," he submitted.The former UP DGP said, on one hand, the Supreme Court itself directed for release of prisoners from jails to reduce overcrowding and on the other hand, Police were continuing to burden the criminal justice system through FIRs in petty offences in an unlawful manner, which at the most mandate the jail term of six months.Singh said, as he was a former DGP, he understood the pain and suffering of those who caught in the wheels of the criminal justice system.He said he was also concerned about the undue burden on police officers, who will have to do voluminous documentation in all such matters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-ex-dgp-vikram-singh-moves-sc-seeks-quashing-of-lockdown-violation-firs-72008
16-04-2020||Amritsar||Coronavirus: 41 Pak nationals stranded in India return through Attari border||Forty-one Pakistani nationals, who were stuck in India following the closure of borders due to the COVID-19 lockdown, on Thursday returned to their country via the Attari-Wagah border.The Indian government has been facilitating the repatriation of 180 Pakistani citizens, who were stranded in different parts of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.SAFMA activist Rajinder Singh Ruby said that 263 Indian citizens have also been stranded in Pakistan, including many students. They have been asked to “stay put”, in line with the government’s policy, until some arrangement was made for their return.“We were in touch with several Sikh pilgrims who got stranded at Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore. They told that they had conveyed this to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to help them reach India," he said.All Pakistani nationals were screened as per the international norms before they were allowed to cross over to Wagah. As per directions, only asymptomatic ones could be allowed to return. They would undergo self-isolation on reaching Pakistan.Showing gratitude towards Indian and Pakistani governments for taking prompt steps for their return, Karachi resident Mohammad Hussain said, “I came to this side through Wagah border for Mumbai on March 8 to attend Urs ritual. Meanwhile, the lockdown was imposed. We faced difficulty but it was acceptable as jaano ki hifazat pehli priority hai (protecting lives is the first priority). It was reasonable to implement restrictions to break coronavirus chain,” he said.Nankana Sahib resident Bhupinder Singh said that he came on February 22 as a tourist with his family and was now happy to go back.“Reaching back, my first move would be to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Janam Asthan, Nankana Sahib and initiate ardas for ‘sarbat da bhalla’. As India did, Pakistan too should help Indian citizens, who got stuck in Pakistan due to lockdown, to reach their homes,” he said.Karachi resident Vilayat Ali said that on February 16 he came to New Delhi along with his daughter who had to undergo plastic surgery.“We are happy and going back after successful medical treatment here. We had two months of medical visa. My daughter was discharged on March 20, but before we couldn’t finish official formalities to get back to Pakistan and we got stranded due to COVID lockdown,” he said.Peshawar resident Raja Singh and Karachi resident Mansur Ali came here to meet their Indian relatives and were happy to reunite with their families back home.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-41-pak-nationals-stranded-in-india-return-through-attari-border-72006

16-04-2020||Aditi Tandon||Lockdown no solution to Covid, aggressive testing main weapon: Rahul||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 16Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the ongoing national lockdown is in no way a solution to COVID 19 and aggressive testing was the country’s main weapon to fight the disease.In his first virtual press conference from AICC headquarters, Gandhi said with lockdown India had pressed the pause button and when the lockdown ends the virus will start its work again.“In no way does a lockdown defeat the disease. The lockdown just stops the disease for some time. The biggest weapon against COVID is testing to know where the virus is moving. Currently we are chasing the virus. Unless we do random testing the virus will keep getting ahead of us,” Gandhi said.He called for aggressive push to testing and for the government to use ransom test results strategically to designate hotspots.“What has happened has happened. Let’s now scale up testing and pre-empt the virus to know where it is going,” Gandhi suggested.The former Congress chief also cautioned the government against declaring victory in the COVID war too soon.“Premature declaration of victory would be fatal. The fight has just started. Declaring victory today would be a very wrong thing to do,” Gandhi said when asked for comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent remarks that India was better placed than many countries on the COVID battle having taken proactive and pre-emptive steps.The Congress leader in oblique references to the Tablighi Jamaat cluster and some communities fearing cooperation in the COVID surveillance efforts said, “India can only fight this disease with unity. Testing won’t harm anyone. It will only help track the virus and its path. If we get divided we will lose this fight.”Gandhi offered Congress cooperation to the PM in the matter and said he may have differences with the PM but he is solidly with the PM in the battle against COVID.Gandhi said he would have liked more decentralisation of funding to states and more conversation between the PM and states on lockdown demanding an immediate minimum financial net, food security for the poor and migrants and a protective package for medium and small industries that employ 40 per cent of people.Gandhi warned against social unrest if the government didn’t move quickly to address the migrant crisis.“Government needs to act quickly. If it doesn’t act now on the migrant front soon there will be social unrest. Government needs to be compassionate,” he said asking for 10 kg wheat and rice each and a kg each of sugar and pulses for the poor including those without ration cards.The Wayanad MP on many occasions stressed the greatness of India to say that India will emerge victorious against the disease.While he flagged concerns around a crisis bruising around food and employment, Gandhi said everyone had to work together to battle the disease.“We have to see this disease not from the prism of fear but from the prism of confidence. India has overdone bigger challenges in the past and India will win again. There is nothing to fear. We will come out at a better place in the world once this fight is over,” he said exuding hope.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-no-solution-to-covid-aggressive-testing-main-weapon-rahul-71996

Then his global income is exempted from tax in India as an NRI. However, his income in India would still be taxed," chartered accountant Sunil Rawla said.In a letter to Sitharaman, GOPIO president Sunny Kulathakal has said NRIs and the People of Indian Origin (PIO) have been substantially contributing to the Indian economy.According to a World Bank report, India is the top recipient of remittances in the world. In 2018, the Indian diaspora sent a whopping USD 79 billion back home, a rise of 14 per cent from the previous year, Kulathakal said."In view of the world-wide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented disruption of economic activities, GOPIO appeals to the government of India for immediate repeal of the revised NRI status duration rule of 120 days and make it 182 days, which has existed for long," he said.The new rule is akin to penalising all NRIs, Kulathakal said."Entire nation is suffering due to the closure of borders, shutdown of airlines and other means of transportation. Many NRIs are forced to stay longer in India due to quarantine and travel restrictions imposed on them to combat the pandemic, resulting in losing their NRI status," he said."In view of these disruptive developments that are beyond our control, we plead before you to revoke the provision on NRI status introduced through the Union Budget 2020," Kulathakal said.The GOPIO is the largest network of the Indian diaspora, which was founded in 1989 in New York, the letter said.Though the initial focus of the organisation was on human rights violations against the people of Indian origin, over the past three decades, it has been actively involved in the social, economic, cultural and educational issues of the PIO community and NRIs around the globe.The GOPIO has been striving to promote Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiatives such as Make in India, Skill India and Digital India among the NRI-PIO community, the letter said.

16-04-2020||New Delhi||India needs to step up coronavirus testing: Experts||India needs to "significantly ramp up" the number of tests done across the country to trace COVID-19 infection if the virus is to be contained in time, experts said.The death toll due to coronavirus rose to 414 and the number of cases to 12,380 in the country on Thursday, according to the Union Health Ministry.While the number of active COVID-19 cases is 10,477, 1,488 people have been cured and discharged and one had migrated, it said.Data obtained from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that till April 14, the number of samples tested stood at 2,44,893, an increase of 27,339 from the corresponding figure till the previous day (2,17,554).Experts feel the figures are modest for a count of the size of 1.3 billion and "much more number of tests" are needed to combat COVID-19 outbreak in the country.According to worldometers.info which maintains a global database on coronavirus cases and tests conducted, the US, where over 26,000 COVID-19 deaths have occurred, has done 31,00,387 tests averaging about 9,367 per million of population.The figure for India is 2,44,893 tests averaging 177 per million of population.Spain and Italy, two countries which have also seen several thousands of fatalities, have done 6,00,000 and 10,73,689 tests respectively.Dr Ravi Shekhar Jha, Senior Consultant and Head of the Department of Pulmonology at Fortis Escorts, Faridabad, said India is going in the right direction but it is not enough."Given the massive size of our population, the number of tests needs to be ramped up and should be conducted more rigorously. We need to do effective contact tracing and test them so that those people in turn do not infect others," he told PTI.The number of samples tested till March 28 stood at 27,688, a rise of 7,038 from the corresponding figure till March 27, according to ICMR data."The rise in number of cases happening is also because in the last few weeks during the lockdown, people who came in contact with affected people were traced and tested. This has to be increased manifold if we have to contain coronavirus in time, otherwise it will be a difficult affair," Jha said.Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director at Max Healthcare, said it has been decided to conduct coronavirus tests on "all our workforce and patients across the country"."Priority will be to test our admitted patients and new patients being brought in. And, the front-line health care workers," he said.India is doing lot of tests, but it is not enough compared to what the US and Singapore and other countries are doing, he said, adding, "much more testing needs to be done".Another expert from a leading private hospital here, who did not wish to be named, said, "The volume of tests conducted needs to be ramped up significantly to capitalise on the gains from the lockdown.”Two kinds of diagnostic tests are being currently used in India -- RT-PCR test and rapid antibodies test, according to global health norms.A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA that detects the virus while the antibody tests, which use blood, detect the body's response to the virus.Dr Arvind Kumar, noted lung surgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said the key to fighting the COVID-19 battle is "testing, testing and testing" and then "quarantining and treating"."The more number of people we screen, the greater our chance of winning this fight against COVID-19. The number of tests has to be significantly increased," he said.In Delhi, which has seen 1,561 cases and 30 deaths till April 14, over 16,000 samples have been tested till that period."Number of cases was rising and they will increase even more now, as more testing is done. We are still on the rising limb of the epidemic curve. Also, people are learning social distancing, sneezing etiquette, which are important elements in this fight," said Dr Rajesh Chawla, a pulmonologist at Apollo Hospital.

16-04-2020||Beijing||China dispatches 6.5 lakh medical kits to India to fight Covid-19: Indian envoy||China on Thursday dispatched 6,50,000 coronavirus medical kits to India to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Ambassador to Beijing Vikram Misri said.Over two million test kits being procured from China will be sent to India in the next 15 days, he told PTI here.“#IndiaFightsCoronavirus A total of 650,000 kits, including Rapid Antibody Tests and RNA Extraction Kits have been despatched early today from Guangzhou Airport to #India,” Misri tweeted on Thursday.As its factories resumed operations after over a two-month grim battle against the coronavirus, China is busy tapping into the vast business opportunities of export of key medical goods, especially ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE), across the world, including India, where both private and government bodies are placing orders for the import of these products.Two major consignments of medical kits were reported to have been sent to India from China earlier as part of efforts to step up testing especially in hotspots during the current lockdown in the country.India has extended its ongoing lockdown to fight the coronavirus till May 3. It has reported 414 deaths due to the disease and 12,380 people have been infected by the disease in the country.Considering the importance, Misri said the Indian Embassy is facilitating commercial procurements besides coordinating flight linkages for their timely arrival in India.On Tuesday, Misri told media here that India has placed orders to procure 15 million personal protection gear from China for medical personnel treating COVID-19 patients besides three million testing kits.The orders are being placed with bona fide firms with the help of the Chinese government."I think facilitation of our needs and our requirements in a timely manner, in a smooth manner, on a predictable timeline at prices that are stable and orderly, would be the best signal possible to send for the India-China relationship," Misri said.As demand for Chinese medical supplies scaled up due to the spread of the virus in several parts of world, China on Wednesday asked all the countries to import these items through reputed Chinese firms cleared by the government and vowed to punish those involved in counterfeit behaviour.Responding to questions about quality concerns raised by several countries related to medical equipment imports from China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here on Wednesday that the Chinese government is facilitating the orderly exports."We hope foreign buyers can choose products from companies that have been accredited by Chinese regulators with good production credentials," he said.

Jharkhand has reported two deaths.Meghalaya, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha and Assam have reported one fatality each, according to health ministry data.However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states as on Thursday showed at least 12,953 cases and 436 deaths.There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of deaths announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states. According to the ministry’s data updated in the evening, the highest number of confirmed cases in the country are from Maharashtra at 2,919 followed by Delhi at 1,578 and Tamil Nadu at 1,242.COVID-19 cases have gone up to 1,120 in Madhya Pradesh followed by 1,023 in Rajasthan, 871 in Gujarat and 773 in Uttar Pradesh.Telangana has 698 cases, followed by Andhra Pradesh at 534 and Kerala at 388.The number of novel coronavirus cases has risen to 315 in Karanataka, 300 in Jammu and Kashmir, 271 in West Bengal, 205 in Haryana and 186 in Punjab.Bihar has reported 74 COVID-19 cases, while Odisha has 60 coronavirus cases.

16-04-2020||Washington||IMF backs India's 'proactive' Covid-19 response||The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said that it supported India's proactive decision of imposing a nationwide lockdown in its fight against coronavirus.A day earlier, the IMF in its World Economic Outlook had forecast India's growth rate to be 1.9 per cent in 2020."India entered the pandemic turmoil in the midst of a credit crunch-induced slowdown and its recovery prospect becomes more uncertain," Chang Yong Rhee, the Director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, told reporters during a news conference here."Despite the economic slowdown, the government implemented a nationwide lockdown and we support India's proactive decision," Rhee said.On March 25, India entered a three-week lockdown, which was slated to end on April 14. The lockdown was extended till May 3.The impact of the coronavirus on the Asia-Pacific region will be severe, across the board, and unprecedented, he said, adding that Asia's growth in 2020 will come to a standstill.This is worse than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 per cent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 per cent). Actually, Asia has not experienced zero growth in the last 60 years, he said. "That said, Asia's growth still fares better than other regions."For 2021, he said, there is hope. If containment policies succeed there could be a rebound in growth, he said.However, it is highly uncertain how this year will progress, he added.Noting that this is not a time for business as usual, Rhee said that Asian countries needed to use all policy instruments in their toolkits. In doing so, policy tradeoffs will be inevitable and will depend on policy space, he added.China is expected to grow by 1.2 per cent in 2020. The revisions to growth reflect both losses of domestic activity due to the social distancing measures, as well as loss of external demand."We expect a rebound in economic activity later this year. This is because China is emerging from the outbreak first. Nonetheless, there are clear risks: the virus could come back and normalisation could take longer," Rhee said.Japan's economic outlook for 2020 has deteriorated significantly, he said.Real GDP in Japan is expected to decline by 5.2 per cent, caused by the coronavirus impact, and a sharp deterioration of external demand, he said, adding South Korea's growth in 2020 is anticipated to be at -1.2 per cent, he said.Spelling out a set of recommendations for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Rhee said the first priority is to support and protect the health sector to contain the virus and introduce measures that slow contagion."If there is not enough fiscal space, countries will need to re-prioritize from other expenditures," he said.Noting that containment measures are severely affecting economies, he said targeted support to hardest-hit households and firms is needed.This is a real economic shock unlike the Global Financial Crisis. Protect people, jobs and industries directly, not just through financial institutions, he said.Observing that the pandemic is also affecting the financial market functioning, he urged countries to use monetary and macroprudential regulations flexibly to provide ample liquidity, ease financial stress of industries and SMEs."For emerging markets with limited fiscal space, they might need to consider how to use central bank balance sheets flexibly to help SMEs through risk sharing with the government,” he said.Asserting that external pressures need to be contained, he said that countries should seek and utilize bilateral and multilateral swap lines and financial support from the multilateral institutions.“There can be a role for capital flow measures to secure external sector stability as a prerequisite to use more aggressive domestic policies to prevent lasting social and economic distress,” he said. "Targeted support combined with domestic demand stimulus in a recovery will help to reduce scarring, but it needs to reach people and smaller firms."

Together!” India eliminated polio in 2014.According to a WHO press release, Vardhan said in New Delhi that “time and again the Government of India and WHO together have shown our ability, competence and prowess to the whole world. With our combined meticulous work, done with full sincerity and dedication, we were able to get rid of polio.” “All of you in the field – IDSP (Integrated Disease Surveillance Project), state rapid response teams and WHO - are our ‘surveillance corona warriors'. With your joint efforts we can defeat the coronavirus and save lives,” Vardhan added.WHO South-East Asia Regional Director Poonam Khetrapal Singh said the National Polio Surveillance Project (WHO-NPSP) played a critical role in strengthening surveillance for polio that generated useful, timely and accurate data to guide policies, strategies and interventions until transmission of the poliovirus was interrupted in the country,” adding that the other WHO field staff involved with elimination of tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases and hypertension control initiative were also significant resources.Singh added that “it is now time to use all your experience, knowledge and skills, with the same rigor and discipline that you showed while monitoring polio activities, to support districts with surveillance, contact tracing and containment activities.”           The WHO release said strengths of the NPSP team – surveillance, data management, monitoring and supervision, and responding to local situations and challenges – will be utilized to supplement efforts of National Centre for Disease Control, IDSP and Indian Council of Medical Research to strengthen COVID-19 surveillance.The NPSP team will also support in sharing information and best practices and help states and districts calibrate their response based on transmission scenarios and local capacities.The WHO field staff will continue to support immunization and surveillance and elimination of Tuberculosis and Neglected Tropical Diseases, Singh said, adding, “disease outbreaks can negatively impact progress in a range of areas, from maternal and child mortality to vaccine-preventable diseases and other treatable conditions. India had been making stupendous progress in these areas and we cannot afford for India's remarkable progress to be set back or reversed.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-welcomes-joint-efforts-with-india-to-fight-covid-19-71940

The Agriculture Ministry also formally launched the All India Agri Transport Call Centre Operations.To lend impetus to rural economy, industrial units in such areas, road construction, irrigation projects, MNREGA projects and operation of rural Common Service Centres (CSCs) have all been allowed.Officials say the government is actively engaged with stakeholders to address issues affecting the sector as strengthening farm/rural economy is the key to benefit a vast majority of India's population. It is also engaging with exporters of agri and allied commodities, to address various issues, they say.Majority of issues relate to availability and movement of labour, inter-state transport bottlenecks, shortage of raw material, phyto-sanitary certification, closure of courier services, freight services, access to ports/yards and clearance of goods for imports/exports. Issues relating to port and ocean freight services will also be resolved soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-guidelines-focus-on-agri-sector-rural-india-71759

FICCI director general Dilip Chenoy said since this period coincided with the harvesting of the rabi crop, the opening up of agriculture and allied sectors and the graded lifting of lockdown in key sectors would considerably alleviate hardship in rural areas.   While courier services and e-commerce offices are being allowed, the industry wants the government to look into home delivery of retail products such as electronics and other household items. CII director general Chandrajit Banerjee also felt the phased exit from lockdown provides a roadmap for economic restart after May 3.  “The resumption of construction of renewable energy projects is a welcome move. We will be utilising the opportunity well, while being extremely cautious at the same time,” said Sanjeev Aggarwal, CEO of Amplus Solar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/industry-hails-five-day-lead-time-to-open-units-71757

The first SCO summit via teleconferencing will be attended by the likes of Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Imran Khan and heads of four Central Asian countries all of which are in the grip of Covid in varying degrees. Sources expect the SCO to contribute more significantly than SAARC to information sharing, exchanging best practices and smoothening out medical aid bottlenecks because of the presence of world’s three major net providers of pharmaceuticals, medical expertise and equipment in India, Russia and China, respectively. Sources did not expect the current deep freeze in India-Pakistan ties to be an inhibiting factor for Islamabad’s participation.  Nepal, which by right should join the SCO as it is sandwiched between two members, may also get invited, thus brightening its chances of becoming a regular participant. For most countries, the SCO’s ability to provide a coordinated fiscal stimulus to the region is of great attraction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-looks-to-expand-covid-fight-via-sco-71756

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pointed out that now was “not the time” to be cutting resources for the WHO.“American taxpayers provide between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO. In contrast, China contributes $40 million a year and even less,” Trump said.“As the leading sponsor, the US has a duty to insist on full accountability.

Likewise, the Centre has asked states to ramp up testing and contact tracing in orange zone. The idea is to prevent these districts from turning red.The classification of districts is based on the scale of current disease burden in a given district and the rate at which the cases are doubling.The classification came on a day India’s cumulative burden rose to 11,933 cases with 392 deaths and 1,343 recoveries. The Centre said while cases were rising, the rate of recovery and discharge were improving with each passing day, with 270 people being cured yesterday. As of Wednesday, the rate of cure was 11.41 per cent.The 170 hotspot districts have further been divided into two sub-sets — 123 districts with large outbreaks and 47 districts with clusters. The second category is non-hotspot areas that are reporting cases.Of the 170 hotspot districts, 29 are in the region. Punjab currently has eight red and nine orange zone districts, while Haryana has six red and 12 orange zone districts. Chandigarh has been designated in the red zone.Himachal has five hotspot districts and JK eight. Five of J&K districts fall in orange zone. Ladakh has one hotspot district, Kargil.A major containment plan for red zone districts will involve complete closure of all educational, recreational and other activities. Each of these districts will have to have an entry and exit point with record of visitors being maintained and movement will only be allowed for essential services based on government passes.“In hotspots, districts will need the implementation of outbreak containment plan with entry and exit points. Districts where clusters of cases are noted will also have to follow containment measures. States also need to identify hotspots based on doubling the rate of confirmed cases. “This exercise of identification of hotspots has to be done every Monday.Red Zone Districts in RegionPunjab: SAS Nagar, SBS Nagar, Jalandhar, Pathankot; Mansa, Amritsar, Ludhiana, MogaHaryana: Nuh, Gurugram, Palwal, Faridabad, Ambala, Karnal ChandigarhJ&K: Srinagar, Bandipora, Baramulla, Jammu, Udhampur, Kupwara, Shopian, RajouriLadakh: KargilHimachal: Solan, Una, Sirmaur, Chamba, Kangra2 MN cases globallyThe number of Covid-19 cases worldwide passed the two-million mark on Wednesday.

More than 95 per cent of the 330 million population is under stay-at-home order amid a national emergency in place. A record number of over 16 million people have lost their jobs due to the ongoing economic crisis in the US, according to latest official figures.President Trump has named over 200 top American leaders from various industries and sections to create nearly a dozen and a half different groups as part of the Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups. These leaders will advise the president and offer recommendations on how to revive the American economy, which has hit an unprecedented ebb in just a few weeks due to the deadly coronavirus. “They’re the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. And they’re going to give us some ideas,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus on Tuesday.In addition to Pichai and Nadella, the president has named IBM’s Arvind Krishna and Micron’s Sanjay Mehrotra to the Tech Group.
