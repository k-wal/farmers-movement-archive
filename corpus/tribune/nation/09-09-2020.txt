Wei Fenghe on the margins of another SCO meet in Moscow last Friday apparently did not yield any tangible outcome.Government sources said a Brigade commander-level interaction took place between Indian and Chinese armies at a forward location along the LAC with an aim to check further escalation of tension and find ways to focus on implementing laid down protocols in management of the border.Both sides also exchanged messages on the hotline and even commanding officers of the two armies were in touch with each other, they said.However, the situation in the region remained “tense” with both sides maintaining aggressive posturing following the fresh face-off on Monday evening, the sources said.The latest incident was considered serious as the previous instance of shots being fired at the de-facto border was in 1975.Provisions of an agreement of 1996 and another inked in 2005 mandate the two sides not to use firearms during any confrontation.The sources had said Chinese troops carried rods, spears, clubs and pole weapons called ‘Guandao’ in aggressively trying to close in on an Indian position on Monday evening.Tensions escalated manifold along the LAC in eastern Ladakh after the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.The border situation deteriorated again after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions. China has strongly objected to India’s move. However, India has maintained that the heights are on its side of the LAC.The PLA has been eyeing to capture the strategic heights in the last three-four days, the government sources said, adding the Chinese troops also damaged an iron fence on Monday evening which was put up by Indian troops in the area.India continues to dominate strategic peaks around the southern bank of Pangong lake area overlooking key Chinese formations in the Moldo area.It has also rushed in additional troops and weapons to the sensitive region following China’s transgression attempts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-chinese-army-commanders-meet-use-hotline-to-cool-tensions-in-ladakh-138822

His family members found him missing from the home early this morning and his body was later found floating in a well in his village,” an officer in the district police office said.Asked if any suicide note was found, he told PTI “no note has been found yet, however, enquiries indicate that this is a suicide”.The body was sent to a government hospital for autopsy, he said.DMK President M K Stalin, expressing grief over the NEET aspirant’s suicide, said one more life has been lost over the national test.“When the merciless central government would stop the NEET. How many more lives should we lose?” he asked and appealed to the student community to face life boldly and give up suicidal tendencies.Tamil Nadu parties, including the ruling AIADMK, has been opposed to NEET on grounds that it went against social justice, the backward classes and interests of rural students who could not afford coaching classes.PMK founder leader S Ramadoss, expressing shock, said Vignesh was studious and his NEET score last year was 370.Though the youth got admission in a private medical college, his family, belonging to the Most Backward Classes, could not afford it, he said, adding hence, the boy was preparing to sit for the test this year too.“The central government has been saying that NEET is to upgrade the standard of medical education and prevent commercialisation of medical education.”“If it is true that the quality of medical education has been rising, many who scored much less than Vignesh in NEET must not have been allowed to join private medical colleges by pumping in loads of money,” Ramadoss said in a statement.Had admission been given based on Class 12 marks, the boy would have for sure got a placement in a medical college, he said.“The opportunity to join medical college must not have been denied to Vignesh just because he did not have money to join a medical college though he cleared the NEET,” Ramadoss said.The PMK top leader, an ally of the ruling AIADMK-led alliance in which the BJP is also a constituent, alleged NEET was being held only for private coaching institutions to indulge in profiteering.“If this situation continues, there is a threat of many students resorting to suicide every year due to fear and frustration over the NEET. To prevent this, the Centre should come forward to permanently scrap the NEET.Also, the Tamil Nadu government must provide a solatium of Rs 50 lakh to Vignesh’s family and a government job to one ofhis family members, the PMK leader appealed.Vignesh passed 12th standard two years ago and he was from Elanthankuzhi village in Ariyalur district.

09-09-2020||New Delhi||Reduce gap between rich and poor, taking care of world is taking care of ourselves: Dalai Lama||Nobel laureate the Dalai Lama on Wednesday called for reducing the gap between the rich and poor, saying it is important to realise that taking care of the world is actually taking care of ourselves.Addressing the third Laureates and Leaders for Children Summit on the Fair Share for Children, the Dalai Lama said children were the future.The Laureates and Leaders for Children is a coalition for ensuring child rights which is led by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi."The future is in our hands so the children are the main human beings who will take care of the world. Taking care of the world is actually taking care of yourselves," he said."Children are our future. We have to think of humanity and poor people who need help, and we need to make efforts on how to reduce the gap between poor and rich," he said.Apart from the Dalai Lama, the summit also saw participation from Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus among others.About the impact of COVID-19 on children, Lofven said this pandemic has put them in a more vulnerable situation in all parts of the world and in all sections of the society."Children are at an increased risk of physical, psychological and sexual abuse," he said.He called for policies to ensure that respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of the child are at the very core of the decision making."We must put human rights, democracy and rule of law at the core of our COVID-19 response. We must acknowledge the political role of children and young people in decision- making. Their voices are crucial in achieving a sustainable, peaceful and democratic future. I am a firm believer in international cooperation. I want to see an increase in our coordinated efforts so that we can ensure a fair, sustainable and democratic recovery from this pandemic," he said.Henrietta Fore, executive director of UNICEF, called COVID-19 a child rights crisis."Poverty is increasing, inequality is growing and the pandemic has exposed the fault lines of development in every country that continue to separate the haves and have nots," she said."Lockdowns are putting children at risk of child labour and child marriage and the pandemic has thrown over one billion children out of school but it is also showing us what we can do when we join forces to support children," she said.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, WHO, said children and adolescents are among the ones most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."In many countries immunization programmes and services have been partially or completely suspended, putting millions at risk and resulting in increase in child mortality and morbidity."The pandemic also threatens food security and nutrition of millions of children around the world. Due to school closure, some 368 million children have missed out on school meals. The increased hunger resulting from the pandemic could lead to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 children every month so what can we do about it," he said.Firstly, he said there is a need to ensure availability and access to essential services, including for immunization, nutrition, breastfeeding, mental health and social support."The countries that chose to reopen schools must do so by following guidance on how to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 while avoiding stigmatising those who may have been exposed to the virus. Countries must make every effort to ensure that children remain safe from abuse and maltreatment. We cannot continue to fail our young global citizens. The post-COVID recovery must have our children at the central focus; they are the most vital resource," he added.

Excellent talks that reflect our Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. Value our exchanges on the international situation,” Jaishankar tweeted.Last week, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met with his Russian counterpart Gen. Sergey Shoigu in Moscow during which he appreciated the “steadfast support” provided by Russia in response to the country’s defence and security needs.Singh, who was on a three-day visit to Russia to attend a crucial meeting of the SCO, pressed for expediting supply of a number of weapons systems, ammunition and spares to India by Russia under contracts which were concluded earlier.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar held separate bilateral meetings with his Kyrgyz and Tajik counterparts here and discussed ways to boost India’s strategic partnership with the two Central Asian countries.“A fruitful meeting with FM Chingiz Aidarbekov of Kyrgyz Republic on SCO sidelines,” Jaishankar tweeted after his first bilateral meeting of the day.The two leaders discussed issues of bilateral and regional interest.“Agreed to further enhance our strategic partnership in all spheres,” Jaishankar wrote.Jaishankar thanked Aidarbekov for the support in facilitating the return of Indian nationals from the Central Asian country. Air India operated several flights under Vande Bharat Mission to evacuate its nationals stranded in other nations due to lockdown.About 4,500 Indian students are studying medicine in various medical institutions in Kyrgyzstan. A few businessmen are engaged in trade and services in Kyrgyzstan, according to the Indian Embassy in Bishkek.Jaishankar later said he held a warm meeting with Tajik counterpart Sirojiddin Muhriddin.“Pleased with our growing bilateral and regional cooperation. Highly value this strategic partnership,” Jaishankar tweeted. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-meets-russian-counterpart-discusses-ways-to-enhance-bilateral-ties-138815
09-09-2020||London||Indian prisons, Nirav Modi's mental health in focus at UK extradition case||The prison conditions in India and Nirav Modi's fragile mental health were once again in focus during the diamond merchant's ongoing extradition hearing related to the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Wednesday.The third day of the five-day hearing, presided over by Justice Samuel Goozee, was devoted to the defence laying out further arguments against a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against Modi, who observed the court proceedings via live videolink from Wandsworth Prison in London where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year.The 49-year-old jeweller seemed particularly inanimate through most part of the day, with the judge at one point pausing the hearing to check if the videolink had frozen and asked Modi to keep moving from time to time so the court can be sure he is still connected to the proceedings.Modi's defence team, led by barrister Clare Montgomery, raised further issues around the conditions at Barrack 12 at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where he is to be lodged on being extradited, claiming it is covered in its entirety in a blue metallic cover since it housed a terrorist in 2007. This makes the barrack “incredibly hot”, with other problems such as damp, dust, insects and rodents, she quoted testimony as saying.Besides fears related to a COVID-19 outbreak earlier in the year, references were also made to a medical expert's “addendum report” which highlighted “much more serious” concerns around Modi's mental health.UK-based prisons expert Dr Alan Mitchell, who has previously given witness statements in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines boss Vijay Mallya, and the medical expert are among a set of defence witnesses scheduled to give live evidence in court over these issues later this week. They will be cross-examined by Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) barrister Helen Malcolm, who is arguing on behalf of the Indian Government.During Wednesday's hearing, Modi's defence team also claimed their client had been the subject of a “trial by media” and would not receive a fair trial in India.After the judge had turned down a defence request earlier this week to allow retired Indian High Court Judge Abhay Thipsay to give his videolink expert statement privately, his written statement was briefly presented in court to highlight assertions against the admissibility of certain evidence presented by the Government of India.Thipsay's testimony questions whether the statements provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) meet the “statutory requirements” under Indian law and raises doubts over whether certain alleged actions, such as the destruction of mobile phones, “amount to disappearance of evidence”.Modi is subject to two sets of criminal proceedings, the first brought by the CBI relating to a large-scale fraud said to have been committed upon PNB and the ED case, relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. A further extradition request was made in February this year of two additional offences of the disappearance of evidence and intimidating a witness.The CPS must establish a prima facie case against Modi to allow the judge to rule that he has a case to answer before the Indian courts. If the judge finds in favour of the Indian Government, the issue will go back to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to formally certify his extradition to India to stand trial.A ruling in the case is not expected before the end of this year or early next year, as a final submissions hearing has been tentatively scheduled for December 1.The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB, known as “letters of undertaking” (LoUs), which resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion.

09-09-2020||---||GST Council to meet over compensation controversy||New Delhi, September 9The GST Council will meet on Thursday to take a call on meeting the shortfall in GST compensation to states.With the expiry of the one-week deadline on Tuesday, the stand of only 17 of the 31 states is publicly known.While 10 states have turned down Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s two options for making good the shortfall, seven have indicated their agreement. The views of 14 states were not in public domain.In order to break down the resistance, the Centre has softened its stand and said it was committed to making good the entire shortfall of Rs 2.35 lakh crore.Under Sitharaman’s first option, GST related shortfall was estimated at Rs 97,000 crore and the rest was due to “hand of God” (Covid-related disruption). States accepting this option were given leeway to borrow more from the market.The second option gives the states the entire amount but further borrowing is conditional. However, the states also want the Centre to borrow from the RBI on their behalf.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-council-to-meet-over-compensation-controversy-138807
09-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||BMC’s action against Kangana gives BJP ammunition to fire at Sena||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 9The BMC’s action against Kangana Ranaut on Wednesday has given the BJP, which was forced to strategically distance itself from the actor following her tweets comparing Mumbai to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, a new stick to whip former ally Shiv Sena.Observers, in fact, are terming the civic body’s demolition drive against alleged illegal structures at Kangana’s office in Mumbai as “political blunder” which Sena could have easily turned into a “political advantage” by “ignoring” her.  Also read: 'Tujhe kya lagta hai...': Kangana Ranaut warns Uddhav Thackeray in video messageWhile the Sena is believed to have ordered the action to satisfy its angry cadres, the act has benefited the Maharashtra BJP which was feeling squeamish over some of Kangana’s recent tweets. Referring to the BMC's action, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said: “This has never happened in the history of Maharashtra.” Also read: Undue importance being given to Kangana’s remarks: PawarThe senior BJP leader, who had condemned Kangana’s remarks about the Mumbai Police in context of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, calling them an “insult” of the police force, on Wednesday said: “If there is an illegal construction, there should be action. But to act against someone because he or she has spoken against you is cowardice, a vengeful act which can never find support from anyone in Maharashtra.”Also read: Bombay High Court tells BMC to stop demolition work at Kangana’s bungalowSources admit Kangana could not have got her Y-Plus security cover without the blessings of the BJP leadership and the government. However, some of her comments, especially those about Mumbai and police, had put the state BJP in a rather piquant situation. The BMC has received widespread criticism, including from Sena’s current partners, over what happened on Wednesday in Mumbai. In those terms, the action has inadvertently given the BJP a fresh front against the Sena, with which it had a bitter parting after the last Assembly elections in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bmcs-action-against-kangana-gives-bjp-ammunition-to-fire-at-sena-138805
09-09-2020||Noida (UP)||Cabbie's killing: Noida police say not hate crime, transfer case to Bulandshahr||The Gautam Buddh Nagar police said Wednesday that the killing of a Delhi-based cab driver allegedly by the passengers on a highway in Greater Noida during a journey from Bulandshahr district was a criminal act and not a hate crime.They also said in a statement that the case was being transferred to Bulandshahr police as the matter related to that district.Aftab Alam, 45, died in Badalpur area Sunday night allegedly after he was attacked by unidentified people who boarded his cab from Bulandshahr, according to police.However, Alam's son Mohammed Sabir alleged his father was killed in a hate crime, citing an audio clip of a purported phone conversation with his father Sunday evening.In the audio clip, one of the cab passengers is heard saying “bol (say) Jai Shri Ram” to someone, with Sabir claiming it was his father who was asked to chant it.Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Noida, Harish Chander said the incident was a criminal act and did not have any communal angle as was being claimed.He said a worker at a CNG filling station was asked by one of the passengers to chant the slogan."It has emerged during investigation that the cab driver was not asked to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. It was said to somebody else. We have found that the cab had stopped at a filling station. A worker at the filling station had injuries on his hand. The passengers said something to indicate towards his injury mark. This can be heard in the audio clip as well," Chander said.“Then the passengers asked the worker how he got injured, to which they were told it was a birthmark. These passengers then offered to give him extra money, which the worker refused. This worker, who belongs to the majority community, was then asked by one of the passengers to chant 'Jai Shri Ram',” he added.The officer, who was supervising the probe, said the filling station worker confirmed the developments to police and also said that nothing of this sort was asked of the cab driver.“This clears that the death of the cab driver is an outcome of a criminal act and not related to communal angle,” DCP Chander said.After nearly three days, police are yet to identify the culprits.Officials earlier said Alam, who was found injured in his cab on a highway and died at a hospital later, had an argument over fare with the passengers.An FIR has been lodged at the Badalpur police station for murder, among other offences, and a probe is underway, police said.

09-09-2020||New Delhi||SC agrees to hear plea seeking to declare animal kingdom as legal entity||The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a plea which has raised the issue of cruelty on animals and sought to declare entire animal kingdom, including avian and aquatic species, as legal entities having a distinct persona with corresponding rights of a living person.While issuing notices to the Centre and others seeking their replies on the petition, which has also sought a direction to all the States and Union Territory (UTs) to take action if any case of cruelty on animals comes to light including on social media, the apex court said it is “very unlikely” that it would entertain the prayer for declaring them as legal entity.“We will issue notice but it is very unlikely that we will entertain the prayer for declaring them as legal entity,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice S  Bobde orally said during the hearing.“Issue notice,” the Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said in its order.Besides the Centre and some of its ministries, the plea has arrayed all the states, UTs, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and the Animal Welfare Board of India as party.During the hearing, the bench asked the counsel appearing for the petitioner: “Do you mean animals can sue or be sued? That is the meaning of legal entity. Is your dog equal to you?”To this, the counsel said that animals can be considered as equal to humans.The lawyer said when legal status can be given to a temple then why cannot such status be given to animals.“Animals are vulnerable and if we will grant them this status then they can be protected,” said the lawyer, representing petitioner NGO ‘People’s Charioteer Organization’.  The plea has said that NCRB should report and publish data and statistics relating to cruelty on animal and crimes against them in its annual report under separate head.It has sought directions to all the states and UTs to take appropriate steps for mandatory registration of FIR under relevant penal provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act, 1960, “whenever any incident of animal cruelty surfaces or comes to light on social media or otherwise”.The plea has also sought a direction to the Centre to form an independent committee monitored by the apex court and consisting of members from all relevant departments and ministries, which can review the entire legal framework in order to curb the menace of cruelty against animals.While referring to recent reported incidents of cruelty on animals in the country, the plea has said that such incidents have enraged many and raised a question as to whether existing laws are sufficient enough to protect animals from possible abuse and cruelty.It alleged the rights of animals exist only on paper due to their lack of implementation and enforcement.The plea said that legal status has been accorded to animals in two recent verdicts rendered by the Punjab and Haryana High Court and the Uttarakhand High Court.

09-09-2020||New Delhi||SC grants bail to 21 PFI members in violence case during anti-CAA protests||The Supreme Court Wednesday granted bail to 21 members of Popular Front of India (PFI) accused of indulging in violence at Mangaluru on December 19 last year during anti-CAA protests, resulting in the death of two persons.The top court had earlier granted stay on bail granted to the protesters on the appeal filed by Karnataka government against the High Court order.A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde, A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said that the applicants be released on bail on the condition that they will not participate in any violent activities or meetings.“Having regard to the observation of the High Court that it was not possible to prima facie determine the presence of the accused persons at the spot and without treating the said observation as final finding of the fact, we consider it appropriate to direct that the applicants be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs 25,000 each to the satisfaction of the trial court..,” the bench said.The top court imposed two conditions for the bail that the accused shall report to the nearest police station on every alternative Monday and that “they shall ensure that they do not participate in any violent activities/meetings”.It said, “We make it clear that the observations of the High Court on question of fact and law are obviously made prima facie and shall not affect the trial”.On March 6, the top court had issued notice to the accused after taking note of the appeal filed by the Karnataka government against the grant of bail by the high court and granted an ad-interim stay on its operation.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state government, had earlier assailed the high court order saying that as many as 56 policemen got injured during the violent protests.“The rioters attacked the police station and set it ablaze,” the law officer had said, adding that two persons died during those violent protests.The High Court, while granting bail, had said that the records produced indicate that the “identity of the accused involved in the alleged incident appear to have been fixed on the basis of their affiliation to PFI and they being members of the Muslim community”.Two persons received bullet injuries in police firing and later succumbed at a hospital on December 19 last year as protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act turned violent in Mangaluru.Police had lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to baton charge and fired in the air to disperse anti-CAA protesters in Mangaluru, as thousands of demonstrators had hit the streets in many cities and towns across Karnataka on December 19 last year defying prohibitory orders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-grants-bail-to-21-pfi-members-in-violence-case-during-anti-caa-protests-138797

09-09-2020||Amaravati/New Delhi||First Kisan Rail from South India chugs off with fruits to Delhi||Connecting the farms to the agricultural markets, the first ‘Kisan Rail’ from south India chugged off from Anantapuramu on Wednesday carrying 322 tonnes of fresh fruits to the famous Azadpur Mandi in the national Capital.Union Minister for Agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy flagged off the inaugural Kisan Rail, the second in the country, via a video link from New Delhi and Amaravati.This train, loaded with 14 parcel vans, will cover a distance of 2,150 km in 40 hours.Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, Anantapuramu MP T Rangaiah, South Central Railway General Manager Gajanan Mallya, Anantapuramu district Collector Gandham Chandrudu, Guntakal Railway Division Manager Alok Tiwari and others joined the event.The Kisan Rail comes as a boon to farmers, particularly those growing horticultural crops, as it ensures the produce reaches the markets in quicker time.“In Anantapuramu, fruits and vegetables are being grown in more than 2 lakh hectare area, and the Kisan Rail will prove very beneficial to farmers of this region.Kisan Udaan service will also be started soon,” Tomar said at the inaugural event.On August 7, the first Kisan Rail was flagged off between Devlali in Maharashtra and Danapur in Bihar as a weekly service, which was later made bi-weekly due to increasing demand.Now the second Kisan Rail will benefit farmers of the states coming en route, he said.Kisan Rail and Kisan Udaan had been announced in this year’s budget so that farm produce is able to be transported all over the country in less time, an official statement quoted Tomar as having said in the virtual event.Tomar also appreciated the implementation of the new agriculture ordinances and the Rs 1 lakh crore Agri Infrastructure Fund in Andhra Pradesh.Noting that horticulture was an important activity in the state, the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister said the state ranks first in the country in the production of tomatoes, coconut, papaya and chillies and is the biggest fruit producing state in South India.“During the Covid-19 situation, transportation of this horticultural produce to North India had become difficult.A number of special trains were run from Anantapuramu to Mumbai during the lockdown so that the horticultural produce could reach other parts of the country,” he said.Union Minister of State for Railways said Kisan Rail is being started to help in the speedy transportation of farm produce to distant places, in keeping with the goal of doubling farmers’ income.“Farmers can now sell their produce wherever they get a better price without spoilage due to reduction in transportation time.This facility will also help in increasing agricultural exports,” he added.On the benefits of Kisan Rail, Collector Chandrudu told PTI: “This gives immense benefits to the farmers in many ways.Huge quantities can be transported in one go, the transportation time is reduced, costs are cut and transportation losses will also be minimal.”In the existing system of transportation through trucks, post-harvest losses of about 25 per cent were causing a loss of about Rs 300 crore a year to the farmers.“We can now eliminate this as shipment through train will keep the product intact and fetch a premium price.Besides erasing the loss of Rs 300 crore (due to transportation damages), farmers can also stand to gain Rs 400 crore per annum by realising a premium price on their produce,” Chandrudu noted.Though otherwise a parched district, Anantapuramu is considered the ‘fruit bowl of Andhra Pradesh,’ where the cropped area under horticulture is 2.02 lakh hectares, yielding an output of 58.39 lakh tonnes per annum of various fruits and vegetables.While consumption of fruits and vegetables within the state is only around six lakh tonnes, the rest is marketed across the country and abroad.“Sweet orange, banana, mango, papaya, pomegranate and melons are our major produce that have a good market in Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, UP, West Bengal, Gujarat and Karnataka.Our tomato, grapes, pomegranate, sweet orange and banana are exported to Bangladesh, Nepal and Middle East countries,” Chandrudu said.The Kisan Rail is planned to be run once a week now but as harvesting picks up after October, the frequency may be increased from January based on the demand. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-kisan-rail-from-south-india-chugs-off-with-fruits-to-delhi-138790

Rhea is a Bengalee Brahmin lady, justice to actor sushant rajput should not be interpreted as a justice to Bihari."Father of Rhea is also entitled to demand justice for his kids, trial by media is an ominous portent for our judicial system. Justice for all is one of the basic tenets of our constitution," he said in a series tweets.He said Rajput was an Indian actor, but the "BJP turned him into a Bihari actor, only to score electoral brownie points"."Rhea Chakroborty has been indicted not for abetment of suicide nor murder nor any economic offences, she has been arrested under NDPS, ludicrous."To please the Political Masters Central agencies have played their roles, after churning the sea they have discovered drugs instead of nectar. Still, they are groping in the dark to identify who is the murderer," he added.After three days of interrogation, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday arrested Chakraborty, 28, in a drugs case linked to Rajput's death, following which she was sent to judicial custody till September 22 by a local court.She was shifted to Byculla jail in Mumbai on Wednesday after the NCB said it did not want her custody.The court earlier rejected Chakraborty's bail application.

09-09-2020||Mumbai||‘Black day’ for Marathas: Maharashtra BJP after SC stays quota law||It is a “black day” for Marathas, the Maharashtra BJP said on Wednesday as it attacked the MVA government in the state after the Supreme Court stayed implementation of 2018 law granting quota to the community in education and jobs.State BJP president Chandrakant Patil claimed that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, was “not serious” in ensuring that the quota held its ground before the apex court.He also charged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP president Sharad Pawar with not paying attention to the matter.The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the implementation of the law, but made it clear that the status of those who have availed of the benefits will not be disturbed.A three-judge bench headed by Justice L N Rao referred to a larger constitution bench, to be set up by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, the batch of pleas questioning the validity of the law granting reservation to Marathas.“The MVA could not ensure the reservation held ground before the Supreme Court,” Patil told reporters here.Noting that the apex court referred the batch of pleas challenging the validity of the law to a larger bench, Patil said now nobody knows when the ruling in the matter will come.Patil contended that matters referred to larger bench in the past have remained pending for years.“This means the stay will continue till the bench gives an order. Now there is no point in the community protesting either, because nobody knows when the ruling will come. Therefore, it is a black day for the community,” the BJP leader said.He said his party had repeatedly told the MVA government to take the issue seriously and prepare well legally for the same.“The MVA did not want the reservation. Which senior leader of theirs paid attention to the matter? Did Uddhav ji or Sharad Pawar pay attention?” he asked.“There is a scope to say now that their mindset was such that they were fine if the quota was stayed as they were not serious to ensure it holds ground,” Patil added.Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said in a statement that following the court stay on the implementation of the quota, the efforts taken by the previous government he led for the “all-round development” of the community have been “undone”.“The (MVA) government could have kept the quota intact had it taken steps by taking everyone into confidence. But this government has not been serious about the issue from the beginning,” he alleged.Fadnavis said the BJP stands with the community in its every battle for quota and added it will make all efforts for its upliftment.Party MP Narayan Rane accused the state government of not willing to give the quota to the community.“They did not appoint any renowned lawyer to contest their case as they were not willing to give the quota. They appointed two ordinary lawyers.“The lawyers fell short of keeping forth the quota side and ensuring it remains intact. The state government is completely responsible for it,” he alleged.The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 was enacted to grant reservation to people of the Maratha community in Maharashtra in jobs and education.The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June last year, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and said the quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions.The politically dominant Maratha community, which constitutes over 30 per cent of the state’s population, held several protests in the past demanding reservation in jobs and education. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/black-day-for-marathas-maharashtra-bjp-after-sc-stays-quota-law-138786

If DCGI has any safety concerns, we will adhere to their instructions and abide by the standard protocols,” Poonawala said indicating a hold on trials.We (Serum Institute of India), were going by DCGI's direction and were not instructed to pause the trials. If DCGI has any safety concerns, we will adhere to their instructions and abide by the standard protocols. pic.twitter.com/u0yaGAU0Eo  Poonawala’s statement came hours after he earlier said the Indian trials would go on and that the UK trials had been paused for review and would restart soon.Top sources in drug controller’s office said the Serum Institute had been asked to furnish an explanation as early as possible as to why should vaccine trial permission granted on August 2 not be suspended in the interest of patient safety.DCGI VG Somani issued the notice. Vaccine trial currently in phase 2 was to enter phase 3 next week.In his notice DCGI cited the suspension of AstraZeneca vaccine candidate trials in the US, UK, Brazil and South Africa after a participant in the UK trial developed a serious neurological illness which is being investigated for its source.“Whereas, Serum Institute Pune till now has not informed the central licensing authority regarding pausing the clinical trial carried out by AstraZeneca in other countries and also not submitted casualty analysis of the reported serious adverse event with the investigational vaccine for the continuation of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the subject vaccine in the country, in light of the safety concerns, DCGI gives you an opportunity to show cause under Rule 30 of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, as to why the permission granted to you for phase 2, 3 human clinical trials on August 2 should not be suspended till patient safety is established?” the notice said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-follow-dcgi-poonawala-after-drug-controller-show-causes-serum-institute-for-suspension-of-covid-vaccine-trial-138782
09-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||TDP demands CBI inquiry damage to temple properties||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, September 9 Telugu Desam Party national president and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has condemned “about 20 attacks” on places of worship of different religions across Andhra Pradesh under the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) rule.He has demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to find who is behind these attacks and to nab the culprits. Naidu, in a series of comments on Twitter, referred to how sacred chariots of temples were burnt to ashes while priests were coming under attack even as the propagation of other religions was being allowed under the present management of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). Even the historic Simhachalam Temple Board was illegally taken over, he has alleged. Blaming this on what he called “egoistic and tyrannical” attitude of the ruling YSRCP, Naidu said only a CBI probe can reveal who the culprits were and can lead to justice. Naidu asserted that AP has been a progressive, pluralistic State where all faiths have thrived and co-existed peacefully. However, of late more than 20 attacks have taken place on religious places. He said there seemed to be a pattern in the occurrence of continuous attacks on different faiths. From charring of sacred chariots at Antarvedi and Bitragunta to the idols being demolished at Pithapuram, there appears to be a pattern in these incidents. There were also attacks on priests like in the Devarampadu incident.  It may be recalled that the latest burning of a chariot at Antarvedi Lakshminarasimha Swamy Temple had caused widespread unrest. The TDP had already sent a committee of its leaders who urged for a judicial enquiry to bring out the facts behind the chariot burning. The Opposition has been agitating with the authorities not yet resolving the mystery behind the fire. He said people were concerned about the propagation of other religions under the management of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. On the other hand, there was illegal take-over of the Simhachalam temple board. In all these aspects, there seems to be a pattern. As a responsible Opposition party, the TDP was demanding a CBI inquiry into all these incidents and attacks under the present regime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tdp-demands-cbi-inquiry-damage-to-temple-properties-138780
09-09-2020||New Delhi||UAE, India should have open sky policy instead of service agreement: Envoy||The UAE and India should have an open sky policy instead of an air service agreement between them, the Gulf nation's Ambassador to India Ahmed Al Banna said on Wednesday, asserting that such a move would benefit airlines of both countries.The UAE is India's trusted partner and its investment commitment is a testimony of its confidence in the economic growth story of India, Al Banna said at a webinar.The UAE is the largest Arab investor in India having a share of about 85 per cent of the total Arab investment in the country, he said."There exists immense untapped growth potential in many different sectors. The UAE wants to be the preferred economic partner of India, and we want to work closely with India to improve on many different levels," Al Banna said at the webinar organised by Vijay Jolly, President of the Delhi Study Group.One of the most important aspects is the improvement of air connectivity which is yet another important economic growth catalyst that facilitates trade and tourism, he said."We have 1,068 flights between the UAE and India. More than 50 or 55 per cent of Indians who travel outside India, they use Dubai and Abu Dhabi as their transit points," he said."We need to look into having what we call an open sky policy, instead of having an air service agreement, which is limited in terms of capacity, in the number of seats," Al Banna said.Calling for a rethink on the issue, the UAE envoy said the two sides should look for a stronger collaboration wherein both Indian and UAE airlines would benefit.An open sky air service agreement allows for airlines from the two countries to have an unlimited number of flights as well as seats to each other's jurisdictions.The National Civil Aviation Policy, 2016, allows the government to enter into an 'open sky' air services agreement on a reciprocal basis with SAARC nations as well as countries beyond a 5,000-kilometre radius from New Delhi.India has signed open sky agreements with the US, Greece, Jamaica, Guyana, Finland, Spain and Sri Lanka, among other countries.

09-09-2020||Dehradun||13-million-year-old fossil ape discovered in Uttarakhand||An international team of researchers has unearthed a 13-million-year-old fossil of a newly discovered ape species in Uttarakhand, which is the earliest known ancestor of the modern-day gibbon.The finding, published in the journal ‘Proceedings of the Royal Society B’, fills a major void in the ape fossil record and provides important new evidence about when the ancestors of today's gibbon migrated to Asia from Africa.The fossil, a complete lower molar, belongs to a previously unknown genus and species (Kapi ramnagarensis), and represents the first new fossil ape species discovered at the famous fossil site of Ramnagar in nearly a century.The researchers, including those from Arizona State University in the US and Panjab University in Chandigarh, were climbing a small hill in an area where a fossil primate jaw had been found the year before.While pausing for a short rest, the team spotted something shiny in a small pile of dirt on the ground."We knew immediately it was a primate tooth, but it did not look like the tooth of any of the primates previously found in the area," said Christopher C Gilbert, from City University of New York."From the shape and size of the molar, our initial guess was that it might be from a gibbon ancestor, but that seemed too good to be true, given that the fossil record of lesser apes is virtually nonexistent,” Gilbert noted.He explained that there were other primate species known during that time, and no gibbon fossils have previously been found anywhere near Ramnagar.Since the fossil's discovery in 2015, years of study, analysis, and comparison were conducted to verify that the tooth belongs to a new species, as well as to accurately determine its place in the ape family tree, said the researchers.The molar was photographed and CT-scanned, and comparative samples of living and extinct ape teeth were examined to highlight important similarities and differences in dental anatomy, they said."What we found was quite compelling and undeniably pointed to the close affinities of the 13-million-year-old tooth with gibbons," said Alejandra Ortiz, from Arizona State University, who is part of the research team."Even if, for now, we only have one tooth, and thus, we need to be cautious, this is a unique discovery. It pushes back the oldest known fossil record of gibbons by at least five million years, providing a much-needed glimpse into the early stages of their evolutionary history," said Ortiz.The researchers noted that the age of the fossil, around 13 million years old, is contemporaneous with well-known great ape fossils.This provides evidence that the migration of great apes, including orangutan ancestors, and lesser apes from Africa to Asia happened around the same time and through the same places, they said."I found the biogeographic component to be really interesting," said Chris Campisano from Arizona State University."Today, gibbons and orangutans can both be found in Sumatra and Borneo in Southeast Asia, and the oldest fossil apes are from Africa."Knowing that gibbon and orangutan ancestors existed in the same spot together in northern India 13 million years ago, and may have a similar migration history across Asia, is pretty cool," Campisano added.

He then checked in at the Dumdum guest house where the police zeroed in on him.He was tracked through GPRS on his mobile and the police confirmed his role in the incident after checking the registration number of his car, job profile, social media activities and other details, the officer said.Initially the victim had mentioned the name of Pandey as Abhisek Bose in her complaint which caused delay in tracking him, the officer said.The woman was Pandey's friend and had dinner with him at a restaurant before she was allegedly molested, the officer said.Pandey, in his early 30s, had also knocked down Nilanjana Chatterjee when she was trying to stop his vehicle from speeding away and save the molestation victim who was pushed off the car in Anandapur area.The braveheart was returning home with her husband in their car when they heard the victim, sitting beside Pandey in another vehicle behind them, crying for help.Chatterjee's husband had stopped their vehicle to block the path of the other car.His wife was seriously injured when Pandey hit her with his car in his bid to flee.She underwent surgery in a private hospital on Monday.Commissioner of Kolkata Police, Anuj Sharma, on Tuesday commended Chatterjee who risked her life to save another lady from being molested inside a moving car, and informed her that the government has decided to bear the cost of her treatment.

09-09-2020||New Delhi||NEP 2020: Civil society representatives say, "Education should be under State List"||After a recent "Governors Conference on the Role of NEP in Transforming Higher Education", a group of educationalists and civil society representatives have urged the Tamil Nadu government to take "necessary measures to bring back education subject under the State List in the Consitution of India."The Non-NDA states like Kerala and West Bengal had previously registered objections to the National Educational Policy (NEP) 2020.  Currently, Education is in the concurrent list, and according to the memorandum addressed to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister by the People-First Movement "representing various fields and interest", and "implementation of NEP 2020 will usurp the Constitutional right, and duty of State/UT governments to frame its own policies, and programmes or enact laws concerning education, as per the needs and aspirations of the people of the state."People-First Movement, Chairman, MG Devasahayam, said: "NEP is being pursued with without Parliamentary mandate, and any meaningful consultation or discussion with the State governments”. “As is known, originally education was a state subject in the Constitution. In 1976 (during Emergency) by 42nd Constitution Amendment, it was shifted to the Concurrent List (List III under Article 246). NEP 2020 demolishes the Federal Character of India by promoting Centralization by controlling all decision-making from ‘ECCE and Primary Education to Higher Education (including Professional Education)’. This cannot be countenanced,” said the memorandum.  “NEP 2020 was released after the approval of the Union Cabinet. It was not placed in the Parliament. Implementation of NEP 2020 would require new Parliamentary Legislations with the concurrence of the States/UTs,” it adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nep-2020-civil-society-representatives-say-education-should-be-under-state-list-138759

Both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha are regarded as the Presiding Officer and Vice Presiding Officer of the House.”He said already a year has elapsed since the 17th Lok Sabha was constituted yet there was no Deputy Speaker.“Rajya Sabha has been on the verge of electing Deputy Chairman of upper house. It is an opportune moment to elect the Deputy Speaker of lower house. I would urge upon you that during monsoon season itself the Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha must be elected.

The number of legislators involved is more than total number of cases since there are more than one accused in one case, and the same legislator is an accused in more than one case. There are 413 cases in respect of offences, which are punishable with imprisonment for life, out of which in 174 cases sitting MPs/MLAs are accused,” the affidavit stated.The Supreme Court had on March 5 directed High Courts to furnish information regarding pending cases of MPs and MLAs in a prescribed format to Amicus Curiae who was asked to compile it and make submissions for expeditious disposal of these cases.Trial of 352 cases had been stayed by High Court and the Supreme Court while a large number of cases were pending at appearance stage and even non bailable warrants issued against the accused had not been executed, it pointed out.The Supreme Court had in 2015 directed that the trial in cases against sitting and ex-lawmakers should be conducted on a daily basis and concluded in one year from the date of the framing of charge(s).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/35-sitting-and-ex-legislators-in-punjab-face-criminal-cases-sc-told-138753
09-09-2020||New Delhi||Harivansh files nomination as NDA candidate to RS deputy chairman post; likely to get elected||JD(U) MP Harivansh on Wednesday filed his nomination as the ruling NDA candidate to the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman's post and is likely to be elected, even as the opposition is working to field a joint candidate against him to force a contest. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance's tally stands at 116 in the 245-member House, which has an effective strength of 244, and its senior leaders have expressed confidence that non-NDA parties like Biju Janta Dal, YSR Congress, Telangana Rashtra Samithi, which has nine, six and seven members respectively, will back Harivansh. BJP's floor managers believe that he will get support of around 140 MPs in case of a contest.  Harivansh filed his nomination in presence of Leader of Rajya Sabha Thawarchand Gehlot and BJP ally SAD leader Naresh Gujral. BJP president J P Nadda and LJP's Ram Vilas Paswan are among his proposers. The election to the Deputy Chairman post will be held on September 14, the first day of Parliament's monsoon session, which will end on October 1.September 11 is the last day of filing of nomination. Harivansh was the last person holding the post as well and the end of his Rajya Sabha term caused the vacancy. He was elected to the House from Bihar recently. With the Congress favouring putting up a joint opposition candidate for the Deputy Chairman post, a contest is on cards.Harivansh had comfortably defeated B K Hariprasad of the Congress in the 2018 election to the post, bagging 125 votes to his rival's 105.The NDA has since then further strengthened its presence in Rajya Sabha, with a disjointed opposition weakened further by its dwindling numbers unable to put up any strong obstacle in the government's legislative agenda in the House. On Tuesday, the Congress in its parliamentary strategy group meeting decided not let the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman's post go uncontested and favoured putting up a joint candidate for the entire opposition.The decision was taken at the meeting chaired by the party chief Sonia Gandhi.The sources said the party may offer the deputy chairman's post to its ally DMK, and Tiruchi Siva is among the candidates being considered. In case the DMK does not contest, the Congress will field its own candidate as it does not want the post to go uncontested.

When you announced a lockdown without a notice, you attacked them. The Prime Minister said the fight will be for 21 days, the backbone of the unorganized sector broke in 21 days,” Gandhi said adding that the COVID lockdown proved to be a death sentence for the poor.अचानक किया गया लॉकडाउन असंगठित वर्ग के लिए मृत्युदंड जैसा साबित हुआ।वादा था 21 दिन में कोरोना ख़त्म करने का, लेकिन ख़त्म किए करोड़ों रोज़गार और छोटे उद्योग।मोदी जी का जनविरोधी 'डिज़ास्टर प्लान' जानने के लिए ये वीडियो देखें। pic.twitter.com/VWJQ3xAqmGHe said when it was time to open after the lockdown, Congress told the government several times that helping the poor was essential.“A scheme like NYAY will have to be implemented, money needs to be directly deposited in bank accounts. But they didn’t do it. We suggested that for small and medium businesses, you should prepare a package. They need to be saved. Without this money they will not be able to survive, but the government did nothing,” said Gandhi adding that instead of the government waived off taxes worth lakhs of crores of the "richest fifteen-twenty people".He said the lockdown was not an attack on coronavirus, it was an attack on the poor of India, on the future of the youth, on labourers, farmers and small shopkeepers and on the unorganised sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-lockdown-proved-a-death-sentence-for-unorganised-sector-rahul-138736

09-09-2020||New Delhi||Unnao rape case: CBI cites lapses, recommends 'appropriate action' against four officials||The CBI has recommended “appropriate action” against four officials, including an IAS officer, citing lapses in handling the case of rape of a minor girl by former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, officials said Wednesday.The central agency, in its letter to the UP Government in August, has named the then DM Unnao and IAS officer Aditi Singh, the then Superintendent of Police and IPS officers Pushpanjali Devi and Neha Pandey posted in Unnao between 2017 and 2018 besides ASP Ashtbhuja Singh who was promoted to IPS in 2019, they said.In its letter, the agency has underlined lapses in handling the rape case of the minor at Sengar’s residence in Makhi village, Bangarmau, Unnao by the MLA and subsequent harassment of the family by his henchmen, they said.                The CBI has not sought any disciplinary action instead it has only highlighted the lapses under these officers and left it on the Uttar Pradesh Government to take “appropriate action” in the light of the agency’s observations, they said.Aditi Singh, a 2009-batch IAS officer, is presently the DM of Hapur. She was posted as DM, Unnao between January 24, 2017, and October 25, 2017, and the victim had written a number of letters to her about the trauma suffered by her at the hands of the powerful ruling party MLA but no substantial action was taken, they said.Neha Pandey, a 2009-batch IPS officer, is presently posted as Assistant Director in the Intelligence Bureau. She was the Superintendent of Police in Unnao between February, 2016 and October, 2017 and allegedly ignored plea of minor girl who was raped in June, 2017, they said.Pushpanjali Devi, a 2006 batch IPS officer and presently DIG railways, succeeded Pandey and remained SP in the district till April 30, 2018. She also allegedly did not pay any heed to prayers of the victim whose father was also framed in an arms act case and was beaten to death in the jail in April, 2018, they said.The then ASP Ashtbhuja Singh, now posted as Commandant PAC Fatehpur, was also posted in Unnao during the period but allegedly did not take adequate action on the complaints against Sengar, they said. Last year in December, a Delhi court had convicted Sengar for raping the minor girl in Unnao in 2017 saying the victim’s testimony was “truthful and unblemished” against a “powerful person”.The court had sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment for rape under the Indian Penal Code and the POCSO Act for offence of a public servant committing penetrative sexual assault against child.Convicting Sengar, 53, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the court had said the CBI proved that the victim was a minor.“I found her statement truthful and unblemished that she was sexually assaulted. She was under threat, worried. She is a village girl, not from cosmopolitan educated area... Sengar was powerful person. So she took her time..,” the judge had said.The court had noted that after the victim wrote letter to the UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, several criminal cases were filed against her family and “imprints of Sengar” were visible in them.

09-09-2020||Bhopal||Efforts on for online delivery platform for street vendors: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said efforts are being made to provide an online delivery platform to street food vendors on the lines of big restaurants.After a virtual interaction with beneficiaries of the PM Street Vendors’ Aatmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme from Madhya Pradesh, Modi praised the state government for ensuring the scheme’s benefits to over lakh people and providing identity cards to over 4.5 lakh people (scheme beneficiaries) in just two months.The Union government had launched the PM SVANidhi scheme on June 1 to help poor street vendors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resume livelihood activities.“I congratulate those who are moving ahead with the SVANidhi Yojna. It is a big thing to provide benefits of the scheme to over one lakh street vendors and providing identity cards to over 4.5 lakh such people. Other states must take inspiration from Madhya Pradesh,” Modi said.After his interaction with the street vendors, Modi in a televised address said, “A scheme has been prepared to provide an online platform to street food vendors by using technology. This means, the street food vendors will be able to make online delivery like big restaurants. Efforts are being made to provide this kind of facility.”          He told the street vendors that if they come forward, the government will take this effort further.The prime minister also urged the street vendors to adopt the digital payment system on a large scale.“The use of digital payment has increased during the past three-four years. Its importance was realised during the corona (COVID-19 outbreak) period. Now customers avoid making payment in cash and pay directly through mobile phone,” he said.Appealing street vendors to come forward to adopt the digital system, Modi said, “A new beginning has been made by the banks and digital payment system providers.”   Modi told the street vendors that representatives of banks and such organisations will reach out to them, provide the QR code and inform them about its use.“I appeal to them (street vendors) to use digital payment more and present an example before the world,”he said.He said the government will make efforts to ensure that street vendors in all big cities of the state get benefit of the PM SVANidhi scheme.“Whenever there is a pandemic, it hits the poor brothers and sisters hard. They always suffer whether it is excessive heat, rainfall or cold and these create problems for their employment and food, Modi said.“They (the poor) faced it the most during the pandemic and were even were forced to return to their native places.The government has realised this and tried to help them as much as possible by providing them ration and creating employment opportunities,” he said.The government launched the PM SVANidhi scheme with easy rules so that they can get rid of paying interest on loans which they used to take from private lenders.“You are getting a rebate of seven per cent in interest in these loans (under the scheme). If you repay to the bank on time, you will get more facilities. If you make digital transaction, you will get rewarded for it and you get more loan next time, he said.Referring to attempts made earlier to remove poverty, Modi said, “In our country, a lot has been talked about the poor. But in the last six years, everything has been done in a planned manner. Steps have been taken, which were not taken earlier, like the Jan Dhan Yojna under which 40 crore bank accounts of poor people were opened.”These people are getting loans and are liberated from the clutches of money lenders. Farmers are getting assistance directly, he mentioned.He also said that soon villages will also be associated with online marketing platforms.“On August 15, we took a vow to connect all villages with the optical fibre network in next 1,000 days. People will also get digital health identity cards for getting health facilities in rural areas also,” he said.Earlier, he interacted with some beneficiaries of the PM SVANidhi scheme, including street vendor Chaganlal and his wife from Sanver in Indore district, Gwalior’s Archana Sharma and vegetable vendor Dalchand in Raisen district.Modi advised Chaganlal how to enhance his business by asking customers to return the pipe used in making broomsticks to reduce the cost of making a broomstick.Chaganlal also told Modi that he wanted to enhance his business. After spotting a plastic water bottle kept behind Chaganlal’s chair, Modi advised him to use an earthen pitcher instead of a single-use plastic bottle for drinking water to save the environment.Modi also asked him about the Ujjwala Yojna and how it benefited his family.Interacting with Archana Sharma from Gwalior, Modi asked whether she would serve him ‘tikki’ (patties) that she sells at her joint. He also asked her about the SVANidhi scheme and how it benefitted her.He also asked her if she was aware of the Ayushman Bharat health care scheme, to which she said her husband was getting treatment through this scheme only. Modi also interacted with her husband Rajendra Sharma.Talking to vegetable vendor Dalchand from Sanchi in Raisen district, Modi praised him for using the QR code digital platform for receiving payments. He also suggested him ways to improve his vegetable business.After the interaction, Modi also informed street vendors about the ‘one nation one ration card’ scheme to make things easier for people.The prime minister also cautioned people about the threat of COVID-19 until its vaccine is developed, and advised them to follow guidelines like wearing masks and maintaining two-yard distance.

09-09-2020||New Delhi||SC asks airlines to spell out stand on refund for tickets booked during Lockdown 1, 2||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked airlines to spell out their stand on a full refund of money to passengers for air tickets booked during lockdown 1 & 2 when air travel was banned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked the airlines to respond in 10 days to the Centre's affidavit that said passengers were entitled to a full refund for air tickets booked during Lockdown 1 & 2 and posted the matter for further hearing on September 23.The Bench said the Centre may also file an additional affidavit clarifying its position on the issues raised during the hearing, particularly with regard to refund for flights cancelled after the resumption of operations post lockdown.Major airlines such as Indigo, GoAir, Vistara, Spicejet, Air Asia were represented by various senior advocates, including Mukul Rohatgi and Harish Salve, Arvind Datar and Pinaki Mishra while Air Passengers' Association was represented by senior advocate Aryana Sundaram.The top court is seized of a PIL filed by Pravasi Legal Cell demanding full automatic refund of money for tickets booked for flights during the COVID-19 lockdown.The Supreme Court had on June 12 issued notices to the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on the PIL.“If the tickets have been booked during the first lockdown period, i.e. 25th of March, 2020 to 14th of April, 2020 for the journeys to be undertaken in both first and second lockdown period i.e. from 25th of March, 2020 to 3rd of May, 2020, in all such cases, a full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately,” the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said regarding domestic airlines’ tickets booked directly by the passenger with airlines.Similarly, for international travel when the ticket has been booked on an Indian carrier and the booking is ex-India, it said, “If the tickets have been booked during the lockdown period for travel within the lockdown period, in all such cases full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately. This amount shall be passed on immediately by the Agent to the passengers, as the case may be.”This was being mandated as the airlines were not supposed to book such tickets during the first and second lockdown, it added.“For all other cases, the airlines shall all endeavour to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days,” it said in its affidavit filed last week.However, the affidavit said, “If on account of financial distress, if the airlines are not able to do so they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected. This credit shell shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket.”“The passenger shall be able to consume the credit shell up to 31st March 2021 on any route of his choice. If the passenger wants to buy a ticket of value more than the credit shell, then he can use cash to top it up. If he wants to buy a ticket of value less than the credit shell, he/she can do so and the balance amount of credit shell shall be available to him/her,” the affidavit read.As one of the advocates on Wednesday suggested that the credit shell should go to the tour operator instead of the passenger, the Bench shot back, "It is the passenger who paid the money. Why should the credit shell go to the operator?"The petitioner NGO had said both domestic and international airlines were violating the Ministry's order which obliged them to fully refund the amount for tickets cancelled on account of COVID19 lockdown.Pointing out that instead of a full refund, airlines were providing a credit shell, valid up to one year, the PIL had submitted that failure to refund the full amount collected for tickets owing to cancellation of flights due to restrictions imposed by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 violated DGCA's Civil Aviation Requirement, 2008.It had referred to the Ministry's April 16 Office Memorandum (OM) which directed all airline operators to refund the full amount collected for all tickets booked during the first phase of the lockdown between March 25 and April 14 both for domestic and international bookings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-airlines-to-spell-out-stand-on-refund-for-tickets-booked-during-lockdown-1-2-138702

The family members said she went to her bedroom and closed the door. They thought she was taking a bath but when she did not come out for a long, they broke the door open and found her hanging. They shifted her to a hospital where the doctors declared her brought dead.The police shifted the body for autopsy and took up the investigation.While the family alleged that she resorted to the extreme step due to harassment by her former boyfriend Devaraj Reddy, the police said the family had admonished her for moving around with him even after lodging a police case against him a few months ago.SR Nagar Circle Inspector Narasimha Reddy said their preliminary investigations revealed that the family members had pulled up Sravani for again moving around with Devaraj and after an argument with her mother and brother over the issue late Tuesday night, she went to her room and hanged herself.Police sent a team to Andhra Pradesh’s Kakinada town to arrest Devaraj.“Since Sravani’s family is making an allegation, we will arrest and question him,” the Circle Inspector added.The police officer said Devaraj was arrested on a complaint by Sravani in June that he was pestering her to marry him.The family members alleged that Sravani took the extreme step as police had failed to act on her complaint against Devaraj.Devaraj had come into contact with the actress through Tik-Tok a few months ago. The friendship between the two turned into love.Sravani’s family said he started harassing her for money. Devaraj had threatened to post her personal photographs and videos on social media, the family said. Devaraj had agreed to delete the photographs on payment of Rs 1 lakh and they had paid the money in instalments through Google Pay.However, he allegedly continued to harass her even after receiving Rs 1 lakh and she lodged a complaint against him at the SR Nagar police station on June 22.The police, however, claimed that there was no mention of videos and photographs in the complaint.Sravani had played roles in popular serials like “Manasu Mamatha” and “Mounaragam”.

09-09-2020||---||42nd amendment introduced concept of fundamental duties including scientific temper: Manmohan||New Delhi, September 9Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday lauded the contributions of late Indira Gandhi saying the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution in 1976 introduced the concept of the Fundamental Duties, among which was to develop scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reform.​The amendment was piloted by Indira Gandhi when the Emergency was in force.Singh was speaking at a virtual event on the occasion of signing of an MOU to set up Indira Gandhi Chair for Environmental Sciences at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru. The Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust which Congress president Sonia Gandhi heads has backed the chair.Singh used the occasion to remember Indira Gandhi saying her years as Prime Minister were peppered with path-breaking initiatives in the realm of science and technology.“While ISRO was already in fledgling existence and the cooperative milk movement had started earlier, it was she who pushed the space programme and the white revolution to new heights. Who can forget the moment when Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian astronaut, told her that from outer space, India appeared to him as “sare jahan se achha!” said Singh, hailing Indira as one of the builders of modern India and a leader whose tenure over 16 years in two separate phases saw transformation within India and the neighbourhood. “Her political achievements, her firmness in the face of military challenges, and her numerous policy initiatives are well recognised,” said Singh, adding that the occasion today was meant to acknowledge the relatively lesser known aspects of Indira’s life.Singh said it was appropriate that the Chair be located in one of the country’s leading centres for the study of science and technology adding, “It was Jawaharlal Nehru who first spoke about the need to inculcate a scientific temper among our people. Indira took this forward by leaps and bounds.”​Sonia Gandhi on the occasion said Indira set up the environment ministry in 1980 and remained minister in charge for four years until her death.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/42nd-amendment-introduced-concept-of-fundamental-duties-including-scientific-temper-manmohan-138691

Since there is no forum in the party where I can ask for cadre opinion, hence I will have to defend myself.  “By tomorrow If Malaviya is not removed from BJP IT cell (which is my five villages compromise proposal to Nadda) it means the party brass does not want to defend me. Since there is no forum in the party where I can ask for cadre opinion, hence I will have to defend myself,” Swamy said.Accusing the party’s IT cell and its in charge Amit Malviya of having “gone rogue”, Swamy on Monday said: “Some of its members are putting out fake ID tweets to make personal attacks on me.“If my angered followers make counter personal attacks I cannot be held responsible just as BJP cannot be held responsible for the rogue IT cell of the party.”I just accurate count on how many students took the JEE exams this last week: out 18 lakhs who down loaded passes only 8 lakhs turned up to take up the exam. What a disgrace for the nation which extols vidhya and gyan!!When one of the followers said:  “you are above criticism, ignore them, if you give them importance than you are wasting your important time,” Swamy replied that he is ignoring but the BJP “must sack one Malaviya character is running riot with filth”.“I am ignoring but BJP must sack them.

We are a party of maryada purushottam not of Ravan or Dushasan,” he wrote, accusing Malviya of running the campaign using fake tweets.Swamy has been facing criticism from within the party on his stance on some issues, including economy and conduct of JEE-NEET during COVID-19.He supported student protests against the BJP-led government’s decision to conduct JEE and NEET, calling for their postponement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/subramanian-swamy-gives-ultimatum-to-bjp-to-remove-it-cell-head-amit-malviya-138689
09-09-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: Plasma therapy not beneficial in reducing mortality, says ICMR Study||Use of convalescent plasma therapy in coronavirus-infected patients does not help in reducing mortality or progression to severe COVID-19, a multi-centric study funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found.The ‘open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial’ (PLACID Trial) was conducted across 39 public and private hospitals across India between April 22 and July 14 to find effectiveness of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of COVID-19, it said.The CP therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those into an active coronavirus patient to help kick-start the immune system to fight the infection.A total of 464 participants (moderately ill COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals) were enrolled for the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and has appeared on medRxiv, a preprint server.The National Task Force for COVID-19, a committee formed by the ICMR to respond to the pandemic, has reviewed and approved this study, it said.The Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19 issued by the Union Health Ministry on June 27 allowed use of convalescent plasma (Off label) for treating coronavirus-infected patients in moderate stage of the illness under “investigational therapies”         This authorisation has been paralleled by questionable practices such as calls for donors on social media, and the sale of CP in the black market with exorbitant price tags in India, the study said.Additionally, although CP is a safe therapeutic modality, plasmapheresis, plasma storage and NAb measurement are all resource-intensive processes, with a limited number of institutes in the country having the capacity to undertake these activities in a quality-assured manner.“The CP was not associated with reduction in mortality or progression to severe COVID-19,” the study said, adding this trial has high generalisability and approximates real-life setting of CP therapy in settings with limited laboratory capacity.A prior measurement of neutralising antibody titres in donors and participants may further clarify the role of CP in management of COVID-19, it said.The study trial included 464 moderately ill coronavirus infected hospitalised patients, of whom 235 were given convalescent plasma along with best of standard care while 229 received only standard care, as per the study.Those in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 ml of CP, transfused 24 hours apart, in addition to the BSC (best standard of care). The two plasma units were collected preferably from different donors depending on the availability and ABO compatibility to increase chances of receiving CP with NAb, it said.  “The PLACID trial results indicate that there was no difference in 28-day mortality or progression to severe disease among moderately ill COVID-19 patients treated with CP along with BSC compared to BSC alone,” the study said.The central implementation team at the ICMR was responsible for study design, study coordination, data analysis, data interpretation and writing of the report, the study stated.Patient enrolment, data collection and actual conduct of the study was done at public and private hospitals independently and the investigators in the ICMR had no role in it, it added.CP as a passive source of neutralising antibodies and immunomodulators is a century-old therapeutic option used for the management of viral diseases.According to the study, only two randomised controlled trials on CP use in COVID-19 have been published, one from China and the other from the Netherlands.Both were halted prematurely, the China study due to inadequate patient enrolment and the one from the Netherlands due to a need to redesign the trial based on interim findings.In both studies, no mortality benefit was noted, and the Dutch study raised uncertainties regarding pre-transfusion antibody-status of patients as a potential factor in identifying appropriate candidates for CP therapy.This uncertainty in the published evidence is reflected in a recent systematic review, which remained undecided on both the safety and effectiveness of CP as a therapeutic option in hospitalized patients of COVID-19.CP therapy has received regulatory approval for use in patients in different countries. This has resulted in its widespread adoption in real-world clinical practice, where it is being used to treat COVID-19 patients with a wide spectrum of disease severity.“Given these uncertainties, we undertook the current study to determine the effectiveness of using CP in moderately ill COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals across India in limiting progression to severe disease and determine the associated short-term adverse effects,” the study said.All participants or their family members or legally authorised representatives were provided with information regarding the trial in a language they were comfortable with, and written informed consent was obtained prior to participant recruitment, it said.

09-09-2020||United Nations||India's child mortality rate declined between 1990 and 2019: UN||India's child mortality rate has declined substantially between 1990 and 2019 but the country, along with Nigeria, still accounted for almost a third of all under-five deaths last year, according to a new report which warned that COVID-19 pandemic threatens to undo decades of progress in eliminating preventable child deaths globally.The ‘Levels & Trends in Child Mortality' Report 2020 said that the number of global under-five deaths dropped to its lowest point on record in 2019 – down to 5.2 million from 12.5 million in 1990.Over the past 30 years, health services to prevent or treat causes of child death such as preterm, low birth weight, complications during birth, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, as well as vaccination, have played a large role in saving millions of lives.However, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to health services that threaten to undo decades of hard-won progress towards eliminating preventable child deaths.According to the new mortality estimates released by UNICEF, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the World Bank Group, the under-five mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) in India declined to 34 in 2019 from 126 in 1990.The country registered a 4.5 per cent annual rate of reduction in under-five mortality between 1990 and 2019. The number of under-five deaths in India dropped from 3.4 million in 1990 to 8,24,000 in 2019.The infant mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) in India declined from 89 in 1990 to 28 last year, with the country registering 6,79,000 infant deaths last year, a significant decline from 2.4 million infant deaths in 1990.The country also witnessed a decrease in neonatal mortality rate between 1990 and 2019 from 57 to 22 - 1.5 million neonatal deaths in 1990 to 522,000 deaths in 2019. Further, the probability of dying among children aged 5–14 years declined from 21 in 1990 to 5 in 2019 (447,000 deaths in 1990 to 136,000 deaths in 2019) and the probability of dying among youth aged 15–24 years dipped from 24 to 10 (407,000 deaths to 246,000 deaths) between the period under review.The sex-specific under-five mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) in India in 1990 stood at 122 males and 131 females and this declined to 34 males and 35 females in 2019.The regions of Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) both saw a faster decline in under-five mortality from 2010-2019 compared to 2000-2009.However, the global burden of under-five deaths weighs most heavily on just two regions - sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia. The report said that about 53 per cent of all under-five deaths in 2019 - 2.8 million - occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, and roughly 1.5 million children (28 per cent) died in 2019 before reaching age 5 in Central and Southern Asia.These two regions alone accounted for more than 80 per cent of the 5.2 million global under-five deaths in 2019, but they only accounted for 52 per cent of the global under-five population.“Nearly half (49 per cent) of all under-five deaths in 2019 occurred in just five countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia. Nigeria and India alone account for almost a third,” the report said.The report added that countries worldwide are now experiencing disruptions in child and maternal health services, such as health checkups, vaccinations and prenatal and post-natal care, due to resource constraints and a general uneasiness with using health services due to a fear of getting COVID-19.“The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.“When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19. Without urgent investments to re-start disrupted health systems and services, millions of children under five, especially newborns, could die.”Even before COVID-19, newborns were at highest risk of death. In 2019, a newborn baby died every 13 seconds. Moreover, 47 per cent of all under-five deaths occurred in the neonatal period, up from 40 per cent in 1990. With severe disruptions in essential health services, newborn babies could be at much higher risk of dying.The report said that meeting the SDG target on under-five mortality would save the lives of almost 11 million children.On current trends, about 48 million children under 5 years of age will die between 2020 and 2030, half of them newborns. More than half (57 per cent) of these 48 million deaths will occur in sub-Saharan Africa (28 million) and 25 per cent in Central and Southern Asia (12 million).

She said that now she will be able to save 70 per cent of amount that she was spending on commuting through cab and taxis in the absence of metro services.When asked, the metros not crowded as earlier, she said, "Still people have Covid-19 phobia and it is the reason why less crowd is ther win the metro."

She further said that metro is a good means to travel as it is safe as well as it saves travelling time, where one has to deal with heavy traffic during rush hours.The resumption of service on these two additional lines comes two days after the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) started the services on the Yellow Line and Gurugram's Rapid Metro as part of Stage 1 of "graded resumption of Metro services".The Blue line runs from Dwarka Sector-21 to Electronic City (Noida), and Vaishali while the Pink line runs between Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar.The services available on both of these Lines are between 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. along with Yellow/Rapid Lines which are already operational.The re-opening of these two Lines ensures availability of nine of the existing 28 interchange Metro stations -- Rajouri Garden, INA Delhi Haat, Mayur Vihar Phase - I, Karkardooma, Rajiv Chowk, Yamuna Bank, Anand Vihar ISBT, Azadpur, and Sikandarpur.In addition to these, three more routes -- Red Line, Green Line, and Violet Line -- will also resume services on Thursday.Also, the rest of the remaining lines will also be re-opened under Stage-2 and Stage-3 of the Graded resumption plan on September 11 and 12, respectively.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commuters-elated-as-metros-blue-pink-line-resume-services-138663
09-09-2020||New Delhi||Bihar elections: Signs of ‘difference’ between BJP and JD-U on post of Deputy Chairperson of Rajya Sabha?||Amid a very open feud between NDA’s Bihar allies JD-U and LJP, there also appear to be signs of “difference” between the BJP and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar (JD-U) regarding the post of Deputy Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha for which elections are due on September 14, the day Parliament Session convenes.The post fell vacant after JD-U MP Harivansh Narayan Singh’s term in the Upper House ended. Since then he has been re-elected to the Rajya Sabha but it seems this time the BJP wants to keep the key post for itself like other important constitutional posts—the President, the Vice President/Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.So far there is no official word from the BJP or the NDA on the candidate but in case the BJP does field its candidate for the post, it can become another cause of rift within the NDA ahead of Bihar elections apart from the existing one between the JD-U and the LJP.While the LJP has authorised its president Chirag Paswan to take a call on whether it will fight against Nitish Kumar and prepare a list of candidates for 143 constituencies, the JD-U has also hinted it may not enter into an alliance with the LJP in the upcoming elections.Notably, despite attacks on JD-U, the LJP has been effusive in its praise for BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and wants to continue in an alliance with the national party, especially with senior leader Ram Vilas Paswan as minister in his Cabinet. Sources say a lot will depend on what the BJP wants in the alliance, adding that the return of Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) to the NDA has added another angle to the tussle for political space in Bihar.The BJP, which has played down the differences within the NDA, is watching closely.The saffron leadership knows that to win Bihar it needs Nitish Kumar, the question is whether it is willing to let go of the post of the Deputy Chairman.Insisting that the NDA is intact and will fight the assembly elections, BJP leaders say a fair distribution of seats will settle issues.  Besides, some amount of “posturing” is expected in electoral politics, they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-signs-of-difference-between-bjp-and-jd-u-on-post-of-deputy-chairperson-of-rajya-sabha-138661

The UN team has also supplied personal protective equipment.With a view to reaching the most vulnerable, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) helped 100,000 migrant workers access social protection and reached 100,000 sanitation workers with safety kits and 4,000 metric tonnes of dry rations, Dujarric said. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has trained 5,300 sanitation workers on safe waste disposal and is also helping develop a helpline directory for women in distress and supported guidelines on reproductive and adolescent services during lockdown.The International Labour Organisation (ILO) colleagues supported guidelines for gender-responsive job recovery, Dujarric said.“The UN in India is also supporting the government's anti-stigma campaign, with over 170 million social media impressions in August alone,” he added.According to estimates by the Johns Hopkins University, India currently has 4.2 million coronavirus cases in the world, second only after the US, which has 6.3 million cases. Over 72,000 people have died in India from the virus, the third-highest death toll after the US and Brazil.

09-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Quad should be more inclusive, open-minded: Russia||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 8Russia is hopeful that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) can become a catalyst for its two recent members — India and Pakistan — to initiate direct talks after a long spell of estrangement.India and Pakistan had recently joined the SCO whose original members are Russia, China and four Central Asian countries. On the margins of the last meeting of SCO Defence Ministers, Rajnath Singh discussed the border tensions with his Chinese counterpart.The threads will be picked up by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who will meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers.Encouraged by this trend, Deputy Chief of Mission in the Russian Embassy Roman Babushkin on Tuesday hoped that India and Pakistan might follow suit. The Russian reasoning was that after India and Pakistan have worked together in SCO on common issues, they could build enough trust to enter into bilateral talks on its sidelines.“The important thing about SCO is this is quite a comfortable platform for expanding cooperation on common ground in order to build mutual trust and eventually create conditions for expanding the dialogue,” explained Babushkin.However, the Russian envoy made it clear that despite Pakistan’s membership of SCO, which has led to closer working ties with Moscow, there will be no arms sale to Islamabad.“Russia has decided not to enter into an arms relationship with Pakistan at the request of the Indian side,” said Babushkin. The envoy was hopeful of India and Russia signing a logistics sharing agreement (LSA) that will give their security forces access to each other’s military bases.India already has a LSA with the US and is negotiating similar pacts with France and Japan. He also said military equipment ordered by India such as S-400 and Mig-29 and Sukhoi-30 aircraft will be delivered as per schedule.Russia was comfortable with India becoming a member of the Quad, Babushkin said, but pointed out that to be a regional body, it must be more inclusive, open-minded and based on the principle of undivided security rather than a “mysterious rules based order”.“We do not accept any attempts to create further alienation in the region by the philosophy of restricted security blocs and forced changes in supply chains. It will lead to more mistrust and take Indo-Pacific away from consensus,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-should-be-more-inclusive-open-minded-russia-138467

He added that Shiv Sena MLAs Pratap Sarnaik and Sunil Prabhu raised the issue in the Assembly on Tuesday.“The law is same for everyone. There is no political vendetta. Security is given to people who are looked upon as idols. If there are allegations of drug consumption against her and if they are false, the people levelling them should be thrown into jail,” Sarnaik said.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials on Tuesday posted a notice at Ranaut’s bungalow here, pointing out many alterations undertaken in the building without the civic body’s approval, a claim rejected by her.A BMC team went to the bungalow of the actor in the Pali Hill area of suburban Bandra and posted the notice there as nobody was present to receive it, a civic official added. The notice pointed out over a dozen alterations in the bungalow, like a “toilet being converted into office cabin” and “new toilets being constructed alongside the staircase”, the official said.The BMC has asked her to tell within 24 hours if she had taken approvals for changes in her residence, he said. The BMC also filed a “caveat” in a local court, saying it should be heard first if Ranaut challenges a stop-work notice issued to her.Ranaut, through her lawyer, responded to the BMC’s notice, accusing its officials of trespassing on her property. — PTIMumbai police to investigate||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-to-face-drug-probe-138469

In his petition, Prof Rao said the decision to go for a separate National Law Aptitude Test (NLAT) will make NLSIU an “island of exclusion” from an “island of excellence”. He urged the top court to quash the September 3 decision of the NLSIU, Bengaluru, to hold NLAT on September 12. Terming the decision to conduct a separate test as “whimsical and baseless”, the petition contended that the present NLSIU Vice-Chancellor did not have the requisite consent from the academic council for it. “The technical requirement of having a laptop and 1 mbps of internet speed for taking home proctored examination is onerous, arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal,” the petition submitted. Unlike the general universities which admit only those having already completed a three-year BA, BSc or BCom course, admission to NLUs is open to candidates passing their Class XII examination, provided they clear CLAT which has a success rate of less than 5 per cent.

It slashed its GDP forecast for the current fiscal to 10.5 per cent, a huge revision of (-) 5 percentage points compared to the June GEO.The economy, it said, would recover to 11 per cent in 2021-22, largely owing to base effect and grow by 6 per cent in the following year.Separately, India Ratings and Research, the domestic arm of rating agency Fitch, projected an 11.8 per cent contraction in the Indian economy in FY21, as against its previous projection of 5.3 per cent contraction in the current fiscal. Indian economy had grown at 4.2 per cent in the 2019-20 fiscal.According to India Ratings, the GDP would bounce back to 9.9 per cent growth in FY22, helped mainly by a weak base of FY21.In another report, Morgan Stanley projected a contraction of 5 per cent in the Indian economy in the calendar year 2020 from 4.9 per cent in 2019. — PTIGlobal Outlook||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fitch-indian-gdp-to-contract-10-5-138490

Those states that were the first to accept one of the two options were criticised by their political rivals for allegedly allowing themselves to be shortchanged by the Centre.Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Puducherry Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana and Delhi have opposed both the options while Karnataka, Assam and Bihar were among the first to choose the first of the two options offered by Sitharaman to compensate states for Rs 2.35-lakh crore in GST dues.Under the first, the GST related shortfall was Rs 97,000 crore while the rest was lost due to "hand of God" (Covid-related disruptions). States were given leeway to borrow more from the market if they accepted this option. Under the second option, the states would have got the entire amount but further borrowing was conditional such as eliminating free rural electricity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-softens-stand-on-gst-dues-to-states-138475

When dissuaded, PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate own (Indian) troops,” the statement said, adding despite the grave provocation, “own troops exercised great restraint and behaved in a mature and responsible manner”.The Indian response came following a statement issued by China earlier in the day, accusing Indian troops of having fired shots across the LAC in the area south of the Pangong Tso. The statement by PLA’s Western Theatre Command spokesperson Col Zhang Shuili was reported by the Chinese state-owned news outlet at 2.30 am. India has termed the Chinese statement misleading. “The statement by the Western Theatre Command (of the PLA) is an attempt to mislead their domestic and international audience,” the Indian statement said.India has said it was committed to disengagement and de-escalation on the LAC, while China continues to undertake provocative activities. The PLA has been blatantly violating agreements, while engagement at military, diplomatic and political levels is on. The Army was committed to maintaining peace, but was also determined to protecting national integrity and sovereignty at all costs, it said. The PLA had earlier said: “The Indian Army blatantly fired threats to the patrol personnel of the Chinese border guards who had made representations, and the Chinese border guards were forced to take countermeasures to stabilise the situation.”First in area since 1962Carried rods, spearsAround 50-60 PLA soldiers were armed with rods and sharp weapons as they tried to close in on Indian-held Mukhpari mountain top in eastern Ladakh on Monday evening, but the Army confronted them, forcing their retreat, govt sources said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-misleading-pla-fired-shots-army-138479

It will be a follow-up of last week’s interaction between Defence Ministers Rajnath Singh and Wei Fenghe.CCS meets, NSA Doval may hold talks too Jaishankar’s meeting with Yi would be significant as he and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla have made it clear that diplomatic ties with China are predicated on the restoration of the status quo on the LAC. The Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is also slated to attend the SCO in Moscow but the chances of a meeting with Jaishankar are bleak.The SCO CFM will review the preparations for a summit that could be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan PM Imran Khan.Meanwhile, Russia’s Deputy Chief of Mission Roman Babushkin said India did not require any advice on how to improve its ties with neighbours when asked whether Moscow would like to be the mediator. “I put a counter question to you. Would you (India) accept third-party mediation?’’ he told a journalist when asked this question.As a friend of both China and India, Russia finds it “quite encouraging” that both countries are trying to find a mutually acceptable solution through dialogue. “So we would encourage this outcome (Sino-India talks on the sidelines of SCO or BRICS) which could provide a good impetus for de-escalation and disengagement,’’ he added.In Tehran, after meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in Tehran, Jaishankar said they discussed strengthening bilateral cooperation and reviewed regional developments. Rajnath Singh had also visited Tehran on his way back from Moscow and analysts view the hectic shuttle diplomacy by the duo as an effort to turn the page after a brief spell of acrimony in India-Iran ties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/external-affairs-minister-firm-on-lac-status-quo-now-all-eyes-on-meet-with-yi-138482

Russia approached India for help on two counts — to consider manufacturing through our companies which are well-known for vaccine production of high quality, volume and capacity. The second was to see if the Phase-3 trials or bridging studies can be conducted in India if need be, which means regulatory facilitation,” Paul said, adding that the government was considering the same model for Sputnik V as the Oxford vaccine which India’s Serum Institute is making and testing here.“It is a win-win situation for India and the world as we can make large vaccine quantities. Serum institute alone can produce 100 million doses a month,” Paul said.Meanwhile, India today crossed 5 crore tests with only one nation — South Korea — having done more tests. The total cases reached 42,04,613 with recoveries surging to 33,23,950 (77.65 per cent).
