But today transmission is rising. We are still opening the lockdown. Does this mean an ill thought out lockdown imposed earlier hasn’t yielded results?“Lockdown has destroyed crores. If urgently they (the poor) are not given Rs 7,500 a month, not provided free ration, not helped and if MSMEs are not supported now, there will be economic devastation,” Gandhi said.He said the government’s economic package does not acknowledge that people need cash, not credit.“It’s our duty to raise this issue. It’s not about parties. It’s about the country. If we don’t raise it now lakhs will seep into poverty,” he added.The opposition meet was attended by 22 parties and they discussed the situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have put forth 11 demands before the Central government, including direct cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month to families outside the Income Tax bracket for six months.

22-05-2020||New Delhi||Centre unabashedly usurping powers of states: Opposition parties||Launching a no-holds-barred attack against the Modi government on Friday over its handling of the COVID crisis, 22 Opposition parties accused it of “unabashedly usurping” powers of states and abandoning any pretense of being democratic, and Congress president Sonia Gandhi terming the prime minister’s announcement of economic package to deal with the situation as a “cruel joke on the country”.Also read: Lockdowns have got back diminishing returns, Centre has no exit strategy: Sonia Gandhi Congress playing cynical politics at time of national crisis: BJPThese parties also asked the Centre to present a revised comprehensive economic package that will be a “true stimulus” and sought reversal of all unilateral policy decisions, especially pertaining to labour laws, as they put forth a 11-point demand charter before the government during a virtual meeting, called by the Congress to discuss the situation arising out of the pandemic as well as the lockdown.Addressing the meeting, which was among others attended by West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC head Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Jharkhand Chief Minister and JMM leader Hemant Soren, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and DMK leader M K Stalin, Gandhi said the government is uncertain about the criteria for enforcing the lockdown with no exit strategy and has “cruelly ignored” scores of migrant workers and the 13 crore families in the bottom half of the population.“The government has abandoned any pretence of being democratic and all power is now concentrated in only one office—the PMO,” she said.“The prime minister’s announcement of a grand Rs 20 lakh crore package on May 12 and the finance minister spelling out its details over the next five days have turned out to be a cruel joke on the country,” she added.Hitting back, the BJP accused the Congress of playing “cynical” politics over the COVID-19 crisis, saying Gandhi and her “family” have “indulged in drama” at the time of a national catastrophe.BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao said it is the Congress president and her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who have “played cruel jokes and cynical politics on migrant workers”. During the virtual meeting, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said there would be economic devastation if the poor were not helped urgently with cash and free rations.A joint statement by these parties said the Centre has failed in discharging its responsibilities in a timely, effective and sensitive manner during the pandemic, and claimed that the economy has collapsed and all sections of society face acute distress, with livelihoods having been destroyed and many lives lost.It said grand announcements have been made by the government but they have not done anything meaningful to alleviate the sufferings of people and address the pressing concerns of farmers, migrants and other workers.“In fact, the Union government has unabashedly usurped powers vested in the States undermining the constitutionally guaranteed federal democracy,” they said, adding this is not the time for the Centre to indulge in “showmanship or one-upmanship”, but this is the time for a gigantic and collective endeavour.“It is important that the government reaches out and engages in a dialogue with all political parties in a systematic manner, listen seriously to the suggestions that we have to make, activate Parliamentary institutions like Standing Committees and be genuine in helping the states financially and otherwise,” the parties said in the statement.They also demanded a direct cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month to families outside the Income tax bracket for 6 months apart from an immediate cash assistance of Rs 10,000 along with free ration.Other demands included free transportation for migrant workers to their native places and immediate and reliable arrangements to rescue all Indian students and other citizens stranded overseas, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at a press conference.He said the parties have also demanded that the Centre should immediately provide a financial package for states, besides a clear and meaningful economic strategy focused on revival of economy and poverty alleviation instead of “propaganda”.“These 22 parties represent over 60 to 70 per cent of the country’s population and hoped the prime minister and the government would take a positive view of their demands,” Surjewala said.Other leaders who attended the meeting included JD(S) leader HD Deve Gowda, besides CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury, CPI’s D Raja, Sharad Yadav (LJD), Omar Abdullah (NC), Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM), Upendra Kushwaha (RLSP), Jose K Mani (KC-M), Badruddin Ajmal (AIUDF), Jayant Chaudhary (RLD). Congress leaders A K Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Mallikarjun Kharge were also present during the meeting.The opposition parties also passed a resolution urging the Centre to immediately declare the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan in Odisha and West Bengal as a national calamity and called for substantially helping the two states in facing the impact of the disaster.

22-05-2020||Lucknow||Coronavirus: Despite low infection rate, returning migrants face ostracisation in villages||Ten days ago, all Gulsher Khan and Mahtab Khan wanted to do was leave the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai to get home to their village in Khajuri Mirza in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya. When they finally did on May 13 after much hardship, their village collectively decided they cannot live at home for the fear of spreading coronavirus.Now they are perched on a cot placed on a mango tree in a grove outside their village. Their families come by with food and water. For charging their mobile phones, they’ve somehow managed to arrange for a solar panel.The Khans were among the many migrants who, having lost their livelihoods to the lockdown called to stop the spread of coronavirus, made the difficult, sometimes even perilous, journey home.And they were not the first to face the ill-effects of a fear that has gripped the country since migrants began returning home.Clashes erupted in several districts in the state on Thursday after migrants were not allowed to enter their villages even after completing their quarantine.Statistics that Principal Secretary Health Amit Mohan Prasad shared shows that only 0.05 per cent of returning migrants have so far tested positive for COVID-19.And yet, there’s panic in many villages about the returning migrants, in some part because of a section of the press that has taken to projecting them as “corona virus bomb”.Some 16.50 lakh migrants had returned home from various states through 1,300 Shramik Special trains until Friday, Prasad said to reporters on Friday. Of that number, 764 migrant workers have tested positive, he said, warning also that situation could get out of hand if protocol is not strictly followed.Every returning migrant undergoes thermal testing and are asked to quarantine themselves at home for 21 days.Those who show any symptoms are sent to institutional quarantine, where they are tested for COVID 19. If they test positive, they are sent to L1 facilities for treatment. If their test results come back negative, they remain in institutional quarantine for a further week and then asked to quarantine themselves at home for 21 days.Gram Nigrani Samitis in villages and Mohalla Nigrani Samitis in urban areas have been tasked with ensuring there are now violations.Posters on the doors of such houses mention the beginning and the end date of the quarantine period.Until now ASHA workers have visited 6,58, 982 homes of  quarantined migrants  to examine them for symptoms of which 764 have been found symptomatic, said Prasad.However, enforcing quarantine in the heat wave conditions is very trying.With the mercury hovering around 45 degrees Mahendra of Sewta village of Jahanaganj  in Azamgarh who has recently returned from Telangana is living under a plastic sheet in an open space outside his hut as there is no space if live separately and he does not want to infect his family.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-despite-low-infection-rate-returning-migrants-face-ostracisation-in-villages-88521
22-05-2020||London||UK court orders Anil Ambani to pay $717million to Chinese banks||A UK court, on Friday, directed Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani to pay nearly $717 million to three Chinese banks pursuing the recovery of funds owed to them as part of a loan agreement within 21 days.At a remotely held hearing, in line with procedures in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, Justice Nigel Teare ruled at the Commercial Division of the High Court of England and Wales, London, that a personal guarantee disputed by Ambani is binding on him.“It is declared that the Guarantee is binding on the Defendant (Ambani),” Justice Teare’s order notes.“It is declared that… the sum payable by the Defendant to the Claimant (banks) pursuant to the Guarantee is $716,917,681.51,” it reads.A statement related to the judgment has been sought from the Reliance Group.The banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, Mumbai branch; China Development Bank, and Exim Bank of China – had taken their claim for a summary judgment to the UK High Court and in February were granted a conditional order, in effect a deposit to be paid into court pending a full trial in the case.Judge David Waksman, presiding over that hearing on February 7, had set a six-week timeline for the payment of $100 million pending a full trial in 2021.The court order this week vacates a trial date previously set for March 18 next year and also issues a court costs order in favour of the banks, adding a further 750,000 pounds to the overall amount owed.According to the court order, the nearly $717 million to be paid by Ambani comprises the principal amount outstanding under the Facility Agreement of $549,804,650.16; interest outstanding as of May 22 of $51,923,451.49; and default interest due of $115,189,579.86.“The final amount owed by the Defendant [Ambani] to the Claimant [banks] under the Guarantee shall be assessed subject to the outcome of the RCom Insolvency Action,” the court order states, leaving the option open to the banks to revisit the final amount in future.The reference is to an ongoing State Bank of India (SBI) Insolvency Application in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in India related to Reliance Communications (RCom), which the Chinese banks’ legal team had argued had no bearing on the English Court's ability to proceed to determine their clients’ claims.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (Mumbai Branch), on behalf of the three Chinese banks, had sought the summary judgment against Anil Ambani over an alleged breach of a personal guarantee on a debt refinancing loan of around $925 million in February 2012.Anil Ambani denies providing authority for any such guarantee, resulting in the High Court action in the UK – the jurisdiction agreed upon as part of the terms of the loan agreement.At the last hearing in the case in February, Justice Waksman had ruled that he did not accept Ambani's defence that his net worth was nearly zero or that his family would not step in to assist him when “push came to shove” to cover the conditional order amount of $100 million.The Reliance Group at the time had said the industrialist plans to appeal against the ruling.“The order pertains to an alleged personal liability of Mr Anil Ambani and will have no bearing on the operations of the Reliance Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Power Limited and Reliance Capital Limited,” a spokesperson for Anil Ambani had said at the end of the February hearing.

22-05-2020||Ravi S Singh||Body of former and present Parliamentarians draws govt attention to spectre of ‘baby boom’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 22A voluntary body of former and sitting Members of Parliament, christened “Indian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development” (IAPPD), has drawn the Union Government’s attention on keeping the focus on ensuring accessible services to its basic health and care programmes along with the fight against COVID-19.On the IAPPD’s list of priorities is on-service for the Reproductive Child Health (RCH) and the Family Planning (FP) programme, which have allegedly fallen off the map in the din of the COVID-19 pandemic.Negligence on the RCH and the FP will be at India’s detriment, especially in the midst of studies raising the spectre of jack-up in the birth of babies by the end of this year.Also, it has been found in India and abroad that the aged persons were the most susceptible to COVID-19 and, hence, they merit unalloyed care and attention.In a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, IAPPD chairman and Rajya Sabha’s former vice-chairman PJ Kurien, while endorsing the successful push-back against COVID-19, flagged the need for keeping up the vigil on the RCH and the FP programme.Medication needs of TB patients and traditional diseases, including cancer, should also be in the government’s health care calculus.“It is unfortunate that our RCH and Family Programme services have been receiving less than the desired emphasis during the lockdown period,” Kurien said, referring to reports of several pregnant women having missed their ante-natal and post-natal check-ups. Also, children missed on their immunisation and other services, Kurien said.“Similarly, though India is at the cusp of achieving the targets of the TFR, wherein we are about to achieve the two-child family norm, yet international media quoting a UN report has predicted a possible ‘baby boom’ towards the end of this year...” Kurien said in the letter, adding this was attributed as a side-effect of the total lockdown due to the pandemic.“Unfortunately, this is all due to inaccessible RCH/FP services which many couples needed but could not receive during this period,” Kurien said.On behalf of the IAPPD, Kurien has also written letters to Parliamentarians to pay attention to these issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/body-of-former-and-present-parliamentarians-draws-govt-attention-to-spectre-of-baby-boom-88508

In addition to the Ministries and Departments of Central Government, the Centre has notified about 214 organizations under section 14 (2) of the Act to bring them within the jurisdiction of CAT.The Principal Bench of CAT also deals with matters of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-petition-seeking-permanent-cat-bench-in-jk-88507
22-05-2020||New Delhi||Congress playing cynical politics at time of national crisis: BJP||Accusing the Congress of playing “cynical” politics over the COVID-19 crisis, the BJP said on Friday the opposition party’s president Sonia Gandhi and her “family” have “indulged in drama” at the time of a national catastrophe.BJP spokesperson G V L Narasimha Rao hit back at the Congress after Sonia Gandhi slammed the Narendra Modi government, claiming that it has abandoned any pretence of being democratic and forgotten the spirit of federalism.   The government’s Rs 20 lakh crore package and its details have turned to be a “cruel joke” on the country, Gandhi said at a meeting of opposition parties.Hitting back, the BJP said it is the Congress president and her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who have “played cruel jokes and cynical politics on migrant workers”. “They did nothing for migrant workers except the mother-daughter duo making some grand announcements. Except indulging in drama and petty politics at a time of national crisis, Sonia and her family did nothing to contribute to nation’s united fight against the pandemic,” Rao said in a statement. “Never before has a principal opposition party indulged in such cynical politics and the Congress will pay a political price for playing negative politics,” the Rajya Sabha MP claimed.Congress-ruled state governments have shown utter lack of sensitivity towards the migrants and refused to allow their own citizens to use Shramik Special trains, he alleged.   “The whole world is appreciative of our handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdown strategy in controlling the spread of the pandemic in India. Sonia Gandhi is perhaps regretting why India didn’t turn out to be like her native Italy,” Rao said.                 Only today, he noted, a study by the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) showed how India averted 20 lakh cases and up to 78,000 deaths by imposing the lockdown timely and implementing it effectively.Every relaxation, like inter-state travel of migrants on Shramik Special trains or of bringing home Indians stranded abroad by Vande Bharat evacuation flights, has been allowed with elaborate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to be strictly followed by all state governments, Rao said.The strategy to exit the lockdown has been designed in a very thoughtful and systematic manner, he added. The BJP leader said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership in successfully controlling the COVID-19 challenge has been praised by world leaders. “The Gandhi family is unable to digest the fact that PM Modi has emerged as truly a global leader and his image has surpassed that of every leader from its dynasty,” he claimed.Addressing a meeting of 22 opposition parties convened through video-conferencing to discuss the situation arising out of the coronavirus pandemic, Sonia Gandhi alleged that the government is uncertain about the criteria for enforcing lockdowns and has no exit strategy it.

22-05-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Nine migrant workers found dead in well in Hyderabad's Gorrekunta village||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, May 22The migrant tragedy linked to COVID-19 appears to be taking a gruesome turn with the recovery of nine dead bodies from an open well at a cold storage unit in Gorrekunta village of Geesugonda Mandal, Warrangal district, Hyderabad.Six of the deceased are from a family hailing from West Bengal and are believed to have committed suicide to avoid starvation.Initially, four bodies were discovered in the well on late Thursday night, but when the police started recovering the bodies, the number quickly went up.Hailing from West Bengal, Maqsood Alam and his wife Nisha had come to Andhra Pradesh around two decades ago looking for work and were working in a jute bag factory till the lockdown was declared in March.The police have retrieved the bodies of Maqsood Alam, his wife Nisha, daughter Bushara Khatun, three-year-old grandson Baby Shakeel, sons Sohail and Shabad.The other bodies have been identified by locals as those of Shakeel Ahmed from Tripura and two of Sriram and Shyam, both from Bihar.A large number of migrants stranded in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have resorted to desperate measures such as walking several hundred kilometres to reach home.All deceased either worked in the jute bag unit or were related to those working there.Shakeel worked as a driver at the jute mill, while Shyam and Sriram worked in a nearby mill.Warangal Police Commissioner V Ravinder, Mayor Prakash Rao and Collector Haritha, who visited the spot, said various angles were being explored.But as of now, the police were not ruling out the possibility of suicide as the bodies did not bear any injury marks.All bodies have been removed for post mortem.Police Commissioner V Ravinder said they were not ruling out the possibility that “the family may have been facing financial issues due to continuous lockdown and that might have led to them resorting to the extreme step of committing suicide”.Reports said the police had picked up Yakub Pasha for interrogation to rule out any crime. The six-member family, residing in Karimabad in a rented house, moved to the jute mill godown where they continued to work if they found work.Maqsood’s daughter was divorced and lived with her parents along with her three-year-old son, the police said.Local ACP Shyam Sundar has ruled out the suicide theory saying “if it was a suicide pact, only the family of six would have committed suicide but there are three other bodies. We are investigating several angles.”The jute bag company owner, Bhaskar, told the police that even though the factory was closed, the labour family and all others had enough dry rations and money and they could not be under any distress.Bhaskar, who wanted to restart the factory, said he went to the factory premises on Thursday afternoon as all mobile phones were switched off and those living there were missing. He then informed the police.The police also found half-eaten food in the room where the family was staying.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nine%C2%A0migrant-workers-found-dead-in-well-in-hyderabads-gorrekunta-village-88482

Thirty per cent of all patients and 40 per cent of all deaths in the country are from this state. Hospitals are full. No ambulances are available. There is no food available at quarantine centres,” Fadnavis said while participating in one such protest at the state party headquarters.The former chief minister demanded that the Maharashtra government treat all COVID-19 patients free of cost and all private hospitals must reserve 80 per cent of their beds for COVID-19 patients who should be charged government hospital rates.The protest however triggered a controversy after footage released by the BJP showed school children participating with their masks lowered.”Absolutely shameful, what lust for power politics can make leaders do. Making kids stand in the heat, with their masks lowered, no covering the face for a political protest when we need to keep them safe and indoors. Corona ko bhul gaye, politics pyaara hai,” Cabinet Minister Aaditya Thackeray tweeted.”One political party state unit has set a new low and a new world record---the only party in the world to indulge in politics and in spreading fear, hate and division when the world has forgotten all of it to help each other. This party has forgotten the pandemic,” Thackeray said in another tweet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-gets-kids-to-protest-against-udhhav-thackerays-maha-vikas-aghadi-govt-draws-flak-from-son-aaditya-88481
22-05-2020||New Delhi||Railways to use 60 pc of its converted isolation coaches lying idle to operate Shramik Special trains||The Railways has decided to use 60 per cent of the 5,200 isolation coaches meant for COVID-infected people to run the Shramik Special trains.Officials said these non-AC coaches would not be reconverted into normal coaches but will be used as “they are” for these services.Officials said since these coaches had been lying idle after being converted into isolation wards and were yet to be deployed, the Railways had decided to use them to operate the migrant special services.“The board desires that 60 per cent of isolation coaches (amounting to 3,120 coaches) meant for the intervention of COVID-19 cases, the Railways may utilise them for running of Shramik Special trains. It is permitted by the board,” the order issued on May 21 said.While making the modified isolation wards, the middle berths had been removed and the lower portion of the compartment was plugged by plywood. There is also a provision of partition provided from the aisle side for the isolation of the compartment.Due to the non-availability of the middle berth, when in use, the trains with these coaches will have a lower number of passengers.Officials said all equipment on board the coaches such as oxygen tanks, ventilators and other medical items would be removed from them.One significant change for travellers would be the availability of a proper bathroom and not just a toilet on board. The four toilets in each coach have been converted into two bathrooms by plugging the toilet pan and with proper flooring.Each bathroom will have a hand shower, a bucket and a mug.“This is a win-win situation for the Railways. We are not reconverting the coaches into regular ones, but using them as they are by removing only the medical equipment on board. There is no additional cost that we are incurring. We will also remove the curtains. These coaches will come in multipurpose use since they are currently not being utilised. If and when they are needed as isolation units, they will be shifted for use there,” a railway spokesperson said.The Centre has, however, earmarked 215 railway stations for the deployment of railways’ isolation coaches to be used as ‘COVID Care Centres’ for suspected or confirmed patients categorised as mild or very mild cases.As of now, none of these coaches is in use.Officials said modifying each coach into isolation wards had cost the Railways around Rs 2 lakh while reconverting them into regular non-AC coaches would cost the national transporter Rs 1 lakh for each coach.So far, the Railways has operated more than 2,000 Shramik Special trains since May 1 to ferry migrant workers home.

Besides these, the CM further directed the Collector to make a skill gap study with the industries and accordingly impart the required skills among the youth through Skill Development Colleges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-pradesh-releases-special-package-to-revive-industry-88477
22-05-2020||Aditi Tandon||India averted 29 lakh cases, 78,000 deaths with first two lockdowns: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 22The Union Government, on Friday, said lockdowns were the right way forward towards COVID-19 management and claimed that India had averted up to 29 lakh cases and 78,000 deaths due to the first two spells of the lockdown, that ended on May 15.Sharing the details of mathematical modelling studies, which the Ministry of Health ordered to assess the public health impact of lockdown one and two, NITI Ayog Member Health VK Paul, on Friday, said: “Broad ranges covering the estimates of lockdown impact by multiple models we got done show that we averted 14 to 29 lakh cases and 37,000 to 78,000 deaths.”The government shared the average prediction of five sets of modelling it commissioned to understand if the lockdowns helped. The assessment covered the period until May 15.Going forward, the Ministry of Health said a balanced approach towards the COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 virus was the way forward.“The lockdown is being gradually eased but we need to be very cautious. We cannot afford to relax. The virus is around and we have to take the measures we know will prevent it from growing. We have to wear masks, practise hand and respiratory hygiene, maintain one-metre distance and ensure care for the elderly,” Paul said, asking people to be wary of the potential of the virus to grow mathematically.We have to create the headwinds needed to ensure the virus doesn’t grow, he added.The Ministry also said the peak of COVID cases couldn’t be fitted in any plain equation because the future growth of the disease would depend not only on how the virus grew but also on how the community behaved and how we as a society created resistance for the virus.Paul said India had changed its behaviour and must now sustain that change.On the positive side, the NITI Ayog official said the pandemic was concentrated in a few urban pockets in terms of both active cases and deaths.Around 80 per cent cases are in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and MP; and 60 per cent active cases are in five cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Pune and Thane.Deaths are also similarly concentrated in urban areas.Paul, however, added that efforts were underway to protect the transmission of the disease in rural areas where the virus hadn’t reached yet.He cautioned the state governments against laxity towards migrants that were returning home.The government also said the lockdown success laid in the fact that case growth rate (24 hour surge in cases) had dropped from 23 per cent on April 3 to 5.4 per cent on Friday.Fatalities had also significantly dropped over the same period, VK Paul said.The NITI Aayog member health added that he never projected zero cases until May 15 and had earlier only said the disease graph had slowed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-averted-29-lakh-cases-78-000-deaths-with-first-two-lockdowns-govt-88473
22-05-2020||New Delhi||New replaceable, more efficient filter for N95 masks developed||Researchers have developed a more efficient membrane filter that can be attached to a regular N95 mask and replaced when needed.The filter has a smaller pore size than normal N95 masks, potentially blocking more virus particles, according the researchers from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia.Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there's been a worldwide shortage of face masks – particularly the N95 ones worn by healthcare workers, they said.Although these coverings provide the highest level of protection currently available, they have limitations, the researchers noted in the journal ACS Nano.N95 masks filter about 85 per cent of particles smaller than 300 nm, they said.The researchers noted that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is in the size range of 65-125 nanometres (nm), so some virus particles could slip through these coverings.Due to shortages, many healthcare workers have had to wear the same N95 mask repeatedly, even though they are intended for a single use.To help overcome these problems, Muhammad Mustafa Hussain and colleagues wanted to develop a membrane that more efficiently filters particles the size of SARS-CoV-2 and could be replaced on an N95 mask after every use.The researchers first developed a silicon-based, porous template using lithography and chemical etching.They placed the template over a polyimide film and used a process called reactive ion etching to make pores in the membrane, with sizes ranging from 5-55 nm.The researchers then peeled off the membrane, which could be attached to an N95 mask.To ensure that the nanoporous membrane was breathable, the researchers measured the airflow rate through the pores.They found that for pores tinier than 60 nm, the pores needed to be placed a maximum of 330 nm from each other to achieve good breathability.The hydrophobic membrane also cleans itself because droplets slide off it, preventing the pores from getting clogged with viruses and other particles, according to the researchers.

The Railways is bearing 85 per cent of the total cost of running each of the trains while the share of the states is 15 per cent.“The Railways is spending an estimated Rs 80 lakh on each of these trains on an average,” an official said.According to the official data with the Railways, provided to it by the states in April-end, the Western Railways, which covers states namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, received requests to ferry around seven lakh migrant workers to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, Assam, Haryana and Odisha.The Southern Railways, which operates in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Puducherry, received a list of 11.4 lakh migrants to be ferried back to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Assam, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Similarly, the Central Railways received requests to ferry 2.94 lakh migrant workers while the Northern Railways was approached to transport 2.84 lakh. The South-Central Railways received requests to ferry 1.86 lakh workers.“As of now, we do not have a consolidated data on how many of these workers want to go home,” said another Railway official.“In fact, we have already surpassed the estimations that the state governments have given us of the stranded people. The Railways has the capacity to run up to 300 trains daily if needed,” he said.The Railway is currently operating 15 pairs of special trains since May 12 on Rajdhani routes, in addition to the Shramik Special trains. It will also operate 100 pairs of special mail/express trains from June 1.“We will continue to run these migrant special trains as long as we receive requests from states,” said a Railway official.Of the 31 lakh migrant workers who returned to their homes travelling by Shramik Express trains, around 12 lakh came back to Uttar Pradesh, over seven lakh to Bihar and more than one lakh each to Jharkhand and Rajasthan, according to the Railways.Officials also said the Railways was getting requests from Bihar and West Bengal where people wanted to return to cities where they were working.

Lockdown has since been extended thrice---the latest on May 17 until May 31.   Read: Congress playing cynical politics at time of national crisis: BJP“The Prime Minister’s  announcement  on May 12 of a grand Rs 20 lakh crore package, and  the Finance Minister spelling out its details over the next five days, have turned out to be a cruel joke on the country,” Gandhi said.The Congress chief said there is no indication either as regards whether Parliament or its standing committees will be summoned to meet to discuss the situation.“The government has abandoned any pretence of being democratic and all power is now concentrated in only one office—the PMO,” she said.Gandhi also accused the government of functioning unilaterally, saying there is no pretence of any consultation with the stakeholders or debate in Parliament.Alleging that the government has embarked on a “wild adventure” of so-called reforms, including “a grand clearance sale of PSUs” and repeal of labour laws, she said, “We deplore these unilateral moves.” Gandhi pointed out that a number of renowned economists have predicted that 2020-21 will end with a negative growth of up to minus 5 per cent for the country and its “consequences will be catastrophic”.“That the present government has no solutions is worrying, but that it has no empathy or compassion for the poor and vulnerable is heartbreaking,” she noted.“The spirit of federalism, which is an integral part of our Constitution, is all but forgotten. There is no indication either if the two Houses of Parliament or the standing committees will be summoned to meet,” she said.The Congress chief said it is the duty of the opposition to offer constructive criticism and suggestions, and be the voice of the people.“It is in that spirit that this meeting has been convened,” she said, requesting the opposition leaders to come forth with their considered views.Gandhi said many like-minded parties had demanded transfer of cash to the poor and free distribution of foodgrains to all, besides arranging buses and trains for migrant workers to go back to their homes. “But our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” she said.Gandhi said the economic downturn began in 2017-18, when the seven quarters of declining GDP growth was unprecedented. Yet, the government carried on with its “misguided policies and incompetent governance”, she rued.The Congress chief said the initial optimism of the prime minister that the war against the coronavirus would conclude in 21 days has turned out to be misplaced and it seems that the virus is here to stay until a vaccine is found.“I am also of the view that the government is uncertain about the criteria for lockdowns, nor does it have an exit strategy. The successive lockdowns have yielded diminishing returns. The government also stumbled badly on the testing strategy and import of test kits.“Meanwhile, the pandemic continues to take its toll. The economy has been gravely crippled. Every economist of repute had pointed towards an immediate need for a massive fiscal stimulus,” she said.Gandhi also expressed grief at the enormous damage caused by Cyclone Amphan in Odisha and West Bengal, including the loss of 80 lives.Opposition parties made 11 demands, including Rs 7,500 per month in the account of all non IT payers for the next six months, resumption of Parliament and special financial package for states.The leaders of 22 opposition parties, including West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Jharkhand Chief Minister and JMM leader Hemant Soren, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, DMK leader M K Stalin and JD(S) leader HD Deve Gowda, besides CPI-M’s Sitaram Yechury and CPI’s D Raja participated in the meeting.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Mallikarjun Kharge were also present.Leaders of some other regional parties such as Sharad Yadav (LJD), Omar Abdullah (NC), Tejashwi Yadav (RJD), Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAM), Upendra Kushwaha (RLSP), Jose K Mani (KC-M), Badruddin Ajmal (AIUDF), Jayant Chaudhary (RLD) and Raju Shetty (Swabhimani Paksha) also participated.

The AIIMS Resident Doctors Association wrote a letter to the institute’s Director on Friday, saying: “A mess worker from RPC canteen died of Covid-19.” The RDA in the letter alleged that the hostel section refused to take precautionary measures as demanded by the RDA more than a month ago.The RDA also alleged that the hostel superintendent tried to present the death of the mess worker as a case of probable cardiac event.The RDA has demanded the resignation of the hostel superintendent and the senior warden for the incident.“We also demand testing of all mess workers and residents after diligent contact tracing, and compensation for the grieving family of the mess worker who was serving us during the pandemic,” the letter said.Speaking to IANS, a source said, “AIIMS is not taking proper precautions for its residents and staff. Two months ago, we had demanded regular screening and other safety measures like thermal scanner, sanitisers, masks etc. to ensure mess workers are able to work safely without endangering themselves as well as the staff members.

Lawyers’ chambers in the court premises were also sealed.SCBA and SCAORA will arrange for thermal screening and filling up of self-declaration forms by all the entrants and those found symptomatic shall be denied entry.It would be mandatory to use stairs while coming downstairs from lawyers’ chambers, the circular said, adding, there will be a “single-entry point” to every chambers’ block fitted with hand-sanitizer machine...”The circular also advised against use of ACs in chambers, saying it may raise health-concerns in the prevalent pandemic situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-opts-for-odd-even-scheme-to-reopen-lawyers-chambers-88447
22-05-2020||New Delhi||DRI sounds alert over smuggling of infrared thermometers into India from China||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has sounded an alert to different customs formations across the country to check smuggling of infrared thermometers into the country from China, officials said on Friday.The move assumes significance as the demand of such thermometers has spiked in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic."The DRI has sent an alert to inland container depots and the cargo airport in Delhi and other places across the country, dealing with the import and export of commodities from abroad, among others asking them to be vigilant about such smuggling," an official said.He said there is information to suggest that smugglers may under-value or miss-declare these thermometers to illegally import them to India.A good being brought into the country can be under-invoiced with an intention to evade customs duty to defraud the government exchequer.In this method, the invoice being filed with authorities for the import of the goods is falsified to show that the price of goods being imported is lower than the actual price being paid by an importer abroad.India had lost a staggering USD 13 billion, over Rs 90,000 crore, to trade mis-invoicing (that includes under and over-invoicing), equivalent to 5.5 per cent of the value of the country's total revenue collections in 2016, according to a 2019 report by the US-based think-tank Global Financial Integrity.A non-contact infrared/thermal thermometer of a reputed manufacturing firm may cost anywhere between Rs 3,500 and Rs 8,000, according to the websites selling them.The officials also suspect that the smugglers may exploit the free trade zone of Dubai port to route the goods for sending them to India."A strict vigilance is maintained to thwart such attempts to cause damage to the Indian economy and the local manufacturers," the official said, referring to the DRI alert issued recently.The DRI is a federal economic intelligence agency under the Finance Ministry mandated to check commercial frauds among others.The customs formations are on alert to thwart any attempts of smuggling. About 2,500 kg of raw material for masks was intercepted by air cargo export here on May 13.In addition to these, the customs officials had intercepted multiple shipments containing 5.08 lakh masks, 57 litres of sanitiser in 950 bottles and 952 PPE kits at the courier terminal in New Delhi.These were attempted to be smuggled out of the country to the US, UK and the UAE among others, they said.The goods were mis-declared as packing materials for pouches to avoid suspicion and further scrutiny by the customs officials.The export of such goods is prohibited by the government due to the coronavirus outbreak.Many countries have either increased the production of such products or ordered their import owing to domestic demands as they stare at its possible shortage.Customs officials in Chennai recently thwarted an attempt to illegally smuggle out over 1,000 kg of red sanders wood to Malaysia.

Patel, a sub-inspector in Betul district, for letting out what they believed was a secret.Patel had told a lawyer that the police once beat up the latter as he was mistaken to be a Muslim.The suspension became effective from Wednesday.The lawyer, Deepak Bundele, claimed that the police stopped him while he was going to the district hospital in Betul on March 23, shortly after movements were restricted to contain coronavirus.Bundele alleged that the police thrashed him mercilessly before he informed them about his visit to the hospital for treatment.Bundele filed complaints with several authorities, seeking registration of an FIR against the policemen who attacked him. He also filed an RTI application to retrieve the CCTV footage of the incident. However, two months later, he was neither given the CCTV footage, nor was an FIR filed.Investigating officer B.S. Patel visited Bundele's house on May 17 to record his statement."The cops mistook you as a member of the minority community due to your beard," Patel allegedly told Bundele.Bundele then shared an audio clip of the conversation with the local media. Superintendent of Police D.S. Bhadoriya suspended Patel after the clip was shared widely on social media."He allegedly made a comment which should not have been part of the police investigation," Additional Superintendent of Police Shraddha Joshi said.Muslims have been the target of hate crimes since a congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi in March.

22-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Locust problem: India proposes joint response, Pakistan yet to reply||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 22While Iran has already “responded positively”, it remains to be seen how Pakistan reacts to India’s proposal of a coordinated response to control desert locust that have entered India earlier than their normal time of June and July.“It remains to be seen if Pakistan will rise above its narrow-minded approach, as was seen in the case of India’s regional initiative for dealing with COVID-19, and come forward with cooperation on a coordinated desert locust control operation with India,” said a source.To further regional cooperation, India proposed a coordinated response to Iran and Pakistan to control desert locust. India suggested to Pakistan that both countries coordinate locust control operation along the border and that India can facilitate supply of pesticide Malathion to Pakistan, sources said.The institutionalised mechanism of Locust Warning Organization could be energised for such cooperation. India has also offered to supply pesticide to Iran to carry out desert locust control operations in its Sistan-Balochistan and South Khorasan provinces. These efforts will contribute to mitigate the effect of the desert locust not only in these countries, but also for India, the sources added.In addition to the Covid pandemic, this year a new challenge is facing the people of the South Asia and South West Asia region in the form of desert locust. Locust swarm from Pakistan has entered Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, threatening major damage to standing cotton crops and vegetables. Rajasthan is the most affected state.According to a MoEF spokesperson, during the current year, the swarm of locust has entered India earlier than the normal time of June and July. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reports, in Iran, hopper bands of the locust are maturing along the south-western coastal plains, and another generation of breeding is underway in the southeast where hatching is taking place on the coast and in the interior of Sistan-Baluchistan.In Pakistan, adult groups are migrating to the Indian border from breeding areas in Baluchistan where hopper groups are present as well as in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan.FAO reports indicate that the desert locust population is expected to move from spring breeding of Balochistan to summer breeding along India-Pakistan border.In India, more adult groups and small swarms have arrived from Pakistan in the past weeks and moved east into Rajasthan, reaching Jodhpur, say officials.In India, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare leads the efforts in locust control in the country and also spearheads initiatives to foster regional cooperation.With Pakistan, there is an existing institutionalized mechanism for such a cooperation including regular border meetings between the locust officers of the two countries, say sourcesSix border meetings between the locust officers led by Plant Protection Advisers of India and Pakistan are held every year (June to November) either at Munabao (India side) or at Khokhropar (Pakistan side) for exchanging information on locust situation of both the countries, explain officials.Wireless communication between Jodhpur (India) and Karachi (Pakistan) is also maintained every year during this period (June to Nov) for exchange of locust information between the two countries, they say.In addition, regional cooperation on locust control is driven by FAO. India participates in the meetings/sessions of the FAO’s Desert Locust Control Committee; participates and organizes the meetings/sessions of FAO’s Commission for Controlling Desert Locust in South West Asia; and participates in the Joint Survey Programmes with Pakistan and Iran organized by FAO.There is consensus that the desert locust could pose a grave challenge in 2020. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Affairs has already started efforts in the matter. In March 2020, Minister of State Kailash Choudhary participated in a South West Asian Region virtual meeting coordinated by FAO to discuss regional cooperation to combat desert locust problem.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar  has interacted with representatives of Pesticide Manufacturing Industry to fine tune a strategy to prevent locust attacksLocust invasion was first noticed last year and the farmers were taken unawares as it took place after decades.Normally, with the arrival of the monsoon, locust swarms enter the Scheduled Desert Areas of India via Pakistan for breeding in the summer (June-July), but this year, presence of locust hoppers was reported from April 11, 2020Pink Adult Swarms were reported since April 30 in border districts of Rajasthan and Punjab, which have been controlled and control operations against new swarms is going on.One reason for this was the uncontrolled swarms of the previous season in Pakistan that breed continuously. Swarms of Pink Immature Adults fly high and travel long distances with strong winds coming from Pakistan. Most of these Pink Immature Adults settle on trees during the night and mostly fly during the day, say officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/locust-problem-india-proposes-joint-response-pakistan-yet-to-reply-88440

The app has been falsely claiming that calls are end-to-end encrypted when they are not," Chugh said in his petition.The petitioner demanded that it should be banned in India as well until an appropriate law was put in place.Continued use of Zoom was "making the users vulnerable and prone to cyber threats", Chugh said seeking a direction to the Centre to carry out an exhaustive technical study into the security and privacy risks involved.The controversial app posed a security threat and could lead in increase in cyber crimes in India, he said.Noting that COVID-19 pandemic drastically reshaped the way in which consumers, businesses and schools communicated, Chugh said that instead of lending a helping hand to people in need, Zoom violated the privacy of its millions of users by misusing and exploiting their personal information.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-ban-on-zoom-app-88438

22-05-2020||New Delhi||Indian economy to contract in FY21; lockdown compounds economic challenges, says Moody’s||Moody’s Investors Service on Friday said India’s economy is expected to contract for the first time in more than four decades saying economic damage owing to the coronavirus-induced lockdown will be significant with lower consumption and sluggish business activity.Even before the coronavirus outbreak, Indian economy already was growing at its slowest pace in six years and with the stimulus measures announced by the government falling short of expectations, the disruptions are likely to be greater.“We now expect India’s growth to register a real GDP contraction for the fiscal year ending in March 2021 (fiscal 2020-21), from our earlier projection of zero growth,” it said in a research note.It however expected the economy to see a recovery in fiscal 2021-22, somewhat stronger than its earlier forecast of 6.6 per cent growth.“Economic damage as a result of India’s continued coronavirus lockdown, now extended through May 31, will likely be significant and reflect the country’s inherent economic vulnerabilities and fiscal constraints, with wide-ranging effects on both the public and private sectors,” it said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus on March 25. It has been extended thrice, with the fourth phase set to expire on May 31.The lockdown has presented a challenge to the country’s unorganised sector, which accounts for more than half of GDP.The first phase of lockdown largely affected low-income households and daily wage earners.Restrictions have been eased gradually in the subsequent phases as the government attempts to restore normalcy to economic activities. In the current fourth phase, states have autonomy to decide on the delineation of areas into red, orange and green zones depending on outbreak intensity.With India now in the fourth phase of its coronavirus lockdown, the disruption to incomes will likely keep household consumption under pressure for the rest of the year, it said.While the government’s cumulative policy response brings total headline stimulus announcements to a sizeable Rs 20.9 lakh crore, or 10 per cent of GDP, and includes a range of support measures that will bring a degree of relief to rural households and small businesses, the measures are unlikely to offset lower consumption and sluggish business activity resulting from the extended lockdown.“Direct fiscal stimulus spending by the government is likely to be in the range of 1-2 per cent of GDP, as most of the government’s plans take the form of credit guarantees or are aimed at easing liquidity concerns for affected sectors,” Moody’s said. “The quantum of direct fiscal spending falls short of our expectations and is unlikely to provide much additional impetus to growth.”      Moody’s said the economic shock from the lockdowns and fiscal policy response is expected to result in significant slippage from the central government’s budgeted deficit target of 3.5 per cent of GDP for fiscal 2020-21.While the direct fiscal spending by the government in the stimulus is limited to 1-2 per cent of GDP, weaker overall revenue and disinvestment receipts (from government asset sales), will likely drive up the deficit in fiscal 2020-21, it said.Before the start of the lockdown in March, activity indicators such as passenger car sales (a proxy for urban demand) and motorcycle sales (a proxy for rural demand) already pointed to weak household demand.Also, inflation had outstripped nominal wage growth, reducing the purchasing power of rural households.Preliminary estimates from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy indicate that the national unemployment rate surged to more than 20 per cent within a week of the lockdown, a nearly threefold increase compared with the rate before the pandemic.“Even as restrictions gradually ease, disruption to incomes will likely weigh on household consumption for the rest of the year. Lower consumption and sluggish business activity will result in a sharp decline in India’s economic growth in fiscal 2020-21,” it said.The rating agency expected the economic shock from the coronavirus and the fiscal policy response to result in significant slippage from the central government’s budgeted deficit target for fiscal 2020-21.Stating that asset quality of financial institutions will deteriorate and finance companies’ liquidity will be under pressure, it said asset quality will deteriorate significantly, although it will not be visible in near-term reported numbers because of regulatory forbearance.Automobile, oil and gas, and mining companies will bear the brunt of the downturn. Corporate sectors that are sensitive to consumer demand, sentiment and supply chain disruptions will be particularly hard hit. Companies that provide essential goods and services have low exposure, it said.Weaker demand, it said, will weigh on power and transport sectors. “Power demand will likely weaken substantially in fiscal 2020-21. The transportation sector will be under severe stress because of the decline in consumer demand and travel restrictions,” it noted.The economic slowdown will hit the performance of commercial vehicle and micro, small and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) loans. “The effects will be more significantly negative if the outbreak spreads and suspension of business activity is prolonged,” it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-economy-to-contract-in-fy21-lockdown-compounds-economic-challenges-says-moodys-88423

22-05-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS doctors planning to study how long coronavirus can survive in dead bodies||AIIMS doctors are contemplating an autopsy of a COVID-19 victim to study how long the coronavirus can survive in a corpse and if it can transmit the infection, the Delhi hospital's forensic chief said.The study will also help ascertain how the virus affects the organs, Dr Sudhir Gupta said.An informed consent will be obtained from the legal heirs of the deceased for it, he said, adding that many more departments like pathology and microbiology would be involved in the study.  "It is going to be a first-of-its-kind exercise and thus has to be planned meticulously. It will help us understand how the virus behaves in the body and the way it affects the organs. Also, it will help us assess how long the novel coronavirus can survive in a dead body," Dr Gupta explained.On Tuesday, the apex health research body ICMR said COVID-19 is a respiratory infection and mainly spread through aerosols.As per the available scientific literature till now, the survival of virus gradually decreases with time in a dead body but there is no specific time limit to declare the body non-infective.So, it is advisable to adopt precautions and non-invasive autopsy technique, it stated.Non-invasive autopsy technique as described in ICMR guidelines should be used, if at all required, to prevent the risk of spreading the infection to mortuary staff, police personnel and contamination of mortuary surfaces."If an autopsy surgeon feels that he will not be able to conclude cause of death or any other related issue without dissection, then he can proceed with minimal invasive/limited internal dissection."However, the dissection has to be performed keeping in mind that the conduction of autopsy is a high-risk procedure which is potentially as hazardous as any other procedure performed on the body of a COVID-19 patient," the guidelines said.The Indian Council of Medical Research said limited studies had been conducted on post-mortem samples of patients who died due to COVID-19.Most of the pathological studies are in consensus with the clinical features and clinical course of the disease in general. But the disease also gives pathological damages to organs like heart, liver, kidney, brain, blood vessels and other organs, it said.

22-05-2020||Mumbai||RBI ramps up economic support; cuts interest rates, extends loan moratorium||In a surprise move, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday slashed key rates even as it forecast a negative GDP growth for the current financial year.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the repo rate was being slashed by 40 basis points to 4 per cent while the reverse repo rate would also witness a similar cut to 3.35 per cent.Also read: Sense and nonsense of stimulus packageIn his video press conference, Das said the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had voted to maintain its accommodative stance and that five out of six members voted in favour of a rate cut. The MPC meeting was due to be held next month but was held ahead of schedule, Das said.The central bank had on March 27 slashed the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points.Apart from slashing the benchmark rates, the RBI also extended the moratorium on loans by financial institutions by three more months till August 31.“Three-month moratorium we have allowed on term loans and working capital we allowed certain relaxations. In view of the extension of the lockdown and continuing disruption on account of Covid-19, these measures are being further extended by another 3 months from June 1 to Aug 31,” Das added.In his commentary on the country’s economic situation, Das said the economy was witnessing a collapse of demand as suggested by electricity, petroleum products and private consumption data. He further pointed out that government revenues have also been badly impacted. “Private consumption has taken the biggest blow due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Investment demand has halted,” Das said.The governor said a combination of monetary, fiscal and administrative measures were being undertaken by the central bank and the government would create conditions for a revival of economic activity in the the second half of FY21. “But the downside risks to this assessment are significant and contingent upon the containment of the pandemic and quick phasing out of social distancing and lockdowns,” he said.The central bank has predicted GDP growth for FY21 to be in negative territory. Headline inflation, he said, may stay firm in the first half of the financial year and is expected to ease below 4 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of FY21.Das said the measures announced today can be divided into four categories: to improve the functioning of markets, to support exports and imports, to ease financial stress by giving relief on debt servicing and better access to working capital and to ease financial constraints faced by state governments.The Group Exposure Limit of banks is being increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of eligible capital base for enabling the corporates to meet their funding requirements from banks. The increased limit will be applicable up to 30th June 2021, Das said.“It has been decided to relax rules governing withdrawal from Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) while at the same time, ensuring depletion of the fund balance is done prudently. It will enable states to meet about 45 per cent of redemption of their market borrowings which are due in 2020-21,” Das added.Following are the highlights of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das' statement and resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC):     * RBI cuts repo rate by 40 bps to 4 pc * Reverse repo rate reduced to 3.35 pc * Second sharp reduction in key policy rates in 2 months * RBI advances MPC meeting to take key decisions * RBI Governor said it is in growth outlook that the MPC judged the risks to be gravest * GDP growth in FY21 estimated to remain in negative territory, with some pick-up in H2 * Top 6 industrialised states accounting for about 60 pc of industrial output largely in red/orange zones * High frequency indicators point to collapse in demand beginning in March * MPC opined macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated * Various sectors of economy are experiencing acute stress * Economic activity other than agriculture likely to remain depressed in Q1 due to lockdown * Inflation outlook highly uncertain * Moratorium on term loan instalments extended by another 3 months till Aug 31, 2020 * Lending institutions permitted to allow deferment of interest on working capital facilities till Aug 31 * RBI decides to extend time for completion of remittances against imports from 6 months to 12 months for imports made before July 31 * RBI extends a line of credit of Rs 15,000 crore to the EXIM Bank * Maximum permissible period of export credit increased to 15 months from 12 months * RBI announces measures to improve functioning of markets and market participants * Forex reserves increase by USD 9.2 bn in 2020-21 (up to May 15) to USD 487 bn. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-ramps-up-economic-support-cuts-interest-rates-extends-loan-moratorium-88404

They contribute more than 20 per cent of the total production of these organisations”.The MoD, he said, had taken several steps for industries, especially MSMEs, such as extension of response dates of tenders and early clearance of pending payments. The definition of MSME has been revised for expansion. At the same time, there will be no distinction between manufacturing and services sector MSMEs.In government contracts (procurements) of value Rs 200 crore or less, global tenders will not be allowed. This will help MSMEs to grow their business. In the event of being unable to participate in trade fairs due to Covid-19, e-market linkages will be ensured.

But, by the time her destination station in Bihar arrived she had a companion in her arms.Since Shramik Special trains started operating, they have witnessed births of 21 babies onboard, officials say.Mamta had decided to board the train in very difficult times: everybody was battling a coronavirus outbreak, her husband had lost his job as a factory worker in Jamnagar due to the lockdown, she was in advance stage of pregnancy and the home was hundreds of kilometres away.But she made the tough choice, and on May 8 decided to take the Jamnagar-Muzaffarpur Shramik Special train to be with her mother at her village in Chhapra district of Bihar for the birth of the baby.Officials say the train left the Jamnagar stations at 8 pm. Mamta, 35, began to experience the labour pain around the midnight.Though the Railways had said that Shramik Special would be non-stop, this train was stopped at the Agra Fort station so that she could get the medical attention she needed.Officials said doctors were alerted by the on board staff as the train approached Agra Fort station around 4.30 am.Mamta’s compartment was turned into a labour room of sorts with other passengers moving out. A team of doctors along with railway staff supervised Mamta’s condition as she delivered a healthy baby girl, official said.“We have a well-oiled system to deal with medical emergencies,” said railway spokesperson RD Bajpai. “Whenever a passenger needs help, our onboard staff alerts the station where medical aid is available next and the doctors who live in railway colonies around the station are always there to deal with any emergency,” he said. “We are happy that we managed to provide help in time every time and in each case the baby and the mother have been healthy,”Mamta and her little one were allowed to continue their journey, officials said.On May 13, the 20-something Pinky Yadav gave birth to a baby boy on board the Ahmedbad-Faizabad Shramik Special train with the help of RPF personnel.

We also advise them the dos and don’ts, give them medicines and allow them to continue their journeys.“We also provide them ambulance to ferry them to the nearest district hospital. However, one thing must be told. The mother nature takes care of most of it. We are just glad our staffers were there to help.”So far, the railways has run around 2,050 Shramik Special trains and these births, many officials said, provided a ray of hope to all in these difficult times.The West Central Railway has seen most of these births, welcoming seven newborns, followed by three each in the South East Central Railway and the North Central Railway, they said.The Central Railway has seen two such births, while the East Central Railway, the Northern Railway, the Northeast Frontier Railway, the South Central Railway, the North Eastern Railway and the Western Railway one each. The co-passengers, onboard staff and fellow travellers clapped, cheered and whistled to welcome the newborn into the world, officials recall. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/train-of-fortune-21-babies-born-onboard-shramik-specials-88027
22-05-2020||New Delhi||China hindering normal patrol: MEA||In a firm response, New Delhi has rejected Beijing’s suggestions that its troops had crossed the border and instead maintained Chinese troops had recently undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns.‘WE ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE’Indian side remains firmly committed to working for the common objective of maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas.Anurag Srivastava, MEA SpokespersonThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) asserted India’s “deep commitment” to safeguarding country’s sovereignty and security but said it would address all such issues on a direct basis with China.“Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the western sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate.

On the issue of compulsory institutional quarantine of passengers after they reach their destination, the minister said that would not be required as all precautionary measures would be in place before they board a plane.Puri also clarified that given the experience the ministry had gathered while operating flights under Vande Bharat Mission, there was no proposal to keep the middle seat vacant. “Even if the seat is kept vacant, the social distancing norm is not met, and we also had to strike a balance between the interests of flyers and the commercial viability of the airlines,” he said.Meanwhile, the ministry advised the vulnerable people like the elderly, pregnant women and passengers battling health issues to avoid air travel till the pandemic abated. People residing in the containment zone would also not be allowed to travel.All passengers would have to provide their medical details through the Aarogya Setu app or by filling in a self-declaration form.
