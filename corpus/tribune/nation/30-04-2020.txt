30-04-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: 6 more CRPF men of Delhi-based battalion test positive; tally 52||Six more personnel from a Delhi-based battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, officials said.The total number of infected troops in this unit now stands at 52.The men belong to the 31st battalion of the paramilitary, based in Mayur Vihar Phase-III area, that has been entirely sealed after 46 personnel were infected with the novel coronavirus and one succumbed to it over the last few days.Six more out of the 89 samples taken have tested positive for COVID-19, a senior official said.All the troops suffering from the infection have been admitted for treatment to various hospitals in the national capital, he said.A 55-year-old sub-inspector rank official had succumbed to the novel coronavirus on Tuesday.These kind of numbers in a single battalion (that has over 1,000 troops) of the country’s largest paramilitary force has rung alarm bells in the establishment after it was found that “dichotomous” orders were issued to check the spread of COVID-19.While the general order in the force was a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for personnel joining back the unit from leave or having suspected exposure to a coronavirus infected person, CRPF officers said it recently came to light that the medical wing of the paramilitary force issued a separate order sometime in April stating that doctors and paramedics can be taken off the quarantine if they do not show any symptoms after five days.Officials have indicated that the primary source of the COVID-19 infection in this unit is a constable (nursing assistant) who joined this battalion after finishing his leave period at his home in the national capital region.The nursing assistant is posted in another CRPF battalion deployed in Kupwara of Jammu and Kashmir and it is not clear as to how he contracted the infection.It could be possible that some other members from the 31st battalion was the primary source of infection for the unit, they said.The force is investigating all these angles apart from an instance where it was claimed that the nursing attendant was not kept under strict quarantine in the battalion camp leading to spread of the infection.Over 400 samples of troops and their families from this unit have already been collected, the officials said.The 3.25 lakh personnel strong CRPF is designated as the lead internal security force of the country apart from being the mainstay for anti-Naxal operations and counter-terrorist duties in the Kashmir valley. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-6-more-crpf-men-of-delhi-based-battalion-test-positive-tally-52-78580

The state government has said rigorous testing and stringent lockdown conditions had given good results.Chief Minister K Chandershekhar Rao expressed his opinion in favour of extending the lockdown beyond May 3. The state has identified various districts as Covid hotspots and containment zones.The highest numbers of cases have been reported from Hyderabad in the state and a total of 12 districts have been identified as hotspots so far. But despite being the ninth state in the country in terms of numbers, the spread has been well contained.Initially, the state used a firm hand in dealing with violators of the lockdown, but now the Telangana Police is using drones and CCTV cameras to identify those violating the prescribed norms, including staying home, to book them and confiscate their vehicles. Of the 1,016 reported positive, the state has 582 active cases with only 25 deaths so far.Meanwhile, while the nation has banned the sale of alcohol, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government has issued orders allowing toddy tapping in the state. The orders enabling toddy tappers to earn their livelihood were issued by R Karikal Valavan, special chief secretary, today.Nearly four lakh people in the state are involved with toddy tapping as the demand for the naturally brewed liquor peaks in the summer months. Toddy tapping has been allowed after relaxation of lockdown regulations for agriculture and horticulture operations by the Central Government.The move brings respite for toddy tappers, especially in the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh, where the community taps toddy from palmyra trees.At the same time, Telangana has taken the decision to designate senior officials as nodal officers for the movement of people stranded due to the lockdown. IAS Officer Sandeep Kumar Sultania and Additional Director of Police (Law and Order) Jitender will receive and evaluate applications from people who need to travel during the lockdown following the prescribed protocol.They will also request chief secretaries of other states to make transport arrangements to pick up people from their states who are stranded in Telangana, besides making arrangements for bringing back people to Telangana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-12-covid-hotspot-districts-telangana-flattening-the-curve-78560

Indian missions were making exceptional efforts to provide assistance to stranded Indians, he added.It is learnt that the government is working on a mega plan to deploy a raft of naval ships as well as military and commercial aircrafts to evacuate thousands of Indians stranded in the Gulf and other regions after the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown ends.On China’s criticism of the decision by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to stop the use of COVID-19 rapid testing kits supplied by two Chinese companies, the MEA spokesperson said the matter was being handled by the premier medical body.The ICMR, on Monday, had asked states and union territories to stop using the test kits procured from the Chinese companies — Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics — due to “wide variations” in their performance.Srivastava said India had provided 2.8 million hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) tablets and 1.9 million paracetamol tablets to over 20 countries as part of its assistance. India also provided HCQ and paracetamol tablets to a large number of countries on commercial basis, he added.Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible treatment for COVID-19.

30-04-2020||Jaipur||#NoRoomRent: Rajasthan students, unemployed youths plead on Twitter||Facing a slew of hardships for over a month now amid the Covid-triggered lockdown, unemployed youths and students in Rajasthan have initiated a campaign on social media, urging the government to have their room rents waived.Fearing joblessness, financial crisis and a gloomy future, the youths have launched the campaign #NoRoomRent on Twitter.Their campaign against paying room rent during the lockdown has emerged as one of the top trending topics on Twitter.“We are unemployed and helpless. In this lockdown period, everyone has a loss, so do we. We want the rent for the lockdown period to be waived and want the government to get our room rent and coaching classes fee waived too,” wrote Sumit Maharshi on Twitter.Another user, Sunny Joshi, wrote: “We are not living in the rooms right now. Why should we pay the rent for the room? Do something for unemployed students.”Students explained that some of them had not vacated their rented accommodations while leaving for their home towns from Kota or other cities in Rajasthan where they had been pursuing coaching or various courses, thinking that they would return in a month or so to rejoin their classes.In other cases, they said, their coaching institutes themselves had provided for the accommodations for the coaching period and were continuing to charge for room rents.While some students have demanded waiver on room rents and coaching fees, many jobless youths have sought the government to fill pending vacancies, including those for lecturers, Ayurveda doctors, clerks, pharmacists and police in the state jobs.Considering it to be a major issue arising in the state, some leaders and social activists, too, have joined the movement.The Gurjar community leader, Himmat Singh, urged Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to take cognisance of the matter.“I want to request you (Gehlot) that room rents of students studying in cities be waived. They come from families dependent upon agriculture. The room rent for three months is about is Rs 20,000. I hope you will take cognisance,” he said.Upen Yadav, a leader of Rajasthan’s unemployed youths association, Berozgar Ekikrit Mahasangh, too, demanded launch of recruitment drive against vacant posts and waiver on room rents for unemployed youths.“Room rent of students preparing for competitive examinations should be waived. The fees deposited by students before lockdown should either be returned or adjusted,” he said. The Union Home Ministry had issued an order in last week of March, asking landlords not to demand rent from students, workers and migrant labourers, he pointed out. Its implementation, however, seems to be a distant dream, he added.Entire Rajasthan is under lockdown since March 22. About 58 people have died of COVID-19 in the state, where a total of 2,556 positive cases have been reported so far.

Expatriates have mentioned that local Indian missions have started collecting data on those willing to return to India.MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastav said the matter was receiving the attention of the Government but declined to go into the specifics. It would be “premature to spell out plans” as consultations and discussions are underway at the highest levels, he said.The MEA acknowledged that in the current situation, Indians stranded all over the world would wish to return and were undergoing inconvenience.The MEA said the social media storm in the Arab world over the Indian media’s targeting of Tablighi Jamaat should not be the sole yardstick to judge India’s relationship with the Gulf countries.The Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister have spoken to their counterparts of almost all the Gulf countries during which there were requests for medicines and medical teams, the MEA mentioned.In addition, the Gulf leadership also appreciated India maintaining the uninterrupted supply of food and medicines during the Ramzan period. Some of them also wanted to remain connected with India on the post-COVID economic revival approach, Srivastav said at a virtual briefing for journalists.The MEA also gave a lowdown of the MEA’s key role in an Empowered Group set up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to source medical supplies and equipment as well as meet requests for supplies of medicines from abroad.The MEA has ensured the dispatch of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and paracetamol tablets to over two dozen countries besides commercial sales to another 87.Rapid response teams comprising doctors, nurses and paramedical staff were dispatched to Maldives and Kuwait to help train and instill best practices in their health staff on the various aspects of dealing with the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-concerned-about-evacuation-of-jobless-indians-in-gulf-mea-78551

As reported the control server is located in Netherlands.”   In general too, the troopers have been advised to maintain caution while opening suspicious links over social media platforms and email on their mobile handset and secure their phone with latest security patches and anti-virus guard, the officials said.The Aarogya Setu application developed by the government helps people assess themselves on the risk of their catching the coronavirus infection.The app detects other devices having the same facility in its GPS or bluetooth range and captures information regarding COVID-19 positive or linked cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intel-agencies-caution-armed-forces-against-pak-propped-fake-aarogya-setu-mobile-app-78549

How can we give special consideration to lawyers? This is unreasonable for us to do. There may be old ladies, aged persons as landlords. How can we say this?” Vasudeva added there were high density areas and lawyers might lose their office spaces due to non-payment of rents during the lockdown period.The bench said it would not enter into this issue as “lawyers are not entitled for any special consideration”.The senior advocate sought liberty of the court to withdraw the petition saying he would then make a representation to the government.The SCBA had on April 22, filed an intervention application in a PIL filed by Aljo K Joseph, member of the Supreme Court Advocate on Record Association (SCAORA), seeking direction to the Centre for formulating a scheme to support advocates and other professionals in paying their office rent during the COVID-19 lockdown.The PIL filed by Joseph through advocate Sachin Sharma contends that owing to the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COvid-19, they were not able to practice and make any money.“Since there is no financial protection given to lawyers and other professionals by the government of India, the present petition has been filed to urge grievances and hardship caused to the lawyers and professionals in this country due to the COVID-19 pandemic and unavoidable lockdown pursuant to the epidemic situation in India,” the plea has said.It also said the Centre declared the lockdown without any consultation with any of the professional associations and no specific steps had been taken by it to extend any help to support working professionals.The plea has sought directions to the Centre to formulate an appropriate scheme to support advocates and other professionals in the country in paying their rent, exclusively for the professional premises used for practice of the professions or office purpose.

Apart from this, at least 2,000 to 3,000 labourers were reaching the state borders on foot every day, he said, adding that as many as 3,000 labourers from Rajasthan, who were stuck in Madhya Pradesh, had been sent back to their home state.Keshari said as many as 30,000 labourers stranded in various districts of the state were sent back to their hometowns in the last five days.At least 7,000 labourers from Rajasthan and 3,000 from Uttar Pradesh would also be brought back on Thursday, while arrangements were being made to bring back 1,600 workers from Goa, the official said.Meanwhile, labourers expressed their happiness on returning home after remaining stranded in other states during the lockdown.Bishnu Bai, who travelled with 18 of his family members to Naya Gaon border between Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan earlier this week, said, “We had gone to Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) for work and we are now relieved to return to our village in Ujjain district.”Arvind, a resident of Damoh district, travelled from Aurangabad in Maharashtra and reached Harda district on foot. “I work in Aurangabad, but was stranded there because of the lockdown. I managed to reach Harda on foot and the local administration arranged for my food and stay,” said Arvind, who will undergo a health check-up before being sent home.On Tuesday, the state government had brought back about 1,350 labourers from Haryana to Gwalior by bus.

They hired an ambulance and the driver drove them over 3,200 km to reach Udaipur town on April 27.“They were screened at Churabari on the Assam-Tripura border and were allowed to enter the state since they showed no symptoms. The driver was allowed to return as his pass was valid till April 28,” Nath told reporters at the secretariat.“The swab samples of the driver and five passengers were collected for COVID-19 tests. The report of the sample of the driver, who is from Tamil Nadu, came in positive,” he added.The reports of the swab samples of the other five persons were negative, Nath said.The driver was located in Siliguri in West Bengal earlier in the day, he said. The five persons are now undergoing quarantine in Udaipur, the minister added.“Though the reports of the five persons has come in negative, their samples will be tested again for reconfirmation. Their 14-day quarantine is not over yet. So, we shall test them again. Having no symptom doesn’t mean one isn’t infected by the virus,” he said.The government is also trying to find out if anyone other than the passengers came in contact with the driver, Nath added.The minister said about 40,000 people from Tripura were now stranded in various parts of the country, but so far only 6,000 have registered themselves with the state helpline to return home.“It is a tough task to bring all of them back to the state as there is a huge risk in allowing them to enter. Our government is providing all kinds of help to the stranded people,” he said.Tripura would soon start rapid testing for COVID-19, Nath said, appealing to people not to panic. He also urged people of the state not to conceal any Covid-like symptoms and report to the authorities.Tripura reported two COVID-19 cases and both patients have recovered. At present, 307 persons are under surveillance in the state, including 231 in home isolation and 75 in quarantine centres. So far, only 4,613 persons have been tested.

In their applications, the teachers said they had not been paid salaries from January 2020 to March 2020.The court said it had earlier, on August 22, 2019, in its order had said in case of default in salary payment, the schools would have to pay Rs 10,000 per month extra to the petitioners.“In as much respondents (DSGMC and the schools) are in default of the said fees, the order, dated August 22, 2019, passed in the present proceedings, will kick into action and the respondents would also be liable to pay an additional amount of Rs 10,000 per month to the petitioners,” the court said and listed the matters for hearing on May 13.During the proceedings, advocate Jasmeet Singh, appearing for the DSGMC, said parents of several students were in default of fees and that was why the teachers were not paid.The teachers, however, have claimed that the schools had already collected tuition fees from students till March 2020, but were pleading absence of funds to avoid paying their salaries.Earlier on April 24, a division bench of the high court in similar matters involving five DSGMC-run schools had directed that salary arrears be paid in two weeks. The court also said “there can be no justification for non-payment of salaries” when fees was being charged from students.

30-04-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19 pandemic: BCI may consider emergency fund for independent lawyers, says SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Bar Council of India (BCI) may consider  an emergency fund for independent practising advocates who are in need of financial assistance and are “facing a tough time” during the COVID-19 pandemic.A Bench headed by Justice N V Ramana, hearing a plea on the matter through video-conferencing, said it cannot pass direction for the creation of funds and set up a special category for lawyers when unfortunately the entire country is facing a difficult situation.The Bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and B R Gavai, observed that some bar councils have taken up this issue and have also decided to help independent lawyers.“This is something for the BCI to consider,” the bench told advocate Pawan Prakash Pathak, who filed the petition.The apex court, while referring to the coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, said the whole country is suffering and lawyers are also a part of it.Pathak referred to the provision of the Advocates Act and said the BCI is responsible for safeguarding the rights, privileges and interests of advocates.He said that courts and tribunals are closed due to the COVID-19 lockdown and independent practising lawyers are left with no other source of income.He argued that the top court can direct the BCI to take action in this regard as also for the future.The Bench, however, said that it is for the BCI to consider as to how well it is in a position to help.Pathak, who filed the plea along with advocate Alok Singh, said that “advocates are also hit by this lockdown and facing financial crunch and if the lockdown further extend then this pose a serious threat to the life and liberty of the advocates who have litigation as there only source of income.”      The plea has claimed that various state bar associations across the country are coming up with financial aid scheme for advocates but there is “no uniformity or equality” in those policies.It has also sought a direction to the BCI and bar council of states to frame a policy for fund disbursal to independent advocates who are in dire need of financial assistance within specified time limit.

30-04-2020||New Delhi||How can court stop it: SC on inflammatory hashtags on Twitter||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain a petition seeking direction to the government to take measures to stop inflammatory hashtags on Twitter linking members of a particular community to COVID-19.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said it was like asking MTNL to stop people talking wrong things on the phone.“You are saying people are saying wrong things on Twitter. How can the court stop this?" it wondered.Petitioner advocate Khaja Aijazuddin alleged that certain hashtags trending on Twitter attacked members of a particular community by linking them to COVID19.Terming it as unwarranted and unconstitutional, he wanted the top court to ask the government to direct Twitter to stop inflammatory hashtags such as #Islamiccoronavirusjihad, #Coronajihad, #Tablighi Jamat, #Nizamuddinidiots, #TablighiJamatVirus.He said it went against the March 18 WHO advisory that said religion cannot be linked to the pandemic.The petitioner contended that hurting religious sentiments was a crime under IPC and such hashtags might disturb communal harmony.However, maintaining that it can't issue such a pre-emptive direction, the Bench asked him to approach the high court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-can-court-stop-it-sc-on-inflammatory-hashtags-on-twitter-78513
30-04-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ union claims heavy losses, writes to PM for COVID compensation||Unimpressed with the Centre’s assertion of smooth agricultural operations, the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) is claiming heavy losses and demanding an economic package of Rs 1.5 lakh crore to compensate farmers affected by the coronavirus pandemic.The government has maintained that all operations, including harvesting and sowing, and support, relaxations and financial incentives have been performed without a hitch.Lockdown was a good move in the interest of the country but it was announced at the time when farmers were preparing to harvest Rabi crops and to sow Kharif, said BKU.Due to the lockdown, farmers who grow vegetables and fruits lost 80 per cent of their crop while flower and milk farmers lost 100 per cent and 50 per cent respectively of their produce, the farmers union said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra ModiThe government must help the sector with direct income and monetary support because unlike other sectors, a large section of the stakeholders do not have any savings/backup and are in dire straits, as per the letter signed by Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (A).Since the lockdown it had become difficult for farmers to get labourers to harvest the crops standing in fields, he said, contradicting government claims of smooth harvesting and operations.The BKU leader said farmers are facing a massive crisis and the government should immediately provide an economic package of 1.5 lakh crores to compensate for the loss of fruits, vegetables, milk, poultry, fisheries, bee, spinach, and flowers.“The benefit of Kisan Samman Nidhi should be given to all farmers as the first instalment. The amount of Kisan Samman Nidhi should be increased from Rs 6000 to Rs 24,000 and procurement should be arranged for all types of crops, including cotton, wheat, gram, mustard and farmers who have been facing bad weather for a long time should be given a bonus of Rs 200/quintal on wheat,” he saidThe BKU is also demanding one-year exemption on the interest of all types of loans taken by farmers and the availability of fertilizer for Kharif crop must be ensured.Crop loan is taken by farmers producing fruits, vegetables and flowers should be waived and along with self-sufficiency of food grains in the country, pulses and edible oil should also be made self-sufficient. To eliminate the dependence of the country on agricultural imports, farmers should be encouraged and incentivized to produce edible oil and pulses. And their crops must be procured by the government, the BKU is also demanding.Due to untimely rains, the harvest of Rabi crops had already delayed by 15 days. After the announcement of the lockdown, it became difficult for farmers to get labours to harvest the crops standing in fields,” says Tikait.Notably, presenting a very positive outlook for the sector, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar yesterday said that despite a lockdown in the country the sowing of summer crops has increased to 57.07 lakh hectare which is more than 38 per cent over area sown last year and that all agri operations were progressing smoothly.“Even in such trying circumstances and conditions sowing has not decreased and in other related activities the sector is making good progress due to the good practices adopted by the government and hard work by farmers,” Tomar said adding that harvesting had been complete in most areas and good sowing showed there was no shortage of labour.”Despite the lockdown and adverse conditions, harvesting has also not been affected, he added“In GDP the contribution of agriculture remains 3.7 per cent and I am sure in coming days it will not be affected much,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-union-claims-heavy-losses-writes-to-pm-for-covid-compensation-78512
30-04-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses urgent order on plea over migrants' unrest||The Bombay High Court has said the gathering of hundreds of migrants near Bandra station here earlier this month was a one-off incident, and refused to pass urgent orders in a plea seeking deployment of adequate security personnel in the city.Justice BP Colabawalla made the observation while hearing a petition filed by one Shankar Pai and two others, who claimed to be residents of suburban Bandra, Khar and Mahim said they were directly aggrieved by the April 14 incident.The petitioners said such gatherings would increase the chance of the spread of Covid-19.The plea sought a direction to the Maharashtra government to make an assessment if military could be deployed in such vulnerable spots.The petition sought for armed forces, or the Central Reserve Police Force and State Reserve Police Force personnel to be deployed in the city.Refusing to accept the petitioners argument that the Bandra incident demands urgent orders to be passed, Justice Colabawalla said, "One incident does not make out an urgency. These are extraordinary times and the government and civic authorities are doing their best to keep things under control."Nearly 1,000 migrant workers gathered near the Bandra railway station here on April 14, demanding transport arrangements for them to go back to their native places.The migrants were later dispersed and assured that they will be provided accommodation and food till the lockdown lasts, a police official earlier said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-refuses-urgent-order-on-plea-over-migrants-unrest-78507
30-04-2020||---||Covid-19: SC refuses to entertain PIL against use of HCQ and AZM||New Delhi, April 30The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to pass any orders on a PIL by a US-based NRI doctor against use of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZM) to treat serious Covid-19 cases in India."Can a court of law say use this type of treatment or that kid of treatment? Are we experts?" a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana told petitioner Dr Kunal Saha during the hearing via video conferencing.The petition can be taken as a representation to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which can examine it, the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.Saha said patients were dying due to side effect of these drugs. There should be informed consent from them before they were administered these drugs, he added.Saha had April 16 moved the Supreme Court against use of HCQ and AZM to treat serious Covid-19 cases in India.He had claimed that the use of HCQ and AZM for Covid-19 treatment was based primarily on “anecdotal evidence” and not on “direct scientific data.”The use of these drugs for treatment of Covid-19 was "potentially-life threatening" contended Saha who is the president of People for Better Treatment.He had urged the top court to direct the Ministry of Health to make necessary changes in the present guidelines for treatment of seriously ill Covid-19 patients, which is based on the use of a combination of HCQ and AZM.He sought to draw the court's attention to an "extraordinary" joint bulletin issued by American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) in the US on April 8 which asked doctors to be cautious during the use of HCQ and AZM in Covid-19, especially for patients with existing cardiac conditions since these drugs have potential to trigger abnormal heartbeat, heart failure and even death.Saha said another multi-national study based on direct analysis of more than three lakh patients in the US and Europe underscored the potential but serious dangers and the urgent need to take precautionary measures for any “off-label” use of HCQ and AZM on Covid-19 patients.He submitted that he had written to the Health Ministry about the serious and potentially life-threatening dangers involved in the use of HCQ and AZM on Covid-19 patients but received no response.He said he had suggested six specific therapeutic measures that doctors should adopt to prevent catastrophic medical outcome while treating a serious Covid-19 patients with HCQ and AZM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-against-use-of-hcq-and-azm-78506
30-04-2020||Washington||Indian Embassy in US contact nationals who wish to travel back home||The Indian Embassy here has started to contact the Indian nationals who wish to return home once the international travel lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic is lifted.The move comes days after the Indian government indicated that a decision will be taken to bring back the Indian nationals stranded abroad after assessing the situation.On April 10, the government said a decision to bring Indians stranded abroad will be taken after reviewing the COVID-19 situation.Ministry of External Affairs Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi said, “Some questions have come about Indians abroad. It is a situation where we cannot give a definite answer because the lockdown is still there. We need to assess the situation… It will be the government’s decision on how we manage the return of Indians from other countries.”        While the first phase is likely to start with countries in the Gulf region, Indians stranded in the UK, other parts of Europe, and the US will be considered after that.The Indian Embassy on Wednesday started sending emails to the community organisations and those who reached out to it in recent weeks.Those interested in travelling back home can register at https://indianembassyusa.gov.in/Information_sheet1. However, no travel dates have been announced yet.There is no official estimate of the number of Indian citizens stranded in the US due to the deadly coronavirus and unable to go back to India because of the travel restrictions by both India and the US.However, many of them are said to be Indian students, whose universities have now closed down for the rest of the academic sessions and those who were here on a short visit. Quite a large number of them have run out of money.“The Indian American community has shown leadership in these difficult times and their spirit of service is commendable. They have been working closely with the Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to our nationals,” India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in a tweet.The Indian Embassy here in coordination with community leaders have been helping these stranded Indian citizens with free accommodation, meals and even financial assistance.On social media, the Indian envoy has been receiving requests from people who wish to travel back home.“Kindly please reopen the international flights ASAP, there are more than 1,800 people stranded in the USA and needing your help desperately,” tweeted one Lavan Kumar.“Please start some flights for Indian citizens on humanitarian grounds. We have critically ill senior citizen parents who are alone and have to be looked after. Please understand our plight and bring this to the notice of the Indian government,” one person pleaded in a tweet to the Indian ambassador.“Sir, when we can expect our return back to India. We got stuck in the USA. Please help sir,” Tushar said in another tweet.“Indian Embassy and Consulate are available for any emergency and special visa situation. And they are exactly doing that. This is our experience across the country. Almost all speakers complemented the Embassy and consulates for the great working relationship between our diplomatic staff and the community,” said Chicago-based  Bharat Barai.“It was a very good initiative by the Ambassador. We have seen no bureaucracy this time,” he said.Sewa International president, Sree Sreenath said that help and co-ordination from the embassy is adding a great value to their coronavirus relief work.

30-04-2020||United Nations||South Asia could face health emergency if children do not receive life-saving vaccine: UNICEF||South Asia could face another health emergency if the unimmunised or partially immunised children in the region—nearly 4.5 million of whom live in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan—do not receive their life-saving vaccine shots due to the COVID-19 lockdowns, the UNICEF has warned.Sporadic outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles and diphtheria, have already been seen in parts of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal, the UN Children’s Fund said.“With lockdowns in place as a part of the novel coronavirus response, routine immunisations have been severely disrupted, and parents are increasingly reluctant to take their children to health centres for routine jabs,” it said.According to the UNICEF, almost a quarter of the world’s unimmunised or partially immunised children—about 4.5 million children—live in South Asia. Almost all of them, or 97 per cent, live in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.The South Asia region is also home to two of the last polio endemic countries in the world, Afghanistan and Pakistan.“Vaccine stocks are running dangerously low in some countries of the region as supply chains have been disrupted with travel bans and cancelled flights. The manufacturing of the vaccines has also been disrupted, creating additional shortages,” Regional Health Advisor for UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) Paul Rutter said.Many of the health facilities throughout the region, where millions of children are normally vaccinated, have been closed and outreach sessions have been suspended, adding to the challenge, he said.“As long as frontline health workers take the appropriate precautions, particularly washing their hands, there is no reason not to vaccinate – in fact, it is crucial that vaccination continues,” Rutter said.Across the region, national mass vaccination campaigns have been postponed. Bangladesh and Nepal have postponed their national measles and rubella campaigns while Pakistan and Afghanistan have suspended their polio campaigns.UNICEF strongly recommends that, where immunisation campaigns are suspended, governments begin rigorous planning now to intensify immunisation activities once the COVID-19 pandemic is under control.“We are very concerned about the impact of not getting children vaccinated,” UNICEF ROSA Director Jean Gough said.“Many of these children are already vulnerable. While the COVID-19 virus does not appear to make many children seriously ill, the health of hundreds of thousands of children could be impacted by this disruption of regular immunisation services. This is a very serious threat. Early action is key,” Gough said.Meanwhile, the World Food Programme (WFP) and UNICEF are urging governments to prevent devastating nutrition and health consequences for the 370 million children missing out on school meals as a result of school closures.For millions of children around the world, the meal they get at school is the only food they will get in a day. WFP and UNICEF are working with governments to support children who are out of school during the crisis. In 68 countries, governments and WFP are providing children with take-home rations, vouchers or cash transfers as an alternative to school meals. The two organisations are also calling for support as they set up to assist governments in the coming months to ensure that when schools reopen, school meals and other health and nutrition programmes resume.

Additionally, up to 7,500 individuals can be referred to the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) by a US embassy in any location," he wrote."Because the rampant religious violence against Afghan Sikhs and Hindus poses an existential threat for them, I urge the US Embassy in Kabul to refer Sikhs and Hindus still in Afghanistan for emergency refugee protection under the USRAP and for the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security to accept this referral without objection to ensure their safety," Khanna said.The letter dated April 18 was also addressed to Joseph Wilson, Charge' d' Affaires, US Embassy in Kabul."There are deeply troubling reports of ties between the Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence and the terrorist organizations that carried out the 2018 and 2020 attacks, which warrant thorough investigation," Khanna said.In 2018, a terrorist group carried out a suicide bombing on a convoy of Afghan Hindus and Sikhs that were on their way to meet with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that killed 19 people and injured 20 others, he added.Just last month, a terrorist organisation linked to an ISIS-affiliate killed 25 Sikh worshippers in Kabul, including a four-year-old girl named Tanya Kaur, he said.During her funeral service, a bomb was detonated, and additional explosives were planted outside their Sikh house of worship. The terrorist group presented the mourners an ultimatum: leave Afghanistan within 10 days or suffer more attacks, he said.According to the US State Department and US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), Afghan Sikhs and Hindus experience systemic religious discrimination.This persecution takes the form of restrictions on religious practices, illegal theft of their property, bullying of children, and judicial bias, he said."As US forces complete our departure from Afghanistan, I am deeply worried about the health and safety of Sikhs, Hindus, and other religious minorities under threat of religious persecution and genocidal violence in Afghanistan," Khanna wrote.Khanna urged the administration to pay attention to the dire situation facing the Afghan Sikhs and Hindus and other religious minorities and enact the suggested policy to protect them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-american-congressman-seeks-refugee-status-for-afghan-sikhs-hindus-78498
30-04-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to stay redevelopment of Central Vista in New Delhi||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the redevelopment of the Central Vista area of New Delhi, saying there was no urgency."During COVID-19, nobody is going to do anything...there is no urgency," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75-acre land in the heart of the capital – involves the demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan. It is planned that a common central secretariat complex and a new Parliament building would be constructed.As petitioner Rajeev Suri said they have approached the authority for clearance, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed the petition."Parliament is being constructed. Why should anyone have any objection?" Mehta submitted.Invoking ‘larger public interest’, the Supreme Court had on March 7 transferred to itself petitions challenging the redevelopment of New Delhi's Central Vista area from the Delhi High Court."In our opinion, it is just and proper that writ petition itself is heard by this Court instead of examining the grievance about the manner in which the interim directions have been passed and then vacated by the High Court,” the top court had said.Earlier, a single judge’s Bench had directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to approach the Court before notifying the proposed land-use changes in the Central Vista.But a Division Bench of Delhi High Court had stayed the Single Judge’s order that had come on two petitions filed by Rajeev Suri and Lt Col Anuj Srivastava challenging the Public Notice inviting objections against the change of land use of several plots of land in Central Vista.Apprehending that the DDA may notify the proposed land-use changes, Suri had moved the top court against the Division Bench order.Suri had contended that the notice inviting objections for the change of land use of several plots in Central Vista was not in conformity with Delhi Master Plan-2021 and other relevant laws and norms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-stay-redevelopment-of-central-vista-in-new-delhi-78496

30-04-2020||---||Loan moratorium: SC asks RBI to examine if benefits being passed on to borrowers||New Delhi, April 30The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the RBI to examine if benefits of its policy decisions were being passed on to the borrowers."It appears that whatever benefits are being given by RBI, they are not being extended to the borrowers. There should be proper guidelines," a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta during a hearing on petitions challenging the March 27 RBI circular on loan moratorium.Issued as part of a Covid-19 relief package, the moratorium is a legal authorisation to debtors to postpone payment of EMIs.The Bench — which asked the petitioners if they had taken any loan — refused to interfere in the matter after they replied in the negative."The RBI may examine it to see the circular issued on March 27 is being implemented by the banks effectively. This is not a PIL issue. However, due to the various issues raised, we request that RBI may examine whether its policy is being implemented in true letter and spirit,” the Bench saidMehta assured the court that it would be considered by the RBI.Several PILs in the Supreme Court had challenged the March 27 Circular issued by the RBI to all banks and financial institutions to the extent it provided for recovery of interest accrued on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period from March 2020 to May 2020.“The State cannot enrich itself nor permit anyone to enrich from the unfortunate situation by charging interest for moratorium period,” one of the petitioners, advocate Amit Sahni, had contended.Most of the petitioners had sought a direction to all banks and financial institutions not to charge interest from their customers during the moratorium period in the larger public interest.     They alleged that the RBI's announcement was eyewash as it provided that the interest shall be chargeable during the moratorium period and the accumulated accrued interest shall be recovered immediately after the moratorium period got over.In his petition, Sahni had pointed out that for a loan of Rs 30 lakh with a remaining maturity of 15 years, the net additional interest was almost Rs 2.34 lakh.It would be unfair to permit banks and financial institutions to charge interest on the outstanding amount for the moratorium period, when the citizens cannot work to comply with the government’s instructions and were compulsorily incapacitated to generate funds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-sc-asks-rbi-to-examine-if-benefits-being-passed-on-to-borrowers-78489

The US is the worst-hit with 1,039,909 cases and 60,967 deaths—the highest in the world.Addressing a news conference here on Wednesday, Pompeo said, “We’re working with our friends in Australia, India and Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Vietnam to share information and best practices as we begin to move the global economy forward.”          “Our conversation certainly involved global supply chains, keeping them running smoothly, getting our economies back to full strength and thinking about how we restructure the supply change chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again,” he said.“One example of our work together is with India. It has lifted export bans on critical medical supplies, including pharmaceuticals, used to treat some COVID-19 patients,” Pompeo said.Over the last few weeks, Pompeo has spoken over phone—at least four times—with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Readout of the calls indicated that ensuring global supply chain figured prominently in their conversations.Pompeo said the US government has provided over USD 32 million in funding to support the COVID-19 response in Pacific island countries.“We’re working with the Burmese government, the United Nations, NGOs, and others to prevent the spread of COVID-19in Burma, including among vulnerable populations,” he said.Referring to a recent report, Pompeo said Americans have devoted nearly USD 6.5 billion in government and non-government contributions to help countries fight COVID-19.“This is by far the largest country total in the world and more than 12 times that of China’s combined contributions,” he said.

The man was arrested but the girl, being a minor, was handed over to the family,” he said.“A month later when the man got out on bail, Rinku insisted on marrying him but her family members refused and instead took her to their village in Rajasthan on March 18 on the pretext of visiting a local deity,” said the officer.The following day, on March 19, they killed the girl and returned to Pune, Kotoki said, adding that the role of other family members is also being investigated.

30-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP silence over killing of sadhus in Bulandshahr comes under attack||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 30The saffron “silence”, rather the “missing outrage” over the killing of two sadhus in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh has come under attack not just by its political rivals but also on the social media. There have so far been no strong Palghar-type reactions from the normally vociferous BJP spokespersons or the Sangh parivaar, who yesterday paid homage to the two sadhus beaten to death in Palghar, Maharashtra.While the RSS's members lit ‘diyas’ in their memory, affiliate Bajrang Dal wrote in blood to Maharashtra Chief Minister Udhav Thackeray, demanding swift justice and warning of a 'bheeshan virod' (strong agitation) if the Maharashtra government tried to sweep the Palghar issue under the carpet.Notably, addressing the RSS cadres recently, chief Mohan Bhagwat had also called it the responsibility of the administration, which is the state government, to keep the law and order in check. “Sanyasis (saints) who pray for the wellbeing of humanity were brutally killed in Palghar. What were the police doing? Such an incident should not have happened,” he had said. While BJP claimed the Palghar killings were intentional, the Maharashtra government had dismissed any communal angle to the incident. And now BJP's political rivals, as also a section on the social media, are wondering why the saffron party and the Sangh parivaar are not showing similar outrage over the killing of the sadhus in Yogi Adityanath-ruled Uttar Pradesh.The answer, observers say, is rather simple. In Palghar, the BJP found a way to corner Thackeray, “an opportunity to undermine the ruling Aghadi coalition” in its difficult times. While Thackeray has been appreciated over the way he has handled the pandemic in Maharashtra, one of the worst hit states in the country, he has been on the back-foot over some non-Covid-19 issuesOne, Thackeray is not a legislator at present and he needs to be nominated on the Legislative Council before May 28, the day he will complete six months in office. Otherwise, he may have to step down as the CM. The Shiv Sena has been accusing Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari for sitting over the Cabinet's recommendation.This apart, Thackeray had to face embarrassment over “special treatment” provided to the controversial Wadhwan family. The communal flare-up after three men, two sadhus and their driver, were lynched by a mob who allegedly suspected them to be child-kidnappers and organ harvesters, added to his pile of woes.Interestingly, when Thackeray spoke to Adityanath he said the Bulandshahr issue should not be communalised. Perhaps it was his way to remind the UP CM of the tough time given to him by the BJP after the Palghar incident. “I spoke to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ji over the phone and expressed concern over the heinous murder of two sadhus in UP’s Bulandshahr. I told him that we are with you. Just the way we acted strongly in such a case, I wish you would do the same and bring the accused to justice. However, I appeal to you that the incident should not be given a communal colour,” Thackeray said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-silence-over-killing-of-sadhus-in-bulandshahr-comes-under-attack-78468
30-04-2020||New Delhi||India needs to open economy in measured way: RBI ex-chief Rajan||India should be cleverer in lifting the lockdown and needs to open up its economy in a “measured way” soon to save jobs, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday, underlining that Rs 65,000 crore should be spent to support the poor amid the crisis.In a first-of-its-kind dialogue broadcast on Congress’ social media handles this morning, Rajan, who was in the US, deliberated on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.The interaction through video conference lasted for about 30 minutes.“We have to be cleverer about opening up...We need to open up in a measured way but as fast as possible so that people start having jobs. We don’t have the capacity to support people across the spectrum for too long. Being a relatively poor country, people start out with significantly lower reserves,” Rajan said.“It is all too easy to have a lockdown forever, but obviously that is unsustainable for the economy,” he said.To Gandhi’s query on how much money is required to help the poor in the current situation, by way of subsidies, food and cash, the former RBI chief said, India needs Rs 65,000 crore to help them in times of pandemic and considering its total GDP, it can afford to do that.“Our GDP is 200 lakh crores, and out of that 65,000 crore is not a huge amount. So, we can do it. If this is for the poor and to save their lives and livelihood, we must do it,” the economist said.India has been in lockdown since March 24 midnight to curb the spread of coronavirus and the same will be in force till May 3.Rajan felt there will be a rethinking on everything in the global economy once the world is out of this pandemic and India could use this opportunity to make its voice heard in the global arena and help make the dialogue multi-polar from being single or bipolar currently.He said India can also find opportunity for its industry and supply chain in the new order.Gandhi said infrastructure connects people and that gives opportunity, but if there is division and hatred, that disconnects people.There is an infrastructure of division and hatred and that causes a big problem, the Congress leader said.Agreeing with Gandhi, Rajan said, “Social harmony is a public good. Having everyone believe that they are a part of this system, an equal part of the system, is essential. We cannot afford to be a house divided especially in these times when our challenges are so big.”          Those who wrote the Constitution realised that there were some issues that one were to put on a shelf and not touch because if “we got into those issues, we would spend a lot of time fighting each other”, Rajan said.Responding to Gandhi’s question on whether there was a crisis of centralization, the ex-RBI governor said he believes that decentralisation is important both for bringing more local information to work and also empowering people.Asked about the authoritarian model, which is questioning the liberal model, being on the rise in more and more places, Rajan said the central authoritarian model—the strong figure—in a world where one is powerless, is sometimes appealing.“Especially, if you can develop a personal rapport with that figure,” he added.“The problem with that is that the authoritarian figure can develop their own sense of ‘I am the power of the people’ and therefore whatever I say goes. My rules apply and not checks and balances, not institutions, not the decentralised structure. Everything should go through me’,” Rajan said.Historically, what has happened is that it has put too much weight on that centre and eventually that collapses, the economist said.During the session, Rajan also posed a few questions to Gandhi, asking him his views on Panchayati Raj to which the former Congress chief said, “It has had a huge effect, but I’m sorry to say it is in retreat.” However, he said the southern states are doing a better job because they are more decentralised.The northern states are centralising power, the MP from Wayanad, Kerala, said.On Gandhi’s question about getting stuck in cyclical lockdowns, Rajan said, “That raises questions that if you reopen, will you go into a third lockdown? So, it does diminish credibility…I don’t think we have to aim for a 100% success — 0 cases. That is unachievable. What we have to do is manage reopening i.e. when there are cases, we isolate them”.Rajan also said there was a need to ramp up testing and go for “mass testing” or pool testing to put a lesser strain on testing infrastructure.On dealing with the economic downturn that would be felt due to the pandemic in the next few months, Rajan said there has to be a prioritization as India’s capacities and resources are limited.“Our fiscal resources are more limited than the West. What we need to do is to decide, how do we keep this economy together. When we reopen, is it sort of able to walk off the sick bed and not be dead at that point?” he said.“Most immediately, keep people well and alive. Food is extremely important. Places where the public distribution system doesn’t go. Amartya Sen, Abhijeet Bannerjee and I have talked about temporary ration cards,” Rajan said.He also said that to address issues of the agricultural sector, workers and migrant workers, the efforts made in Direct benefits transfer (DBT) need to be realised.The former RBI governor also voiced concern over loss of jobs in the country and cited the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy data.

Driving his point home, he said as against requirement of some 30 to 40 lakh nurses, India has 15 lakh nurses, and half of anaesthesiologists are above 50 years who may not risk attending a Covid patient.Stating that the lockdown did help in slowing down the spread, he disfavoured herd immunity policy as it could have had higher cost as in the case of UK. Techno-academic Smita Srinivas said the existing multilateral arrangement has its limitations and no shared agenda with lack of oversight on industrial organisations in health sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-should-push-for-who-reforms-experts-78234
30-04-2020||---||Cong misleading people on loan write-off: Nirmala||New Delhi, April 29The Congress-BJP slugfest, which began on Tuesday over the Reserve Bank of India’s write-off of Rs 68,000 crore in loans from top 50 defaulters, continued today morning as well.In a series of a dozen late-night tweets, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala of “misleading people in a brazen manner by sensationalising facts” and asked them to consult former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on finance-related issues. Surjewala hit back in the morning by accusing Sitharaman of twisting facts. Surjewala wanted to know why the government has written off bank loans worth Rs 6.6 lakh crore since it came to power. He also sought an answer on whether the RBI’s RTI reply dated April 24 of loans write-off of Rs 68,607 crore was wrong or right.Sitharaman pointed out that no loan was waived off. “Upon full provisioning, banks write off the fully provided NPA but continue to pursue recovery against the borrower. No loan is waived off,” she posted.Yet she sought to counter the Congress leaders on the same ground by counter-accusing the UPA government of writing off Rs 1.45 lakh crore in bad bank loans between 2009-10 and 2013-14.She said it was useful to recall the words of former RBI chief Raghuram Rajan that several “bad loans originated in the period 2006-2008... Too many loans were made to well-connected promoters who have a history of defaulting on their loans... RBI could have raised more flags about the quality of lending....” She then dissected the cases of fugitives Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya which include nearly 10,000 recovery suits and over 3,500 FIRs that have yielded Rs 18,332.7 crore in attachment and seizures from the trio.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-misleading-people-on-loan-write-off-nirmala-78233

Our estimate is that the sector will see a growth rate of 3 per cent despite all prevailing adverse circumstances.According to Chand, the prices of major commodities and vegetables were higher in mandis this year than what were last year. “When prices are favourable and terms of trade are better, farmers invest more. Sixty per cent of India’s economy is closed, but in case of agriculture, things are happening,” he said.Chand said positive outlook was based on two factors — a good monsoon and the water availability in reservoirs which would be much higher over last year and average of last 10 years. “There will be plenty of water available for sowing,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sowing-of-crops-up-by-38-tomar-78232

They are applicable to all institutions alike...” The Bench held there was no violation of rights of unaided/aided minority educational bodies to administer their institutions under Articles 19(1)(g) and 30 read with Articles 25, 26 and 29(1) of the Constitution.Several minority educational bodies — including Christian Medical College Vellore Association — had challenged the validity of NEET, contending it violated their right to administer their institutions.The petitioners had argued that the State had no power to compel an unaided minority institution to admit students through a single centralised national examination i.e. NEET.Further, they had asserted that they had the fundamental right to choose the method and manner of admitting their students, subject to satisfying the triple test of having a fair, transparent, and non-exploitative process. Earlier, the top court had in 2013 quashed NEET. But, in 2016, it allowed review petitions against the 2013 verdict and chose not to put a stay on NEET.The top court rejected minority institutions’ contentions, saying the provisions of the MCI/DCI Act and the regulations couldn’t be said to be ultra vires or taking away the rights guaranteed under Article 30(1) read with Articles 19(1)(g), 14, 25, 26 and 29(1) of the Constitution, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-neet-applicable-to-minority-institutions-78226
