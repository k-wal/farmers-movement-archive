These discussions were candid, in-depth and constructive and both sides exchanged views on disengagement at all friction points along the LAC in the western sector of the India-China border areas, he said “The objective of these discussions is to ensure complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the western sector.“We will continue our dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels and have also agreed to have another round of talks soon with a view to achieve this objective,” the spokesperson said.Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded any concrete outcome yet to resolve the military standoff that erupted in early May.  China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials.Asked about the report relating to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the British daily, Srivastava said: “I think you would have seen the response from the Army Spokesperson who has conveyed that these reports are not true and they are completely baseless.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-continue-dialogue-mea-on-ladakh-border-standoff-with-china-172771

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: Delhi court dismisses 44 pleas by police against order discharging foreigners||A court here on Thursday dismissed 44 pleas filed by the Delhi Police challenging the order of the magistrate’s court by which the foreigners were discharged for the offences of attending Tablighi Jamaat congregation here by allegedly violating visa norms, malignantly spreading infection of disease dangerous to life and disobeying quarantine rules.Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav said the revision petitions were devoid of merits.The magistrate court had on August 24 framed charges against 36 foreigners under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (disobeying regulation) of Epidemic Act, 1897.The charges were also framed under section 51 (obstruction) Disaster Management Act, 2005.However, they were discharged for the offences under section 14 (1) (b) (violation of visa norms) of Foreigners Act, sections 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the IPC.The punishment for the offences for which they have been charged ranges from six months to eight years of imprisonment.The police had filed revision petitions seeking framing of charges against the 36 foreigners for the offences for which they were discharged.The police had also filed revision petitions against the order of the magistrate court by which eight foreign nationals from six countries were discharged of all charges under which they were charge sheeted in the absence of any record or any credible material against them.The court said on Thursday in its similar orders passed on the revision petitions filed against the discharge of eight foreigners that the magistrate’s order “was well reasoned which did not call for interference”.Advocates Ashima Mandla, Mandakini Singh and Fahim Khan, appearing for the foreigners, said none of them have admitted that they did preaching or Tablighi work and they have admitted to merely being a follower.Mandla further submitted that there was no violation of any visa conditions.Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava, appearing for the police, said the foreigners allegedly violated the visa conditions as tourist visa does not allow participation in Tablighi work.The public prosecutor further argued that the foreigners had allegedly gone to the headquarters at Markaz and to different places also.The court had on August 24 said there was no iota of evidence to suggest that the present accused had in any manner professed or propagated the principles and doctrines of the Tablighi Jamaat or had indulged in Tablighi work as alleged and discharged eight foreigners of all charges.The 44 foreigners were charge sheeted for attending Tablighi Jamaat congregation here in March, allegedly in violation of visa norms, indulging in missionary activities illegally and violating government guidelines issued in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

There was, however, no confirmation yet from the Pakistan side, he said.In view of the pandemic, all health related protocols will be strictly followed, Srivastava added.Pakistan had in June unilaterally reopened the corridor to commemorate Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s death anniversary but India had rejected the offer due to the pandemic.Pakistan had made the offer again in October but the MEA had pointed out that movement was suspended in the wake of the Covid outbreak.A decision on re-opening of the corridor would be taken in accordance with the Covid protocol and easing of restrictions, said Srivastava.India and Pakistan had signed an agreement in October last year to operationalise the Kartarpur Corridor to allow Indian pilgrims visa-free visit to the holy Gurdwara, located about 4 km inside Pakistan.The MEA also cites a technical hitch that Pakistan needs to make good. It has been over a year but Pakistan is yet to construct a bridge at Budhi Ravi Channel which is ready at the India end. Despite a technical meeting, there is no progress shown by Pakistan, officials have earlier said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/551st-birth-anniversary-of-guru-nanak-dev-special-sikh-jatha-to-visit-gurdwara-nankana-sahib-in-pakistan-172757

It is not as if the two parties have come together today. It was done to keep the Congress out. Besides, in the current circumstances anything can happen. In any case by the next elections, the Kargil NC will also be part of the BJP,” they say. The 2018 elections to the Kargil Hill Council resulted in a hung verdict. Though NC had an alliance with the Congress, later it entered into a coalition with two PDP councillors and four Independents. The PDP councillors joined the BJP, creating its alliance with the NC, they add.  Ahead of the coming DDC (District Development Council) elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP is going hammer and tongs against the PAGD, its main rival. Stating that “Gupkar gang” wants foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir, Home Minister Amit Shah said “Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest”.“Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it.” Shah said, slamming PAGD which is seeking restoration of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir as it existed before the constitutional changes of August 5, 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-kargil-council-bjp-sharing-power-with-nc-which-it-calls-gupkar-gang-172750

We have good cooperation in areas like steel, financial technology, digital domain, but there is a massive possibility of taking it forward,” Modi said at the meeting with his Luxembourg counterpart Xavier Bette.Luxembourg is one of the most important financial centres globally. Several Indian companies have raised capital by issuing Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.Several Luxembourg-based investment funds hold substantial banking and asset management market share in portfolio investments in India.In his remarks, Modi also talked about possible cooperation between the two countries in dealing with the economic and health challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.“When the world is fighting the economic and health challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the partnership between India and Luxemburg can be beneficial for the two countries as well as both the regions,” Modi said.He also welcomed Luxembourg’s announcement to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA).

19-11-2020||New Delhi||EPFO dismisses reports about fall in number of subscribers, contributing firms in October||Retirement fund body EPFO on Thursday dismissed media reports about a fall in the number of firms and subscribers contributing towards its social security schemes in October.The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is a statutory organisation under the Ministry of Labour and Employment.“An article was published in a section of (media) on November 18, 2020 under the caption ‘EPFO subscribers, firms down in Oct’. In this regard, EPFO has categorically clarified that the information contained in the article is incorrect and unsubstantiated,” a Labour Ministry statement said.The article published claims a decline of 30,800 contributing establishments with the EPFO in October from September 2020, and a simultaneous decline of 1.8 million contributing members in October as compared with the previous month, it said.The EPFO has emphasised that the dataset published regarding contributory members and establishments does not match with the official data of the organisation for any of the wage months mentioned.The data published is not based on EPFO’s data and is incorrect, the statement said.The EPFO’s official data regarding contributory members and establishment is published on the 20th of every month in the form of payroll data.The payroll data for any wage month is taken one month after the due date for filing ECR or the electronic provident fund return.Consequently, the data for September 2020 (due date October 15, 2020) shall be taken only on November 15, 2020 and that for October 2020 (due date November 15, 2020) on December 15, 2020, it said.The last payroll data published on October 20, 2020 has shown that except for the month of April and May 2020, there has been a continuous growth trend in net payroll additions till August 2020.The EPFO’s payroll data for month of September will be published on November 20, 2020.In EPFO, the data regarding contributing members and contributory establishments is derived from the Electronic Challan cum Return (ECR) filed by the establishments for any particular wage month.The due date of filing of ECR is the 15th of the subsequent month but employers may pay belatedly with liability of interest for the period of delay.“Due to this flexibility, to be able to file ECR even after due date, EPFO’s contributory member and establishment data for any wage month remains dynamic. In this regard, concluding a count of contributory members and establishments for October, 2020 as on November 16, 2020 is premature and totally erroneous. “Projection of incomplete data from unknown source without considering the dynamics nature of the data is highly objectionable,” EPFO added in the statement.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Everybody can’t be allowed to prescribe medicines, says SC||Everybody cannot be allowed to prescribe medicines, observed the Supreme Court on Thursday while hearing an appeal against the Kerala High Court order which had said that AYUSH medical practitioners can prescribe government approved mixtures and tablets only as immunity booster for COVID-19.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file counter affidavit within a week on the plea against the August 21 order of the high court.The apex court asked Mehta whether there are any guidelines in this regard by the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy).The solicitor general said he would place on record the guidelines on this aspect.“As prayed, one week time is granted. List after a week,” the bench said in its order.During the hearing, the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, said, “Everybody can’t be allowed to prescribe medicines,” and “It may be used as immunity booster but not for treatment.”The high court had passed the order on a plea which had sought a direction to the state authority to ensure that homoeopathic practitioners are immediately allowed to perform in accordance with the March 6 notification of the Ministry of AYUSH, which had said state government shall take steps to adopt homoeopathic system among other systems of medicines in the fight against the menace of Coronavirus.“Advisory of the Ministry of AYUSH is being followed by the government and tablets are given free of cost to those persons as immunity boosters. As per the state medical protocol, COVID-19 affected persons should not be treated by anybody other than the government and those authorised by the government,” the high court had noted in its order.The high court had further noted that as per the medical protocol of the government, doctors practising in AYUSH medicines are not supposed to prescribe any medicines stating that it is curative for COVID-19 disease.“However, as per the advisory, there is nothing prohibiting the qualified medical AYUSH practitioners to prescribe immunity booster mixture or tablets, as suggested by the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, New Delhi,” it had said.“When the Central as well as State Governments have approved prescription of certain mixtures and tablets, as immunity boosters, qualified medical practitioners in AYUSH can also prescribe the same, but only as immunity boosters,” the high court had noted in its order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/everybody-cant-be-allowed-to-prescribe-medicines-says-sc-172744

19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers protesting against agri laws to take highway route to Delhi on Nov 26||Farmers who are protesting against three new farm laws will reach Delhi on November 26 through five highways connecting the national capital as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march call.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and various factions of Bharatiya Kisan Union have joined hands and formed a ‘Samyukta Kisan Morcha’ to press the central government to scrap the three farm laws.The ‘morcha’ has the support of over 500 farmers’ organisations. Various farmer leaders met here on Thursday in connection with the November 26 ‘Delhi Chalo’ march.A seven-member committee has also been formed to coordinate the operations of the ‘morcha’. Addressing the media here, Yogendra Yadav, a member of the panel, and Swaraj India president, said on November 26, farmers will peacefully move towards Delhi through five highways—Amritsar-Delhi national highway (Kundli border), Hisar-Delhi highway (Bahadurgarh), Jaipur-Delhi highway (Dharuhera), Bareilly-Delhi highway (Hapur) and Agra-Delhi highway (Ballabhgarh).“Farmers will demand in one voice that the farm laws should be scrapped. Proposed electricity law should be immediately withdrawn,” Yadav said.“We hope farmers will be allowed to raise their voice in the national capital. If they are not allowed (to enter Delhi), then we have decided that wherever we’ll be stopped, we will sit there and launch a protest for an indefinite period,” he added.The protest call for November 26 and 27 was earlier given by AIKSCC, a body of more than 200 farmers’ organisations across the country.Lashing out at the Centre for “imposing economic blockade” on Punjab, Yadav demanded the government to resume goods trains in the state.Shiv Kumar Sharma, another farmer leader, dubbed the three farm laws as a “death warrant” for farmers.Replying to a question, BKU (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said if the Centre invites them for talks, they will go but will not withdraw their ‘Delhi Chalo’ protest call.Farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.They have been demanding that these new laws should be repealed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protesting-against-agri-laws-to-take-highway-route-to-delhi-on-nov-26-172740

A delayed letter written to Assam CM about ongoing incidence of violence against journalists and urging him to take steps to ensure their safety. Wow so noble,” Patricia, who resigned from her membership of Editors’ Guild recently in protest against the watchdog’s refusal to take up her case, said in a tweet.So the conscience of the Editors' Guild of India is now awakened about a periphery called Assam..A delayed letter written to Assam CM about ongoing incidence of violence against journalists and urging him to take steps to ensure their safety. Wow so noble  In a letter written to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday, the Guild expressed concern about “growing incidents of violence against journalists in Assam”. The letter, signed by Guild president Seema Mustafa, general secretary Sanjay Kapoor and treasurer Anant Nath, mentioned the recent incident of journalist Milan Mahanta being tied to a pole and beaten mercilessly for daring to expose land and gambling mafia of Kamrup district. A video of the assault went viral.The Guild’s letter also mentioned the unnatural death of journalist Parag Bhuyam who was run over by a car. According to the editor of the paper Bhuyam was working for, the reporter was murdered for exposing corruption and illegal activities in the Kakopathar area of Assam.A list containing names of 31 journalists killed in Assam since 1991 was appended with the letter. The Guild said most of these murder cases remained unresolved and urged the state government to take necessary steps so that “media can operate without fear” in Assam.Mukhim quit Editors Guild of India (EGI) on Tuesday in protest against the watchdog’s “complete silence” on a recent Meghalaya High Court ruling which refused to quash an FIR against her and held her guilty of creating communal disharmony through a Facebook post in July.In the FB post, she had commented on an attack on a group of non-tribal boys by a group of tribal youths in Shillong.Accusing the Guild of elitism, the veteran journalist had said that while the Guild was silent about her case, it issued statements condemning the arrest of non-member Arnab Goswami whose arrest was not on grounds of journalistic pursuits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/padma-awardee-editor-of-shillong-times-ridicules-editor-guilds-letter-to-assam-cm-172739
19-11-2020||New Delhi||SC orders Uttarakhand govt to demolish four illegal religious structures in Haridwar by May 31||The Supreme Court on Thursday gave time till May 31, next year to Uttarakhand government to demolish the four illegal religious structures built on public land in Haridwar in view of upcoming ‘Kumbh Mela’ which is scheduled to be held in the city from January 2021.A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah said, “For the reasons given in the application and especially that ‘Kumbh Mela’ is to commence in 2021 and will end on April 15, 2021, we are of the view that the state should be permitted to demolish the illegal structures by May 31, 2021”.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Uttarakhand government, submitted that the state has undertaken to commence proceedings for demolition of the four illegal structures in Haridwar and will remove them by May 31, 2021.Counsel appearing for intervenor ‘Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad’ submitted that the structures, which have been made, should not be demolished.He, however, conceded that the religious structures have been made on the land belonging to the state’s Irrigation Department but added that the said lands were allocated during ‘Kumbh’ period to the ‘Parishad’.The Bench said, “Be that as it may, allotment, if any, is temporary and any permanent structure could not have been constructed and the same is to be demolished.”The four religious structures which are to be demolished are of ‘Nirmohi Akhada’, ‘Nirmani Adi Akhada’, ‘Bhaiyadas Digamber Akhada’ and ‘Niranjani Akhada’ at Bairagi camp of Haridwar.The state government had filed an appeal against the Uttarakhand High Court order of October 8 by which it had refused to extend time till the culmination of ‘Kumba Mela-2021’ for demolishing the illegal structures at Haridwar.The state government had earlier informed the high court that though almost all religious structures built on public lands have been removed in various districts including Dehradun, it would take some time to clear all such structures in Haridwar as many of these properties are used to host ‘Kumbh Mela’.The high court had taken suo motu cognisance of the issue after top court’s December 7, 2009 order in which it was directed that no unauthorised construction shall be carried out or permitted in the name of a Temple, a Church, a Mosque or a Gurdwara etc. on public streets, public parks or other public places.The top court had directed the state governments to frame a policy in respect of the existing unauthorised constructions of a religious nature, which had already taken place.On January 31, 2018, the top court had observed that implementation of its 2009 order should be supervised by the concerned high courts, and remitted the matter to the respective high courts for ensuring implementation of the orders in an effective manner.In compliance with the 2009 order of the top court, the state government framed a policy on May 17, 2016 called ‘The Uttarakhand Policy for Removal, Relocation and Regularization of Unauthorized Religious Structures on Public Streets, Public Parks and other Public Places, 2016’.The Uttarakhand High Court had on January 2, 2020, while hearing a suo motu case noted that the policy decision of the Uttarakhand government, taken on May 17, 2016, had remained unimplemented for the past more than three and half years.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Scheme launched to mechanise sewer, septic tank cleaning Ops in 243 cities by Apr 30||Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday launched ‘Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge’ across 243 cities in the country, a move that aims to mechanise all sewer and septic tank cleaning operations by April 30 next year.Addressing a webinar on ‘World Toilet Day’, Puri said the challenge is to ensure that no life of any sewer or septic tank cleaner is ever lost again owing to the issue of “hazardous cleaning”.The minister, according to a statement, said this is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision, who has always placed the safety and dignity of sanitation workers at the core of the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U).The virtual event saw the chief secretaries, state mission directors and other senior state and union territories coming together to take a pledge on behalf of 243 cities to mechanise all sewer and septic tank cleaning operations by April 30, 2021, and gave their commitment to work towards preventing any deaths from hazardous entry, it said.“The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act (2013) and various judgements of Hon’ble Supreme Court expressly prohibit hazardous cleaning, i.e. manual entry into a septic tank or sewer without protective gear and observing operating procedures,” the statement quoted Puri as saying at the event.He said despite this, recurring episodes of human fatalities among those engaged in cleaning of septic tanks and sewers, typically belonging to the economically disadvantaged and marginalised communities of society, continue to be an issue of concern.The minister also highlighted that the success of the challenge does not only depend on the intent and commitment of political representatives, bureaucrats or municipal authorities but also on the citizens of the country.“Just like citizens have taken complete ownership of the Swachhata of their cities, their involvement in this endeavor is absolutely crucial,” Puri said, and appealed to people to be vigilant and responsible and play their part in saving the lives of the Sanitation or ‘Swachhata Commandos’.Union Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said the challenge will focus extensively on creating citizen awareness on this critical issue along with infrastructure creation for mechanised cleaning and capacity building of workforce.The ministry said that since its launch in 2014, SBM-U has made significant progress in the area of both sanitation and solid waste management.As many as 4,337 Urban local bodies (ULBs) have been declared open defecation free (ODF) (except 35 ULBs of West Bengal), it said.“Besides, over 62 lakhs individual household toilets and over 5.9 lakhs community/ public toilets have been constructed. Additionally, over 59,900 toilets across 2900 plus cities have been made live on Google Maps,” it added.In the area of solid waste management, 97 per cent of wards have 100 per cent door-to-door collection while 67 per cent of the total waste generated is being processed, the ministry said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scheme-launched-to-mechanise-sewer-septic-tank-cleaning-ops-in-243-cities-by-apr-30-172730

It released its first list of candidates on over 20 seats.   The TRS working president KT Rama Rao has ruled out any alliance with its friendly All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Party and at the same time Chief Minister and TRS president K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has launched the poll campaign by declaring a political war against the BJP for what he calls the “Centre’s for its anti-people, anti-farmer and anti-labour policies”.  Announcing that Hyderabad would become the centre of a movement to unite and bring together non-NDA parties onto one platform, KCR said, “Leaders of non-NDA parties, including Mamata Banerjee, HD Kumaraswamy, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati and MK Stalin, will be invited for a meeting to be held in the state capital in the second week of December to give shape and form to the national movement against the regressive BJP”.  Interestingly, KCR did not name Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president and former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu as one to be invited. Naidu was instrumental in forming the “Maha Gathbandhan” against the BJP on the eve of the 2019 General elections when the BJP came back to power with an overwhelming majority of 303 seats in Lok Sabha.  The chief minister took a public jibe at the BJP during a joint meeting of the TRS Parliamentary and Legislative Parties to discuss the GHMC poll strategy with the GHMC division in-charges.   The TRS chief said, “I have already met the Chief Minister of West Bengal (Mamata Banerjee), Kerala (Pinarayi Vijayan), Delhi (Arvind Kejriwal), Odisha (Naveen Patnaik), DMK leader MK Stalin, former UP Chief Ministers and presidents of Samajwadi Party and BSP, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawathi, respectively, NCP president Sharad Pawar, former Punjab Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal, the Left parties and others. We decided to work together on the issue of fighting against the policies pursued by the BJP across the country. A meeting with all these leaders will be convened in Hyderabad in the second week of December where we will discuss a plan of action to take forward the movement across the country. We will stand by farmers, workers and the poor who are suffering due to the Centre’s policies.”  The Telangana Chief Minister said he would give a concrete shape to the “unification process” after the GHMC polls, voting for which will be held on December 1 and results will be announced on December 4. After this he would invite all non-NDA leaders to Hyderabad and form an alliance to check the BJP.  He said he was putting the BJP government on notice as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had done nothing for the country in the past six and a half years and had, in fact, pushed it back with false propaganda and wrong policies. “The onus was now on non-NDA parties to reverse the anti-people’s policies pursued by the Centre and the BJP in the wake of the Congress’ passive partisan politics,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kcr-to-push-for-alliance-of-non-nda-parties-after-ghmc-polls-172728

Both NDB and AIIB are headquartered in China.The loan agreement was signed from the NDB side by its Chief Operations Officer Xian Zhu.The loan will finance the rolling stock, signaling system, operational structures, residences for operational staff, train control and telecommunication system and other miscellaneous works of the corridor.The 82 km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor with a project cost of Rs 30,274 crore will be co-financed under a parallel financing arrangement with these multilateral lending institutions.The elevated corridor will have 24 stations, and of the 82 km distance, 11.5 km will be underground.Civil construction work is in progress on more than 50 km of this 82 km long corridor, according to an official news release.The 17-km long priority section between Sahibabad and Duhai is scheduled to commence operations in 2023 and the entire corridor will be operational in 2025.Three corridors are enlisted in the first phase – Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut, Delhi-Gurugram-Alwar and Delhi-Panipat. They will converge at Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and will be interoperable, read the release.The RRTS stations will be seamlessly integrated with nearby transport modes such as Metro Stations, ISBTs, railway stations, and airports. This clean and green rail-based system will set a benchmark for similar future projects, added the release.“This is a unique multilateral funding arrangement that allows Make in India provision in procurements,” said Vinay Kumar Singh, Managing Director, NCRTC.“With features like multi-modal integration and interoperability, RRTS will lead to polycentric development and significantly curb pollution and congestion in NCR by providing fast, reliable, secure, and all-weather connectivity,” said Vinay Kumar Singh.The implementation of the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor will enable a modal shift in favor of public transport. It is expected that the share of public transport will move from 37 per cent to 63 per cent in the region, which will help in significantly curbing congestion and pollution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/500-mn-brics-bank-loan-for-rapid-rail-system-in-delhi-ncr-172718

19-11-2020||---||Oxford Economics revises downwards India growth forecast; pegs at average 4.5 pc for 2020-25||New Delhi, November 19Global forecasting firm Oxford Economics on Thursday revised downwards its India growth forecast over the medium term to an average 4.5 per cent over 2020-25, from its pre-pandemic projection of 6.5 per cent.In a research note, it said India’s post-COVID-19 scars could be among the worst in the world.“We forecast India’s growth equilibrium to worsen substantially over the medium term, with potential growth averaging just 4.5 per cent over 2020-2025 in our latest baseline, as opposed to our pre-virus forecast of 6.5 per cent,” Oxford Economics said.It said an adequate and well-designed fiscal stimulus would halve this impact by limiting deterioration in pre-COVID-19 headwinds.“But, given the low likelihood of such a comprehensive response, we project India’s GDP per capita to be 12 per cent below our pre-virus baseline even in 2025, implying the largest amount of scarring among major economies globally,” Oxford Economics said.It added that the Indian government has announced various schemes and reforms this year, with an eye on the medium-to-long-term growth.“However, its policy implementation track record is mixed and is likely to have been weakened further by recent social and institutional developments that detract from its capacity to focus on economic policymaking,” the global forecasting firm said.Beyond 2020, Oxford Economics said India remains one of the most rapidly growing economies in our baseline.“But, that is not enough to preclude a large medium-term output loss in the wake of COVID-19,” it said.Oxford Economics said even after the pandemic is contained, India’s economy will have to deal with its aftermath.“It’s likely that headwinds already hampering growth prior to 2020 — such as stressed corporate balance sheets, elevated non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks, the fallout in non-bank financial companies (NBFCs), and labour market weakness — will worsen,” it noted.The resulting long-term scars, it said, would probably among the worst globally and would push India’s trend growth substantially lower from pre-COVID-19 levels.Oxford Economics said that despite having one of the most stringent lockdowns globally, India’s direct fiscal response to COVID-19 so far amounts to just 2.5 per cent of GDP, with the lion’s share of the USD 230-billion fiscal package earmarked for liquidity and financing support schemes.“While we forecast that the central government’s fiscal deficit will widen to 7 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) in 2020-21 from 4.7 per cent in 2019-20, it’s unlikely to deliver a meaningful boost to growth because it’s not the result of a surge in spending,” it argued.Oxford Economics said it expects private investment to continue to be held back by both macroeconomic and financial factors.On the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, the global forecasting firm said while not a reform in itself, the scheme is an important fiscal incentive that could impart a significant boost to manufacturing and investment in principle.Oxford Economics said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, sparked protests last year. The unexpected departure of a second RBI governor in 2018 alongside other senior technocrats from different government offices raised questions about the independence of key institutions, such as the central bank and the nodal statistical agency, it added.“Against this backdrop, we remain cautious on the timeline and magnitude of growth impact that these schemes and reforms could have,” it said.Meanwhile, Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday upped India’s growth forecast to (-) 10.6 per cent for the current fiscal, from its earlier estimate of (-) 11.5 per cent. It said the latest stimulus prioritises manufacturing and job creation, and shifts focus to longer-term growth. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-economics-revises-downwards-india-growth-forecast-pegs-at-average-4-5-pc-for-2020-25-172712

The Commission decided to provide her Rs 20 lakh ex-gratia as an exception, which is the present admissible amount.In 2002, the admissible amount for ex-gratia was Rs 5 lakh.The amount has been transferred to her bank account.Ramesh Kumar of the 45th battalion was deployed for election duty in the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls. On October 8 that year, he died fighting terrorists at a polling booth in Doda Town Hall area.His widow Pramila Devi, who lives in Bhiwani in Haryana, first wrote to the Commission in December 2019 requesting early payment of ex-gratia permissible.Her request was forwarded to the chief electoral officer of Jammu and Kashmir.“There was undue delay in processing in the office of CEO...,” said a letter sent out by the Commission to all state chief electoral officers sensitising them about fast-tracking such matters pending with them.On August 10 this year, Devi wrote an email to CEC Arora requesting his intervention.In his reply, Arora wrote in Hindi: “I personally apologise on behalf of the entire administrative machinery and assure you that your late husband’s supreme sacrifice will always be remembered.”The EC took stern view of the “institutional failure” and lack of sensitivity “bordering on apathy” on part of administrative machinery “which failed to respect the memory of the departed”, said the letter to all CEOs.The EC has also ordered a stock-taking exercise of pending claims of ex-gratia payment in respect of polling officials and security personnel.“A digital database may be created for tracking settlement of such legacy claims and future claims,” it said.

Kataria was elected MLA from Radaur in Yamunanagar district in 1987.The World Toilet Day function was organised by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Jal Shakti Ministry.Kataria referred to his household not having a toilet in the context of the changed situation now when the country has become ODF (open-defecation free) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government.“I will tell you about my personal experience. I became MLA and Minister in Haryana in 1987. My house had first toilet two years after that,” Kataria said, while showering accolades on Modi’s political leadership in making “Swachhta Abhiyan” (cleanliness drive) a by-word, and a people’s movement.Modi had given a call for ODF campaign from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2014 in his Independence Day speech.On October 2, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi last year, Modi announced that country had achieved ODF status.“We will not stop here. The country will achieve the target of ODF Plus as visualised by the Prime Minister,” Kataria said.The ODF Plus include treatment of all kinds of solid and liquid waste, and their recycling for productive purposes, including bio-gas and fertiliser. He said inspired by the call of Modi, the people are hooked to the idea of “total cleanliness”.Kataria said about 60 crore toilets constructed under “Swachh Bharat Mission” must be sustained.He underlined that the Centre’s twin drives of cleanliness, and piped water connection to every rural household under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) are instrumental for overall progress, security and a sense of dignity to an individual.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/got-a-toilet-in-house-after-becoming-mla-union-minister-kataria-172696

You are the one who is guilty,” he said in a series of tweets. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/days-after-taking-oath-bihar-education-minister-resigns-over-corruption-taint-172685

He was sentenced to 11 years in jail by an anti-terrorism court in February this year in two terror financing cases.The 70-year-old JuD chief is lodged at Lahore’s high-security Kot Lakhpat jail.“The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Lahore on Thursday sentenced four JuD leaders, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, in two more cases,” a court official told PTI.Saeed and his two close aides — Zafar Iqbal and Yahya Mujahid — have been sentenced to 10-and-a-half years each while JuD chief’s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki was sentenced to six months imprisonment.“Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta of ATC Court No. 1 heard the case filed by the Counter Terrorism Department, in which the verdict has been announced after the statements of witnesses were cross-examined,” the official said.A total of 41 cases have been registered by the CTD against the JuD leaders, of which 24 have been decided while the rest are pending in the ATC courts. Four cases have been decided against Saeed so far.Thursday’s sentencing comes weeks after Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog — the Financial Action Task Force — retained Pakistan on its grey list till February 2021 as Islamabad failed to fulfil the agency’s six key obligations, including failure to take action against two of India’s most wanted terrorists — Saeed and Maulana Masood Azhar.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. He was listed under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.The FATF had placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.With Pakistan’s continuation in the ‘grey list’, the country may find it difficult to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the cash-strapped nation.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||SC restores dismissed PIL challenging validity of Centre's farm laws||The Supreme Court Thursday restored a PIL, which was dismissed earlier, challenging the constitutional validity of Centre's newly enacted three farm laws on a ground that Parliament lacked power to make legislations on the subject as 'agriculture' is a state subject in the Constitution.  A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, on October 12, had issued a notice to the Centre on a batch of petitions against the three contentious farm laws and had sought its reply in four weeks.However, it had dismissed the PIL filed by lawyer M L Sharma against these statutes by asking him to approach the High Court instead. "We will restore and keep your matter for admission after two weeks," the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said when Sharma claimed on Thursday that he couldn't argue his case on the last date of hearing. In a hearing conducted via video conferencing, the lawyer sought restoration of his dismissed PIL by saying "if I could not appear before the court and argue myself, then it amounts to non-appearance".The bench said it remembered as to what had transpired on the last date of hearing in the case."We had discussed it. The point on which we had dismissed it was that there was no cause of action," the bench said. Earlier, the top court had decided to hear pleas of RJD lawmaker from Rajya Sabha, Manoj Jha and DMK Rajya Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu, Tiruchi Siva, and one by Rakesh Vaishnav of Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress against the three laws -- Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.These laws came into being from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent. These pleas have sought setting aside of these statutes on various grounds .Sharma, in his PIL, has said that these laws are "being contra to the Article 246 of the Constitution" as the agriculture falls in the State list unstead of Union List and hence, Parliament has no power to legislate on the subject. "That the present petition is being filed to decide constitutional questions follow such as whether Parliament has constitutional power to make a law in the subject matter belong to state list," the plea said The agriculture is placed at entry 14 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, it said. 'Entry 14. “Agriculture, including agricultural education and research, protection against pests and prevention of plant diseases," reads the entry 14.

As you know the healthcare workers, who are corona warriors, will be prioritised.

Then those below 50 years who have other diseases,” he said.Vardhan said everything is being decided by experts with a scientific point of view.“We have made a very detailed meticulous plan on this. What we would have to do in March-April next year, we have started planning for it from now only,” he said.The minister said: “We have also initiated an integrated response system against COVID-19 and will also host clinical trials for all the major vaccines. About 20 vaccines are in different stages of development.”He said about 90 to 99 per cent tackling of COVID-19 was only through protecting and motivating others.“You can protect yourself from this deadly virus with small precautions such as wearing a good quality mask properly, maintaining social distance and taking care of hand-hygiene,” he noted.The phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories will also soon start the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||HC raps Delhi govt on Covid situation, asks why it didn't 'wake up' when numbers were spiralling||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the AAP government if it could explain to those who had lost their near and dear ones to COVID-19 in the last 18 days why the administration did not take steps when cases were spiralling in the national capital. The high court, which also asked the government to look at the situation with a "magnifying glass", observed that it was "disheartening" to see that the number of daily deaths due to the virus has increased to 131 and fresh COVID cases have risen to 7,486.Pulling up the Delhi government, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked why it waited till the court intervened to take steps such as reducing the number of people attending weddings to 50 to prevent the spread of COVID-19."You (Delhi government) saw from November 1 which way the wind was blowing. But you turn turtle now because we asked you some questions. The bell should have rung loud and clear when the numbers were spiralling. Why did you not wake up when you saw the situation was deteriorating?"Why did we have to shake you out of your slumber on November 11? What did you do from November 1 till November 11? Why did you wait 18 days (till November 18) to take a decision? Do you know how many lives were lost during this period? Can you explain it to those who lost their near and dear ones," the bench asked.It also noted that Delhi government statements, about the rising COVID cases, to the press appear to be contrary to the submissions made in court.The bench said that while Delhi government ministers were giving press statements to the effect that the third wave of COVID infections has reached its peak and the numbers are going down, the same "is not reflected" in the daily figures and the status report before the court."We can take judicial note of the statements your ministers are making," the bench told senior advocate Sandeep Sethi and Delhi government additional standing counsel Satyakam, who was representing the AAP government.The bench also noted during the hearing that the crematoriums are "overflowing" and the "funeral pyres are burning throughout the night" and asked the Delhi government whether adequate arrangements are in place to cremate or bury the rising number of people succumbing to COVID-19.It said that Delhi government ought to reduce its reliance on the Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) and focus on increasing tests by the more accurate RTPCR method as more and more asymptomatic persons are testing positive and the number of COVID-19 cases is spiralling in the city."Delhi government should have been alive to the fact that RAT is not effective," it said.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.   The bench directed the Delhi government to file a status report, before the next date of hearing on November 26, indicating the funeral/burial arrangements, an increase of ICU beds in its hospitals by an additional number of 663 and number of care homes for accommodating those who cannot home quarantine themselves.On implementation of social distancing norms, prevention of spitting and wearing of masks, the court was not satisfied with the monitoring being done by the Delhi government in some districts where COVID-19 numbers were high.The bench also said the fines being imposed -- Rs 500 for the first violation and Rs 1,000 for every subsequent violation -- did not appear to be a deterrent.It said there appeared to be a substantial disparity in monitoring and imposition of fines in certain districts as compared to others."What kind of monitoring and marshalling are you doing? Look at the situation seriously with a magnifying glass. You have crossed cities like New York and Sao Paolo," the court said.The high court was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking an increase in the COVID-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.  The court on November 11 had pulled up the Delhi government for relaxing norms for public movement and gatherings even as COVID-19 cases were increasing with no household "left untouched", and sought to know if it had any policy or strategy in place to deal with the "alarming" situation.It had directed the Delhi government to file a status report explaining steps taken by it in the last two weeks, when the COVID-19 cases have risen alarmingly, to contain the spread of the infection.Als read: 80 per cent beds in Delhi private hospitals to be reserved for Covid patients from today: KejriwalICU beds with ventilators not available at nearly 60 hospitals in DelhiDelhi govt to increase number of RTPCR tests from 18,000 to 27,000 daily: AAP MLAIn its latest status report filed on Wednesday, the Delhi government has said that it was not allowing all the activities, like reopening of schools, higher education institutions and swimming pools, that have been permitted by the Central government.It also told the court that it banned bursting of firecrackers during Diwali with the view to prevent an increase in air pollution and crowding of people and also prohibited celebration of Chhath Puja in public places, open grounds, river banks and temples.The Delhi government also told the court that it has approached the Centre seeking its sanction for closing certain markets in the city during certain days or hours of a week.It told the court that it was alive to the situation and was making every effort to arrest the spread of COVID-19.However, the bench said that whatever the Delhi government was doing was not enough in the prevailing situation. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-raps-delhi-govt-on-covid-situation-asks-why-it-didnt-wake-up-when-numbers-were-spiralling-172651

19-11-2020||United Nations||UN report cites ISRO efforts in assisting the Indian government to contain COVID-19 pandemic||A report by the United Nations has cited efforts by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to leverage its geospatial tools in assisting the central and state governments towards containing the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting sustainable development projects in the country.The UN report ‘Geospatial Practices for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific 2020' cites the role being played by 'BHUVAN', the national geo-portal developed and hosted by ISRO comprising of geospatial data, services and tools for analysis, in combating COVID-19.“The Government of India and its state governments have taken several steps to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. ISRO has assisted in this by providing and leveraging geospatial tools, in particular, BHUVAN – the Indian Geo-Platform,” the report said.It added that the geospatial information platform provided service in six aspects: tracking, identifying hotspots, vegetable markets, food needed, home isolation and pollution.“Additionally, as India needed a dashboard to better understand the current circumstances in the country, ISRO customised the Geo-portal and developed ‘Bhuvan- COVID-19' at a national level to track the pandemic and update the public on the current situation, ” the report said.The report, released on Wednesday by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), showcases examples from the region's countries employing applications of space technology to advance sustainable development.It said that Asian and Pacific nations are increasingly leveraging space technology and geospatial information to respond to challenges on the ground, including in their efforts to contain the spread and mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The report also said that India has been making significant progress in responding to the demands of today's cities by incorporating robust space technologies and GIS (geographic information system) into the urban planning, transport management and traffic navigation techniques.It said the development of Road Asset Management system for National Highways (NHs) is a flagship project by the National Highways Authority of India in association with the Indian Space Research Organisation and the World Bank.“Bringing both public and private funded roads under one umbrella, the main objective of this project is to assist in accurate and scientific maintenance planning, enhance road safety measures and plan the development of the NH network in India,” the report said.The report also noted that ESCAP, with the support of India, regularly facilitates young professional officials from developing countries in the region to join a nine-month post-graduate course on remote sensing and the Global Navigation Satellite Systems at the Centre for Space Science and Technology Education in the Asia Pacific, in Dehradun.Some of the other practices undertaken by countries in the region and cited in the report include ‘Night-light' satellite images monitoring the impact of lockdowns, ‘heatmaps' to chart out communities vulnerable to the pandemic and its socio-economic consequences, real-time situational analysis, and dashboards integrating a wide gamut of critical information to support decisions are some of the practices cited.The examples, according to the report, show how space applications and geospatial data have played an important role in providing essential location-based and temporal data to make an “overall data map” and snapshots on the COVID-19 pandemic for policymakers and the public.Besides, combining spatial data from contact tracing, quarantining, and social distancing with digital solutions and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven risk analytics can help enhance community resilience.Such applications can also help in the recovery phase to build back better, by providing an evidence base for decisions on the easing of lockdown and the resumption of economic and social activities, the report added.“The effective integration of geospatial data, with existing statistics and ground-based information, will be key to delivering the timely data needed for governments, businesses, communities and citizens to make evidenced-based decisions,” Executive Secretary of ESCAP Armida Salsiah Alisjahjabana said.The report, issued two years after Asian and Pacific countries endorsed an ambitious plan of action on the use of space technologies to support sustainable development also provides a baseline for assessing future progress in the region.In addition to presenting an overview of the status along with thematic areas such as disaster risk, natural resource management, connectivity, social development, energy, and climate change, the report also highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships.  “Many regional and country-based efforts are sparking innovations that attract both public and private capital, supporting start-ups and spinoffs from space applications research and pilots,” said ESCAP.  The report outlined seven key recommendations for policymakers to integrate applications of geospatial information into their planning and actions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-report-cites-isro-efforts-in-assisting-the-indian-government-to-contain-covid-19-pandemic-172644
19-11-2020||Bengaluru||Time for tech solutions that are designed in India but deployed for the world: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said it is time for tech solutions that are designed in India but deployed for the world, and declared that the country is uniquely positioned to leap ahead in the information era.He also called on the industry to make a conscious attempt to take product-level innovations to the next level."India as a country is uniquely positioned to leap ahead in the information era. We have the best minds as well as the biggest market. Our local tech solutions have the potential to go global. India is at a sweet spot. It is time for tech-solutions that are designed in India but deployed for the world," Modi said.Addressing the Bengaluru Tech Summit, 2020 (BTS2020) virtually, Karnataka's flagship technology event, he said, his government's policy decisions are always aimed at liberalising the tech and innovations industry.Recently the government has eased the compliance burden on the IT industry in various ways.Besides, it has always tried to engage with stakeholders in the tech industry and chart out future-proof policy frameworks for India, Modi noted."You all are the drivers of this industry. Can we make a conscious attempt to take our product-level innovations to the next level? A framework-level mindset has the potential to build an eco-system of multiple successful products," he said at the inaugural of the summit attended among others by the Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa.Union IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attended the event virtually.Organised by the government of Karnataka along with Karnataka Innovation and Technology Society, Karnataka government's Vision Group on Information Technology, Biotechnology & StartUp, and Software Technology Parks of India, the summit is scheduled to take place from November 19 to 21.More than 25 nations are participating in the 23rd edition of the event along with thought leaders, industry captains, technocrats, researchers, innovators, investors, policy-makers and educators from India and different parts of the world, officials said.Pointing out that technology is setting the pace for the defence sector to evolve, Modi said, earlier wars were determined by who had better horses and elephants, then came the era of fire-power, now technology is playing a very important role in global conflicts.From software to drones to UAVs, technology is redefining the defence sector.Also highlighting that with the rapid increase of tech use, data protection, as well as cyber security, has become very important, he said, our youth can play a big role in devising robust cyber security solutions, which can effectively "vaccinate" digital products against cyber attacks and viruses."Today our Fintech industry is also doing very well, millions of people are doing transactions without any hesitation," he said, adding that this is because of people's trust, which is very important to be preserved and made stronger.A sound data governance framework is also our priority, Modi said.The Prime Minister also said that the scope and need for innovation are relevant in the fields of science as well."Be it bio-sciences or engineering, innovation is the key to progress. India has a clear advantage when it comes to innovation because of the talent of our youth and their zeal to innovate," he said.Pointing out that Digital India has become a way of life, particularly for the poor, marginalised and for those in government, Modi said, thanks to Digital India, our nation has witnessed a more human-centric approach to development."Our government has successfully created a market for digital and tech solutions, but it has made technology a key part of all schemes. Our governance model is technology-first.Through technology, we have enhanced human dignity. Millions of farmers receive monetary support in one click. At the peak of the Covid-19 lockdown, it was the technology that ensured that India's poor received proper and quick assistance," he said.Modi also lauded the resilience of the country's tech sector during global lockdowns, travel restrictions, and said it used tech solutions to keep work going on, from home and from anywhere.The tech industry recognised a great innovation opportunity in bringing people together."The Covid-19 pandemic was a bend in the path not the end...The amount of tech adoption that would not have happened in a decade happened in just a few months," he said.The summit will have the participation of more than 200 Indian companies setting up their virtual exhibition, more than 4,000 delegates, 270 speakers, around 75 panel discussions and more than 50,000 participants every day, officials said.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/time-for-tech-solutions-that-are-designed-in-india-but-deployed-for-the-world-modi-172640

The teams lay in wait for nearly an hour after which an African national approached the taxi in which the woman was waiting. When he attempted to take the parcel, he was overpowered by the sleuths. An accomplice of the African national was also apprehended,” said the DRI official.During this, the role of another Mumbai-based woman in the drug smuggling racket was uncovered, the officials said, adding that sources confirmed that this woman was currently holidaying in Udaipur. Then another DRI team from Ahmedabad was dispatched to Udaipur and with the help of local police the woman was apprehended and was taken to Mumbai on transit remand, they said.The officials said it also came to light that the second apprehended woman was a history-sheeter, who was arrested by Mumbai police only last year and the woman who had come to collect the parcel from the courier company also had a criminal background and both women had networked while they were in jail last year.“Investigations have revealed that this syndicate had cleared multiple consignments of cocaine in the past and the total quantity of cocaine smuggled by the same modus operandi was over 3.3 kg since August 2020, priced at Rs 20 crore,” another DRI official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dri-busts-international-cocaine-smuggling-racket-arrests-2-indian-women-2-african-nationals-172639
19-11-2020|| Kolkata||Radio-tagged falcons fly over 5,000 km non-stop across Arabian Sea||Imagine travelling over 5,000 km non-stop without using any transport and crossing a sea en route! Chiulon and Irang, two Amur Falcons radio-tagged in Manipur, have been found to have flown more than 5,000 km at a stretch to reach the deserts of Somalia from the rainforests of the north-eastern state.After spending close to 20 days in Manipur and adjoining areas the two satellite-tagged Amur Falcons: Chiulon and Irang set out on their second-year migration on 11 and 12 Nov. They have now arrived in Somalia covering 5700 km and 5400 km in five and half days nonstop flight. pic.twitter.com/HxMy6JqnNzThe birds had returned to Manipur last month after covering over 29,000 km which formed their annual migratory circuit.On October 31 and November 1, 2019, five Amur falcons — three named after Manipur villages (Puching, Chiulon and Phalong) and two after Manipur rivers (Irang and Barak) — were radio-tagged at Tamenlong in Manipur as part of a joint endeavour between Manipur Forest Department and Wildlife In, Dehradun.Irang reached Chandel, about 200km from Tamenglong, on October 25, 2020. Chiulon reached Tamenglong three days later. An elated Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) announced the arrival of the birds in a tweet. “A milestone has been achieved in the conservation efforts of birds, as an Amur named Irang, tagged in Manipur has returned to the state after completing its migratory route full circle & covering 29,000km. Another Amur named Chiulon also arrived in the state yesterday,” stated the MoEF&CC tweet.Radio contact could not be established with the three remaining falcons (Puching, Phalong and Barak) fitted with a satellite device. “Barak was last located on the Meghalaya-Bangladesh border. Then we lost contact”, Dr R Suresh Kumar, a scientist with the Endangered Species Management Department of Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, told the Tribune.It turned out that three weeks was enough rest for the two falcons who could be tracked by researchers. “After spending close to 20 days in Manipur and adjoining areas the two satellite-tagged Amur Falcons - Chiulon and Irang - set out on their second-year migration on 11 and 12 Nov. They have now arrived in Somalia covering 5700 km and 5400 km in five and half days nonstop flight”, Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, tweeted on Wednesday evening.  Suresh Kumar said Chiulon reached Somalia on November 16 evening. It arrived in the Somali desert 200 km north of Mogadishu. Irang reached Somalia the following day, Kumar said. The two birds made it across the Arabian Sea ending their nonstop flight from Manipur covering over 5000 km in five days and 13 hours. The visit by Amur Falcons to Somalia coincides with the arrival of swarms of desert locust that is currently threatening croplands and pastures in Somalia. “From termites in NE India to locusts in Somalia, Amurs truly are biocontrol agents,” Tamenlong Forest Division of Manipur said in a post on its Facebook page.Amur falcons are small migratory birds of the size of a pigeon. Suresh Kumar said the birds breed in northern China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/radio-tagged-falcons-fly-over-5-000-km-non-stop-across-arabian-sea-172638
19-11-2020||Washington||China perceives rising India as 'rival'; wants to constrain its partnership with US, allies: Report||China perceives a rising India as a "rival" and wants to constrain its strategic partnership with the US, its allies, and with other democracies, the State Department said in a report, emphasising that Beijing intends to displace America as the world's foremost power.Coming ahead of the transition of power from Donald Trump's administration to President-elect Joe Biden's administration after the November 3 US presidential election, the detailed policy document highlights that China is undermining the security, autonomy and economic interests of many nations in the region."China perceives rising India as a rival and seeks to impel it to accommodate Beijing's ambitions by engaging economically while constraining New Delhi's strategic partnership with the US, Japan, Australia and its relations with other democracies," the report said."China is undermining the security, autonomy, and economic interests of many others in the region — such as member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including those in the vital Mekong Region, as well as the nations of the Pacific Islands," the report added.The 70-page report states that awareness has been growing in the US - and in nations around the world - that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has triggered a new era of great-power competition."Yet few discern the pattern in China's inroads within every region of the world, much less the specific form of dominance to which the party aspires," said the report.The CCP aims not merely at preminence within the established world order — an order that is grounded in free and sovereign nation-states, flows from the universal principles on which America was founded, and advances US national interests —but to fundamentally revise world order, placing the People's Republic of China (PRC) at the center and serving Beijing's authoritarian goals and hegemonic ambitions."In the face of the China challenge, the US must secure freedom," said the report.China, it said, seeks to diminish US influence by fostering a sense in the region's nations that China's dominance is inevitable."Prime targets include US treaty-based allies — Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines — as well as emerging strategic partners such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Taiwan," it said.The People's Liberation Army, the report said, recently provoked skirmishes along its disputed border with India, which killed dozens on both sides, and remains in a tense standoff with India's military.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died.The report also highlighted Beijing's hard relations with Taiwan, which it claims as its territory."Beijing menaces democratic Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, intending to reunify Taiwan with the Mainland — by force if necessary. And the PLA Navy and Chinese Coast Guard increasingly challenge Japan's administrative control of the Senkaku Islands," it said."The Trump administration achieved a fundamental break with conventional wisdom. It concluded that the CCP's resolute conduct and self-professed goals require the US and other countries to revise assumptions and develop a new strategic doctrine to address the primacy and magnitude of the China challenge," according to the document.The report also highlighted the outbreak of contagious coronavirus from China's Wuhan city. The disease has so far infected 56,178, 674 people and killed 1,348,348 others across the world. The US is the worst affected country."The CCP's recklessness in allowing the novel coronavirus born in Wuhan to develop into a global pandemic coupled with the concerted disinformation campaign that Beijing undertook to conceal China's culpability should put doubts to rest. Yet many people lack a proper understanding of the character and scope of the China challenge,” it said.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi zoo gets Bengal tigress from Kanpur for conservation breeding||The Delhi zoo has got a Royal Bengal tigress, the first in six years, from the Kanpur zoo for breeding proposes under an animal exchange programme, officials said on Thursday.The tigress, Barkha, is six years old. She will form a pair with Karan, who is also aged around 6.The Delhi zoo did not have a Royal Bengal tigress for six years despite it being a participating zoo for the Conservation Breeding Programme of Bengal Tiger, according to its Director Ramesh Pandey.According to the Central Zoo Authority, the Conservation Breeding Programme is a science of conserving a species by preventing imminent population collapse in the wild due to a large number of eliminative pressures such as habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, industrialisation, poaching, illegal trade and climate change, etc.The Delhi zoo had three Royal Bengal tigers till a year ago. One of the three tigers, eight-year-old Rama died at the zoo in September last year due to kidney failure. He was brought from the Mysore zoo in 2014.At present, the zoo has two male Royal Bengal tigers -- B2 or Bittu and Karan -- and seven white tigers -- three females and four males.Officials said 15-year-old Bittu was not in good health and reports suggest very high presence of creatinine that affects the functioning of kidneys.Recently, the Delhi zoo acquired five species -- wild boar, black and grey partridge, golden pheasant, Eurasian dove and jungle cat -- from Chandigarh's Chhatbir Zoo.A male rhino from Patna will be brought soon for breeding purposes. There are two female rhinos in the Delhi zoo at present, Pandey said.It is also likely to acquire chinkara and a pair of ostrich from Chandigarh and a pair of striped hyena from Jaipur. The last chinkara of the zoo had died in June last year."There are around 88 species in the Delhi zoo at present. We hope to increase this number to 100 by the year end,” Pandey said.

"Can the state say no we will treat him in Taloja? We are only saying transfer him to Nanavati for two weeks. We will further see after two weeks," they had noted.They added that Rao should not be discharged from the hospital without informing the court, and that his family should be allowed to meet him at the hospital."It goes without saying that the state will bear the expenses (of his hospital stay)," the bench had added.The next hearing in the case is scheduled on December 3.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||At 9.4 degree C, Delhi records coldest morning this season||The minimum temperature in the national capital dropped to 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday morning, the lowest this season so far, due to cold winds blowing from snow-capped western Himalayas.        The minimum temperature on Thursday was three notches below normal. The city recorded a low of 10.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.     Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius from November 19 to November 21.The average minimum temperature from November 22 to November 26 is 11.3 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting center of IMD, had earlier said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years.The IMD had earlier predicted a drop in the minimum temperature in Delhi as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall.The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality poor, may deteriorate as temperature dips||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Thursday morning and is likely to deteriorate further amid a dip in the minimum temperature.A change in the wind direction has also increased the share of stubble burning in the city's pollution slightly.Delhi's air quality index was recorded at 272 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 211 on Wednesday and 171 on Tuesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said the northwesterly winds increased the stubble contribution slightly on Wednesday.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 8 percent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Wednesday. It was 3 percent on Tuesday.Around 800 fire points were observed in Punjab, Haryana and western Pakistan on Wednesday. However, their impact on Delhi-NCR's air quality will not be significant, Soni said.     The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to remain in the “moderate” and the lower end of the “poor” category on Thursday and Friday.However, SAFAR said it may deteriorate to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Friday and Saturday, “as the conductive meteorological environment created after rainfall is slowly retreating”.The minimum temperature settled at 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday – the lowest this season so far -- and the maximum wind speed was predicted to be 10 kmph, according to IMD.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.      Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 5,000 m2/s on Wednesday and is likely to be 7,500 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air.

Its northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari went a step ahead, saying it is “strange to see how treacherous the Delhi CM can be. You (Kejriwal) will not allow “Chhath” under the guise of social distancing and do false drama of seeking guidelines from the Centre. Tell us after following which guidelines you have taken the permission to serve liquor 24 hours in the city,” he said re-tweeting message posted by his office. Tiwari re-tweeted another post, which said, “Corona does not spread if you worship in a public place with your entire Cabinet.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Bolstering democracy, secure Indo-Pacific Biden’s priorities||US President-elect Joe Biden provided a snapshot of the altered relationship with India during his phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi late Tuesday night.Among the five priorities highlighted by Biden were “strengthening democracy at home and abroad” and maintaining a “secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region”.Change in emphasis Donald Trump, in contrast, went easy on the lockdown in Kashmir as well as on the CAA and NRC protests in India. On the Indo-Pacific, Trump had pushed for a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, whereas Biden’s terminology is a “secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific”. Analysts interpret this change in emphasis to mean that Biden will not be at daggers drawn with China like the Trump administration.The other three focus areas are launching the global economic recovery, combating Covid and future health crises, and tackling the threat of climate change, according to the readout provided by the Biden transition team.The Indian version of the Modi-Biden phone call did not delve into similar wordplay. It said PM Modi reiterated his firm commitment to the Indo-US strategic partnership.Biden’s first phone call was made on November 10 to Canadian PM. The conversation with PM Modi was clubbed with a round of calls with leaders of Chile, Israel and South Africa. The transition team’s readouts of each of the conversations showed that Biden was prepared with country-specific issues.Biden also spoke about “strengthening democracy” with Chile’s billionaire President Sebastian Pinera. With Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu, he promised unstinting support to their security interests but also said he would “address the many challenges confronting our countries”, in an indication that the Trump-Jared Kushner approach to Israel may see modifications.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bolstering-democracy-secure-indo-pacific-bidens-priorities-172391

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Those unhappy with Cong can leave: Adhir||Days after the Bihar poll loss, the Congress continued to spar publicly with the party’s Lok Sabha leader today saying those unhappy with the party were free to leave.Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s jibe was targeted at former minister and Congress MP Kapil Sibal, who recently criticised the party leadership for its inertia in the face of election debacles.“Those unhappy with the functioning of the Congress and its state of affairs are free to leave. They have the freedom to form a new party or join any other if they feel the Congress is not the place for them,” said Adhir reacting to Sibal’s remarks that the people did not see the Congress as a viable alternative anymore and that time for introspection was over.Adhir also questioned Sibal if he had campaigned in Bihar elections or any of the previous ones.“Sermonising from air-conditioned rooms is easy and lecturing others without doing anything yourself is not called introspection. Sibal enjoys proximity to the Gandhis and could have flagged his concerns in party forums instead of embarrassing the Congress in public. He is senior and has access to party’s top leaders,” said Adhir, who is a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee.Adhir is the second senior Congressman to take on Sibal for his public remarks against the party. The first was Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. The ongoing open bickering in the Congress signals a massive churn within and a section of the Congress feels matters could well be headed towards a split.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/those-unhappy-with-cong-can-leave-adhir-172398
