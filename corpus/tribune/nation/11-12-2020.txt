This, as you know, is the responsibility of the host government.”“Regarding the protest in front of our High Commission in London and our Consulate in Birmingham, UK authorities took necessary action to ensure the safety and security of our premises and our personnel,” he said at an online briefing.To another question on designated Khalistani terrorist Paramjit Singh Pamma spotted at protests in the UK and whether India had taken up the issue with the UK officially, Srivastava said the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has filed a charge sheet a couple of days back against 16 foreign-based Khalistanis in the referendum 2020 case and the list includes Pamma.“As of now, I understand that further investigation is going on in this case as well as in earlier cases. Whatever action is required, will be taken,” he said.Farmers in India are protesting the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

11-12-2020||United Nations||UNSC Sanctions Committee allows Rs 1.5 lakh monthly expense for 26/11 plotter Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi||The UN Security Council's 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee has given a go-ahead for a monthly payment of Pakistani Rupees 1.5 lakh for Mumbai terror attack plotter Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, a proscribed UN terrorist, to meet his expenses.The Sanctions Committee this week approved the payment that will include expenses of about Rs 45,000 for medicines, food (Rs 50,000), public utility charges (Rs 20,000), lawyer fees (Rs 20,000) and transportation (Rs 15,000) to be accessed monthly from Lakhvi's bank account, which has been frozen since he is a listed terrorist, sources said.Lakhvi, 60, was designated as a global terrorist by the UN in December 2008 for being associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Al-Qaeda and for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of” both entities.Proscribed terrorists and entities are subject to an assets freeze, wherein all states are required to freeze funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities, a travel ban that prevents the entry into or transit through nations' territories by the designated individuals and an arms embargo.The 1267 Committee has also approved a request by the Pakistan government for a monthly payment to Mahmood Sultan Bashir-Ud-Din, a nuclear scientist who founded and served as a director of Ummah Tameer e-Nau (UTN) and who was listed by the UN in 2001.UTN provided Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the Taliban with information about the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.During UTN visits to Afghanistan, Bashir-Ud-Din met Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda leaders and discussed nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. During 2001, Bashir-Ud-Din also met Taliban leader Mullah Omar.During a follow-up meeting, an associate of Bin Laden indicated that he had nuclear material and wanted to know how to use it to make a weapon.Bashir-Ud-Din provided information about the infrastructure needed for a nuclear weapons program and the effects of nuclear weapons.In September last year, 26/11 mastermind and banned JuD chief Hafiz Saeed was allowed by the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee to withdraw money from his bank account for basic expenses on Pakistan's request.The Security Council Resolution 1267 provides for states to sanction basic expenses of the designated individuals if there is no objection over it.As per the rules of the Sanctions Committee, approval for such expenses for designated terrorists is granted unless all 15 members of the Committee oppose it within three days of getting such a request.Even if only one member state does not oppose the request while the rest do, the approval is deemed granted.However, this raises questions about whether a monthly amount of as high as Rs 1.5 lakh for expenses is reasonable for a designated UN terrorist, and that such access to funds constitutes circumvention of the asset freeze and the sanctions regime.

11-12-2020||London||Vijay Mallya applies for funds held by UK court from sale of French property||Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya on Friday made an urgent application before the UK High Court seeking access to millions of pounds to cover his living expenses and legal fees from funds held with the Court Funds Office as part of bankruptcy proceedings, initiated by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India.Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Robert Schaffer declined to allow a draw down from the court-held funds of an estimated amount of around 1.5 million pounds, accrued from the sale of Mallya’s French luxury property Le Grand Jardin earlier this year, until further arguments in the case.However, he did allow the release of 2,40,000 pounds plus VAT to cover the legal costs of a substantive hearing in the bankruptcy proceedings scheduled for next Friday.“In essence, I will adjourn this hearing subject to one caveat that the fees for the hearing next week are covered,” concluded Judge Schaffer, during a hearing held remotely on Friday.Mallya’s counsel, Philip Marshall, had argued that his client needed urgent access to the substantial funds held by the court to cover his living and legal expenses, as had already been set out by a validation order of the High Court from last year.Unless the court grants a validation order, prospectively or retrospectively, any payments made whilst a bankruptcy petition is pending are void.“With ongoing proceedings in India and the UK, Dr Mallya cannot wait for something to live on and to cover his legal expenses. With substantial sums outstanding [to lawyers] and no other source of income, it is absurd to refuse,” argued Marshall, warning that without the money Mallya would not have any legal representation for the important hearing next week.“That would put him at a very serious disadvantage and be a denial of justice,” he said.The court heard that 64-year-old Mallya’s income from two consultancy agreements was no longer coming in and therefore he had to resort to the money derived from the sale of his French property, which was deposited with the court as a “convenient place to put the money”.Barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, arguing on behalf of SBI and others in the class action, disputed the grounds of the urgent application as being based on a pre-approved 2019 court validation order.“The [2019] order dealt with payments out of his [Mallya’s] income. This [application] is referring to payments out of capital assets, which is a very different animal,” said Shekerdemian.“It is a substantial portion of his admitted UK assets and even on a limited urgency basis, cannot be approved,” she said, accusing Mallya of trying to “jump the queue” to gain access to the funds before the substantive hearing in the bankruptcy case next week.The SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd, had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018.There have been a series of hearings in the case since then as part of their efforts to recoup around GBP 1.145 billion in unpaid loans.Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail as the UK Home Office deals with a “confidential” legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can sign off on his extradition sought by the Indian government, on charges of fraud and money laundering related to loans acquired by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.The separate extradition proceedings have gone through different levels of legal procedure in the UK courts and concluded that he has a case to answer before the Indian courts.

11-12-2020||New Delhi||WHO, vaccine manufacturers in Southeast Asia discuss fast tracking COVID-19 vaccines||The World Health Organization, national regulatory authorities and vaccine manufacturers in WHO South-East Asia Region discussed fast tracking of COVID-19 vaccine rollout in member countries, a statement said."The vaccine manufacturing and regulatory sectors have a critical role to play in equitable and efficient deployment of vaccines," said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, at the two-day virtual meeting that ended on Friday.The meeting deliberated processes and timelines to fast-track registration of COVID-19 vaccines in countries using the "Emergency Use Listing procedures" while comprehending the landscape of COVID-19 vaccine production in the region.According to Singh, all the countries in the region were "developing and finalising" national deployment and vaccination plans for COVID-19. She added that regulatory preparedness was a core component of the process."Establishing expedited regulatory pathways for vaccine approval and adjusting regulatory pathways to the type of vaccine that is developed and filed for approval remains critical as emergency use authorisation will precede full licensure."While vaccine licensure systems may need to be modified, having standard operating procedures and stipulated timelines for emergency use authorisation would be vital," Singh said.While emphasising on effective coordination, collaboration and information-sharing, she said manufacturers, regulators, policy-makers and planners must continue to work together to optimise and refine vaccine deployment."Countries in our region are among the world's largest vaccine manufacturers, and the vaccines produced here are likely to be administered to billions of people globally. I am certain that together, in solidarity with all people of the region and world, you will effectively contribute to health and well-being of all," Singh said.Participating vaccine manufacturers from India were India Bharat Biotech International Ltd, Biological E Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd, Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Wockhardt Limited.Other participants included, key global and regional partners such as GAVI and UNICEF, as well as vaccine manufacturers like Bio Farma Limited from Indonesia, and Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), Bionet Asia Co Ltd and Siam Bioscience from Thailand.This was the second such meeting with vaccine manufacturers and regulators organised in WHO South East Asia Region, with the first held in April.The expert group recommended that all countries should ensure availability of "high-quality, complete and timely" COVID-19 surveillance data on all risk groups, including migrants and remote or displaced populations, for decision-making related to vaccination.The group added that countries should also leverage their experience in vaccine delivery platforms for adults, including experience with seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination and Measles and Rubella and Japanese Encephalitis vaccination campaigns to find effective ways to reach eligible adults with COVID-19 vaccines."Adjustments should be made to vaccination strategies in accordance with the COVID-19 prevention measures and plans developed for demand generation, community engagement and risk communication, with special consideration for overcoming vaccine hesitancy."Countries should leverage the use of existing networks, including those for polio, to support the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines where appropriate," the expert panel said.It also highlighted the need for all countries to assess available cold chain space and meticulously plan cold chain requirement, including necessary improvements in storage, stock management, vaccine delivery strategy and waste management.--- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-vaccine-manufacturers-in-southeast-asia-discuss-fast-tracking-covid-19-vaccines-182946

However, he got interim bail from a court there, which asked him to appear before the agency in Kolkata on November 9.He told CBI sleuths on that day that he was a suspected COVID-19 case and the agency asked him to come back on November 24.The CBI on November 17 arrested a BSF commandant for his alleged involvement in the cattle smuggling racket. It is alleged that cattle smugglers used to bribe BSF and customs officials to keep their illegal business running.Haque was earlier arrested in 2018 by CBI for allegedly bribing another BSF commandant and is out on bail in that case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cattle-smuggling-racket-kingpin-surrenders-before-cbi-court-182943
11-12-2020||New Delhi||If govt wants to talks to farmers, it should convey that formally: BKU leader Tikait||If the government wants to talk to farmer leaders, it should be formally conveyed like in previous occasions, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait has said on Friday, asserting that anything less than the scrapping of the new agri laws will be accepted.The government on Thursday asked farmer groups to consider its proposals for amending the Acts to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want.“They (government) should first tell us when and where they want to meet us as they did for previous formal talks. If they invite us for talks, we will discuss that with our coordination committee and then take a decision,” Tikait told PTI.The BKU leader said there was no question of returning home until the government repealed the three laws. Asked whether the government has sent any invite for further discussion, he said the farmer unions had not received anything as such.“One thing is very clear that farmers will not accept anything less than scrapping of new agriculture laws,” he said.Farmers leaders on Thursday announced they would block railway tracks across the country if their demands were not met by the government and would announce a date for that soon.However, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has expressed hope there would be a resolution soon.“The government is keen and ready for further discussions with protesting farmers. To clear their apprehensions, we have sent our proposal to farmer unions. I want to urge them to fix a date for discussion as early as possible. If they have any issue, the government is ready for discussion,” he had said during an address to reporters along with Food, Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.The Agriculture Minister had also said it was not proper on the part of the farmer unions to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing, and urged them to return to the discussion table.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) condemned Tomar for his comments and claimed it was the government which remains adamant on not repealing the laws.In a statement, it remarked that the farmers’ organisations were ready for talks and have responded for every previous discussion proposed by the government.Another farmer organisation — the All India Kisan Sabha — said: “AIKS rebuffs the allegation of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar that the kisan organisations were wrong in intensifying struggle while the discussion was going on.”It stated that the farmers’ struggle would be intensified in the coming days until their demands were met.At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and representatives of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, protesting on various borders of the national capital for about two weeks but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws.The sixth round of talks between the government and farm union leaders, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning, was cancelled.

11-12-2020||New Delhi||India hits out at Russia, China on Asia Pacific, LAC tensions||India on Friday hit out at both Russia and China for recent observations by their Foreign Offices on the Indo-Pacific and tensions on the line of actual control (LAC), respectively.India also countered Chinese claims on cancellation of a joint issue of a postage stamp to commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties.Also read: Ladakh standoff result of China’s move to change status quo, says MEA“India has always pursued an independent foreign policy based on its national interest. India’s relationship with each country is independent of its relations with third countries. We hope that this is well understood and appreciated by all our partners,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s comments on India earlier this week.Speaking in the context of Quad, Lavrov had said the West was drawing India into anti-China games as part of a “persistent, aggressive and devious policy”.The West was also attempting to undermine Russia’s close partnership and privileged relations with India.The MEA assured that India’s ties with Russia stand on their own merits including in the sphere of military technical cooperation (MTC), an area identified by Lavrov as being targeted by the West. At the same time, it said India does not see the Indo-Pacific region as a strategy or as a club of limited members or as a grouping that seeks to dominate.The MEA also rebutted its Chinese counterpart’s charge of India being responsible for the tense stand-off on a part of the LAC.Srivastava said contrary to the Chinese MFA’s claims, the situation for the last six months is due to Chinese actions to unilaterally change the status along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh.The core issue remains that both sides need to strictly follow the various bilateral agreements and protocols in their entirety which requires no amassing of troops.Srivastava said the Indian expectation is that further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on complete disengagement in all friction points.India also rebutted claims by the Chinese embassy that Beijing had cancelled the joint release of commemorative stamps to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations because no feedback was given by the Indian side.As the launch of the 70th anniversary celebrations has not taken place, the issue of going ahead with joint activities under its ambit does not arise, said Srivastava.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hits-out-at-russia-china-on-asia-pacific-lac-tensions-182935

This excludes possibility to trade any types of weapons and military equipment, or being engaged in any other but non-military sector.The company said it has made a representation to the US State Department pointing out that a harsh decision has been imposed without asking it for an explanation.

The state police provided a bullet proof car and a pilot to JP Nadda, which was in addition to the escort (state vehicle provided to CRPF personnel) and PSOs from CRPF that Nadda was entitled to as a Z-category protectee.The DIG (Police) of the range was stationed in the area to personally supervise the police arrangements.Four additional superintendents of police (ASPs), eight DySPs, 14 inspectors, 70 SIs/ASIs, 40 RAF personnel, 259 constables and 350 members of auxiliary forces were deployed on the route and at the venue at Diamond Harbour, Bandopadhyay wrote.The chief secretary added that while the central protectees had their own arrangement, state government provided them with additional security over and above the central arrangement.Nadda’s convoy was attacked by TMC supporters on Thursday when he was heading toward Diamond Harbour, Lok Sabha constituency of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee.While Nadda himself escaped unhurt, a number of other members of his entourage, including BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, sustained injuries in the assault.Following the incident, the Home Ministry swung into action and Chief Secretary Bandopadhyay and DGP Virendra were asked to meet Bhalla for a discussion on the law and order situation including the attack on Nadda’s convoy.The state government officials were asked to meet Bhalla at his chamber in North Block at 12-15 in the afternoon on December 14.Bandopadhyay, in his letter to Bhalla on Friday, wrote that three cases, including two for vandalism, had been registered already in connection with Thursday’s incident. Seven persons had been arrested in these cases.Stating that West Bengal government was addressing the attack issue “with utmost seriousness” and obtaining and compiling further reports, the chief secretary wrote to Bhalla to dispense with their (his own and the DGP’s) presence in the proposed meeting on Monday.Earlier, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also told press persons here today that he too had sent a report to Delhi today on the law and order situation in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-govt-says-multiple-vehicles-messed-up-naddas-security-arrangement-182926
11-12-2020||New Delhi||Ladakh standoff result of China’s move to change status quo: India||India on Friday blamed China for the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, insisting this was a result of the actions by the neighbouring country to effect a “unilateral change” in the status along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The assertion by Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava came a day after the Chinese foreign ministry again held India responsible for the border situation in eastern Ladakh.Also ReadIndia hits out at Russia, China on Asia Pacific, LAC tensionsReferring to China’s comments that it “strictly” observes the bilateral agreements and is committed to resolving the border issue through dialogue, Srivastava said New Delhi expects Beijing to match its words with actions.The MEA spokesperson also rejected China’s claim that it had to cancel a joint launch of a commemorative stamp with India as New Delhi did not give its feedback on the matter within the agreed time-frame.“Our position has been very clear and has been articulated several times in the past. The situation that we have seen since the last six months has been a result of the actions of the Chinese side which has sought to effect a unilateral change in status along the LAC in eastern Ladakh,” he said at a media briefing.The spokesperson was replying to a question on China again blaming India for the border standoff.“These actions are in violation of the bilateral agreements and protocol on ensuring peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the India-China border areas,” he added.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson on Thursday blamed India again for the border standoff while reacting to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s comments that bilateral ties have been “very significantly damaged” following violation of various border pacts by China and that it has given India “five differing explanations” for its actions.“We have taken note of the Chinese side’s statement that it observes ‘strictly the agreements between the two sides and is committed to resolving the border issue through dialogue and safeguarding peace and tranquillity’ in the border areas. We expect that the Chinese side will match its words with actions,” Srivastava said.The armies of India and China are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May. Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks. However, no breakthrough has been achieved yet.Srivastava said the two sides have continued to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels.“It is our expectation that the further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” he said.The MEA spokesperson said the core issues remains that both sides need to strictly follow the various bilateral agreements and protocols in their entirety, including the 1993 and 1996 agreements on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the LAC.He said the pacts require that there should not be amassing of troops, each side should strictly abide by and respect the LAC and should not take any unilateral action to alter it.Asked about China’s comments that it had to cancel the joint launch of the commemorative stamp with India to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties as New Delhi could not provide its feedback on the matter, Srivastava called it factually incorrect.“Joint release of commemorative stamps to mark the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and China was one of the activities agreed with the Chinese side last year. However, there had been no discussion on any launch date with any Chinese authorities for this activity,” he said.“We have also seen the Chinese embassy’s tweet suggesting that this event was cancelled by the Chinese side on account of no feedback given by the Indian side before the launch time agreed by both - this is factually incorrect,” he said.Srivastava said the launch of the 70th anniversary celebrations itself has not taken place yet, adding, therefore, the issue of going ahead with joint activities under its ambit does not arise.

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt sensitive towards farmers; in discussion with representatives to resolve concerns: Tomar||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday has said some “anti-social elements” are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants’ movement under the guise of farmers and appealed the protesting farming community to be vigilant against their platform being misused.He also said the government was sensitive towards farmers and was in discussion with them and their representatives to resolve their concerns.“A proposal to resolve the farmers’ objection has also been sent to the farmers union and the government is ready for further discussion,” Tomar tweeted.Also read: Congress, AAP to hold protests in Punjab on Dec 14 in solidarity with farmersIf govt wants to talks to farmers, it should convey that formally: BKU leader TikaitKhalsa Aid India sets up makeshift massage centre for protesting farmersBhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) moves SC against farm lawsBJP to hold nationwide programmes to highlight benefits of three farm lawsTagging a media report about posters coming up at farmers’ Tikri Border protest site demanding release of some activists arrested under various charges, Tomar said: “Anti-social elements are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasant movement under the guise of farmers.”“I appeal to the peasant brothers to be vigilant and not provide their platform to such anti-social elements,” he added.Farmer leaders had on Thursday insisted that their ongoing protest against the Centre’s new farm laws was “apolitical”, after photos of protestors at the Tikri Border went viral in which they were seen holding posters demanding the release of writers, intellectuals and rationalists, arrested under various charges, on the occasion of the Human Rights Day.Addressing a press conference at Singhu border, another protest site, farmer leaders said they had refused many political leaders to use their platform.When asked about supporters of a farmers’ union at Tikri border demanding the release of writers, intellectuals and rationalists by displaying posters of people like Umar Khalid and Sudha Bharadwaj among others, who had been arrested under several charges, the leaders they were not sure of what went on at Tikri border.They said the incident at the Tikri border may be the farmers’ way of observing Human Rights Day.Thousands of farmers have been staying put at Delhi border points — Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) — for nearly two weeks against the Centre’s new farm laws.In September, former JNU students’ leader Khalid was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for his alleged role in the February northeast Delhi riots. Delhi police had in November filed a supplementary charge sheet in a court here against Khalid and JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a case related to the alleged larger conspiracy in the communal violence.The government had on Thursday asked farmer groups to reconsider its proposals for amending the Acts to address their concerns and said it was open to discussing its offer further whenever the unions want, but protesters remained defiant and threatened to block railway tracks too in addition to highways.At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Central Government and representatives of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for the repeal of the three contentious laws and repeatedly rejecting the Centre’s offer to make some changes in law and give written assurances or clarifications on few issues such as MSP and mandi systems.When asked at a press conference on Thursday whether there was some other force behind the protest, Tomar did not give any direct reply and had said: “Media’s eyes are sharp and we will leave to it to find out.”“The press has to explore and use your investigation skills to find out,” Food, Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said in reply to a similar question.“We believe that the farmers had certain issues. We respect farmers came and discussed with us. We tried to address the issues that came up during the course of the discussion. If there are other issues which are to be discussed or need clarification on the current proposal, we are ready for that. Whether there is any other reason holding them back, we will leave that to your wise counsel,” Goyal added.

It will give employment to locals besides furthering Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a self-reliant India," Quiriyal said.Five flower containers will be kept at Triveni Ghat -- the oldest bank of the Ganga in Rishikesh -- and unemployed young men will be tasked with collecting flowers offered to deities by devotees in temples and homes and depositing them in the containers, he said.These youths will be paid by the incense manufacturing units, he said, adding that the state government will not have to spend a single penny on the project.Initially, the project will be Rishikesh centric. If the experiment succeeds, it will be extended from Gaumukh to Gangasagar, Quiriyal said.A cottage industry has already been set up in Keregaon for making organic incense sticks out of these flowers by a private entrepreneur.

The least we could do is to represent her monumental contribution by including her life in our school education syllabus," the Congress leader said in a message to the CM.He went on to say, "Just as one cannot deny the role of KCR, nobody can deny the role of Sonia Gandhi in Telangana formation. While KCR's and various others' role in the state formation has been mentioned in school syllabus, why not mention Sonia Gandhi's role too," Dasoju asked.He said that but for Sonia Gandhi, who was the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and president of the Congress party, Telangana’s existence would be still a dream for many.Telangana state was formed on June 4, 2014 and the resolution for the same was passed in Parliament on February 20, earlier that year.The state government has included a chapter in the social studies textbook for Class X, highlighting the role of KCR in the formation of Telangana state.The 14-page chapter mentions the revival of the Telangana movement by KCR in 2001, his fast-unto-death in 2009 and the mass protests led by him for the statehood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-congress-seeks-chapter-on-sonia-in-text-books-182918

11-12-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Telangana CM in Delhi, hopes to get central aid||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, December 11Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) left for a three-day visit to the national capital on Friday.He is expected to raise various pending issues with the Centre, especially the pending disbursement of funds due to the state.A strong supporter of a federal setup, KCR has been vocal about the Centre being partial in terms of disbursement of funds to BJP ruled states.KCR left in a special flight from Begumpet airport on Friday morning. He is expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, besides other Central leaders.This would be his first meeting with the PM since the start of the farmers’ agitation. KCR has supported the farmers’ agitation and gave a bandh call in the state on December 8.Apart from meeting Union Ministers Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Hardeep Singh Puri, the Chief Minister is likely to visit the site allocated by the Central government for setting up the Telangana Rashtra Samithi party office in New Delhi. The centre has already cleared the proposal of allotting land in South Delhi for a party office and intimated the state about it.The CM is also expected to meet Union Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Nitin Gadkari.Telangana has demanded over Rs 5,000 crore central aid for providing relief to those who suffered during the unprecedented floods and rain in Hyderabad this October. In the absence of any grant from the Centre, the state has disbursed Rs 550 crore from its own funds.KCR has already announced that he would act as a unifier of all non-BJP political parties to provide an alternative to the nation in terms of a strong opposition.In light of his vocal outbursts, it is yet to be seen how welcome the Chief Minister is made to feel in the national capital, especially after the BJP has gained some ground in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections and feels no need to cozying up to Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS).KCR is expected to return to Hyderabad on Sunday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cm-in-delhi-hopes-to-get-central-aid-182913

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Vohra committee report: SC refuses to entertain plea, says prayers are utopian||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea seeking a Lokpal-monitored investigation into the “criminal-political nexus” as flagged in the 1993 Vohra Committee report, saying the prayers “are all utopian”.The top court said that petition must serve the purpose and it does not encourage petitions which are for publicity.A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy asked the petitioner advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay to withdraw his plea and granted liberty to make a representation to law commission.At the outset, senior advocate Anupam Lal Das, appearing for Upadhyay, said the petition relates to the issue of unholy nexus of criminals, politicians and bureaucrats.The Bench said over two decades have gone by since the report was filed. Das replied that they have been taking baby steps and today, there is a Lokpal but it does not have the wherewithal and has no investigation wing. The Bench said, “Look at your prayers. They are all Utopian. It is like a utopian situation. It’s like I hope our country will be at the top in the world. You should write a book on it, don’t file a petition on this”. Justice Kaul said, “I don’t encourage such petitions which are for publicity. The petition must serve the purpose”.Das then told the top court that he will withdraw the petition but liberty may be granted to approach law commission. The Bench allowed the petitioner to withdraw and granted the liberty to approach law commission. Upadhyay through his PIL has prayed for appropriate direction for Lokpal Monitored Investigation of the criminal political nexus, as referred by the Vohra Committee. Former Union Home Secretary NN Vohra headed the committee formed to study the problem of criminalisation of politics and the nexus between criminals, politicians and bureaucrats in India.The report was submitted in October 1993.He has sought a direction to the Union Home Secretary to handover the true copy of the Vohra Committee Report with annexures and notes to the Director- NIA, Director- CBI, Director- ED, Director- IB, Director- SFIO, Director- RAW, Director- NCB, Chairman- CBDT and Chairperson- Lokpal.Upadhyay has also sought direction to respective chiefs of probe agencies to take appropriate steps for comprehensive investigation of criminals-politicians nexus referred to in Vohra Committee Report and chairperson of Lokpal should monitor the investigation. In the alternative, he sought setting up of a judicial commission to monitor the investigation by different probe agencies.He also sought direction to Union home secretary to withdraw the Padma Awards given to politicians-public servants mentioned in the Vohra Committee report. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vohra-committee-report-sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-says-prayers-are-utopian-182910

A farmer would not have the knowledge to negotiate the best terms with a private company.DMK MP Siva also raised similar issues against the farm laws and said they “are prima facie unconstitutional, illegal and arbitrary”.He contended that the Acts are anti-farmer, brought out during the COVID-19 pandemic to benefit few corporations who are close to the corridors of power.The plea of Congress Lok Sabha MP from Kerala, TN Prathapan has not be listed so far for the hearing in the court.

11-12-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan panchayat polls: Rivals Congress, BJP join hands at two places, ditch own allies||In unlikely collaborations, rivals Congress and BJP came together at two places in Rajasthan to thwart local Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) leaders in the elections for zila pramukhs and panchayat samiti pradhans.The BTP, a Congress ally which supported Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the revolt in his party earlier this year, is upset that the ruling party candidates chose the BJP over it in the tribal Dungarpur district, where the small outfit is trying to expand its influence.On Friday, it threatened to snap ties with the Congress in the state.Similarly, the opposition BJP did not help its ally, Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal’s RLP, bag a village head’s post in Nagaur district. Instead, its candidates went for an independent nominee, supported also by the Congress.In Dungarpur zila parishad, the newly elected Congress members voted Thursday for the BJP nominee for the pramukh’s post in the district board, thwarting a BTP-backed candidate’s bid.Thirteen of the 27 seats in Dungarpur zila parishad were won by BTP-supported independent candidates. The BJP got six seats and the Congress eight.The BTP needed just one Congress member’s vote for a nominee backed by it for the district board head’s post. Instead, its ally supported BJP member Surya Ahari, who had filed her nomination papers as an independent candidate for the zila pramukh’s post.The state assembly has two BTP MLAs, who went with the Congress in the last Rajya Sabha election.The tribal-dominated party had fielded its members as independent candidates in the elections for panchayat Samiti and zila parishad members.BTP state president Velaram Ghoghra said the party was now set to snap its links with the Congress over the development.“We had supported the Congress government at the time of need and now we were expecting reciprocation in zila pramukh elections. We just needed one member to form the board but the Congress surprisingly ditched us and joined hands with the BJP,” Ghoghra said.“The party is now going to cut ties with the Congress government. A party executive meeting will be held in a couple of days and a formal decision will be announced,” he told PTI.Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia claimed that it was local politics playing out.“The decision was left to the local leaders who decided as per the local political circumstances,” he said.In Nagaur’s Khinwsar panchayat samiti, the RLP was just one short of the halfway mark to get its candidate elected to the pradhan’s post. In the 31-member body, the RLP won 15 seats, the Congress eight and the BJP five. Three seats went to Independent candidates.Here, the Congress, the BJP and the Independents got together to get an Independent member elevated to the post. Had the BJP members voted for its ally, the RLP nominee would have won.The results for the elections for panchayat samiti and zila parishad members were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday.The elected members then voted for the post of pramukhs in zila parishads and pradhans in panchayat samitis on Thursday.Twelve BJP, five Congress and three independent candidates — including Surya Ahari in Dungarpur — were elected to the posts of pramukh in 20 zila parishads for which results were announced on Thursday night.The BJP candidates were elected to the posts of pradhan in 98 of the 221 panchayat samitis across 21 districts. The Congress candidates won 97 posts.In Tonk panchayat samiti, where no party got a mandate, the Congress managed to get the pradhan’s post with the backing of three Independent candidates, who had pledged support to Congress leader and Tonk MLA Sachin Pilot.

Neither do T-shirts and flip-flops.  Also, all government employees must wear khadi clothes at least on Fridays to encourage the use of handspun, a circular issued on December 8 stated.“It has been observed that several officials/staff (mainly contractual staff and advisers engaged for government work) do not wear attire suitable for government employees. Hence, the image of government staff gets sullied among people,” it said.People expect “good behaviour and personality” from all government officials and employees, it reminded.“If the attire of officials and employees is unsuitable and unclean, it also has an indirect impact on their work,” the circular said.The attire should be “proper and clean”, it said.Women employees can wear sarees, salwars/chudidars kurtas, trouser pants and shirts along with dupattas if necessary, it said.Men have fewer choices: they can wear shirts and “pants or trouser pants”.“Clothes with deep colours and strange embroidery patterns or pictures should not be worn. Besides, employees and staff should not wear jeans and t-shirts in offices,” the circular ordained.Women employees should wear chappals, sandals or shoes while men should wear shoes or sandals, it was stated. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-dress-code-for-maharashtra-government-employees-no-t-shirts-jeans-or-slippers-182895
11-12-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to hear PIL on making laws to confiscate ‘benami’ properties, black money||Asserting that the judiciary cannot be asked to take over the roles of the legislature and the executive, the Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a PIL seeking a direction to the Centre to ascertain the feasibility of making laws to confiscate ‘benami’ properties, disproportionate assets and black money.A bench headed by Justice SK Kaul, however, permitted Delhi BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay to make a representation to the Law Commission to ascertain the possibility of making laws or amending existing ones to ensure confiscation of illegal properties and provision for awarding life term in cases pertaining to offences such as bribery and black money.“Let me tell you two things. There is legislative and executive exercise and there is judiciary to do the scrutiny. You cannot ask the judicial wing to take over all the roles. It is not envisaged in the Constitution also,” the bench told senior advocate Gopal Sankarnarayanan in a hearing conducted via video conference.The bench, which acknowledged Upadhyay’s good work in the field of PILs, also observed that this was becoming a “publicity interest litigation”.“Sorry, this is becoming a publicity interest litigation. Petitioner has done some good work also but this we can’t entertain,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.At the outset, Sankarnarayanan, representing Upadhyay, referred to the issues of black money and ‘benami’ properties and said the late Ram Jethmalani had also raised similar issues in the Apex Court a few years ago.“There is a total lack of will and resistance (in law). In coal scam, it is over Rs 1 lakh crore scam but the sentence given is three years,” he said.“It is for Parliament to create the law. We cannot issue a mandamus to Parliament to enact a law,” the bench said, adding that the petitioner should persuade the peoples’ representatives to make a law on this.“The tendency to come to court for all this is not right,” the court observed and added: “Look at your prayers. It is like please clean up the country. What is this relief? It is not the court’s job to do all this.”The bench allowed Upadhyay to withdraw the PIL to make a representation to the law panel.On the issue of corruption, the bench stressed the need for change in the thinking pattern of society and said: “For every person taking money, there is a person distributing money.”The plea stated that the petitioner was filing it as a PIL under Article 32 seeking writ, order or direction to the Centre to ascertain the feasibility of “confiscating cent per cent Benami Property Disproportionate Assets and Black Money and awarding life imprisonment in the offences relating to bribery, black money, benami property, disproportionate assets...”It went on to list a host of other offences, including money laundering, tax evasion, profiteering, grain hoarding, food adulteration, human and drug trafficking, black marketing, cheating, fraud, forgery, dishonest misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust, dishonestly inducing delivery of property, cheating by personation, concealment of property, benami transaction, corporate fraud and forensic fraud.The plea, alternatively, urged the top court to direct the Law Commission of India and/or the Lokpal to examine and publish the best Anti-Corruption Laws of the world, particularly the most strict and effective provisions related to offences such as bribery, black money, benami property, disproportionate assets and tax evasion.

After the successful Bharat Bandh on 8th December called by the Farmers jointly, the Central Government cannot call this a 'Punjab question' any more," a statement by joint forum said.They also said that the invitation by Home Minister Amit Shah to the farmers' representatives from Punjab as well as from other states, is an acceptance of this fact."The Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions and Independent Sectoral Federations/Associations are closely following the machinations of the Centre, such as planting alleged NIA (national investigation agency) reports of instigation by SFJ (Sikhs for Justice) from Canada, alleged letter bearing lakhs of signatures of the Haryana farmers backing the agri-laws, offer to amend laws and many other such deceitful diversionary tactics have failed to make any headway against the demand to repeal the three agri-laws that itself has become a material force," it added.The Joint Platform of Central Trade Unions (CTUs) and Independent Sectoral Federations/Associations reiterate their wholehearted support to the ongoing united struggles of the farmers demanding scrapping of Draconian Agri-laws, Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 and legislation guaranteeing MSP (minimum support price)."We have once again received a letter from the Samyukta Morcha of Kisans for their appreciation of continued support from the Central Trade Union organisations for their justified struggle. They have informed us the next phase of their action programmes with request to extend support," it said.The Samyukta Morcha of farmers' organisations has decided to block Delhi-Jaipur national highway from December 12. Farmers have also decided to open toll plazas throughout the country from December 12.Farmers have also planned state/local level actions (protests) on December 14, 2020."They will also boycott the products of Ambani and Adani like Jio, Reliance Malls, Adani Fresh etc," it added.The Joint Platform of CTUs and Sectoral Federations/Associations call upon the workers, employees and their unions, irrespective of affiliations, to be ever vigilant and extend our active solidarity to the call of Farmers' Joint Struggle in the coming crucial period, the unions have said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trade-unions-support-farmers-agitation-saying-bharat-bandh-on-december-8-successful-182890
11-12-2020||New Delhi||What action taken subsequent to NBSA report on Rakul Preet complaint: HC to Centre||The Delhi High Court Friday asked the Centre as to what action it has taken subsequent to the NBSA report indicating violation of code of ethics by several TV channels in their news reports connecting actor Rakul Preet Singh with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.Justice Navin Chawla asked the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma and central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul, to file a fresh status report in furtherance of the court's earlier orders in the matter and in view of the NBSA report.The News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) was also asked to place on record its report/orders on the complaints made by Singh against various TV channels for connecting her with Rhea Chakraborty drug case and the court listed the matter for hearing on March 4.The actor in an application filed earlier has sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation in the drug case and files an appropriate report before the competent court.The high court on September 17 had said that the leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".The NBSA in its orders of December 9, against various TV channels, has observed that several news reports were based on information received from NCB which has not issued any statement disputing the same.NBSA has censured some TV channels for their use of "misleading" hashtags and taglines in their broadcasts of the case and some others have been asked to issue an apology to the actor.It has also directed the TV channels to immediately remove videos of the offending broadcasts from their websites and YouTube and to "exercise greater care, caution in future while telecasting such news stories and taglines".The court had earlier expressed the hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".In her main petition, the actor has sought directions to the authorities to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.She has claimed, in her petition, that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-action-taken-subsequent-to-nbsa-report-on-rakul-preet-complaint-hc-to-centre-182889

Uzbekistan’s use of the corridor would add to the overall improvement of connectivity in the larger Eurasian space, read a joint statement issued after the summit.Uzbekistan has proposed a trilateral dialogue among India, Iran and Uzbekistan to promote connectivity through the India-operated Chabahar port, Adarsh Swaika, Joint Secretary (Eurasia) in the Ministry of External Affairs, told newspersons.Mirziyoyev wanted to explore the possibility of implementing priority developmental projects in Uzbekistan as part of the $1 billion LoC offered by India for Central Asian countries during the second meeting of the India-Central Asia Dialogue.Over the past couple of years, with a new leader as President after 25 years of Islam Karimov, Central Asia's most populous nation has sought to open out beyond its traditional partners.With India, it held its first-ever joint military exercises and the first bilateral dialogue between the National Security Councils last year. They also resolved to strengthen cooperation between the law enforcement agencies and special services of the two countries.Tashkent is in the process of supplying uranium for India's nuclear power plants under an agreement signed last year.The emerging developmental partnership is expected to supplement efforts for closer security and regional ties. The $448 million LoC will be used in road construction, sewerage treatment and information technology projects as India seeks to get more involved in High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs).PM Modi and the Uzbek President had similarity of views on terrorism, with both reaffirming their determination to combat the menace by destroying terrorist safe-havens, networks, infrastructure and funding channels.They also underlined the need for every country to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks against other countries.They also expressed interest in strengthening cooperation for the development and economic reconstruction of Afghanistan, including through implementation of various development projects.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-offers-448-mn-credit-line-to-uzbekistan-182886

11-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farm laws: BJP to hold nationwide ‘chaupals’; no ‘rail roko’ by farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 11With farmers’ unions intensifying protest against the central farm laws, the BJP has decided to hold nationwide programmes, including ‘chaupals’ in rural areas, to spread awareness about their benefits.Party sources said events, including press conferences and public programmes, would be held in majority of districts in the country.Meanwhile, the ‘jathebandis’ said there was ‘no rail roko’ in their protest plans, which includes making toll routes free of cess, blockade at the Jaipur-Delhi Highway and dharnas at district headquarters and state capitals.Confirming this, BKU (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal said the decision regarding ‘rail roko’ would be taken later after consultations with unions across the country.While the BJP has accused the Opposition parties of “misleading and inciting” farmers over “historic farm reforms” for “selfish political interests”, a new controversy erupted with “posters of jailed extremists” on the Tikri border where the BKU-Ekta (Ugrahan) is protesting.While the Centre on Friday again urged the protesting farmers to return to the table for dialogue, leaders warned of “Left-Wing threat to farmers protest”.Referring to posters demanding release of jailed accused at Tikri yesterday, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar called it a “dangerous and diversionary tactic to divide the farmers’ agitation”.“They can demand for MSP, the APMC, changes in the Acts…what do these posters mean? Farmers should be careful as this is a way of dividing the movement,” he said.Terming it a “matter of deep concern”, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: “This is a sinister design to hijack the movement, exploit farmers unions…. there is enough evidence to show ‘tukde tukde gang’ is threatening to take over the protest. There are serious charges against those being portrayed as victims.”When asked about the controversy, Rajewal said the protests at Tikri were under the BKU-Ekta (Ugrahan), “and has nothing to do with ‘jathebandis’ at Singhu”.Meanwhile, a day after Union Ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal argued in favour of these laws and government’s stance regarding MSP, ‘mandis’ and the APMC, Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the video of their press conference and urged the people to listen to them carefully.“My two Cabinet colleagues, Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal, have discussed in detail about the new farm laws and demands of the farmers. Must listen to this,” he said.A BKU from Uttar Pradesh has also approached the Supreme Court against the three agriculture laws, alleging they will make them vulnerable to corporate greed.On Wednesday, Bhanu Pratap Singh, who heads BKU (Bhanu), filed a petition for impleadment in the matter of Tiruchi Siva versus the Union of India.Siva, a Rajya Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu, has also approached the Apex Court against the three farm laws, according to reports. Singh’s writ petition also challenged the laws, calling it “unconstitutional” and “anti-farmer”.Tomar, who today again asked the farmers to return to the table, said he was yet to hear from farmers regarding government’s proposals offering amendments to the laws.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination in turn charged him of “falsely claiming that farmers’ organisations have gone back on talks and should not have intensified their agitation at a time when talks are on”.“Farmers’ organisations are always ready for talks and have responded each time the Government has called. It is the Government which is adamant on not repealing the three Acts and EB 2020 which is the main demand of the farmers,” it said.More farmers have joined the dharna sites at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Palwal, unions said. “Farmers from Tamil Nadu have arrived and groups of farmers from almost all states of India shall be arriving to join the Delhi protest, soon,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-bjp-to-hold-nationwide-chaupals-no-rail-roko-by-farmers-182879

11-12-2020||Vijay Mohan||From WWII to 1965 war, Colonel with unique distinction of serving all Armed Forces marks centenary||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 11Marking a centenary is rare, and rarer still is a veteran, who has had the unique opportunity of having served with not just all three branches of the Armed Forces but also the para-military.As Col Prithipal Singh Gill (retd) celebrated his 100th birthday in the city on Friday, he fondly reminisced his stint in uniform and aura, adventure and elan associated with it.With a twinkle in his eye as felicitations poured in, and he cut the cake amidst a small gathering of family members and close relatives, the World War II veteran recalled his eventful and chequered service life in the cockpit, on the high seas and with the big guns. The demeanour and alertness behind his smile belied his age. Brigadier Ravi Kumar from the Western Command presented him a memento on behalf of the Army and another was also sent by 71 Medium Regiment, the unit he had commanded.It began with him joining the erstwhile Royal Indian Air Force in 1942 as a flight cadet in Karachi, without telling his family. He had just spent a little over a year with the Air Force, learning to fly Harvard aircraft, when his father learnt from a friend that he was a “good flyer” and pulled him out because flying in those days was considered unsafe and his father was afraid that he may die in an air crash.Incidentally, Col Prithipal’s father, Harpal Singh, was a soldier himself, having served as a Captain in the Army.Then at the age of 23, he joined the Navy and served for five years, from January 1943 to September 1948, as a commissioned officer in the gunnery branch. He sailed on minesweepers and escort ships.During World War II, he was assigned to undertake escort duties for maritime convoys proceeding from the Indian mainland to the Persian Gulf.It was during his days with the Navy that then Sub-Lieutenant Prithipal Singh was detailed to attend the Long Gunnery Staff Course at the Army’s School of Artillery in Deolali, where he qualified as an instructor in gunnery.After a brief interlude with a government agency, for which he got service credit, he donned the olive green in April 1951, joining the Regiment of Artillery on account of his previous naval gunnery experience. He was posted to the Gwalior Mountain Battery, then equipped with 5.4-inch howitzers.He then served with 34 Medium Regiment, that had earlier served with distinction in Iraq, Palestine, Egypt and Italy during World War II.Later, he raised and commanded 71 Medium Regiment that saw action during the 1965 Indo-Pak War.“The most eventful part of my service was during the 1965 Indo-Pak War when I was commanding the Regiment,” he said.“During the war, the Pakistanis had enveloped one of our gun batteries. Four of our guns were cut but we went in and got them back. For a gunner, his guns are sacrosanct and revered and just cannot be given up,” the retired Colonel added.On promotion to the rank of Colonel, he commanded as Assam Rifles Sector in Manipur, from where he took opted for retirement in 1970. He also recalled their younger days when he and Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw used to go on hunting and shooting expeditionsBy the time he hung up his boots, the war veteran had not only served in all three dimensions of combat but also in almost all theatres, including Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and the northeast.Born in 1920 in Patiala, he studied at Government College, Lahore. He got married to Preminder Kaur in 1950. After retirement, he took up farming his family lands near Faridkot, but continued to keep up a healthy and robust lifestyle.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/from-wwii-to-1965-war-colonel-with-unique-distinction-of-serving-all-armed-forces-marks-centenary-182876

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Doing most of cleaning at Singhu border, claim protesting farmers||Garbage has been piling up at the Singhu border in Delhi where the farmers have been staying put for over a fortnight protesting the farm reform laws, with many complaining there has been little help from the authorities in keeping the site clean.Clusters of piled up paper and plastic glasses, bottles, fruit peels, waste generated from the food being cooked and dirty toilets combined with stagnant water generating a stench, the conditions at the site is worsening."Officials from the municipal corporations have been coming to clean the site once in a while, but it is the farmers who are doing most of the cleaning," said Malkar Singh, a farmer from Karnal, who has been camping at the site since November 25.On both the Delhi and Haryana sides of the border, a handful employees from the municipal corporations can be seen sweeping on the periphery of the protest sites, but farmers say that is not enough for maintaining the hygiene of the site which is seeing such a massive congregation."The toilets haven't been cleaned for days. There is no help from the government," said an agitated Gurvinder Singh whoc hails from Ramgarh in Punjab.Camping at the border since November 30, the farmer said whatever little cleaning is happening is because of the "safai pasand" farmers, who have taken it upon themselves to keep the area clean.The mobile toilets provided by the Delhi government are visibly not enough for all farmers at the site, leaving them with no option but to urinate in the open."There are so many of us here and not enough bathrooms. We urinate wherever we can. What else can we do?” said Bhajan Singh from Ferozepur in Punjab.A small group of Bharat Kisan Union farmers from Punjab have recently installed a laundry facility with washing machines running for eight to 10 hours a day to ensure that the farmers get to clean their clothes."We use water from the tankers that we have brought along and use the batteries of tractors to run the machines. The washing powder is donated by various people," Jagjit Singh, one of the men running the service, said.Thousands of farmers agitating against the centre's new agri laws have been camping at multiple border points for two weeks. On Thursday, they threatened to intensify their agitation with a plan to block railway tracks if their demands are not met soon.The announcement came on a day Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doing-most-of-cleaning-at-singhu-border-claim-protesting-farmers-182855

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Pranab Mukherjee’s presidential memoirs to hit stands in January||A new book by late former President Pranab Mujkherjee will recount his fascinating journey from growing up under the flicker of a lamp in a remote village of Bengal to walking the ramparts of the Rasthrapati Bhavan as the first citizen of India.The memoir, titled “The Presidential Years”, will be globally released in January 2021, publisher Rupa Books announced on Friday.The fourth volume of Mukherjee’s memoirs recollects the challenges he faced in his years as the President including the difficult decisions he had to make and the tightrope walk he had to undertake to ensure that both constitutional propriety and his opinion were taken into consideration.“A towering figure of Indian politics, Pranab Da would always insist that he would ‘melt into the masses without leaving a track behind’. Today, he leaves behind an unmatched legacy, some of which is reflected in the highly anticipated fourth volume of his memoirs.“If he were still alive, he would have been thrilled to note the widespread excitement among readers to read this extremely well-written autobiography. It’s so personal in tone that to me it almost seems like the former President is sitting in his study with a cup of tea (and shingara) and narrating his story,” said Kapish G. Mehra, managing director, Rupa Publications India.In the memoir, Mukherjee reveals the relationship he shared with two politically opposed prime ministers during his tenure as the president.“While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary,” Mukherjee wrote in the book.He also presents a critical point of view for the Congress party, in which he was a senior leader for over five decades. He candidly refutes the view of leaders of the party, who believed had Mukherjee become the PM in 2004, the party might have averted the 2014 Lok Sabha drubbing.“Though I don’t subscribe to this view, I do believe that the party’s leadership lost political focus after my elevation as president. While Sonia Gandhi was unable to handle the affairs of the party, Dr Singh’s prolonged absence from the House put an end to any personal contact with other MPs,” he wrote.Filled with rare photos and handwritten notes, the memoir offers a rare glimpse into the life of one of the most important and admired politicians of contemporary India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pranab-mukherjees-presidential-memoirs-to-hit-stands-in-january-182853

India has only 3% of all historical emissions, the environment minister said adding that its current emission levels are just 6.8% and that it has nearly achieved targets of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC).“Climate change has not happened in one day or due to recent actions, for 100 years greenhouse gases has been released in it. The USA is responsible for 25% of historical emissions, Europe 22%, China 13% and India only 3%. India is not responsible for the problem but as a responsible country we have decided to participate in the mitigation process. “We also need to understand the current situation. The USA has 15.52 tonnes per capita and 13.5% of world’s total emissions, China 8.12 tonnes per capita and 30% total emissions, Europe and UK 6.47 tonnes per capita and 8.7% emissions and India only 1.9 tonnes per capita and 6.8% emissions. “India has behaved more responsibly than many countries in mitigating climate change challenge. We have nearly achieved our targets of NDC much before the beginning of the Paris Agreement implementation. We need to understand this from another perspective. We just have 2.4% land mass, 4% fresh water resources and 17% of world’s total population, 16% cattle population and 8% biodiversity,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/historically-not-responsible-for-emissions-india-walking-the-talk-on-climate-action-javadekar-182846

11-12-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal Governor says ‘stop playing dangerous games’, asks Mamata to apologise over violence||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar Friday said he has sent a report to the Centre in the backdrop of the violent attack on the convoy of BJP chief J P Nadda, and castigated Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the deteriorating law and order situation.Pulled her up for her repeated remarks calling the BJP a party of outsiders, Dhankhar asked her to desist from such politics as would weaken the national fabric.He said it is shameful that the attack on Nadda occurred on International Human Rights Day.Dhankhar said the Chief Minister should apologise for comments she made on Wednesday over the attack on BJP chief JP Nadda's convoy."I have sent my report to the central government whose contents cannot be shared on account of propriety," he told a press conference at Raj Bhawan.He alleged the violators of law in Bengal have the protection of police and administration and any resistance by the opposition is quelled."The governor is not a post office...he will not fidddle around in Raj Bhawan when human rights are being violated," he said, and asserted "the governor will vindicate his oath, come what may."It is the duty of the governor to protect the Constitution, he said.Dhankhar said the chief minister is also under constitutional obligation and has to act in accordance with the Constitution.Referring to Banerjee's remarks calling the BJP a party of outsiders, Dhankhar said, the citizenship of India is one and insider-outsider politics should stop.A section of bureaucrats, he alleged, is acting as "political servants" despite getting paid from state exchequer."Accountability will be enforced," he said, and asked Banerjee "not to play with fire"."The law and order situation in the state has been worsening with each passing day. Despite cautioning the chief minister and the administration nothing has happened," he said.Dhankhar said  the "non-responsive" stance of the chief minister towards the Raj Bhawan is an indication that governance is not in accordance with the Constitution.Underlining that distancing of governance from the rule of law cannot be accepted in democracy, he said, "unconstitutional parameters is at an alarming level making it extremely difficult for me to conclude that governance in the state is according to the constitution."Terming the attack on J P Nadda's convoy on Thursday as most "unfortunate and a slur on democracy", he said "the violators of law in Bengal have protection of police and administration"."Present political scenario in West Bengal is that any opposition is ruthlessly suppressed...the human rights were in flames yesterday".Describing Banerjee's comments on the attack on Nadda's convoy as "most unfortunate", he said "I take a very serious note of the statement that emanated from the honourable chief minister. How can a responsible chief minister, believing in rule of law...Constitution, believing in Bengali culture talk the way she did."            Banerjee had uttered distorted versions of the BJP chief's surname at a rally in Kolkata on Thursday and termed the attack on his convoy a "staged act".

11-12-2020||Kolkata||Mamata govt decides not to send CS, DGP to Delhi despite MHA summons||A defiant West Bengal government on Friday decided not to send the state’s chief secretary and police chief to New Delhi in compliance with Union Home Ministry’s summons in the wake of a mob attack on BJP chief J P Nadda’s convoy, the latest flashpoint between the state and the Centre.Chief Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay wrote to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, saying he has been directed to request to “dispense with the presence of the state officials” in the meeting convened on December 14, an obvious indication that he was just obeying the state government’s order.The MHA had on Friday summoned Bandopadhyay and DGP Virendra asking them to present themselves on December 14 for an explanation on the law and order situation in the state, following Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s report on the attack on Nadda’s convoy by alleged supporters of the ruling TMC.“Kindly refer to the letter whereby the Chief Secretary and the Director-General of Police, Government of West Bengal have been requested to attend a meeting on December 14, 2020, at 12.15 PM in your chamber to discuss the law and order situation in the State of West Bengal including the incidents regarding certain Z-category protectees,” Bandopadhyay wrote in his letter.“While further reports are being obtained and compiled, in the circumstances, I am directed to request you to kindly dispense with the presence of the State officials in the meeting, considering that the State Government is already addressing this issue with utmost seriousness,” he said in his two-page letter.The top bureaucrat of the state said as requested by the Union Home Secretary on December 10, the state government had indeed made elaborate arrangements for security coverage of the protectees on Thursday.“The incidents regarding Z-category protectees are already being examined at our end. The West Bengal Police had provided a bulletproof car and a pilot to Shri J.P. Nadda, which was in addition to the escort (vehicle by State, personnel by CRPF) and PSOs (CRPF) he is entitled as a Z- category protectee,” he wrote.The DIG (Police) of the range was stationed in the area to supervise the arrangements personally. At the same time, 4 Additional SPS, 8 DySPs, 14 Inspectors, 70 Sls/AS1s, 40 RAF personnel, 259 constables and 350 members of auxiliary forces were deployed on the route and at the venue at Diamond Harbour, the letter maintained.“While the central protectees had their own central protection arrangements, these arrangements were made over and above the same from the end of the State,” Bandopadhyay wrote, while seeking to be excused from attending the meeting.Referring to the battery of cars with the convoy of Nadda, Bandopadhyay said it made the “situation unwieldy”.“Because typically, security authorities are to handle a protectee convoy of a few vehicles only, and not with/in the presence of so many other vehicles which got tagged to the convoy travelling together,” he wrote.Noting that three cases have been registered in connection with Thursday’s violence, including two for vandalism, he said, seven persons have already been arrestedTMC calls MHA summons to CS, DGP acts aimed at interfering in state mattersThe TMC on Friday hit out at the Union Home Ministry for summoning West Bengal chief secretary and police chief over the attack on BJP president JP Nadda’s convoy, and accused the saffron party of trying to create a situation where the Centre can interfere in matters related to states.Senior TMC MPs Saugata Roy and Kalyan Banerjee alleged that Nadda’s convoy had “convicted criminals and goons” who carried weapons with the malafide intention of instigating violence.“What the Central government is doing by sending a letter (seeking report) from the state government is unconstitutional. The MHA summoning the chief secretary and DGP is unacceptable.“The BJP and the Central government are trying to create a situation where they can interfere with the federal structure,” Banerjee told a press conference.Provocative speeches by BJP state president Dilip Ghosh are leading to a “vicious” situation, he said, and claimed that Nadda was accompanied by “convicted criminals and armed men belonging to the BJP”.Nadda’s cavalcade was on Thursday attacked by alleged TMC supporters, who threw stones and rained lathi blows on vehicles and BJP workers accompanying him. Several BJP leaders including general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya were injured in the attack. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-govt-decides-not-to-send-cs-dgp-to-delhi-despite-mha-summons-182826

11-12-2020||New Delhi||India's maritime pacts to preserve strategic autonomy: CDS Rawat||Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Bipin Rawat on Friday said India will seek to preserve its strategic autonomy while engaging with extra-regional powers and improving regional linkages to give it more leverage.Pointing out that India lives in a tough neighbourhood and an increasingly contested region, Rawat said it would engage freely with other powers keeping in view not only the geo-strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific but also in the race for bases which will gain momentum in the times to come.The security of land borders is of prime concern, but India is also looking at the seas and oceans around it with ever-increasing interest, Rawat said while delivering the keynote address at a webinar helmed by the German thinktank Konrad Adenauer Stiftung and Global Dialogue Forum of Moses Manoharan.Terming dissuasive deterrence as the best guarantor of peace and stability, the CDS indicated that India was looking beyond the Quad grouping for partnerships in the maritime domain. As External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said on Tuesday, Rawat also pitched for more trilateral and multilateral arrangments with maritime powers sharing the same values as India.Giving an insight into Berlin’s approach to the Indo-Pacific, Peter Rimmele, the India head of the German think-tank, said his country’s approach was not targeted at China. There was no move towards an economic decoupling as China was Europe’s most important trading partner. However, Beijing was a systemic rival and Germany felt the need to strengthen its partners in the region to uphold a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific."A more significant German contribution might be on cards but Germany is a trading power not a military one and does not intend to be one. Despite the superpowers making noises, militarism was not the way forward,’’ he felt. It could only be the flanking of supportive measures, Rimmele observed.Australian High Commissioner Barry O'Farrell AO pointed out that India and Australia face significant hurdles; their common goals are more important than those of others. "The US and China are the most important in the India Pacific. They can set the tone for cooperation or competition. But the Indo-Pacific does not belong to either," he observed, leaving enough space for India and Australia to play leadership roles.Appreciating PM Modi and Jaishankar for admirable regional leadership, he said it had served as the template for India’s constructive leadership and its attempts to shape the neighbourhood for the better. This approach becomes more crucial in a post-Covid world that will be poorer, dangerous and more disorderly.Australia and India share the common goal of not just emerging from the crises stronger but shaping the strategic environment for the better. This has started at home in Australia with more economic rejuvenation programs. Outside, Canberra is encouraging more economic openness and continuation of rules that have underpinned it in the Indo-Pacific for decades, said the Australian High Commissioner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-maritime-pacts-to-preserve-strategic-autonomy-cds-rawat-182823

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Police ask people to take alternative routes in view of farmers' protest||With thousands of farmers protesting against the Centre's new agri laws staying put at Delhi borders, several routes in the national capital remained off bounds for commuters on Friday.The Delhi Traffic Police took to Twitter to inform people about road closures and advised them to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience.Farmers from different states have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) border points for nearly two weeks now to demand a repeal of the farm laws enacted in September.In a series of tweets, the Delhi Traffic Police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are closed for traffic movement, while Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrians.Those travelling to neighbouring Haryana can take routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders, the police said.On Thursday, farmer unions threatened to block railway tracks across the country and all highways leading to Delhi if their demands are not met.The announcement came a day after farmers' leaders rejected the government's offer to amend the new agri laws and give a "written assurance" on continuing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system.Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of MSP and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-ask-people-to-take-alternative-routes-in-view-of-farmers-protest-182820

11-12-2020||Nonika Singh||Dancer who blended tradition with modernity||In a way, he represented the spirit of modern India. Born in 1947 when India got independence, at Navsari, Gujarat, renowned dancer and choreographer Astad Deboo created new frontiers of dance as well as surpassed many. Deemed too western and not Indian enough at one point, he went on to create a grammar of dance, best described in his own words, “style was contemporary in vocabulary and traditional in restraint”.Trained in both kathak and kathakali, he was to amalgamate the two seemingly disparate classical styles and put his unique stamp. Of course, he also went on to learn Martha Graham’s modern dance technique. In New York, it was José Limón’s technique that he imbibed. If he trained with the very best, including celebrated German choreographer Pina Bausch, he collaborated with who’s who such as Pink Floyd, Gundecha Brothers, Dadi Pudumjee. Why back in time he was commissioned by Pierre Cardin to choreograph a dance for Maya Plisetskaya — prima ballerina of the Bolshoi Ballet.Purists in the Indian dance world might have been reluctant to work with him, those from other disciplines were only too eager and he was too happy to find the binding factor in the rhythm of their work. Bouncing off the technique of his collaborators against his own, he would create an idiom that imbibed from the world inspired by influences as varied as Balinese dancing, Japanese Kabuki and traversed the same.Performing solo as well as in group choreography around the world in as many as 70 countries, in spaces as unique as a museum, a street, the Great Wall of China, his signature style was fusion in the best sense of the word. As he himself put it, “it evolved from energetic and entertaining to minimalist and introspective, from the narrative to the abstract”. When awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi honour the citation read: He has created a dance-theatre style which successfully assimilates Indian and Western techniques. Padma Shri may have come to him when he was 60 but was no less gratifying for it came without any lobbying. But then he never cared to market his dance only spread it far and wide.Age was just a number for the contemporary dancer who was active on stage till recently creating an ode to Mahatma Gandhi, another one on migrant workers during the lockdown. Today, when the word contemporary is used without much thought by practitioners sans rigour, they need to look up to this trailblazer to comprehend how tradition and modernity can meet seamlessly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dancer-who-blended-tradition-with-modernity-182572
11-12-2020||Kolkata||Nadda’s convoy attacked in Bengal, Centre seeks report||The convoy of BJP chief JP Nadda was attacked by TMC supporters in West Bengal, leaving several people injured, party leaders and eyewitnesses said.Nadda was on his way to attend a programme in the parliamentary constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP, who also happens to be the nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and widely believed to be her successor.Didi claims violence stagedCars that were part of the BJP president’s convoy were pelted with stones, large enough to inflict major damage. The most serious attack on the cavalcade took place at Shirakol, located on the road to Daimond Harbour. The front and rear windscreens and windowpanes of a number of vehicles were damaged in the attack.The Centre has sought a report from the West Bengal Government over the alleged "serious security lapses" during the visit of Nadda to the state, as Union Home Minister Amit Shah called the attack "sponsored violence", and alleged that the state has "descended into an era of tyranny and anarchy" under the Trinamool rule. BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya’s vehicle was also rained with stones. His hand was wounded. Even, Nadda’s vehicle was not spared though the BJP chief managed to escape unhurt.Abhishek Banerjee, who addressed a rally at Arambag, said the attack on Nadda’s convoy was a spontaneous reaction of masses. Banerjee said people who suffered a lot during the lockdown were angry with the BJP because their leaders did not show up when the common man needed help.“What happened to Nadda’s convoy today was an expression of the pent-up anger of common people,” the TMC youth wing leader said. Addressing fishermen at Diamond Harbour, Nadda said: “Intolerance and lawlessness had become synonymous with West Bengal.” The BJP chief said because of “Ma Durga’s blessings”, he escaped unhurt. “The TMC wants to choke democracy. The Mamata-led government is not going to last,” Nadda said. The BJP leader asserted the days of the TMC government are numbered. West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also expressed concern over the attack. Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naddas-convoy-attacked-in-bengal-centre-seeks-report-182596
11-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt makes fresh talks offer, farm unions stick to demand for repeal||Reaching out to the agitating farmers, the BJP-led Centre today said it had given them written proposals addressing their concerns about the new farm laws and was ready to discuss any other issue they might have.Read also: Centre-state rift visible in stir against farm laws Even as the farm unions hardened their stance, the government virtually ruled out accepting their main demand for repealing the agricultural laws.“Whenever you are ready, the government is ready for talks,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal said on a day the unions announced further plans for agitation.Listing the many pro-farmer measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tomar said the government’s constant effort had been to empower farmers and make agriculture and villages ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant).“Till the time villages and agriculture are self-reliant, the country cannot become self-reliant”. Tomar said. Since farmers were not “forthcoming on their issues and were sticking to the demand (of rolling back the laws),” the government culled out their concerns from the several rounds of talks and prepared the proposals, Tomar said, adding that the Central Government was well within its constitutional rights for making laws on agricultural trade.“The government has given them a written assurance. If they are still unconvinced we can hold more discussions. We urge them to leave the path of agitation and come to the discussion table. When the dialogue is on, it is not correct to announce further agitation,” the Agriculture Minister said. Regarding their main demand, the ministers said laws had been formulated after “due diligence and consultations with stakeholders” and following proper parliamentary procedure “to benefit farmers and the agriculture sector”.“No law can be completely wrong, you should read the Acts and see for yourself. We have taken due care and consideration and only then brought in the laws. We are only trying to benefit the farmers,” Tomar said.Meanwhile, Goyal said panchayat election results from Rajasthan were a “proof of farmers’ complete faith” in PM Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-makes-fresh-talks-offer-farm-unions-stick-to-demand-for-repeal-182562

Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “History will record that when farmers were fighting for their rights, you were building yourself a palace.” TNSHis remarks came around the time when there is criticism from a section of the Opposition over spending of resources on a new building when the country was battling an economic downturn.Modi asserted that democracy in India had always been a means of resolving differences along with governance. “Our democracy has moved forward with the goal that there is always a room for differences.... Different views and different perspectives empower a democracy,” he said.Referring to traditions in India much before the 13th century Magna Carta document, he said the day was not far when the world would call India the “mother of democracy”. The PM quoted Guru Nanak Dev to underscore the importance of dialogue and noted that the Guru had said that interaction should continue till eternity. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-lays-stone-of-new-parliament-says-differences-fine-in-democracy-182564
