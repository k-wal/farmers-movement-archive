12-08-2020||New Delhi||Swadeshi does not mean boycotting all foreign products: Bhagwat||Swadeshi does not necessarily mean boycotting every foreign product, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Wednesday and asserted that only those technologies or materials may be imported which the country lacks traditionally or are not available locally.Talking about the relevance of being self-reliant and swadeshi in the wake of COVID-19, he suggested that the pandemic has made it clear that globalisation did not yield desired results and one economic model cannot be applicable everywhere.Mutual cooperation among self-reliant countries while considering the world as one family and not one market, seems to be the economic model required for post-COVID world, Bhagwat said while speaking at a virtual book launch event.Backing the BJP-led NDA government’s pitch for a self-reliant India, the RSS chief said swadeshi means to promote and give preference to indigenous products or technologies and not necessarily boycott all foreign items.He made it clear that only those materials or technologies should be imported which are not available locally or India lacks traditionally and these should be modified in an Indian manner.Citing a few examples when traditionally available products and technologies were overlooked for imported ones, Bhagwat emphasised on the need for change in mindset and not considering domestic items as inferior.Noting that even after independence, policy making in India was influenced by the west and other foreign countries, Bhagwat said as a result many locally available products and technologies were overlooked in favour of foreign items.Describing the recently-announced National Education Policy as a “step in the right direction” to make India self-reliant, he said such policies will help India realise the potential of its people and of traditional wisdom.The concept of swadeshi which talks about promoting local products and restricting inflow of foreign investment and items, features prominently in RSS ideology. Its affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch has been at the forefront of a campaign to boycott Chinese products. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/swadeshi-does-not-mean-boycotting-all-foreign-products-bhagwat-125644

12-08-2020||New Delhi/Mathura/Mumbai||Janmashtami celebrated amid Covid-19 restrictions||The massive crowds of devotees in temples, elaborately decorated tableaus and Dahi Handi revelry were all missing this year on Janmashtami, the birthday of Lord Krishna, as celebrations were dampened by COVID-19 restrictions.Amid blowing of conch shells and beating of drums, priests offered prayers since early morning in temples but there were no special religious discourses, ‘Krishnalila’ dance dramas and community kitchens as the entry of devotees had been either banned or restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic.The rituals were, however, streamed online from some temples. In North India, families usually observe a day-long fast and hold special prayers at midnight.Tight security arrangements were made outside the main temples to ensure that people followed social distancing.The festivities were also relatively low-key in the main temples of Mathura, the birth place of Lord Krishna, Vrindavan, Nandgaon, Mahaban and Baldeo, which are usually visited by lakhs of pilgrims on the occasion.Soaked in religious fervour, devotees would throng decked-up temples and take out colourful processions to mark the birth of Lord Krishna, but like other festivals in COVID-19 times, rituals have been restricted on Janmashtami too in the country.Though the entry of devotees was banned, a large number of people assembled outside the Sri Krishna Janmasthan in Mathura and greeted each other with chants of Lord Krishna.The temples of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), which celebrate the festival in a grand manner and attract large congregations, also allowed only a limited number of devotees.In the national capital, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia prayed at the ISKCON temple in East of Kailash.Groups which organise Dahi Handi festivities in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra opted for low-key celebration unlike in past years when massive crowds would gather to cheer Govinda squads.These youngsters would move around the city in processions, make human pyramids and break pots filled with butter or curd, which are hung at a considerable height, to win prize money.It is inspired by the tale of Lord Krishna’s boyhood trick of stealing butter from a suspended earthen pot.Adhering to the social distancing guidelines, Dahi Handi mandals did not form human pyramids this year.Instead, they carried out health and social welfare drives, like blood donation camps and removal of plastic, organisers said.Dahi handis were being broken in a symbolic manner with those involved maintaining social distance and wearing masks.Ram Kadam, BJP MLA from Ghatkopar in Mumbai, said in normal times, his mandals Dahi Handi celebration saw five to six lakh footfalls.“Ours was the biggest Dahi Handi celebration in India in normal times. But this year, we celebrated in a very simple manner, observing social distancing given the COVID-19 crisis.“No human pyramid was formed. A child climbed atop a table and broke Dahi Handi to mark the festival in a symbolic manner,” Kadam said.In Rajasthan, the famous Khatu Shyam temple was closed after eight people were found infected in the nearby area last night, according to officials.A nearly 350-year-old tradition of 21-gun salute at Rasala Chow will continue, Public Relations Officer of the Srinath temple in Nathdwara, Girish Kumar, said.The idols of Lord Krishna and Radha were adorned with ornaments made of gold and precious stones, collectively worth around Rs eight crore, at a temple in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior.In Uttar Pradesh, devotees assembled outside the Sri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan in Mathura, and as soon as they heard the  drums and sound of clarinet, they greeted each other with loud chants, temple secretary Kapil Sharma said Bathing ceremony of the deity - ‘Abhishekam’ - was performed with milk, curd, honey, ghee and khandsari.Normally after ‘Abhishekam’, ‘Charnamrit’ is distributed among devotees in the Radha Raman Temple, Radha Damodar Temple and Shah Ji Temple.However, there was no distribution of ‘Charnamrit’ in Radha Damodar and Shah Ji temples this year since priests have expressed their inability to control crowds.Amid chants of vedic hymns, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath celebrated Janmashtami at the Gorakhnath temple on Tuesday night, temple manager Dwarika Tiwari said.President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders have greeted the people on Janmashtami.In his message, President Kovind appreciated the efforts of all corona warriors who are at the forefront of the country’s fight against COVID-19, according to an official statement.“Lord Shri Krishna inspires us to establish a society that is just, sensitive and compassionate. His message of Karmayoga is a call to focus on our responsibilities rather than caring for rewards. This spirit has been evident in the working of all our corona warriors who act at the forefront of our fight against COVID-19,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/janmashtami-celebrated-amid-covid-19-restrictions-125637

BJP’s former ally, which is currently battling perceptions over the “role of the Mumbai Police” in investigation of the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, also dared it to launch “Operation Lotus” to dislodge Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition government led by Uddhav Thackaray.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ accused the BJP of trying to dislodge governments run by opposition parties using money and central agencies. It said Congress leader Sachin Pilot failed in his rebellion and the BJP also could not break the “chakravyuh” formed by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot “who taught it a lesson”. The ‘Saamana’ editorial also alleged that BJP leaders were now planning ‘Operation Lotus’ in Maharashtra.This on a day president of the Aghadi constituent NCP, Sharad Pawar, described his grand-nephew Parth Pawar as “immature”, dismissing his demand for a CBI probe into the case of actor’s death and leading to speculations of a rift in the partyThe NCP and the Congress are part of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state.Pawar said he has faith in the Mumbai Police but will not oppose if someone still wants the central agency’s investigation into the case. “We attach absolutely no importance to what my grand-nephew says. He is immature...I have clearly said that I have 100 per cent trust in the Maharashtra Police and Mumbai Police. But if someone still wants a CBI probe into it, then there is no reason to oppose that too,” the NCP chief was quoted as saying after a meeting with Sena MP Sanjay Raut.“We feel sad if any person commits suicide. But I feel a bit surprised at the way it is being discussed (in the media),” he added.Parth Pawar is the son of Pawar’s nephew and state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.There is a tug-of-war between the governments of Bihar and Maharashtra over the Rajput death case.Sources say that several senior leaders in the coalition have expressed concern over the negative perceptions against the ruling coalition due to the raging controversy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-makes%C2%A0fun-of-bjp-over-its-failed-bid-to-topple-gehlot-govt-125617

I would like to know from when being Indian is equal to knowing Hindi,” the MP from the Thoothukkudi Lok Sabha seat in Tamil Nadu had tweeted with the hashtag ‘hindiimposition’. CISF officials said the lady official posted at the Chennai airport has been “counselled about her conduct and the soft skills and basic language courtesies the force personnel need to extend to the passengers, as taught to them during training.” The lady official, they said, hails from a south Indian state and had interacted with Kanimozhi for a routine security process to be followed, in Hindi. “She told the inquiry team that she never questioned the passenger about her being an Indian for not knowing Hindi but just said that Hindi is an Indian or official language,” a senior CISF officer said.After Kanimozhi flagged the issue through her Tweet, the CISF had responded through its official handle on the same social media platform and said an inquiry has been ordered into the matter and that “it is not the policy of CISF to insist upon any particular language”.The senior officer said the force will undertake “enhanced efforts to ensure that personnel and officers who know the local language are increasingly deployed at airports keeping in mind administrative and operational issues.”That has always been the policy and it is being reiterated again, he said. When a response was sought on the issue from CISF Director General (DG) Rajesh Ranjan, he told PTI: “Our emphasis is on communication that can take place in whatever manner.” Another senior official of the force said the CISF regularly conducts soft skills classes and public interaction sessions for its personnel and the recent incident is an “aberration and not a norm”.“Every day, lakhs of passengers travelling to destinations within the country and abroad interact with CISF personnel and such incidents do not take place very often.

12-08-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: Railways’ refund exceeds earning from passengers in Q1, finds RTI||Perhaps for the first time in its 167-year-long history, the Railways has refunded more than it has earned from ticket bookings, registering a negative passenger segment revenue of Rs 1,066 crore in the COVID-19-hit first quarter of 2020-21, an RTI query has found.The freight earnings, however, during the period managed to hold ground, according to the RTI reply provided by the Railways to Chandra Shekhar Gaur, a Madhya Pradesh-based activist.The first three months of this financial year, when the Railways had to suspend all its regular passenger services due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, the national transporter’s revenue was in the negative — Rs 531.12 crore in April, Rs 145.24 crore in May and Rs 390.6 in June (all in negative), the RTI reply said.“The minus figures are being shown due to the fact that the value of refunds is more than the value of tickets booked,” said Railway spokesperson DJ Narain.An official explained that due to the suspension of services, tickets booked for travel in April, May and June were offered refunds, while fewer tickets were booked during these three months due to the restrictions.The Railways has cancelled all regular passenger services indefinitely.In the first quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal, the Railways had earned Rs 4,345 crore in April, Rs 4,463 crore in May and Rs 4,589 crore in June.The Railways has said due to the pandemic, it is envisaging a loss of around Rs 40,000 crore this financial year.“Passenger revenues of Railways are naturally expected to be low this year due to suspension of most of the services due to COVID-19 pandemic,” Narain said.However, freight traffic seems to have recovered somewhat since the Railways has been the preferred mode of transportation for ferrying essential during these months.In April 2020, the freight earning was Rs 5,744 crore, in May it was 7,289 crore and in June the number stood at Rs 8,706 crore.In the first quarter of last fiscal year, it earned Rs 9,331 crore in April, Rs 10,032 crore in May and Rs 9,702 crore in June.Narain said the Railways’ freight operations during the last two weeks are higher than the last year’s corresponding figures for the same period.“This is a very encouraging and positive sign for the things to come,” he said.A concerted effort by railway officials and better management practices will ensure that revenue lost in passenger segment is significantly offset by an outstanding freight performance, Narain said.The Railways said it has also suffered losses to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in the running of the Shramik Special trains which began operations from May 1 to ferry stranded migrant workers home. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-railways-refund-exceeds-earning-from-passengers-in-q1-finds-rti-125596
12-08-2020||Kolkata||Coronavirus patient dies in ambulance outside Kolkata hospital||A 60-year-old woman suffering from COVID-19 died in an ambulance outside a city private hospital as she was allegedly made to wait by its authorities who reportedly wanted Rs 3 lakh to be paid upfront for admission, her family members said on Wednesday.The hospital authorities have refuted the charge and said that the woman’s family was given an estimate for treatment but not pressurised for making payments.The woman hails from Tamluk in East Midnapore district and the alleged incident took place on Monday night after she was brought to the hospital from a nursing home in the city after she tested positive and reported severe health problems, a Kolkata Police official said.Her son Nazeem Khan has lodged a police complaint against the hospital at Anandapur police station, the official said.The alleged incident took place a day after the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Commission allowed hospitals to charge patient parties for admission an advance of no more than Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated treatment cost, whichever was lower but not refuse admission or treatment if the payment was not made immediately.“The hospital authorities asked us to deposit Rs 3 lakh. We managed to pay Rs 80,000 and requested them to start my mother’s treatment assuring them to get the remaining amount in the meantime. But the hospital told us that treatment will not be started unless the full payment was made,” Khan said.Later, Rs 2 lakh more was transferred to a bank account of the hospital by the woman’s elder son Latif Khan from Abu Dhabi, he said.“But by then my mother had passed away in the ambulance ... We repeatedly requested the hospital to send a doctor to her, but its authorities insisted that unless they see a proof that the money was transferred to them, nobody from it would attend to my mother,” he said.“If they (hospital authorities) had attended to my mother on time, she could have been saved,” a sobbing Khan said.Refuting the charge, a senior official of the hospital said the patient was brought in a very serious condition.Doctors had tried CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)in the ambulance but could not revive her.Police said a probe into the incident is on and the hospital has been asked to provide the CCTV footage.

12-08-2020||K V Prasad ||Kamala Harris as VP candidate: How she adds to Democratic Party||Tribune News Service New Delhi, August 12 The announcement by Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic party presidential candidate, of selecting Senator Kamala Harris as the Vice President running mate in the November 3 election for the President of the United States created plenty of excitement in India. Well Kamala Harris was born in the United States to an Indian mother Shyamala Gopalan and father Donald Harris from Jamaica. She becomes the first African-American/Indian-American to be on the ticket for the presidential polls. Will her presence in the race challenging Republican President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence swing the pendulum the Democrats way? Her strong ground in California, African-American/Indian-American connect, is a calculation the party would have made at a time when the country is facing the three major crises pandemic, economic downturn and a strong call for racial justice. Surveys at present give Biden a sizeable lead over President Trump. A majority of Indian-Americans traditionally vote Democrats. However, criticism by the party on recent developments like CAA, abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir or even Harris own observation on Kashmir could result in a greater swing away from the party  among the 1.3 million Indian-American voters, in the last polls. Kamala Harris made her political mark as California’s Attorney General starting 2010 till she won the senatorial in 2016 to become the first South Asian woman to enter the Senate. In the House, she pursues with vigour scrutiny of the policies and programmes of the Trump administration. Of course, her record on criminal justice as Attorney General attracted a fair share of criticism that rekindled during the primaries. On his part Joe Biden described her as a “fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants”.  Preferring to portray herself as a Black, Kamala Harris maintained her connections with India making an odd visit to Tamil Nadu where her mother’s family hails from. As per reports, the Senator falls back on her maternal aunts with one of them being part of her campaign team. Her sister Maya was associated with Hillary Clinton. There is an uncanny resemblance between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. In 2007, Biden who threw his hat in the Democratic party primaries ring, dropped out of contention in race eventually won by Barack Obama.  Obama split the ticket to have Biden as his running mate, and strike an equation to balance the political dynamics as the first African-American to run for the office of the President. Now, 12 years later Biden who faced a challenge from Kamala Harris in the primaries reversed the role, brushing aside Senator Harris sharp attack on Biden over his record. The first public test for Senator Kamala Harris would be the sole October 7 Vice Presidential debate with incumbent Vice President Pence as Biden-Harris hope to create history.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kamala-harris-as-vp-candidate-how-she-adds%C2%A0to-democratic-party-125590

12-08-2020||Jodhpur||Pak migrants’ ‘suicide’: Victim in video alleges harassment by 'gang', police inaction||Days after the death allegedly by suicide of 11 members of a family of Hindu migrants from Pakistan in a village in Jodhpur district, a video has surfaced in which one of the victims gives a detailed account of the “harassment” they were facing at the hands of their relatives and a purported gang.The one-and-a-half-hour long video was in the mobile phone of Laxmi, one of the victims, that was found in the shack where the bodies were discovered, police said.According to Laxmi’s account in the video that has been viewed by PTI, after the family came to India in 2015 due to fears of religious persecution in the neighbouring country, they got embroiled in a row with their relatives here as well as a “gang” that allegedly tried to control their lives.“We had no idea that we would be subjected to a new ordeal in India not only by others but by our own people,” Laxmi said in the video.She said the family fled Pakistan and came to India on the insistence of Dhandali, the now estranged wife of her brother Kewal Ram who is the lone surviving member of the family. Dhandali’s family was already settled in Jodhpur.“Right after we arrived here, Dhandali shifted to her parents’ house and started harassing us along with her family and others, claiming the custody of her children,” Laxmi said.In the video, Laxmi alleged that there was a racket run by a gang that tried to control the lives of those who came to live in Jodhpur.The gang scared the migrants into following its advice in order to remain safe and protected, she said.“These gang members began harassing us also and had eye on all of us four sisters. One of our sisters died due to their pressures in 2017. They also forcibly managed to get our brother Ravi married to Sharifa, a cousin of Dhandali, who also sided with them to harass us,” Laxmi said in her elaborate account, adding that alleged gang members also wanted the sisters to marry as per their wish.Laxmi and her sister Priya were both qualified nurses, but while Priya had been working in a nearby clinic, Laxmi could not work as her certificate was destroyed by this alleged gang, she said.Laxmi also alleged that the family had approached the police but they did not take any action.She said the family had shifted to Dechu tehsil to work in farms to escape the harassment in Jodhpur but it did not help. She also said she filed a complaint with the Dechu police but the police also allegedly harassed her family.The police cases began with the first case registered by Dhandali in Mandore police station on July 16, 2019 accusing her husband Kewal Ram and his sisters of harassment. This was followed by a series of cases and counter cases from both the sides against each other, Laxmi stated in the video.A police officer from Jodhpur commissionerate said, “The last case was filed by Dhandali again on August 7, which was to be investigated but this incident happened before police could do anything.”SP (Jodhpur Rural) Rahul Barhat said all the documents related to the case and complaints have been collected and are being investigated.“Kewal Ram has given some names in his FIR and we have been interrogating them in order to get to the bottom of the allegations in the video,” said Barhat.Giving her account in the video, Laxmi also stated that the family had run from pillar to post seeking help from the local administration as well as the government but they were not heard and were ultimately “tired”.The 11 family members, including five children, were found dead on Sunday morning inside the hut they lived in at Lodta village of Dechu area. The autopsies indicated the consumption of a poisonous substance, police had said on Monday, pointing at the possibility of a mass suicide.A note found at the spot alleged threats from the relatives of the wives of two members of the family and harassment by police.Kewal Ram, 35, told police that he spent the night in the fields, where he had gone to guard the crops, and came home in the morning to find everyone dead. Based on his complaint, police detained his wife and some other people for interrogation.A preliminary investigation indicated a dispute between the victims and the families of the wives of two brothers — Kewal Ram and Ravi.The family came from Pakistan’s Sindh in 2015 on a long-term visa. For the past six months, the family members were living on the farm which they had hired for cultivation.Police had found chemicals and injection vials at the shack, leading to suspicion that some poisonous substance may have been administered to family.Two of the victims, Laxmi and Priya, are said to be nurses, the police had said, adding that their signatures appear on the note.The victims included Budharam Bhil (75), his wife Antara Devi, their son Ravi (31) and daughters Jiya (25) and Suman (22). Another 40-year-old woman and five children were also among the dead. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-migrants-suicide-victim-in-video-alleges-harassment-by-gang-police-inaction-125587

12-08-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Whale shark caught by fishing trawler at Sassoon Dock||Late on Tuesday night, a fishing trawler in the Arabian Sea accidentally netted a big catch around 40-50 kms off Colaba.A giant dotted whale shark got entangled in the fishing nets and desperately struggled to set itself free, but failed, said one of the fishermen on board the vessel.Owing to darkness and inclement weather conditions, the fishing trawler decided to sail back to Mumbai, dragging the creature in the nets behind it, and reached here early on Wednesday.They left it along with the net near the shores of the 145-year-old Sassoon Docks in Colaba and sailed back into the sea, informed Damodar Tandel, President of Akhil Bharatiya Machhimar Kriti Samiti and prominent fisherfolk leader.Later, a crane was deployed to lift the massive dotted whale shark that was around 8-metres (over 26 feet) long, and weighed more than two tonnes (two thousand kilograms).The crane laid it on the docks as curious fisherfolk gathered around to click selfies this morning."We were on a routine patrol in the area and saw this enormous fish, which the fishermen revere as 'Dev-Masa' lying here," Colaba Police Station's constable Swapnil Kumbhar told IANS.Though Kumbhar was not clear of the next course of action, prominent fisherfolk leader Damodar Tandel said the whale shark was taken away by a trader who will extract oil from it and dispose off the remains.This is the first instance in recent times that such a massive fish got entangled in a fishing net, though Mumbai and Maharashtra coastline have witnessed incidents of similar sea-giants getting washed ashore in the past, he said.

Does it mean that Sushant was not popular during his life time or that he should not get justice ? Certainly not. Misinterpretation should be avoided.The tweet doesnot in any way insults or belittle him.  Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in Bandra area here on June 14.A tug of war has been going on between the governments of Bihar and Maharashtra over the case. Maharashtra has been contending that Bihar had no jurisdiction in the matter since the death took place in Mumbai.Mumbai Police have so far recorded statements of 56 people  including Rajput's sisters, his friend and actress Rhea Chakraborty and some other film personalities in connection with his death.Rajput's father K K Singh on July 25 lodged a complaint with Patna police against Chakraborty and her family members, accusing them of abetting the actor's suicide.An FIR has been registered by Patna police against Chakraborty and others under various IPC sections."Sushant was not as famous during his lifetime as he is after his death. The space in media he is occupying nowadays is perhaps more than our PM or President of US! Memon tweeted.Memon said secrecy has to be maintained when a crime is at the investigation stage. Publicising every development in the process of collecting vital evidence adversely affects the interest of truth and justice, he added.With reactions coming in on the social media following his post, Memon later said his comments do not insult the actor in any way."There is so much noise on my tweet on Sushant. Does it mean that Sushant was not popular during his lifetime or that he should not get justice? Certainly not.Misinterpretation should be avoided.The tweet does not in any way insults or belittle him, he added.However, Maharashtra minister and NCP national spokesperson Nawab Malik said Memons remarks do not reflect the partys view and it does not endorse or support his statement in any way."The statement made by Majeed Memon on twitter is his personal opinion and not of the NCP.

12-08-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 pandemic casts shadow on ‘Dahi Handi’ celebrations||The grim shadow of COVID-19   crisis was visible on Dahi Handi festivities in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra on Wednesday as mandals opted for low-key celebration unlike past years which provided for public spectacles by ebullient Govinda squads.Adhering to the social distancing guidelines, Dahi Handi mandals were not forming human pyramids this year to mark the birth of Lord Krishna. Instead, they were carrying out health and social welfare drives, like blood donation camps and removal of plastic.In previous years, Dahi Handi used to be celebrated with great fervour in parts of Maharashtra, particularly in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane, where religious institutions, political leaders, and Govinda mandals, comprising youngsters dressed in colourful attire, took part in the festivities.Various social groups also used to organise programmes and cash rewards were given to the groups which succeeded in making the multi-tier human pyramids and breaking the dahi handis, earthen pitchers containing curd or buttermilk, tied at a height with rope.But this year, dahi handis were being broken in a symbolic manner with those involved maintaining social distance and wearing masks.Ram Kadam, BJP MLA from Ghatkopar in Mumbai, said in normal times, his mandals Dahi Handi celebration saw five to six lakh footfalls.“Ours was the biggest Dahi Handi celebration in India in normal times. But this year, we celebrated in a very simple manner, observing social distancing given the COVID-19 crisis.“No human pyramid was formed. A child climbed atop a table and broke Dahi Handi to mark the festival in a symbolic manner,” Kadam said.“This year, we gave a message of boycotting Chinese products and working for an aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) India,” he said.Bala Padalkar, chief of Dahi Handi Utsav Samanvay Samiti, an umbrella body of over 950 mandals (groups) in the state, told PTI that the enthusiasm was not the same this year and members of various mandals agreed not to travel in the city to break dahi handis.Instead, they performed puja in their own areas without forming human pyramids, he said.Considering the crisis situation and the brave fight put up by COVID-19 warriors, various mandals undertook health and social welfare initiatives, including blood donation camps, to mark the festival, he added.Sandeep Dhawale, coach of the city-based Jai Jawan Govinda Pathak (squad), known for forming high human pyramids, said maintaining social distance was the need of the hour and celebrating the festival in a simple manner was in the interest of everyone’s health.His mandal has undertaken the plastic-free Mumbai and clean environment initiative on Wednesday to mark the festival while following the social distancing rules.“We are collecting plastic and recycling it. The fund raised through the activity will be used for the education of the needy,” Dhawale said.

12-08-2020||New Delhi||Covid cases haven't yet peaked or even plateaued: AIIMS director||All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Director Randeep Guleria, one of India's leading medical experts, has asserted that the coronavirus cases in the country have not yet hit their peak or even plateaued.The remarks come at a time when the infections are racing ahead with the country adding at least a lakh new cases every two days. It has logged more than 23 lakh cases and over 46,000 deaths so far since the first case on January 30."These are trying times. It has tested the resilience of the nation. We have not reached the peak or started plateauing as far as cases are concerned," Guleria, who is also the part of a core team monitoring the pandemic, said.Shedding light on the vaccine development, he said that India has an advantage because it makes almost 60 per cent of the world's vaccines."We have the capacity to manufacture a large number of vaccines and that is the commitment that the government and manufacturers have given -- that we will be able to upscale our manufacturing capacity not only for our own country but for the entire world," he added.Three vaccine candidates are in different stages of human clinical trials in India -- one developed by University of Oxford by Pune's Serum Institute of India, the other inactivated virus vaccine by Bharat biotech and the third DNA vaccine by Zydus Cadila.The country's top pulmonologist further said that the vaccine development has moved so rapidly because of the collaborative work between various countries."What the pandemic has shown is the resilience that the world has and the way researchers, manufactures and industries can come together to overcome any hardship we face as a planet." Guleria, however, advised caution with regards to the Russian vaccine, being touted as the world's first coronavirus vaccine. Elaborating on the safety aspect, he said that the issue would be just to make sure that the vaccine is "safe and efficacious"."Any vaccine that is tried in a large number of people who are elderly or have comorbidities, safety is the most important thing and should of course be efficacious in terms of what degree of protection does it give and how long the protection lasts," the AIIMS Director said.The comments come in the backdrop of Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement about the approval of the coronavirus vaccine for public use. It is, however, marred by controversies and is yet to complete the final trials.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-cases-havent-yet-peaked-or-even-plateaued-aiims-director-125556

12-08-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks commission for inquiry into mismanagement of COVID-19 pandemic||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Friday a plea which has sought a direction to the Centre to appoint a commission, headed by a retired apex court judge, for an inquiry into the alleged mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.The petition has alleged that the Centre failed to undertake timely and effective measures for containing transmission of the virus and an independent inquiry by a commission, appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1952, was essential to inquire into the "lapses".As per the cause list uploaded on the apex court website, the plea, filed by six petitioners including retired bureaucrats, is scheduled to come up for hearing on August 14 before a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao.The petition, filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, has claimed that the Centre's response to the pandemic and its "deleterious impact" on the lives and livelihoods of the citizens is a "definite matter of public importance and warrants appointment of a commission" under section 3 of the Act.The plea has claimed that the nationwide lockdown, which had commenced from March 25, and the manner in which it was implemented has had a "devastating impact" on jobs, livelihood and the overall economy.It alleged that the nationwide lockdown, which was announced on March 24, was "arbitrary, irrational and without due consultation with experts or state governments"."In spite of being the harshest and most restrictive lockdown in the world, it has failed to arrest the spread of the disease," the plea claimed and also referred to the "exodus" of migrant workers and daily wagers during the lockdown from cities to their respective home towns.It alleged that the authority has also failed in drawing up a national plan and issuing guidelines for providing minimum standards of relief to vulnerable sections of the society under the Disaster Management Act 2005.The plea alleged that there was a delay in ensuring adequate supplies of personal protective equipment for the safety of healthcare workers during the pandemic.It claimed that the Centre has failed to undertake effective measures for containing the transmission of the virus even after being notified about it by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early January this year.The plea has alleged that these lapses "while dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a severe infraction of the fundamental rights of people".It claimed that prior to March 4 and during the months of January and February, the authorities have failed to conduct screening and surveillance of an adequate number of international passengers.

There is a lot that the family has gone through in the past years but I am confident, this too shall pass," she said. The producer, however, appealed to the people to refrain from speculations."However, it is my heartfelt request to Sanju's fans to not fall prey to speculations and unwarranted rumours,  but to just help us with their ongoing love, warmth and support. "Sanju has always been a fighter, and so has our family. God has yet again chosen to test us to overcome the challenges ahead," she said."All we seek is your prayers and blessings, and we know we will emerge as winners on the other side, as we always have. Let us use this opportunity to spread light and positivity," Maanayata added.Sanjay Dutt is the eldest child of late Bollywood stars Nargis and Sunil Dutt. He has two sisters -- Priya Dutt and Namrata Dutt.He has two children, a son and a daughter, with Maanayata Dutt. He also has a daughter Trishala Dutt from his first marriage to Richa Sharma. She died of a brain tumour in 1996. Sanjay Dutt's producer friend Rahul Mittra also asked fans and media to exercise restraint."This is all speculation, the reports have not come out yet. It is not confirmed whether it is there or not. At the moment, there is no confirmation about his illness and details about it. He has got his tests done. "I request everyone to exercise constraint... He has been a fighter and always will be. He has been interacting with his fans and well wishers both before going to hospital and after getting discharged. We should wait for his statement rather than speculating and wish him all the best," Mittra told PTI when contacted.On the work front, Sanjay Dutt has three films up for release on digital platforms. While "Sadak 2" and "Bhuj: The Pride of India", will premiere on Disney+Hotstar, action-thriller "Torbaaz" will stream on Netflix. He will also star in the second instalment of "KGF" and "Shamshera", alongside Ranbir Kapoor. In 2019, the actor had featured in three movies -- Ashutosh Gowariker's period drama "Panipat", Karan Johar-produced "Kalank" and political drama "Prassthanam".

12-08-2020||Patna||Sushant Singh Rajput's MLA cousin slaps legal notice to Sanjay Raut, seeks apology||A Bihar MLA and close relative of Sushant Singh Rajput sent a legal notice to Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Wednesday, threatening action over a piece written by him in the party mouthpiece about the deceased actor's strained relations with his father, his lawyer said.In his column for Saamana a few days ago, Raut had alleged that the actor, whose death is being probed by the CBI, was not on good terms with his own family and had strained relations with his father after his second marriage.Sanjay Raut is an honorable member of Parliament and a responsible spokesman of the party. My client Neeraj Kumar Bablu has contended that he should apologise within 48 hours for his baseless comments. If he does so, we will proceed no further. If he does not, we will seek legal remedy, Anish Jha, the BJP MLAs counsel, said here.Bablu, who is a cousin of Rajput, had rubbished the allegation that the actors septuagenarian father, Krishna Kishore Singh, had tied the knot again after the death of his wife in 2002.Singh had lodged an FIR at a police station in Patna last month, nearly 40 days after his son was found hanging from the ceiling at his Bandra residence. In the FIR, Singh had accused actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members of abetting his son's suicide besides cheating him financially.Chakraborty has, since, been slapped with a money laundering case by the Enforcement Directorate.Her petition, questioning the Bihar polices jurisdiction in the matter and seeking transfer of the case from Patna to Mumbai is pending before the Supreme Court.The matter was taken over by the CBI following a recommendation by the Nitish Kumar government at the request of Rajput's father.While the Bihar police had swung into action after registering an FIR on July 25, the development was received with indignation by the Uddhav Thackeray government in Maharashtra.

12-08-2020||New Delhi||AAIB chief says too premature to make initial assessment of Kozhikode plane crash||Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) chief Aurobindo Handa has said that evidence is being collected for carrying out a formal probe into the Air India Express plane crash and it was too premature to make an initial assessment of the incident.At least 18 people, including two pilots, died in the Air India Express aircraft crash at Kozhikode airport in Kerala on Friday. The Boeing 737 plane, carrying 190 people, had overshot the runway and later broke into pieces.On the initial assessment about the crash, Handa said the investigation is being carried out as per the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017 and ICAO Annex 13."As the objective of the investigation is prevention of accidents and incidents, a thorough and an in-depth investigation into all contributory factors would be carried out. It is too premature to make an initial assessment of the crash," he told PTI in an e-mail interview late Tuesday evening.Handa is the Director General of the AAIB.The International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) Annex 13 on aircraft accident and incident investigation contains the international standards and recommended practices for aircraft accident and incident investigation.The digital flight data recorder (DFDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of the ill-fated aircraft have been recovered."Initial collection of evidences is in progress for carrying out formal investigation into the causes of the accident to Air India Express B- 737 aircraft VT-AXH," Handa said while replying to a query on when the initial report is expected to be submitted to the government.An Airports Authority of India (AAI) spokesperson, on Saturday, said the plane had touched down near a taxiway that is around 1,000 metres from the beginning of the runway at the Kozhikode airport before breaking into pieces.The Kozhikode airport has a table-top runway and is operated by the AAI.On whether there is a possibility that the first officer could have taken control of the plane and any indications of pilots' or air traffic controllers' (ATC) failure, Handa said, "It is a part of the investigation and any comments made at this stage would be inappropriate and irresponsible".In response to a query on whether overseas agencies would be assisting in the probe, Handa said that if AAIB requires any assistance, overseas agencies would be contacted."Each aircraft accident investigation is unique. Seasoned investigators do study the reports of other accident investigation agencies as well and there is a little doubt in my mind that they won't be aware of the recommendations of Mangalore crash," Handa said.He was responding to a question on the possible takeaways for the probe from the report on the plane crash in Mangalore in 2010.In 2010, an Air India Express aircraft overshot the runway at Mangalore airport, fell into a gorge, caught fire and 158 people lost their lives in the accident.The Court of Inquiry into the Mangalore accident, that happened on May 22, 2010, had said the direct cause was the captain's failure to discontinue the unstabilised approach of the plane.

12-08-2020||New Delhi||Modi to launch ‘Transparent Taxation - Honouring the Honest’ platform on Thursday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday launch a new platform, ‘Transparent Taxation – Honouring the Honest’, which will carry forward the journey of direct tax reforms, an official statement said here.The virtual event will be witnessed by various chambers of commerce, trade associations, chartered accountants' associations and "eminent" taxpayers, the statement issued on Wednesday said.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Singh Thakur would also be present, it said.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has carried out several major tax reforms in direct taxes in the recent years, the statement pointed out.Last year, corporate tax rates were reduced from 30 to 22 per cent, and for new manufacturing units, the rates were reduced to 15 per cent, it said.Dividend distribution tax was also abolished, it added.The focus of the tax reforms has been on reduction in tax rates and on simplification of direct tax laws. Several initiatives have been taken by the CBDT for bringing in efficiency and transparency in the functioning of the Income Tax (I-T) Department, the statement said.This includes bringing more transparency in official communication through the newly introduced Document Identification Number (DIN), wherein every communication of the department would carry a computer-generated unique document identification number, the statement said.Similarly, to increase the ease of compliance for taxpayers, the I-T Department has moved forward with pre-filling of income tax returns to make compliance more convenient for individual taxpayers.Compliance norms for startups had also been simplified, it said.With a view to providing for resolution of pending tax disputes, the I-T Department also brought out the Direct Tax ‘Vivad se Vishwas Act, 2020’, under which declarations for settling disputes are being filed currently.To effectively reduce taxpayer grievances and litigation, the monetary thresholds for filing of departmental appeals in various appellate courts have been raised.Several measures had been taken to promote digital transactions and electronic modes of payment, it said.The I-T Department has also made efforts to ease compliances for taxpayers during the COVID-19 pandemic by extending statutory timeliness for filing returns, as also releasing refunds expeditiously to increase liquidity in the hands of taxpayers, the statement pointed out.

The way this episode happened, they had to stay in hotels...so it was natural to be upset. I have exhorted them that in the interest of the country, state, people of the state and for saving democracy, sometimes we have to bear.”                MLAs belonging to the Gehlot camp were lodged in hotels for close to a month as the political crisis in the state played out. “We will work together and our colleagues who have gone have also returned and I hope that all, after settling the complaints and grievances, will work and fulfill our commitment to serve the state,” he said, referring to the rebel MLAs.The chief minister reiterated the allegation that the BJP was trying to topple the state government and said it was fully "exposed".However, it could not succeed in its game...'Satyamev Jayate', Gehlot said.The BJP has in the past denied the allegations levelled by Gehlot.             The chief minister said that he recently wrote a letter to all the MLAs asking them to listen to the voice of conscience and people to save democracy and stand with the truth. “It was the impact of the letter that BJP booked three charter planes to take their MLAs to Gujarat but only one plane could go,” he said.    Gehlot maintained that democracy was maintained in the country due to the contribution of Congress leaders and hoped that democracy is sustained in the country.

12-08-2020||New Delhi||Naidu says he has 'aced' coronavirus scare||The Vice President of India and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said he has "aced" the coronavirus scare and was able to expand his work schedule and public commitment "contrary to initial apprehensions and hesitancy".He virtually put the Members of Rajya Sabha and others pitted along the headwind of his work-velocity to be ready to discharge official duties.Speaking at an event at the completion of his three years in office as Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman, Naidu said the Corona induced confinement over the last four months has kept him "more busy and engaged than before".He made extensive use of technology and technology platforms and social media.Naidu has the reputation of not holding punches in calling to order MPs on the floor of the House, and his insistence on following rules and procedures.A salient feature of the celebratory event was the release of a publication titled "Connecting, Communicating, Changing" by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. It was organised by the Information and Public Broadcasting Ministry.Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar released the electronic version of the publication.Recounting the three years in office, Naidu said the functioning of Rajya Sabha has shown certain "winds of change" as evident in the consistently higher level of productivity and increased legislative output over the last few sessions.Also, the attendance in the meetings of the Committees of Rajya Sabha crossed the 50 per cent mark for the first time.Before he took charge, the productivity of the Rajya Sabha had been declining over the last 25 years with the House reporting annual productivity of 100 per cent only once in 1999 during the last 20 years.The overall productivity of the last eight sessions presided by him during the last three years has been 65.50 per cent despite the intervening election year seriously impacting the functioning of the House.Referring to improvement in legislative output as yet another indication of change, Naidu said that out of the 93 Bills passed by Rajya Sabha during the last three years of his Chairmanship, 60 of them accounting for 65 per cent of the total were passed during the last three sessions.Despite the given composition of the House and stated positions of different parties, Rajya Sabha passed some major Bills including the Triple Talaq Bill, the Citizenship(Amendment) Bill and the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill.Stating that the functioning of the eight Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees of Rajya Sabha has been an area of concern and focus for him, the Naidu informed about the improvements in this regard as a further indication of the change.The attendance in the meetings of these Committees has crossed the 50 per cent mark for the first time during the last year (since reconstitution in September 2019 ).However, the loss of about one-third of the functional time of the House due to disruptions during the last eight sessions wrankles with him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naidu-says-he-has-aced-coronavirus-scare-125516

Surve never realised that the caller was asking for Rhea, the Bollywood actor.After a while, the frequency of callers increased and in no time, the calls turned abusive. He was quoted in the report as saying: “I started receiving messages, voice calls and video calls on WhatsApp. People asked me to send them a photograph of myself when I told them that they were mistaken. I tried to ignore the calls but it only worsened over the next three days.”Reportedly, Surve realised what was happening only after his cousin pointed out that a TV channel had flashed Rhea's mobile number when it showed Sushant's call records and mentioned how his mobile number differed from her by just a single digit. Meanwhile, Rhea Chakraborty told Supreme Court on Tuesday that there appears to be a considerable amount of state interference, influence and therefore an apprehension of bias in the probe conducted by Bihar Police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-clerical-staffer-faces-abuse-harassment-as-he-is-mistaken-for-rhea-chakraborty-blocks-150-callers-report-125509

12-08-2020||Moscow||Russia first to approve Covid vaccine||President Vladimir Putin today said Russia had become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, a move hailed by Moscow as evidence of its scientific prowess.Read also: How moscow did itRussian researchers used an already proven technology instead of going into uncharted territory. Since 2015, they have been working on a two-vector approach, using two adenoviral vectors — Ad5 and Ad26. This way, they trick the body that has developed immunity against first vector & boost vaccine effect with 2nd shot using a different vector.The development paves the way for the mass inoculation of the Russian population, even as the final stage of clinical trials to test safety and efficacy continues.Named Sputnik V, after satelliteThe vaccine has been named Sputnik V, which is a reference to the 1957 Cold War era surprise launch of the world’s first satellite by the Soviet Union.The speed at which Russia is moving to roll out its vaccine highlights its determination to win the global race for an effective product, but has stirred concerns that it may be putting national prestige before sound science and safety.Global raceforeign partnersSpeaking at a government meeting on the state television, Putin said the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, was safe and that it had even been administered to one of his daughters.“I know that it works quite effectively, forms strong immunity, and I repeat, it has passed all the needed checks,” said Putin. He said he hoped the country would soon start mass producing the vaccine.Its approval by the health ministry foreshadows the start of a larger trial involving thousands of participants, commonly known as a Phase-III trial. Such trials, which require a certain rate of participants catching the virus to observe the vaccine’s effect, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval.Regulators around the world have insisted that the rush to develop Covid-19 vaccines will not compromise safety. But recent surveys show growing public distrust in governments’ efforts to rapidly produce such a vaccine. More than 100 possible vaccines are being developed around the world to try to stop the pandemic. At least four are in final phase-III human trials, according to WHO data. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-first-to-approve-covid-vaccine-125272
12-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi guarded; task force to meet today||India reacted cautiously to the Russian announcement today with Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan saying “we cannot answer the hypothetical question about any vaccine having been developed by any particular country”.The Health Secretary evaded queries on whether India was in touch with Russia for procurement of Sputnik V, saying the National Task Force on Vaccine Administration was mandated to decide suitable vaccines for procurement.The Health Secretary said the task force, the highest policymaking body on the issue set up recently, will meet here tomorrow to discuss issues related to Covid vaccine, including the selection of suitable vaccines for procurement.The task force headed by Member, Health NITI Aayog, and co-chaired by Health Secretary will discuss the terms of reference, including suitable vaccines for procurement; procedure for procurement; delivery issues; priority groups for inoculation; logistical issues, including cold chain and inventory challenges; and financial matters related to vaccine procurement.Meanwhile, top epidemiologists were not enthused by the Russian announcement that came close on the heels of the WHO urging Russia to follow established vaccine trial guidelines to produce a safe vaccine.Reports say clinical trials on Sputnik V vaccine started only on June 18 on 38 volunteers and that “all human subjects developed antibodies and immunity”.Date of introduction to civilian circulation has been mentioned by Russia as January 1, 2021. Former head of community medicine at PGI, Chandigarh, Rajesh Kumar said no scientific literature had been published on the Russian vaccine yet.“The timelines Russia claims to have followed before approving the vaccine is beyond our comprehension. Such fast-tracking is unbelievable. Besides, the Russian vaccine has never been among six potential worldwide vaccine candidates the WHO had been mentioning,” said Kumar.India is currently focused on three vaccine candidates under trial at home. The first is global frontrunner Covishied, being developed by Oxford University and Astra Zeneca with Serum Institute. The other two vaccines under trial in India are Covaxin and ZyCov-D.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-guarded-task-force-to-meet-today-125273

A part of the fleet of drones will be adapted to carry bombs and air-to-ground missiles.Defence Council approvalsair-to-ground missilesincluding 106 Basic Trainer Aircraft (HTT-40)The Indian armed forces, so far, don’t have drones which can fire ammunition from air, however, they do have “kamikaze drones” – Harop — which can hover over a target. On command from a ground-based controller, they can self-implode on the target.The decision on the upgrade was taken on Tuesday by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC).The Heron drones with the Indian Air Force and Army have high-resolution surveillance cameras and electronic signal tracking systems, but their operating system will have to be modified for hitting targets. In February this year, drones’ manufacturer Israel Aerospace Industries had announced a strategic partnership with MoD-owned public sector undertaking Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Dynamatic Technologies Limited (DTL) to jointly manufacture Heron MK II drones. These are the armed variety.The ones India is looking to upgrade could possibly be done through the same partnership.The DAC also okayed acquisition of platforms and equipment worth Rs 8,722.38 crore. This includes 106 Basic Trainer Aircraft (HTT-40). The aircraft will address the basic training requirements of the IAF. After certification, 70 Basic Trainer Aircraft will be initially procured from HAL and the remaining 36 after operationalisation of HTT-40 fleet in the IAF.The DAC approved procurement of 125-mm ammunition for the Army. The ammunition being procured will have 70 per cent indigenous content.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/set-for-upgrade-uavs-to-fire-ammunition-125307

A son is a son until he gets a wife. A daughter is a daughter throughout her life,” the court observed in a significant judgment while upholding the rights of a daughter even if the father died before the enactment of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said the provisions contained in substituted Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, conferred the status of coparcener on the daughter born before or after the amendment in the same manner as a son with the same rights and liabilities. Coparcener is a person who assumes a legal right on parental property by birth only.The SC overruled its 2015 decision in which it had held the rights under the amendment were applicable to living daughters of living coparceners as on September 9, 2005, irrespective of when such daughters are born. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daughters-have-equal-rights-over-joint-hindu-family-property-supreme-court-125337

In an interview with The Tribune, he recalled his first meeting at 12 with indomitable poet Jan Nisar Akhtar, father of Javed Akhtar. Indori took Akhtar’s sagacious advice and held by it, “The first condition for writing well lies in reading, not just in the language you intend to write in, but you need to browse world literature.”“He was the most popular poet of our times, who connected with the young generation as well,” says Madhav Kaushik, Vice-President, National Sahitya Akademi.
