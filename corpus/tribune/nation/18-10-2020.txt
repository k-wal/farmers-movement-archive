More than 100 students participated in the march and a subsequent dharna, the JNUSU said.The march culminated at the North Gate with the dharna staged by students.The march was addressed by JNUSU office-bearers, including its general secretary Satish Chandra, who said, “Students must be allowed inside in a phased manner. Researchers have their submissions in December. Many have their books and laptops in their hostel rooms, which now stand double-locked. How is research even possible without such crucial things? Proper SOP, including testing and quarantine facility, must be ensured by the JNU administration.”Students have put up a temporary tent near the main entrance. They spent the whole night there and have resolved to stage the sit-in until the university administration starts calling students back to the campus.The JNU has formed a panel to work out guidelines on ensure a phased return of students to the campus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jnusu-starts-indefinite-sit-in-demanding-phased-return-of-students-to-campus-157693

18-10-2020||Bhadohi||UP: NISHAD party MLA among 3 booked allegedly for raping singer||Three men, including NISHAD party MLA Vijay Mishra and his son, were booked on Sunday for allegedly raping a 25-year-old singer, police said.NISHAD party is an ally of the ruling BJP.Bhadohi Superintendent of Police Ram Badan Singh said the singer alleged that in 2014 Mishra had called her to his house for a programme, when he raped her and threatened to kill her if she ever spoke up about the incident.She alleged that in 2015, she was raped at a hotel in Varanasi. She also claimed that once after raping her, Mishra told his son and nephew to drop her home but, both of them allegedly raped her before taking her back.The singer lodged a complaint at Gopiganj police station on Sunday after she came to know that Mishra was lodged in Agra jail in connection with a case involving land grabbing. His wife and his son are co-accused in the case.Mishra was shifted to Agra central jail from Chitrakoot jail around three weeks back.In August, Vijay Mishra, his wife and son were booked on several serious charges including property grabbing on a complaint by their relative Krishna Mohan Mishra. Ramlali Mishra (wife of the MLA) is out after getting anticipatory bail from high court, while his son is absconding after his bail plea was rejected.Mishra was arrested by the police from Madhya Pradesh and subsequently jailed.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||LAC row: 8th round of Corps Commander talks likely this week||The eighth round of Corps Commander-level talks between India and China is likely to take place this week with a focus on carrying forward their discussions on the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh as the region enters the harsh winter season, government sources said.There was no breakthrough on the disengagement of troops from the friction points during the seventh round of talks on October 12.Both sides had maintained that the talks were “positive and constructive”.“The eighth round of military talks is likely to take place this week. The date is yet to be finalised,” said a source.A joint press statement by the two armies a day after the last round of talks said that both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement “as early as possible”.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The sixth round of talks were held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by the Chinese soldiers to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.As tensions escalated further, the foreign ministers of India and China held talks in Moscow on September 10 where they reached the five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh.In the last three months, the Indian Army rushed tanks, heavy weaponry, ammunition, fuel, food and essential winter supplies to various treacherous and high-altitude areas of the region to maintain combat readiness through the harsh winter of around four months starting around mid-October. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-row-8th-round-of-corps-commander-talks-likely-this-week-157685
18-10-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to interfere with HC order on harassment inquiry against judicial officer||The Supreme Court has refused to interfere with the Uttarakhand High Court’s interim order dismissing a senior judicial officer’s plea for changing the inquiry officer, who was examining charges of sexual harassment against him, over alleged bias.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi rejected the plea of the additional district judge, saying that he can raise the ground of bias even after the inquiry against him gets over.“We are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the high court. The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of accordingly.“However, the high court is requested to finally dispose of the writ petition when the matter is listed on October 31, along with amendment application,” the bench said in its recent order.Senior advocate P S Patwalia, who appeared for the petitioner along with advocate Sachin Sharma, argued that his client has an outstanding record and these allegations were levelled to embarrass him.He claimed that a day after his plea for a change of inquiry officer was taken up for hearing by the high court, the inquiry officer had closed the defence and started proceedings ex-parte.The bench said that it will not interfere with the inquiry but can ask the high court to decide on the plea and pass the order.“If you have a good case on bias, you will succeed. You can argue on the point of bias, even after the inquiry gets over”, the bench said.The additional district judge in his plea has contended that the inquiry officer, who is a sitting judge of the high court, is also a member of the committee that had recommended disciplinary inquiry against him, and any exercise so conducted cannot be said to be fair.He claimed that the high court on October 8, without considering the facts and circumstances of the case, by a non-speaking order gave a prima facie finding that it was too late for making the allegation of bias against the presiding officer and had rejected the stay application.“That it is a gross case of violation of the principle of natural justice wherein the petitioner, who is a member of Higher Judicial Service, imparted justice without any spot on his career for the last 16 years, having outstanding ACR throughout, is now himself rattling for the justice,” his plea said.The plea sought a stay on the order of the high court as well as on the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner.The plea said that in 2017, the petitioner was transferred from the post of registrar of the Uttarakhand High Court and was posted as First Additional District Judge and Session Judge, Haridwar.It said on February 1, 2018, the complainant was directed to join/attach with the officer of the petitioner as a contractual employee and just after working for two days on February 1 and 2, he was directed to join at some other place.To the shock and surprise of the petitioner,  he was informed after being suspended and charge-sheeted that the contractual employee had made a “false and frivolous complaint, dated March 19, 2018, to the district Judge Haridwar, alleging therein that the petitioner had tried to take undue advantage and sexually harassed him on February 1 and 2”.The plea contended that “this bare fact itself shows that complainant was planted by someone having grudges against the petitioner to defame/disable him from performing his official duties”.The petition claimed that the complainant and his mother, in their cross-examination conducted before the Inquiry Officer, had admitted that they filed the complaint dated March 19, 2018 only because they were promised that the complainant’s job will be regularized.“Hence, the entire disciplinary proceeding is nothing but a gross abuse of process of law,” it said, adding that on September 21, the inquiry officer had even refused to allow the complainant to withdraw his complaint.The plea also said that the inquiry officer had dismissed the recusal application dated September 21 filed by the petitioner. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-hc-order-on-harassment-inquiry-against-judicial-officer-157680
18-10-2020||New Delhi||Indian democracy passing through its ‘most difficult phase’: Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday launched a scathing attack on the government over the three farm laws, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic slowdown and alleged atrocities against Dalits, while claiming that Indian democracy is passing through its “most difficult phase”.A “conspiracy” has been hatched to defeat the gains of the ‘green revolution’, she alleged, slamming the government over the three “anti-agriculture black laws”.Addressing a meeting of AICC general secretaries and state-incharge which she presided over, Gandhi also alleged that the country was being ruled by a government which was “systematically” handing over the rights of citizens to a handful of crony capitalists.This was the first meeting of general secretaries and state in-charges Sonia Gandhi chaired after a major organisational reshuffle last month.Hitting out at the government over the recently passed farm laws, she said the BJP-led dispensation has attacked the very foundation of India’s resilient agrarian economy by bringing in “three anti-agriculture black laws”.“A conspiracy has been hatched to defeat the gains of the ‘green revolution’. Lives and livelihoods of crores of farm labourers, leasehold farmers, small and marginal farmers, toiling labourers and small shopkeepers are under attack. It is our solemn duty to join hands to defeat this sinister conspiracy,” Gandhi asserted.The three farm bills—the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- were passed by Parliament recently. Subsequently, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bills.The Congress, many other opposition parties and several farmers organisations have been protesting against these legislations, claiming that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government. The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income.Alleging that the country’s democracy is passing through its “most difficult phase”, Gandhi claimed there is a “designed attack” on the Constitution and democratic traditions.The country was pushed into the “abyss” of coronavirus pandemic by “sheer ineptitude” and “mismanagement” of the Modi government, Gandhi alleged in her opening remarks at the meeting.“All this happened as we witnessed the biggest unplanned and cruel migration of crores of migrant labourers as the government remained a mute spectator to their miseries.“The stark truth is that a prime minister who promised to defeat corona within 21 days has abdicated his and his government’s responsibility towards the citizens,” Gandhi said.There is neither a plan nor strategic thinking, solution or a way ahead in the fight against the pandemic, she alleged in her address in Hindi.Gandhi claimed that the government has simultaneously “demolished” the economy, built painstakingly by the hard work of fellow Indians and the vision of successive Congress governments.“Never has the country witnessed such a free-fall in GDP as also all other economic indices. Today, the young have no jobs. Nearly 14 crore jobs have been lost. Small and medium businesses, small shopkeepers and other small enterprises are shutting at an unprecedented pace, yet an uncaring government remains a mute spectator,” the Congress president said.She also accused the government of failing to honour even its Constitutional responsibilities, saying the share of GST compensation is being denied to states.“How will the state governments help our people, if the government of India was to renege on its Constitutional obligations? This must be a first example of economic anarchy being spread by the central government,” Gandhi said.Alleging that atrocities against Dalits have reached a “new zenith”, she said that instead of honouring the law and granting adequate protection to India’s daughters, BJP governments are siding with criminals.“The voice of oppressed families is being suppressed by the agencies of the state. Is this the new ‘Raj Dharma’?” Gandhi asked.She exhorted the general secretaries and state in-charges to take on these challenges and stand with the people, saying this is what defines the Congress organisation.“I am confident that all of you would toil hard and stand up to the forces attacking India and its people. Let us join hands to defeat the anti-democracy and autocratic designs of the ruling BJP,” she said.“Persistent and determined struggle for the cause of people is the heart and soul of Indian National Congress. Even today, dedicated service of fellow citizens and determined fight against the injustice, inequity and discrimination in all spheres is the guiding light for every Congress men and women,” Gandhi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-democracy-passing-through-its-most-difficult-phase-sonia-gandhi-157678
18-10-2020||Hathras (UP)||Hathras: Anti-Romeo squads back in action to check crimes against women||Nearly a dozen teams with over 50 police personnel are part of the anti-Romeo squads that have been reactivated in Hathras to check crimes against women, officials said on Sunday.The development comes as part of the “Mission Shakti” campaign of the Uttar Pradesh government, which has faced flak over a string of rape incidents, including the alleged gangrape and death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman here, recently.“There are 11 police stations, including the Mahila Thana, in the district. There are 11 anti-Romeo squads with five police personnel in each team. One team includes three women and two men personnel. These squads would keep an eye on miscreants harassing or troubling women and girls in the district,” Hathras Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal told PTI.The district police chief on Sunday held a meeting with all members of the squads and stressed on the need to put a check on crimes against women and girls.These squads would patrol public places like markets, the vicinity of schools and colleges, coaching institutes, bus stands, parks, among others, to prevent harassment of women and girls, and indecency against them by miscreants, a police spokesperson said.“The squads would also raise awareness among women and girls about the helpline numbers being operated by the state government and the state police. For example, they can dial 112, 181 and 1090 (women helpline), 1076 (chief minister’s helpline), 1098 (child helpline), 102 and 108 (healthcare and ambulance),” the spokesperson said.The squads will also apprise the women and children about mobile phone apps like the UP COP and how they could be used by distressed persons, the official added.The anti-Romeo squads were constituted to check stalkers and eve-teasers in Uttar Pradesh soon after Yogi Adityanath had assumed the office of the chief minister in 2017.Facing flak over crimes against women in the state, Adityanath on Saturday had launched the ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign that focuses on ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girls, with a stern warning that perpetrators of crimes against females will be dealt with an iron hand.

18-10-2020||Mumbai||Path to restart Jet operations very tough, uncertain, says expert||The path to recommence operations of the grounded Jet Airways is very tough and uncertain despite the committee of creditors (CoC) approval of the airline’s revival plan submitted by the Kalrock Capital-Murari Lal Jalan consortium, aviation advisory and research practice CAPA India head Kapil Kaul has said.The plan was approved after the conclusion of the e-voting on the proposal, Jet Airways RP (resolution professional) Ashish Chhawchharia had informed the BSE on Saturday.After failing to get funds even for daily operations, the then cash-strapped airline announced temporary suspension of services on April 17 last year and the last flight S2-3502 that took off from Amritsar at around 10:30 pm touched down at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at 12:22 am on April 18.Subsequently, the carrier went into administration in June 2019. The CoC has met 16 times since then, extending the deadline for submission of bids one after another. The initial deadline for receipt of EoIs was August 3, 2019.“Path to restart operations is very tough and uncertain,” Kaul told PTI without elaborating.He also said that the “terms” accepted by the Jet Airways creditors did not make sense to CAPA.At the peak of its operations, Jet Airways had little over 120 planes. When the operations came to a halt due to mounting debt woes and unpaid salaries, the airline had around 16 own planes.The plan will now be submitted to the NCLT for its final approval. If the court allows, Florian Fritsch and Murari Lal Jalan would have the task of taking the airline off the ground again at a time when the aviation industry globally is in financial distress due to the pandemic.The grounded airline had received bids from two consortiums, one comprising UK-based Kalrock Capital founded by Florian Fritsch and UAE-based entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan.The other bid was submitted by the consortium consisting of Haryana-based Flight Simulation Technique Centre, Big Charter of Mumbai and Abu Dhabi’s Imperial Capital Investments LLC.Airline revenues plunged 80 per cent in the first six months of the year, according to industry despite pruning costs just over 50 per cent during the second quarter, compared to the year-ago period.Jet Airways saw its losses widening to Rs 5,535.75 crore in the year ended March 2019, mainly due to surge in expenses, as against a loss of Rs 766.13 crore in 2017-18. These figures are for standalone comprehensive losses.Kalrock Partners provides a combination of investment and advisory services in financial, marketing, managerial and legal matters to all its partners while Jalan has investments in diversified business such as real estate, mining, trading, construction, fast-moving consumer goods, dairy, travel & tourism and industrial works globally.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||Tectonic fault line in Ladakh active: Study||The fault line in Ladakh region, where India and Asian Plates are joined, has been found to be tectonically active, according to a new study.The new findings, which suggest a more remote fault at the suture zone or the Indus Suture Zone (ISZ)  being neo-tectonically active, could call for a serious relook into the existing evolutionary models, using new techniques and a larger geological database.The findings can also have major implications in terms of earthquake study, prediction and understanding the seismic structure of the mountain chains.The Indus-Tsangpo suture zone marks the limit of the Indian plate where it collided with the Asian plate.A group of scientists from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun, an institute under the Department of Science and Technology, have found that the suture zone which was conventionally thought to be locked is tectonically active.The scientists carried out the mapping of the remote regions of Ladakh that forms the most hinterland part of the Himalaya. The study was published recently in the journal ‘Technophysics’.“Since we have shown that fault in this area (Ladakh) is also active, the rocks along the fault zones are very weak and fragile. So, in terms of landslides it has much more implications. Seismically, this area is also active, but the activity is very low to moderate.“If there is any major rainfall event along the Indus river fault, it is more prone to landslides,” said Koushik Sen, one of the co-authors of the paper.The geologists observed that sedimentary beds are tilted and thrust broken, the rivers are associated with uplifted terraces, and the bedrock shows brittle deformation that occurred at much shallower depths.These deformed geological features were then dated in the laboratory at Dehradun using a technique called Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) (method for carrying luminescence dating of geological sediments) and data of seismicity and denudation rate was reviewed.The combination of field and lab data suggested the region of the Indus Suture Zone (ISZ) has been neo-tectonically active since the last 78,000-58,000 years and a recent earthquake in 2010 of low magnitude 4.0 near the village of Upshi occurred due to a thrust rupture.Himalayas were known to be made up of north dipping thrusts like the Main Central Thrust (MCT), the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT), and the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT).As per the established models, all of these thrusts except MFT are locked, and overall deformation in the Himalayas is being accommodated only along with the MFT. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tectonic-fault-line-in-ladakh-active-study-157657
18-10-2020||Buxar/Jagdishpur (Bihar)||Bihar polls: Nitish, Sushil Modi launch joint poll campaign; hit out at Lalu||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi held joint election campaign on Sunday and launched a blistering attack on rival Lalu Prasad highlighting the crime situation and lack of development during his RJD rule in the past.Reeling out comparative data during 15 years under the RJD and an equal period under the NDA now, the two leaders sought another chance from voters to speed up development work in the state in the next five years.The two started the day with a public meeting at Buxar, where BJP has fielded Parshuram Chaturvedi as its candidate.He is pitted against sitting MLA Sanjay Kumar Tiwari of the Congress.This was the constituency from where former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who took VRS and joined JD(U), was expected to enter the poll fray, but the seat went to ally BJP under the seat-sharing deal.After launching separate campaign since beginning of this week, Kumar and Sushil Modi moved together on Sunday and sought support for BJP as well as JD(U) nominees on four seats of Buxar, Dumraon, Tarari and Jagdishpur.In the Buxar rally, former state police chief and JD(U) leader Gupteshwar Pandey was not present.But, the BJP nominee Parshuram Chaturvedi said he enjoys his support and blessings.Chaturvedi himself had taken premature retirement as Assistant Sub Inspector in the Bihar police in 2003 and joined politics.“Gupteshwar Pandey is not only my boss in police but also an elder brother to whom I touch feet out of respect and he has always shower blessings on me,” Chaturvedi told PTI.Both the CM and Sushil Modi kept their focus on the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and highlighted the condition prevailing in the state during 1990 to 2005 which both described as “jungle raj”.“What was the condition of law and order at that time.People were afraid to step out of home after sunset. We ended ‘jungle raj’ and established ‘rule of law’,” Kumar said at the Buxar rally.Both referred to corruption prevailing during the RJD regime and Prasad himself indulging in corrupt practices.“Those involved in self servie are behind the bars today and many more will follow them soon,” Kumar said.Prasad is in Ranchi jail after being convicted in four cases of multi-crore rupees fodder scam.While Kumar highlighted “inexperience” of the opposition chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav, though he did not name him, and accused him of making “anap-sanap” (illogical) statements against him to get “publicity”, Sushil Modi was more severe in criticising him.“See a man who failed in class 9th and has no history of any family business is today owener of 52 properties at an age of 31. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has long innings as chief minister of Gujarat and PM for last six years, is no match to him financially,” Sushil Modi said in an apparent jibe at Tejashwi Yadav.Sushil Modi praised the Nitish Kumar ministry for effectively dealing with the COVID pandemic in Bihar and hit out at the Maharashtra government in which Congress is one of the partners for doing precious little in this regard.“More than 40,000 people lost their lives due to coronavirus in Maharashtra where Congress is part of the ruling dispensation. Whereas in Bihar the NDA government by making proper arrangements has minimised the death toll to less than 1000 so far,” Sushil Modi, who is a senior BJP leader of the state, said.Kumar also made mention of high testing of samples in Bihar and over 94 per cent recovery rate of coronavirus patients in the state to drive home the point.The JD(U) president took a potshots at his bete noire Lalu Prasad for merely anointing wife on the chief ministerial chair but not doing anything for the upliftment of women during the RJD rule.“While the leader at that time installed wife on the chair (of CM) before going to jail but did he do anything for welfare of the females?” he asked the crowd. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-polls-nitish-sushil-modi-launch-joint-poll-campaign-hit-out-at-lalu-157655

The nearest village in Assam is Lailapur, which is in the Cachar district.Kolasib district deputy commissioner H Lalthlangliana told PTI that a large number of Vairengte residents assembled when some people from Assam, armed with sticks and dao, pelted stones at a group near the auto-rickshaw stand on the outskirts of the border village on Saturday evening.The irate mob from Vairengte retaliated and set on fire about 20 temporary bamboo huts and stalls built along the national highway by residents of Lailapur despite a prohibitory order being in place, he said.One of the injured persons, who suffered a cut in his neck, was admitted to the Kolasib district hospital and the condition was critical. Three people were being treated at a Public Health Centre (PHC) in Vairengte, he said.“Despite the prohibitory order under Section 144 of the CrPC and policemen trying their best, the situation turned violent and became out of control as people gathered in large numbers,” he said.The incident could be the fallout of the demolition of a makeshift hut used by local volunteers who guard the inter-state border near the Saihaipui ‘V’ village, 3 km from Vairengte, he said.The volunteers are guarding the border to check the movement of the people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.Lalthlangliana said no one died in the clash and one person from Assam was admitted at Silchar Medical College and Hospital.He said he has spoken to Cachar deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli over the violence and asked her to take measures to ensure that the national highway, which has been blocked by the local people, is cleared at the earliest.The Assam government also said the situation is under control and senior officials along with police are in the area to defuse the tension.The state’s forest Minister Parimal Shuklabaidya, who is the MLA of Dholai in Cachar, told PTI that such incidents happen in the area every year as people from both the sides illegally cut trees.Suklabaidya, on the direction of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, visited Lailapur during the day and interacted with the people.The incident was the handiwork of miscreants to create disturbance in the community, a statement issued by the Assam government quoted him as saying.Assuring the people living close to the border of safety and security, Suklabaidya said he would place their demands of police outpost and other security-related issues to higher authorities.“The government is with you all and will take necessary steps,” he told the locals.Jalli, the deputy commissioner of Cachar, also visited the area along the inter-state border.She assured the locals that the administration would provide them the security to ward off the “evil machinations at work” to create disturbance between the people of the two states.Commissioner (Home) Gyanendra Tripathi assured the local people of protection and urged them to live in harmony with the people of Mizoram.Assam’s DIG Southern Range Dilip Kumar Dey, Additional Deputy Commissioner Rajib Roy, and Circle Officer of Sonai Sudeep Nath were also in the area.“We got reports of a few temporary houses and stalls being burnt. Police reached the spot and brought the situation under control. We are taking all possible steps to ensure such incidents do not recur in near future,” Cachar’s Superintendent of Police Bhanwar Lal Meena said.Security has been beefed up in Lailapur and along the inter-state border, the Assam government said in the statement.However, former Silchar MP Sushmita Dev of the Congress earlier told PTI that she visited the troubled area but found no officials there.Lalthangliana said the Kolasib district administration is giving shelter to truck drivers, mostly from Assam, at Kolasib town and Kawnpui village and volunteers of the Young Mizo Association (YMA) provided them food.Mizoram’s MNF MLA Lalrintluanga Sailo, who is camping at Vairengte, said that his state is not hostile to Assam or its people but is protecting its territory from infiltration by illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, who are living in the border areas.He claimed that more than 80 per cent of people living along the Assam-Mizoram border are illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.Sailo alleged that the border dispute is a ploy by some politicians with vested interest to take advantage in view of the Assam election, likely to be held early next year.At least 11 MLAs of Mizoram’s ruling party MNF, including deputy speaker Lalrinawma, are at present camping in Vairengte.Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga also held a cabinet meeting over the border dispute during the day.“I sincerely request everyone to maintain peace and to kindly not bypass any administrative proceedings,” he tweeted.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, home minister Lalchamliana said the Mizoram government has urged Assam to make efforts to defuse the tension and restore peace and tranquility in the border area.He alleged that recently troubles were created by Assam at three border points—Thinghlun in Mamit district, and Saihapui ‘V’ and Vairengte, both in Kolasib.“We have approached the Centre over the border dispute. Accordingly, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla will hold a virtual meeting with chief secretaries of the two states on Monday to defuse the prevailing border standoff,” he said.At least seven people from Mizoram were injured in the clash that took place on Saturday night, he said.He said that the state government has sent reinforcement to the border area to stabilise the situation.Asserting that a 509-square-miles stretch of the inner-line reserve forest notified in 1875 was the actual Mizoram’s boundary with Assam, the state home minister said, “We are not trying to encroach on Assam’s territory but faithfully protecting our land at all cost.”According to Lalchamliana, Mizoram is likely to face a shortage of essential commodities, especially cooking gas and fuel, due to the indefinite blockade by residents of Lailapur on the national highway, which is the lifeline of the state.He urged the people, especially traders, not to hoard commodities and hike their prices.He further asked civil bodies not to act on their own and break law and order.Mizoram Chief Secretary Lalnunmawia Chuaungo said that the state government has consented to the formation of a boundary commission and officially intimated the matter to the Centre.He said that the core committee constituted by the state government in connection with the state boundary is studying and assessing old maps and documents.The two states are often at loggerheads over the boundary, which they dispute.Recently, a standoff took place near Thinghlun village in Mizoram’s Mamit district on the border with Assam’s Karimganj when Assam officials allegedly demolished a farm hut erected on the disputed land.Mizoram shares a 164.6-km border with Assam.Several dialogues held since 1995 to resolve the border dispute have yielded little results. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tension-at-assam-mizoram-border-as-several-injured-in-violent-clash-157654

18-10-2020||New Delhi||Shashi Tharoor’s remarks at Lahore event spark BJP-Cong spat||The BJP and the Congress were engaged in a war of words on Sunday over MP Shashi Tharoor’s remarks at a Lahore event, as the ruling party accused him of “demeaning and discrediting” India and wondered if Rahul Gandhi wanted to contest elections in Pakistan.Hitting back, the opposition party said the BJP has always responded to substance and facts with “jumlebaazi” (rhetoric).The BJP attacked Tharoor after he posted a link to the comments made online at Lahore Think Fest, which his office said was held last month, in which he criticised the Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus and also spoke of alleged “bigotry and prejudice” against Muslims during the pandemic.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters that it was “unbelievable” that a senior Congress leader and an MP like Tharoor can make such comments against India at a Pakistani forum.“He has demeaned India and projected the country in dim light,” Patra said.Referring to Tharoor’s remarks that Rahul Gandhi had warned about the severity of the COVID-19 as early as in February and that he should be getting credit for it, Patra claimed that the Kerala MP was a close friend of the former Congress president and wondered if Gandhi wanted to get credit in Pakistan and contest polls there.He is already a “hero” in China and Pakistan, Patra alleged.At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said such reactions from the ruling party “ridicule” the debate and “diminish us as a democracy”.“The BJP has always responded to substance and pointed facts with ‘jumlebaazi’. The BJP has always believed in rhetoric, not substance.“Yes, it does sometimes catch you by the eyeballs or the earbuds when you hear it, but, within seconds, logic takes over and tells you how empty a rhetoric the BJP is indulging in,” he said.If somebody is praising a particular achievement or pointing to a particular area of activity “in which you are laggard in India, and asking such a person to stand for elections from Pakistan is to ridicule the debate and diminish us as a democracy”, he said.“All that is being done is to point out that you are far stronger, far bigger, far more capable country, and yet you should not be lagging behind in this parameter,” the Congress spokesperson added.Patra asserted that the Union government had imposed a timely lockdown and noted that India has a high recovery rate and a very low mortality rate in the world, as he lauded its handling of the pandemic.He also referred to Tharoor’s comments about Indian citizens from the Northeast at times facing problems elsewhere in the country to target the Congress.“What was the need to discuss such matters at a Pakistani forum? There is no country in this world as democratic and just as India,” he said.Patra referred to various remarks made by Congress leaders in the past that allegedly targeted the Modi government at events in Pakistan and asked if the opposition party members have ever asked Pakistan at its forum about its “bigotry and violence” against minorities in that country.In a swipe at Gandhi, Patra said he and the BJP will now call him “Rahul Lahori”.Singhvi, in his reaction, also noted the recent debate about the possibility of Bangladesh taking over India in terms of per capita GDP and asked if the right response to it is that he should stand for elections from Dhaka and not be in the Indian Parliament.“These responses might have short-lived, few seconds of utility but they actually show the hollowness of your intellectual ability to deal in areas where you are a complete failure,” he said, targeting the BJP.In the event, Tharoor was asked by a Pakistani journalist as to how the political fortune of the Indian government was impacted by the rising COVID numbers.He said it was paradoxical as the government was “not doing well” in dealing with the pandemic and people realise that, but polls suggest that it has not hurt the BJP politically as it should.“So we in the opposition do point out, for example, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had mentioned as early as February that COVID had to be taken more seriously than the government was taking it and preventive measures needed to be put in place immediately otherwise we would face both a health disaster and an economic catastrophe if this was allowed to run unchecked.“So he ought to be getting credit for having signalled this early on...,” Tharoor said.He also said there was a contrast between the way the COVID numbers have worked out in the two countries, India and Pakistan, but the fate of the leadership has not gone in the same contrasting way.“Both seem to be doing rather well in the public eye, which, to some of us in the opposition in India, is still a bit of a mystery, but we don’t discuss that outside India. We fight our battles at home,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shashi-tharoors-remarks-at-lahore-event-spark-bjp-cong-spat-157648

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled to take part. It is yet to be decided as to whether the meeting will be virtual or with the direct presence of the leaders, officials said.Addressing the gathering on Sunday, Misri said, “India is a new member of the SCO but our association with the countries of the ‘SCO Family’ dates back centuries and even millennia in some cases”.He said India has assumed the Chairmanship of the SCO Council of Heads of Government this year and is hosting the meeting of SCO premiers next month.“We are playing a constructive role in enriching the agenda of the SCO and many initiatives proposed by India in the fields of economics and trade, start-ups, health care, S&T and culture have been supported by SCO members,” Misri said.“Today’s presentation on Yoga@SCO is especially relevant as it goes beyond race, colour, faith, religion and region. Yoga brings people together around the world. Recent years have seen an explosion in its popularity, especially since 2014, when the UN General Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution designating June 21 as the International Day of Yoga,” he said.“Today’s event is yet another indication of Yoga’s global appeal. It is a part of India’s contribution to strengthening cultural cooperation among SCO countries…I have been greatly impressed with the fervour with which Chinese people across the country practice yoga,” he said.In his address, Norov said despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the activities of the SCO, under the presidency of Russia, a lot of work has been done to implement the plans and priorities that were identified for this year.“In the absence of regular face-to-face meetings, the Organisation’s activities quickly adapted to the new realities with the use of new formats and platforms of work, important meetings at the level of Ministers and heads of key agencies and departments were held in online format,” he said.“Next year the SCO will celebrate its 20th anniversary. In this anniversary year, in addition to official events, we have planned to hold art exhibitions, film festivals, ‘Yoga and Tai Chi Day’, student football tournament, boxing tournament, marathon races in the cities of SCO member states where ‘8 Wonders of SCO’ are located,” he said.

Community transmission is limited to certain districts, occurring in a limited number of states," Vardhan said.He added that as yet, no mutation of the coronavirus has been detected in India that is either more transmission-efficient or more pathogenic.The Centre so far has denied community transmission of the coronavirus infection in the country.Health ministry officials had said the World Health Organization (WHO) has not given any standard definition of community transmission.It permits its member nations to assess the spread of the disease, based on their own analysis of the situation, and do their reporting, which the global body shows on its website.Broadly, if it is not possible to trace the transmission chain, it means there is community transmission, officials said.The Centre has maintained that there are clusters of cases and there are pockets of localised transmission.India's COVID-19 tally mounted to 74,94,551 on Sunday with 61,871 fresh cases reported in a day, while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 1,14,031 with 1,033 more people succumbing to it in a span of 24 hours, health ministry's data updated at 8 am showed.

But, we are satisfied with the Union Home Minister’s stand and thank him for understanding the reason of our anger,” said Raut.With Shah’s statement, the Shiv Sena has put the issue to rest, the party’s chief spokesperson said.Raut dismissed speculation that Shah was being soft on the Shiv Sena, a year it snapped its ties with the BJP.“There is nothing political. What Shah spoke was in line with the Constitution of India,” he said.On Shah’s comments that the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should have been handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) earlier, Raut asked, “Why should that have been done when the Mumbai Police are capable of probing it?”“Before the investigation was completed, the case went to the CBI. What has the CBI found? Truth will come out,” the Shiv Sena leader said.Rajput (34) was found hanging at his apartment in Bandra area of Mumbai on June 14 this year.Raut also said he agreed with Shah’s observation that drugs and Bollywood should not be seen together.“It (drugs) is a global menace which should be nipped in the bud,” the Sena MP said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-welcomes-amit-shahs-stand-on-maharashtra-guv-cm-letter-row-157631

Further probe revealed that there were money transfers between Dhali and Shaik as commission paid to Dhali for trafficking across the borders, the official said.Dhali and other 10 arrested accused had illegally entered India in the 1980’s and established a prostitution racket along with Yusuf and Bithi, who are husband and wife, in various parts of India, the NIA spokesperson said.The 12 accused hatched a criminal conspiracy along with their associates in Bangladesh to look for young Bangladeshi girls in the age-group of 19-25 years and traffic them to India by crossing the Sonai river via Kolkata, and then take them to various destinations in India, including Mumbai and Hyderabad, the official said.These girls are lured with promise of lucrative jobs and better life quality. They are also provided fake Indian identity documents and are eventually forced into prostitution, the NIA official said.The rescued young girls are presently at shelter homes and the arrested accused are in judicial custody in Hyderabad.Further investigation in the case was underway.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 is additional layer to ‘gender equality in education’ challenge: UNESCO report||The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an education crisis, fuelled by deep and multiple forms of inequality having gender roots and implications, the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report by UNESCO has pointed out.Increase in gender-based violence during the period families spent at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, potential rise in teenage pregnancies or early marriages, possibility of a section of girls dropping out of schools or colleges, girls being at a disadvantage due to shift to online learning and increased responsibilities of household chores, are among the several implications pointed out by UNESCO in the report.   “Uncertainty over the contagiousness and deadliness of COVID-19 led governments around the world to impose lockdowns, curtail economic activity and close schools and universities. In April, 91 per cent of the global student population was affected in 194 countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an education crisis, fuelled by deep and multiple forms of inequality. Some of these forms have gender roots and gender implications,” it said.The report said while the extent of implications is difficult to predict with precision, they need to be monitored closely.“The first of these implications is concern that the extended period families spent at home during the lockdown increased gender-based violence. Whether such violence affects mothers or girls, the consequences for girls’ ability to continue learning are clear. Second, sexual and gender-based violence coupled with restricted access to reproductive health, police, justice and social support services may increase early pregnancy,” it added.The UNSECO report has raised a red flag about the potential increase in early pregnancy likely to be a result of increased early marriages, a consequence of households being plunged deeper into poverty due to the pandemic.“One estimate is that COVID-19 could cause 13 million more child marriages over the next 10 years. There have been attempts, based on previous knowledge of the links between poverty and school attendance, to project the potential effect of COVID-19 on dropout. UNESCO suggests that 3.5 per cent of adolescent girls of lower secondary school age and 4.1 per cent of young women of upper secondary school age in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk of not returning to school,” it said.Quoting the World Bank that girls between 12 and 17 are more at risk than boys of not returning to school in low and lower-middle-income countries, the report recommended that the countries need to recognise the need to maintain contact with girls during the pandemic to support their eventual return to schools.“Fourth, the shift to online distance learning could disadvantage girls. In low and middle income countries, women are 8 per cent less likely than men to have a mobile phone and 20 per cent less likely to use the internet on it. Finally, school closures have led to increased child care and chore responsibilities at home, which are likely to disadvantage girls more.”“A study of secondary school students in Ecuador during lockdown showed boys and girls were equally likely to continue their education in the morning but more girls did chores in the afternoon, while boys were engaged in leisure activities,” it said.COVID-19 has infected over 3.91 crore people across the globe claiming over 11 lakh lives.According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates, over 154 crore students are severely impacted by closure of educational institutions across the world amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||Vardhan says Kerala paying price for 'gross negligence' during Onam; No shortage of medical oxygen||With Kerala witnessing a spike in coronavirus infections recently, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the state was paying the "price for gross negligence" during Onam festivities when unlocking of services along with an increase in travel for trade and tourism led to the spread of COVID-19.The minister said this ought to serve as a good lesson for all the state governments that were being negligent in planning for the festival season.Kerala's COVID-19 tally has crossed 3.3 lakh while the toll climbed to 1,139 on Saturday. Prior to Onam (August 22), the state had reported around 54,000 cases, while the death toll was nearly 200.During an interaction with his social media followers on the sixth episode 'Sunday Samvaad', Vardhan reiterated his request to everyone to celebrate festivals at home with their loved ones in the traditional way to ward off the risk of COVID-19 infection.“This festive season, charity must take precedence over celebrations."My own celebrations too shall remain subdued due to the heart-rending impact of COVID-19 on lakhs of corona warriors across the world battling for us," the minister stated.He also assured that there is no shortage of medical oxygen in the country and that the government is ready to scale up the production capacity to meet any further increase in demand arising due to the pandemic.Responding to a question on Kerala recently reporting a spike in COVID-19 cases, Vardhan said that between January 30 and May 3, the state had reported just 499 cases and two deaths due to the disease.He regretted that "Kerala was paying the price of gross negligence" during the recent Onam festivities when state-wise unlocking of services, along with an increase in inter and intrastate travel for trade and tourism led to the spread of COVID-19 across various districts.“The epi curve of Kerala changed completely due to Onam festivities across the state. The daily new cases nearly doubled," Vardhan said.He exhorted the people to honour the prime minister's call for a 'jan andolan' (mass movement) to religiously follow COVID-appropriate behaviour.Vardhan also said that as of yet, no mutation of coronavirus has been detected in India that is either more transmission efficient or more pathogenic.He rekindled the joy of having morning tea with the daily newspaper in a respondent by reassuring him that there is no scientific evidence that proves that novel coronavirus transmission can happen via newspapers."Reading newspapers is completely safe even during the COVID-19 pandemic," he said.Answering a question on the discrepancy in the COVID-19 death figures, Vardhan said that the Ministry of Health has taken up the issue of correct certification of COVID-19 deaths with all states and UTs on multiple instances.It has also shared a proper modality of reporting of deaths with them to ensure consistency in reporting of COVID-19 related deaths across India, the minister said.On the availability of medical oxygen in the country, he said the current oxygen production capacity of India is around 6400 MT/Day.The government is ready to scale up the production capacity to meet any further increase in demand arising due to the pandemic, he said.The Empowered Group constituted by the home ministry is monitoring the requirement of medical oxygen across India.The health ministry is also monitoring the availability and supply of medical oxygen at the field level through regular video conferencing with state nodal officers as well as with principal secretaries or mission directors.He said 1,02,400 medical oxygen cylinders had been delivered to states and UTs.The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has fixed the price of Liquid Medical Oxygen. Guidelines on 'Rational use of oxygen for management of COVID-19' have also been issued, he informed.Vardhan remarked that although there are no intranasal COVID-19 vaccines under trial in India at the moment, Serum India and Bharat Biotech are expected to pursue clinical trials of such vaccines in the country in the coming months on receipt of regulatory approval.He clarified that the Phase 3 clinical trial is generally with thousands of participants, sometimes even close to 30,000 to 40,000.It is possible that from a specific city or hospital, a couple of hundred participants are selected at a given time but, in general, the overall Phase 3 participant pool is much larger, the minister said.

It has given a call for “March to Parliament” on November 26 and 27 demanding the repeal of farm laws.“We will campaign for the defeat of the BJP and their allies in the Bihar Assembly elections,” national general-secretary of the All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) Hannan Mollah said on Sunday.“The farmers’ organisations will also approach the Central Trade Unions (CTUs) urging them to join the proposed anti-BJP campaign in Bihar,” Mollah added.AIKS is one of the constituents of the AIKSCC.Country’s 10 CTUs, mainly leaning to the Left, have already expressed opposition to the farm laws.The proposed offensive of the AIKSCC in Bihar is bound to cause concerns in the ruling BJP-JDU in the state.The coalition government in the state, headed by Nitish Kumar, is facing flak for alleged mishandling of migrant labourer issue, COVID-19 pandemic, floods during the lockdown and soaring unemployment.The farmers’ agitation is a development the BJP and the JDU would like to avoid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-unions-to-campaign-for-bjps-defeat-in-bihar-assembly-elections-157618
18-10-2020||New Delhi||Pollution may increase virus transmissibility making people more vulnerable to COVID-19, say experts||Air pollution may increase the transmissibility of the novel coronavirus making people more vulnerable to the disease and aggravating the COVID-19 situation, experts have said, while warning that those who have had the infection in the past may also have to face new challenges.With winters approaching and easing of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Delhi-NCR is bracing for months of poor air quality. The national capital’s air quality was in the ‘poor’ category on Sunday morning.According to doctors, respiratory illnesses, such as viral influenza, increase with a spike in pollution levels as poor air quality leads to inflammation in the lungs making it more vulnerable for the virus to penetrate.“This year, we have COVID-19. Like the common cold, the transmission of this virus is expected to increase with a rise in pollution levels. We may see a further surge in cases. It would be a taxing time for testing centres as they have to cater to people with coronavirus and also non-COVID patients with similar symptoms,” Dr Neeraj Nischal, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS, told PTI.Experts feel the worst-affected would be people in the lower socioeconomic class with no access to masks and also vulnerable to additional risk factors such as ‘chulla’ smoke.“Transmission apart, the presentation of COVID-19 like other viral respiratory illnesses will be more severe in high-pollution areas. This will burden hospitals as more patients become symptomatic, requiring admission,” Dr Nischal said.According to Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, mortality has been linked with population density, the proximity of people and heavily industrialised or urbanised areas which have higher pollution levels.These factors are likely to become more effective during the festive season and winters, particularly in north India where stubble burning is common and this affects air quality severely, he said.“Italy showed a possible link between PM 2.5 concentration and excess mortality to the extent that one-unit increase is associated with a 9 per cent increase in COVID-19 mortality,” Dr Gupta said, adding that pollution could also assist in the transmission of the novel coronavirus.During smog, particulate matters remain suspended in the air near the earth’s surface for a longer period making it conducive for the transmission of the virus, he elaborated.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant of Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals, said: “We really don’t know how this virus is going to behave. But we need to prepare ourselves for the worst as pollution level increases and with winter setting in. It will be a dangerous combination.”He cautioned that people with respiratory illness, such as asthma and bronchitis, were at much higher risk of contracting coronavirus infection.“For people who have tested positive for COVID-19, it is going to be a double whammy, with pollution making things worse,” he told PTI.Doctors warn that even those who have had COVID-19 in the past are not out of the woods.“Post-COVID fibrosis and immunoparalysis make their lungs more susceptible to super-added bacterial pneumonia and other viral respiratory illnesses. We urge everyone to get inoculated with the influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine to prevent additional infections in these times,” Dr Nischal stressed.According to Dr Gupta, with the cohort of survivors of COVID-19 increasing, a significant number is noted to be symptomatic — 43 per cent with respiratory complaints — even after two months.These individuals are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, which is known to cause chronic airway irritation and inflammation, affects mucus clearing, impairs immunity and acutely precipitates airway disorders such as asthma, COPD, lung fibrosis or even cancer-related conditions.Dr Vivek Nangia, principal director and head of pulmonology, Max Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi’s Saket said that for individuals belonging to the high-risk groups, who are at extremes of ages and suffering from chronic disease, are advised to stay indoors or at least restrict their movement to bare essential activities outdoors.“While outdoors, wear a mask at all times and stay away from firecrackers during Diwali. Keep inhaler handy and consult a doctor at the earliest. Even for the others, it is strongly recommended that they minimise their outdoor activities and wear a mask at all time,” he said.“The number of cases will go up. There is a study which has been published by Harvard Medical School, USA, where they have shown that with every 1 micron per metre rise in PM 2.5 particles, there’s an 8 per cent increase in the mortality,” he said.Dr Gupta said: “Indeed, a tough time for post-COVID patients is in store.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pollution-may-increase-virus-transmissibility-making-people-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19-say-experts-157615

She is critical but undergoing treatment."According to reports, the woman, a mother of two, had lodged a complaint against the Constable for her sexual exploitation at gunpoint for months.She said she was now being pressurised to withdraw the complaint.The woman's husband, a local shopkeeper, told police: "Ever since the Constable was booked, he and his well-wishers were pressuring us to withdraw the complaint. A woman Constable even offered my wife money to settle the case while threatening to put her behind the bars if she refused."Rampur Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Arun Kumar Singh, meanwhile, said: "Accused Amit, posted at Patwai police station, was booked and suspended soon after police received the complaint. He was arrested on Friday night after the woman consumed poison and presented in a court on Saturday. He was sent to jail. Further investigation is underway."The Constable is said to have first befriended the woman's husband and then started exploiting her sexually by threatening to frame her husband, said police sources.The accused has been booked under Sections 376 (2) (whoever, being a police officer, commits rape), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at the Patwai police station.

18-10-2020||Aditi Tandon||India can control Covid-19 by early 2021 with current safety protocols: Govt panel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 18Top government scientists on Sunday said India can control the COVID-19 pandemic by early 2021 if everyone follows safety protocols and total projected cases by February next would be 106 lakh.India is at 74.94 lakh cases as of today.Led by Prof M Vidyasagar of IIT-Hyderabad, the COVID-19 India National Supermodel Committee of the Government of India, said today that the pandemic had peaked but warned of laxity in the festival season saying “we could go up to 26 lakh active infections in October if precautions of masks, physical distance and hand and face hygiene were not taken”. Current active cases are below 8 lakh.Also read: 61,871 new coronavirus infections push national tally to 74.94 lakhCannot rule out possibility of 2nd wave of COVID-19 infections in winters: Expert panel chief V K PaulActive COVID-19 cases below 8 lakh for 2nd day in row; recovery rate 88.03 pcThe committee said 30 per cent of the Indian population is projected to have developed antibodies to the virus as of today as against 14 per cent at August-end and the rising number of infected people was the reason why new cases were dropping. The supermodel study concludes that 14 pc people had likely developed antibodies by August-end as against 7 pc projected by the ICMR.Prof Vidyasagar said the panel’s mandate included the study of the efficacy of the national lockdown.“Projections show that without the lockdown, active symptomatic cases would have peaked in June at 140 lakh overwhelming our hospitals; total symptomatic cases would have reached 204 lakh by February 2021 as against 106 lakh currently estimated and deaths would have been over 26 lakh by August-end as against the current 1.1 lakh as of October,” said Prof Vidyasagar who headed the team that included researcher Gagandeep Kang.The study also concludes that the Indian lockdown was best timed and migration of workers in May and June did not cause any sharp rise in cases. Scientists actually say migration would have cause greater harm had it been permitted pre-lockdown.“There would be been significant adverse impact if migration had been permitted before the lockdown rather than after the lockdown,” the largest mathematical projection of COVID 19 in India said.Going forward the panel said lockdowns were no longer desirable and won’t yield better results.“If no safety measures are taken, we project 26 lakh peak active cases in October; with lesser precautions we project 13 lakh active cases in October. Stricter measures like lockdowns by states won’t help much and we recommend highly localised lockdowns if needed,” said Prof Vidyasagar said.The modeling said Kerala saw a major surge past Onam festivities and warned people against gathering for the current festive season.“Kerala celebrated Onam during August 22 and September 2 and saw a sharp rise from September 8. Infection probability in Kerala increased by 32 per cent and the effectiveness of medical response declined by 22 per cent in September,” the modeling found. The message is clear – the upcoming festival and winter season may increase the susceptibility to infection if safety protocols are not strictly followed.Lockdown projections by top scientistsActual lockdown led to peak active cases of 10 lakh in September and one lakh deathsProjection if there was no lockdown: 140 lakh peak active symptomatic cases by June and 26 lakh deaths by end AugustProjection of lockdown was from April 1 to May 1: 40 to 50L peak active cases by June, 7 to 10L deaths by August end||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-can-control-covid-19-by-early-2021-with-current-safety-protocols-govt-panel-157611
18-10-2020||Patna||BJP following 'coalition dharma' by attacking me despite 'anger' against Nitish: Chirag Paswan||Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan on Sunday downplayed the BJP's recent attacks on him, claiming that it was only following the "coalition dharma" as an ally of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar."I do not need to exhibit my relations with the prime minister. From the time when my father was in the hospital to his last rites, I can never forget what he (PM) has done for me," Paswan said in a series of tweets in Hindi.With the BJP working overtime to dispel the impression of having any tacit understanding with the LJP, Paswan claimed that Kumar has been trying to create distance between the saffron party and him.बिहार फ़र्स्ट की सोच से JDU के नेताओं की गले की फाँस बन चुका है। प्रधानमंत्रीजी के विकास के मंत्र के साथ मैं और #बिहार1stबिहारी1st प्रतिबद्ध है।  He said the thrust of Kumar's campaign has been on showing a distance between Modi and him.Paswan said the chief minister, also the JD(U) president, should be thankful to his ally for following the coalition dharma by giving him a "certificate" every day that it has no links with the LJP president despite "so much anger" against Kumar."I do not want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be in any dilemma due to me. He should follow his coalition dharma. He can say anything against me without any inhibition to satisfy Chief Minister Nitish Kumar," he said.He added that he is committed to Modi's mantra of development.Modi is set to address a number of poll rallies with Kumar and other coalition leaders in the coming days in Bihar.The LJP's decision to fight the Bihar polls independently after walking out of the NDA, which includes the BJP and the JD(U), has muddied the waters ahead of the upcoming assembly polls.Paswan has been making determined efforts to target the JD(U) by putting up candidates against it, while his party is not contesting on seats where the BJP is in the fray.The BJP has in the last few days accused Paswan of trying to spread confusion by harping on his claimed proximity to its senior leaders and reiterated that Kumar will become the state's chief minister again if their alliance gets the mandate.On the other hand, Paswan has been claiming that an alliance of the BJP and the LJP will come to power after the polls.The Bihar Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in three phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7. The counting of votes will take place on November 10. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-following-coalition-dharma-by-attacking-me-despite-anger-against-nitish-chirag-paswan-157600
18-10-2020||Kolkata||Hardship faced by migrant labourers during lockdown theme of many Durga Puja committees||Hardship faced by migrant labourers during the COVID-19 induced lockdown is the guiding theme of many Durga Puja committees in West Bengal for the five-day festival starting from October 22.Some other Puja committees have shown the coronavirus as demon Mahisasura to be destroyed by the Goddess while others have paid tribute to COVID-19 warriors.Lakhs of migrant labourers returned to their native places in West Bengal from different parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Durga Puja is the biggest festival in Bengal but the festival is relatively low key this year due to the pandemic and economic recession triggered by lockdown.Many Durga Puja organisers have still pitched for theme-based puja like in past years on contemporary issues, designing pandal decoration, illumination and interiors - a trend prevalent for the past 20 years.Taking up the migrant issue Barisha Club, in the southern fringes of the city, has installed the idol of a woman pausing for a while on the road trail with a baby in her lap and two children."She is our Durga. Eight other hands are seen on the background. She epitomises the migrant labourers' pain, cries, suffering and resilience when business activities came to nil and road communication stopped. But still, the migrant labourers did not stay back. They boarded vehicles on their own, walked thousands of miles, collapsed but again stood up.This is our tribute to the migrants," a puja committee spokesman said.At Naktala Udayan Sangha, a truck has been put up near the marquee with models of migrant labourers, scrambling to get on board the vehicle."Our pandal is called waves. It reflects the waves of returning migrants from different corners. We have employed migrant labourers from different districts to portray the theme," puja committee office-bearer Anjan Das said.The return of migrant labourers on various modes of transport - on cycle, truck - or by walking miles, has been depicted through mural works and models in the pandal of Kestopur Prafullakanon Paschim Adhibasibrindo, Secretary Ranjit Chakraborty said."Our pandal will be inaugurated by the migrants who are working round the clock since past one month and during inauguration the entire locality will be plunged into darkness for a while to show respect to the migrants who had died during return," Chakraborty said.The battle of covid warriors against the pathogen also features in pandals.At Salt Lake's A K Block, models of vendors, phuchka seller, vegetable sellers are put up on the two sides of pandal while Durga has been depicted as a rustic woman."Our pandal is themed on the hardships faced by these people, who work in big cities to eke out living from their faraway homes in villages. This is our way of remembering their hardships during the lockdown," a spokesman of the puja committee Raja Banik said.The battle of covid warriors and slaying of 'corona sur' also features in several pujas in the state.Sahid Colony Sarbojonin Durgotsab in Sodepur, a popular puja in North 24 Parganas district, has themed this year's festivity on COVID-19 warriors like doctors, other health workers and frontline fighters like police and other emergency services."We are putting up models of doctors and other essential services people as revellers will approach the pandal and there will be poster campaigns about the contribution of these people in the battle against coronavirus," a puja committee spokesman said.Shakti Sangha, a puja committee in Birati in northern outskirts, has placed the order for Coronasur at Kumartuli."Our artisan has made the asuras head look like the virus based on the images we saw on TV. The hair, ear, crown of the demon will have spikes like the virus. We all pray the goddess kills the virus after the battle," treasurer Sudip Sau said.A coronavirus shaped pandal has also been erected by a puja committee in Balurghat in South Dinajpur district."We had built pandals shaped on titanic ship, Victoria memorial in past. This year all our members wanted to make the pandal look like coronavirus as it is on top of everyone's mind. When the virus will finally go. This pandal will also remind people the virus is still raging on and we should be on guard against it always," a puja committee member said.Samajsebi Sangha, a popular puja in south Kolkata, will have a stall near the pandal where a doctor will be present with medical personnel for treating any emergency and checking the temperature of people if required, a puja committee spokesman said.At Sribhumi Sporting Club, known to depict current events through illumination, this year they will highlight the battle against COVID-19 through lighting."Our illumination will be far less than in past. There are fewer light gates and boards. The battle against COVID 19 will be the highlight of this years illumination," a puja committee member said.Many organisers are trying to spread the message of COVID-19 safety measures during the festival.There are around 37,000 Durga pujas being organised in the state. West Bengal Chief Minister had announced a grant of Rs 50,000 to each Durga Puja committee in the state.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||Conscious decision not to allow religious events amid COVID-19, Maha to SC on plea by gurdwara||The Maharashtra government has told the Supreme Court that allowing the Nanded gurdwara to hold the Dusshera procession as per custom will not be a "practically feasible option” amid COVID-19 and that the state has taken a conscious decision of not allowing religious functions to check the spread of the virus.The state government said that as per its past experience it is impossible to monitor the strict observance of conditions and restrictions imposed and the only consequence is the spread of the deadly infection, a situation that is irreversible.It said that as on October 16, 2020, the total population affected by COVID-19 in Maharashtra was 15,76,062 and the total number of deaths registered on account of the virus are 41,502.  The state government said that in Nanded district the number of persons affected by COVID-19 is 18,167 and the total number of deaths is 478. In Nanded Municipal Area, the number of persons affected by COVID-19 is 8,375 and the total number of deaths is 224.It said that a conscious decision has been taken of not allowing religious functions and not permitting congregation, at least for the present, and the said decision is fully justified and needs no interference at the hands of this Court in the exercise of its extraordinary constitutional writ jurisdiction.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao is likely to take up a plea on Monday at the time when the top court is on Dusshera vacation.The bench has sought response from the Maharashtra government on October 16, on the plea filed by ‘Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib Board' seeking permission to conduct 'Dusshera, Takht Isnan, Deepmala and Gurta Gaddi' event procession as per three centuries old custom maintained by the gurudwara with certain conditions.It has said, “Having the hostile political environment in the state of Maharashtra, ample religious discontent has been spread due to political interest and the petitioner believes that he will not be able to grapple with the situation without recourse thereto which is evident from the fact that despite repeated written representations, no decision has been taken till date”.The plea said “Gurudwara Takhat Shri Hazur Abchalnagar is a pious place of world fame for being last place of tenth Sikh Guru Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji Maharaj, where he granted the holy seat of Guru to the Gurugranth Sahiv ji before going to Sachkhand”.The state government, in its affidavit, said that it has taken a conscious policy decision of not allowing religious functions and large congregations, without any exception.  “The policy decision is based on assessment of the situation at hand as also the consequence of permitting such activities. Since, the restrictions were imposed in March 2020 and till date, everybody has followed the restrictions strictly”, it said, referring, to several festivals including Gudhi Padwa, Ram Navami, Mahaveer Jayanti, Easter Sunday, Buddha Purnima, Ramadan Eid, Bakri Eid, Dahi Handi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Moharram and Navratri.  It said that all the religious festivals are performed by citizens by staying at home, so as to contain the spread of virus and “there is no reason at all, much less just and proper to carve out an exception for the petitioner”.The state government said the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra cannot be ignored and ought to be considered in its proper perspective when considering the prayers in the present petition.“Allowing the claim of the petitioner by imposing conditions is not a practically feasible option. The experience of the State Government and its machinery in the past demonstrates that, such restrictions and conditions are observed only in breach thereof e.g. vegetable markets etc. and secondly, it is impossible to monitor the strict observance of such conditions,” it said.The affidavit said that it is also worthwhile to note that the only consequence of non-observance and breach thereof is the spread of deadly infection, a situation that is irreversible.  It said that in this background of such a most likely, almost certain, event, it must be remembered that prevention is always to be preferred, especially when such events are surely avoidable.  “The law enforcement agencies have clearly expressed their practical difficulty that if such prayers of the petitioner are allowed with whatever restrictions, it will not be practically possible to enforce such restrictions or guidelines, particularly keeping in view the crowd that is charged with emotions and religious sentiments,” it added.It stated that there is no violation of the fundamental rights and the right to practice and propagate religion under Article 25 has been made subject to public order, morality and health, under the Constitution itself.  “Thus, if the deponent is able to satisfy this Court that the decision of prohibition of holding any religious function and prohibition on congregation is taken considering the health aspect of the citizens more particularly during the present pandemic situation, in such case, certainly right under Article 25 of the Constitution, which is subject to health, will not be available,” the state government said.

However, there are five states (Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal) and three to four Union Territories (UTs), where there is still a rising trend,” Paul told PTI in an interview.Also read: 61,871 new coronavirus infections push national tally to 74.94 lakhActive COVID-19 cases below 8 lakh for 2nd day in row; recovery rate 88.03 pcIndia can control COVID-19 by early 2021 with current safety protocols: Govt panelHe is heading the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC).According to him, India is in a somewhat better position now but the country still has a long way to go because 90 per cent of the people are still susceptible to coronavirus infections.On whether India could see a second wave of coronavirus infections in the winter, Paul said that with the onset of winter, countries across Europe were seeing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.“We cannot rule out (a second coronavirus wave this winter in India). Things can happen and we are still learning about the virus,” Paul noted. He stressed on COVID-19-appropriate behaviour during festival season and winter months.“Because of the winter season, some increase in pollution in north India as well as festival season, we have to be very careful... coming months are a challenge. One would be worried that we could lose the gains that we have made,” Paul said.He also cautioned against any complacency about the decline in the number of new cases and called for keeping up the efforts to contain the pandemic.“If we don’t take precaution, if we are not careful, because we are susceptible there can be an escalation. God forbid, but we can avoid it. This is in our hand, whether India has another wave or not is very much in our own hand,” the Niti Aayog member said.To a query about the storage and distribution of the vaccine once it is available, he said India had enough cold storage facilities to an extent and this could be readily augmented as required.“Once the vaccine is available, there will be enough resources for delivering vaccines and making it accessible to the citizens and there will be no concern about resources under those circumstances,” Paul said.On Saturday, the Prime Minister’s Office said the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC), in consultation with state governments and all relevant stakeholders, had prepared a detailed blueprint for vaccine storage, distribution, and administration.The group, in consultation with states, is working actively on prioritisation and distribution of vaccines.The coronavirus death toll climbed to 1,14,031, the Health Ministry’s data updated at 8 am on Sunday showed. The number of active cases of coronavirus infection remained below eight lakh for the second consecutive day.India is the second worst-hit nation in terms of COVID-19 cases after the US.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||SC frowns at inordinate delay by govt authorities in filing appeals||The Supreme Court has deprecated the “inordinate delays” by government authorities in filing appeals before it and says they “must pay for wastage of judicial time” and such costs can be recovered from officers responsible.A bench headed by Justice S K Kaul said the Apex Court could not be a place for the governments to walk in when they chose to ignore the period of limitation prescribed in the statute.“We have raised the issue that if the government machinery is so inefficient and incapable of filing appeals and petitions in time, the solution may lie in requesting the Legislature to expand the time period for filing limitation for government authorities because of their gross incompetence. That is not so,” said the bench, also comprising Justice Dinesh Maheshwari.“Till the statute subsists, the appeals and petitions have to be filed as per the statues prescribed,” the bench said in its order while dealing with an appeal filed by Madhya Pradesh after a delay of 663 days.The top court noted the explanation given in the application for condonation of delay which stated that it was due to unavailability of documents and process of arranging them and also that in “bureaucratic process works, it is inadvertent that delay occurs”.“We are constrained to pen down a detailed order as it appears that all our counselling to government and government authorities have fallen on deaf ears i.e., the Supreme Court of India cannot be a place for the governments to walk in when they choose to ignore the period of limitation prescribed,” it said.The bench said a “preposterous proposition” was sought to be propounded that if there was some merit in the case, the period of delay was to be given a go-by.“If a case is good on merits, it will succeed in any case. It is really a bar of limitation which can even shut out good cases. This does not, of course, take away the jurisdiction of the court in an appropriate case to condone the delay,” it said.The bench noted that such approach was being adopted and the object appeared to be to obtain a certificate of dismissal from the Supreme Court to put a quietus to the issue and thus, say that nothing could be done because the highest court has dismissed the appeal.“It is to complete this formality and save the skin of officers, who may be at default, that such a process is followed. We have on earlier occasions also strongly deprecated such a practice and process. There seems to be no improvement,” it said.“The purpose of coming to this court is not to obtain such certificates and if the government suffers losses, it is time when the concerned officer responsible for the same bears the consequences,” the bench noted.The top court said no action was taken against the officers, who sit on the files and do nothing, and it was presumed that the court would condone the delay.“We are thus, constrained to send a signal and we propose to do in all matters today, where there are such inordinate delays that the government or state authorities coming before us must pay for wastage of judicial time which has its own value. Such costs can be recovered from the officers responsible,” the bench said.It noted in its order that no doubt, some leeway was given for “government inefficiencies” but the sad part was that authorities kept on relying on judicial pronouncements for a period of time when technology had not advanced and a greater leeway was given to the government.The bench, which dismissed the appeal on the ground of delay, imposed a cost of Rs 25,000 on Madhya Pradesh and said it was to be deposited within four weeks with the Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee.“The amount be recovered from the officers responsible for the delay in filing the special leave petition and a certificate of recovery of the said amount be also filed in this court within the said period of time,” it said.The bench made it clear that if its order is not complied within time, it would be constrained to initiate contempt proceedings against the Chief Secretary of the state.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||Watch: BrahMos missile test-fired from Indian Navy’s stealth destroyer hits target successfully||A naval version of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile was successfully test-fired from an indigenously built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian Sea on Sunday, officials said.The missile was fired from INS Chennai, a stealth destroyer, and it hit the target with pin-point accuracy after performing "extremely complex" manoeuvres, they said."BrahMos as ‘prime strike weapon' will ensure the warship's invincibility by engaging naval surface targets at long ranges, thus making the destroyer another lethal platform of Indian Navy," the defence ministry said in a statement.BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russia joint venture, produces the supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the BrahMos Aerospace and the Indian Navy for the "successful" test-firing of the missile.DRDO Chairman G Satheesh Reddy too congratulated the scientists and all personnel involved in the test-firing of the missile which he said will add to the capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces in many ways.In the last few weeks, India has test fired a number of missiles including a new version of the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos and anti-radiation missile Rudram-1.India also carried out successful test firing of a laser guided anti-tank guided missile and nuclear capable hypersonic missile 'Shaurya'.The successful test firing of Rudram-1 was seen as a major milestone as it is India's first indigenously developed anti-radiation weapon.The flight testing of the missiles came in the midst of India's bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh.In May last year, the Indian Air Force successfully test fired the aerial version of the BrahMos missile from a Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft.On September 30, India successfully test fired a new version of the surface-to-surface version of the BrahMos.The range of the new land attack version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km.India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the de-facto border with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.

18-10-2020||Chandigarh||Colonel who sent legal notice to Defence Secretary loses out on promotion, retires||A Colonel of the Judge Advocate General’s Department, who had sent a legal notice to the Defence Secretary over discontinuance of rations to officers in peace stations, has not been approved for promotion to the rank of Brigadier.Consequently, his retirement, that had been stayed by the Delhi High Court last month till the results of the promotion board were declassified, has now come into effect.After perusing the proceedings of No.2 Selection Board and pleadings made by the counsels in the case, a Bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal comprising its Chairperson, Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen Philip observed that the board had not recommended the officer, Col Mukul Dev, for promotion and there was no reason to permit him to continue in service.Pointing out that this case was different from that of a Brigadier in whose case the order for a stay on retirement was referred for support in Col Mukul’s averments, and he cannot claim the same benefit, the Tribunal ruled that ultimately if this petition is allowed and any order passed in his favour, he can always be restored and given all consequential benefits. He is presently posted in Bathinda.The Tribunal heard the case along with two other petitions filed by JAG colonels, including a woman officer, in matters concerning their promotion to the rank of Brigadier. It was on the woman officer’s petition that the Tribunal had earlier stayed the results of the selection board.After the government had stopped the issue of free ration to officers in 2017, Col Mukul had sent a legal notice to the Defence Secretary, terming the move to be illegal and against the terms and conditions of service. He was awarded a ‘displeasure’ by the Corps Commander for violating the Army’s rules and regulations by sending the notice directly to the Defence Secretary. The rations were later restored by the government.He had also taken up the case for implementation of Non-Functional Upgradation (NFU), as recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission for Group-A services, for the Armed Forces. The matter is pending before the Supreme Court.Last month, Col Mukul had moved the Delhi High Court contending that his retirement is stayed till the results of the promotion board, held in December 2019, are out because if he retired as Colonel, it may adversely affect his right for promotion. On September 29, a day before his scheduled superannuation, the High Court had granted him protection until the Tribunal heard the matter further.Directing that the petitioner would be deemed to have retired from service on September 30, his original date of superannuation, the Tribunal ruled that the retirement shall be subject to any final order passed on merits after hearing all concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/colonel-who-sent-legal-notice-to-defence-secretary-loses-out-on-promotion-retires-157589

"Hence, we have issued a second summon to her," the police said.After securing the search warrant, the CCB had carried out searches at Vivek Oberoi's Mumbai residence over suspicions of hiding Aditya Alva.Aditya Alva, one of the accused in the Sandalwood drugs cases, has been absconding ever since the case came to light."We need to question Priyanaka as we suspect she knows about her brother's whereabouts. She has not honoured the summon to appear on Friday. So we have again issued a summon to her," a senior officer said.The raid at Vivek Oberoi's Mumbai residence was carried out after receiving a tip-off that the absconding Aditya Alva could have taken shelter there."We have all reasons to believe that Alva is in Mumbai. Besides, we also wanted to question his relatives there regarding his whereabouts," the source said.The CCB police have been looking for Alva since the crackdown on narcotic substances began in the city.Alva is not just the brother-in-law of Oberoi, but he comes from a very well-connected and highly influential family as his late father Jeevaraj Alva was a minister in early '80s, who knew how to organise people for political rallies and raise funds to build the Janata Parivar which was in its nascent stage then.His mother Nandini Alva too is well-connected in her own right as she is a very big name in Bengaluru's cultural scene.Allegedly, several of the accused in the Sandalwood drugs cases reportedly disclosed that they attended parties that were held at a farmhouse owned by Alva in Hebbal in Bengaluru, where drugs were allegedly supplied and consumed.The police conducted raids on his properties where such parties were allegedly held about three weeks ago after issuing a countrywide lookout notice against him.After the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested three people in Bengaluru with a drug haul two months ago, the Bengaluru Police cracked down on drug traffickers, peddlers and consumers.More than 15 people have been arrested by the police in connection with the case so far, including Sandalwood actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani, party organiser Viren Khanna and realtor Rahul Thonse.

A six-year-old child was killed after a wall collapsed in Hyderabad’s Turkapet area and another person was electrocuted in Old Malakpet area. Heavy rains have resulted in around 50 deaths in the state so far. Another wall of the historic Golkonda Fort collapsed due to continuous rain. Last week saw lot of death and destruction due to rain with the Hussain Sagar and other water bodies filled up beyond the danger mark, inundating their neighbourhoods.  People had heaved a sigh of relief when the rains stopped, but after a two-day break, heavy rains lashed the city again on Saturday with Bandlaguda in Uppal recording a rainfall of 119 mm by 9 pm. Heavy rains resulted in panic in many areas, where people were yet to recover from the destruction caused by rain on last Tuesday. India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, has issued a weather warning asking people to stay home as there was a possibility of thunderstorms accompanied with lightning and heavy rain across Telangana on October 20 and 21.  Rainwater disrupted travel to the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport and motorists were asked to take the Outer Ring Road (ORR). Elsewhere in the city, people heading home were stuck in traffic jams and suffered a hellish experience. Education Minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy, who went around the city, said food, medicines, drinking water etc. were being provided for the residents. These people who needed to be housed in camps were tested with rapid antigen for COVID-19 before being put in the camps. IMD issued a yellow warning as water continues to disrupt traffic and threaten outbreak of vector disease in low-lying areas. People have been advised to take precautions due to wet and slippery roads, uprooted trees and electric poles.  In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh (AP), Meteorological Centre has said cyclonic circulation was observed over west-central Bay of Bengal off south AP coast and extends up to 1.5 km above mean sea level. Under its influence, a low-pressure area is very likely to develop over the same region during the next 24 hours. It said thunderstorms along with lightning were likely to occur at isolated places in north coastal Andhra Pradesh.  Heavy rainfall is likely to occur at isolated places of AP mainly in East Godavari, West Godavari, Yanam, Prakasam, Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rain-returns-after-two-days-bringing-back-death-and-destruction-in-hyderabad-157584

Dr. Joseph Mar Thoma Metropolitan was a remarkable personality who served humanity and worked hard to improve the lives the poor and downtrodden.“He was blessed with abundance of empathy and humility. His noble ideals will always be remembered. RIP,” Modi tweeted. The Prime Minister had on June 27 inaugurated the 90th birth anniversary celebrations of the Metropolitan.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the demise of the Metropolitan was not only a loss to the church but to the society as a whole.“He worked for the liberation and welfare of the homeless and marginalised people in the society.His involvement in rehabilitating children from the Red Street in Mumbai and uplifting transgender persons into the mainstream shows how he battled for the downtrodden,” Vijayan said in a statement.Vijayan said Metropolitan fought fearlessly against social evils.Born as P T Joseph to Alakunnathu T Lukose and Mariamma couple at Maramonin Pathanamthitta district, Joseph Mar Thoma became Mar Thoma metropolitan in October 2007 after the then Mar Thoma, Philipose Mar Chrysostom, expressed his desire to transfer responsibilities of the church to his successor due to his deteriorating health.He was ordained as Ramban on January 11, 1975 and designated as suffragan metropolitan on 15 March 1999, when Philipose Mar Chrysostom, the suffragan metropolitan, was designated as the officiating metropolitan.The mortal remains have been kept at the church headquarters in Thiruvalla where people from all walks of life paid their final respects to the Metropolitan.

It was an honour meeting him in person and I also took part in the launch of his autobiography in Dharamsala. We have lost a true patriot of Tibet." According to the CTA, Sangpo was reportedly first arrested in 1960 while teaching at Lhasa Primary School and charged with "corrupting the minds of children with reactionary ideas".In 1964, he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in Sangyip Prison over comments regarding Chinese repression of Tibetans and was sent to labour camp in Lhasa.He was again sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in Sangyip Prison for 'counter-revolutionary' propaganda in 1970.He had been caught attempting to send a document reporting Chinese atrocities to His Holiness the Dalai Lama via his niece, who was trying to flee Tibet.Sangpo lost his eyesight as a result of suffering forced labour, prison atrocities and harsh prison conditions."Torture and degrading ill-treatment, inhuman interrogation, solitary confinement, forced labour and indoctrination sessions are common practices used by the Chinese authorities in Tibet's prisons," he testified in 2003.As a result of sustained efforts by the CTA and international community pressing the Chinese government for his release, he was released on medical parole at the age of 76 in March 2002.In August 2002, he settled in Switzerland as a political refugee and relentlessly advocated for the issue of Tibet and testified at various human rights forums on the gross violations of human rights in Chinese-occupied Tibet, according to the CTA.In April 2003, Sangpo first testified at the UN Commission on Human Rights, in which he said: "This old man from Tibet, appeals to all nations in this hall to help end the human suffering of the Tibetans."Please urge the Chinese government to open earnest negotiations with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to resolve the long-standing Tibetan issue in the interest of both the Tibetan and Chinese peoples." On June 5, 2008, he addressed the UN Council.Sangpo's biography titled 'Metse Nyongtsor' was released in January 2014 in Dharamsala by Sangay.

I want to continue to provide selfless service to the poor in villages."After completing his diploma from the Nagpur College of Homeopathy in 1957-58, Dandekar worked as a lecturer at the Chandrapur Homeopathy College for a year, before shifting to rural areas to serve in villages.His elder son Jayant Dandekar says the octogenarian has a fixed timetable for his visits to villages on weekdays and carries only his medical kit and medicines with him.He does not even carry a mobile phone or a watch during his trips."If he has to attend to patients in faraway talukas, he travels by bus and visits the homes on cycles kept in villages. And if he gets late, he chooses to stay back at someone's house," his son says."Everyone calls him 'Doctor Sahab Mul waale', and he visits around 20 homes in each village," he says.Although his visits have now reduced a little, the doctor has continued to serve his patients amid the pandemic, despite the risk of infection."He guides and advises people to get admitted to nearby hospitals if they are found suffering from fever or other symptoms of the virus," says his son, who is proud of his father's selfless service.

18-10-2020||New Delhi||Share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution likely to increase||The national capital's air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Sunday morning and the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution is likely to “increase significantly”, according to a central government agency.    It was 19 per cent on Saturday, 18 per cent on Friday, around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday.  The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 275 at 8:30 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 287 on Saturday. It was 239 on Friday and 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 (AQI 320).   An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  During the daytime, winds are blowing from the northwest, bringing pollutants from farm fires. At night, calm winds and low temperatures are allowing the accumulation of pollutants, according to an India Meteorological Department official.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the farm fire count around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring border regions was 882 on Saturday.Since transport-level wind direction was favourable for intrusion, stubble contribution in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was around 19 per cent on Saturday, it said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 12,500 metre square per second on Sunday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.It, however, said the impact of stubble burning on Delhi's air quality is likely to “increase significantly” by Monday.Punjab and Haryana have recorded more incidents of stubble burning this season so far compared to last year and it is largely due to early harvesting of paddy and unavailability of farm labour due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to officials.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had Friday said meteorological conditions in Delhi have been "extremely unfavourable" for dispersion of pollutants since this September as compared to last year.With less area under non-basmati paddy cultivation this time, CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava hoped the number of stubble burning incidents will be fewer this year compared to 2019.Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content and so farmers burn it.Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/share-of-stubble-burning-in-delhis-pollution-likely-to-increase-157540
18-10-2020||New Delhi||India watching anti-army, Imran Khan protests in Pak||India is watching with interest an “early start” to joint protests by nine opposition political parties in Pakistan which are against PM Imran Khan as well as Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.Of particular interest was former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s video address from London on Friday in which he targeted not just Gen Bajwa but also ISI Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as well as the judiciary.Street unrest in Pakistan usually begins at the fag-end of the term as opposition parties try to whip up anti-incumbency sentiments. Protests in Pakistan that begin mid-term, as was the case during the early tenures of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, usually have the imprint of the Pakistan army. Sharif has so far indirectly accused the army, but this is the first time he has named the army chief and the ISI DG for short-circuiting the last general election and ensuring the installation of Imran Khan as PM. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-watching-anti-army-imran-khan-protests-in-pak-157201

Meanwhile, political observers claim the BJP is also apprehensive about the possibility of a “post-poll anti-climax” featuring Nitish Kumar. This is believed to be one of the main reasons why the leadership are ticking-off Chirag publicly, working hard to put at rest speculations about his party, the LJP, being its ‘Plan B’. Chirag has been strategically criticising Nitish Kumar, praising the Prime Minister and supporting the idea of a BJP Chief Minister, thereby earning the title of BJP’s ‘Plan B’ to “wipe out Nitish Kumar and the JD-U in Bihar”.Notably, many top BJP leaders, suspended now, are contesting on the LJP ticket. While they may have been suspended by the BJP for contesting against NDA candidates, the observers say “there are no prizes for guessing which side they will go in case of a hung Assembly”. While NDA rivals are using Chirag’s utterances against the incumbent CM to their advantage, the BJP camp is also worried about upsetting the EBC vote bank of Nitish Kumar.Sources say party’s internal surveys suggest that Nitish Kumar’s stock is at an all-time low. While the surveys indicate a tight contest in several Assembly segments, the BJP is apprehensive about a scenario where Nitish Kumar manages to get enough seats to cross over to the RJD-led ‘mahagathbandhan’ and help it form the government. This is the main reason for a very public admonishment for Chirag.BJP general secretary Bhupinder Yadav yesterday asked Chirag that while he praised the functioning of the Bihar government till as recently as February 2020, what led to a change in stance in the past few months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-bihar-bjps-surveys-indicate-tough-fight-157205

18-10-2020||---||Centre, states cross hurdle over sharing of GST revenue||New Delhi, October 17The Centre and opposition-ruled states have crossed one hurdle over sharing of GST revenues after the Centre agreed to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore from the market and on-lend it to the states. This has addressed the primary concern of at least seven states about paying high interest costs if they were to individually approach the market.Primary concern addressedThe indication came after the Kerala government cancelled a meeting to strategise on the GST compensation cess issue. Other states too withheld comment and were examining the fine print. Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac’s comments, however, showed the differences have moved to other issues.“Having amicably settled questions of who should borrow, we hope she will address the question of how much to borrow through dialogue with state FMs,’’ Thomas Isaac said in a social media post today.The other major question is addressing the Rs 1.25 lakh crore gap in compensation. As GST revenues increase, this might narrow to Rs 70,000 crore in 2020-21, but the issue nevertheless will have to be sorted out.Finance Ministers of Punjab and West Bengal have not officially reacted after their combative comments in the two sessions of 42nd meeting of the GST Council where they had warned the Centre against using brute majoritarianism in forcing states to accept one of the two options without any clarity on who would foot the borrowing-related costs.Days after the GST Council meeting, spread over two sessions, ended in a stalemate, the Centre had sought to reward the states that had chosen one of its two options for borrowing by allowing them to borrow more without meeting the stipulated reform conditions.At least seven opposition states continued to hold out, leading Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to offer that the Union Government will arrange the borrowing despite the serious budgetary constraints.The Central government will initially receive the amount and then pass it on back-to-back to the states as loan. This will enable ease of coordination and simplicity in borrowing, apart from ensuring a favourable interest rate.The Union Finance Ministry expects the situation to further ease by the time the GST Council reviews the financial performance at the end of the third quarter in December.The seven dissenting states are Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-states-cross-hurdle-over-sharing-of-gst-revenue-157332
18-10-2020||New Delhi||India’s 14% population undernourished||India ranked 94 among 107 nations in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2020 and was in the ‘serious’ hunger category with experts blaming poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring, siloed approach in tackling malnutrition and poor performance by large states behind the low ranking.Last year, India’s rank was 102 out of 117 countries.Country ranks 94, up eight notchesat 3.7 per cent.Neighbouring Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan too were in the ‘serious’ category, but ranked higher than India in this year’s hunger index. While Bangladesh ranked 75, Myanmar and Pakistan were in the 78th and 88th positions, respectively.Nepal in 73rd and Sri Lanka in 64th position were in ‘moderate’ hunger category, the report showed.Seventeen nations, including China, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Cuba and Kuwait, shared the top rank with the GHI scores of less than five, the website of the Global Hunger Index, that tracks hunger and malnutrition, said on Friday. According to the report released on Friday, 14 per cent of India’s population was undernourished.It also showed the country recorded a 37.4 per cent stunting rate among children under five and a wasting rate of 17.3 per cent. The under-five mortality rate stood at 3.7 per cent.Wasting is children who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition. Stunting is children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition.Shweta Khandelwal, Head of Nutrition Research, Public Health Foundation of India Attention neededHunger and undernutrition cannot and should not be fixed by mere calorie provision. All stakeholders must pay attention to making balanced healthy diets which are climate-friendly, affordable and accessible to all Data from 1991 through 2014 for Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan showed that stunting was concentrated among children from households facing multiple forms of deprivation, including poor dietary diversity, low levels of maternal education, and household poverty.During this period, India experienced a decline in under-five mortality, driven largely by a decrease in deaths from birth asphyxia or trauma, neonatal infections, pneumonia, and diarrhoea, the report stated.“However, child mortality, caused by prematurity and low birth weight, increased particularly in poorer states and rural areas. Prevention of prematurity and low birthweight is identified as a key factor with the potential to reduce under-five mortality in India through actions such as better antenatal care, education, and nutrition as well as reductions in anaemia and oral tobacco use,” it said.Experts think that poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring and siloed approaches to tackling malnutrition often result in poor nutrition indices. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-14-population-undernourished-157337

Faith, confidence and acceptability cannot be commanded, they have to be earned.“It is an important quality for a judge to withstand all pressures,” Justice Ramana said in an online condolence meeting to pay homage to former top court Judge AR Lakshmanan, who died on August 27.“There are innumerable qualities that a person needs to live what can be called a good life: humility, patience, kindness, a strong work ethic and the enthusiasm to constantly learn and improve oneself. Most importantly, particularly for a judge, one must be steadfast in holding on to his principles and fearlessness in decisions,” he said.In his letter to CJI Bobde, Reddy had alleged, “Justice Ramana has been influencing the sittings of the high court, including the roster of a few judges and instances of a few matters important to Telugu Desam have been allotted to a few judges.”The contents of the letter were made public at a press conference addressed by the Principal Adviser to the AP Chief Minister last week.Justice Ramana — who is likely to be the next Chief Justice of India after Justice SA Bobde demits office in April 2021 — said, “The greatest strength of the judiciary is the faith of people in it. Faith, confidence and acceptability cannot be commanded, they have to be earned.”Last month, Justice Ramana had expressed serious concern over judges becoming soft targets of criticism and subject of juicy gossip on social media.Quoting Justice Lakshmanan, Justice Ramana today said, “We, the members of the judicial hierarchy, have inherited the legacy of dedicated collective endeavour by the Bench and the Bar in establishing an unbroken tradition of high efficiency, perfect integrity and fearless independence.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judge-needs-to-withstand-pressures-justice-ramana-157352
