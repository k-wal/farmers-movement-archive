08-09-2020||London||Indian-origin professor’s UK firm strikes Covid-19 vaccine pact with India||An Indian-origin professor’s Oxford-based company on Tuesday announced that its Indian partner, the Serum Institute of India (SIIPL), has begun trials of a novel virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine targeting Covid-19 which has the potential to offer a groundbreaking new approach to fighting the pandemic.Prof Sumi Biswas, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of SpyBiotech – an Oxford University spinoff company with a novel vaccine platform to target infectious diseases, cancer and chronic diseases, said the first subjects have been dosed in a Phase I/II trial.SpyBiotech said it had signed an exclusive global licensing agreement with SIIPL for the development of the vaccine as part of the study initiated in Australia.“Combining SpyBiotech's unique platform technology with Serum's extensive expertise developing VLPs and its manufacturing capability is an exciting development at a critical time, giving us the tools to produce the large volume of doses required to support the global fight against Covid-19,” said Biswas, a Kolkata-born immunologist.“For SpyBiotech, this is an opportunity to provide an accelerated proof point for our platform technology, alongside the other candidates which we are advancing into clinical development. Our technology can be combined with multiple vaccine delivery platforms to create a plug and display vaccine which is critical for generating vaccines rapidly and safely,” she said.Biswas moved to the UK in 2005 having studied microbiology at the University of Bangalore and went on to become an Associate Professor of Vaccinology at the Jenner Institute, Oxford University's leading vaccines innovation centre which is currently also working on another Covid-19 vaccine candidate.SpyBiotech says its vaccine candidate uses its “proprietary” SpyCatcher/SpyTag protein “superglue” technology to display the coronavirus spike protein on the surface of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) VLPs, a licensed vaccine with "excellent safety and immunogenicity data" in humans and which are currently manufactured to billions of doses.The coronavirus spike protein's receptor-binding domain is displayed on the VLP, taking advantage of the platform's properties to induce a potent immune response.Adar Poonawalla, Chief Executive Officer of SIIPL, said: “We are very excited about the collaboration with SpyBiotech to work on this novel vaccine for Covid-19.”“This new technology has the potential to be a powerful new approach to tackling the pandemic. SIIPL is looking forward to working alongside SpyBiotech to advance this candidate through clinical development,” he said.SpyCatcher/SpyTag is a platform technology which allows antigens to be displayed onto VLPs with a covalent, irreversible bond in a highly stable and effective way with specific orientation/epitope presentation and high density. The technology can be used for an exceptionally broad range of applications in vaccine development and has established proof of concept data in a viral, bacterial, parasitic diseases and chronic diseases and cancer.SpyBiotech said it had exclusive rights from the University of Oxford to apply, commercialise and sub-license the “plug and display” technology for vaccine development. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) virus is one of the most pressing scientific challenges of our time,” said Lachlan Mackinnon, Oxford Sciences Innovation Principal and SpyBiotech Chairman.“Combining the benefits of SpyBiotech's protein ‘superglue' technology with the known safety and immunogenicity of the Serum Institute's Hepatitis B surface antigen virus-like particle offers the potential for an effective, safe COVID-19 vaccine which could be manufactured at scale,” he said.Through the latest agreement, he said that SpyBiotech's technology can be added to a growing armoury of weapons being developed against this disease.“We hope the development programme will also help validate the broader potential of the technology, which in the future will be used to target other infectious diseases and cancer,” he added.SpyBiotech was spun out of the University of Oxford in 2017 and its proprietary protein superglue technology binds antigens to vaccine delivery platforms in a way which minimises delivery risk and enhances immunogenicity and efficacy.The company said it was supported by high quality investors including Oxford Sciences Innovation (OSI), the capital investor for the University of Oxford, and GV (formerly Google Ventures) and has raised 15 million pounds in funding to date.

08-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt to sell 15-20 per cent stake in IRCTC via OFS||The government plans to sell about 15-20 per cent stake in IRCTC via offer for sale (OFS) and would like to complete the transaction in minimum number of tranches.Last month, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) had invited bids from merchant bankers by September 10 for managing the sale in Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp (IRCTC).However, it did not disclose the quantum of stake on offer in the Request for Proposal (RFP).Following this, a pre-bid meeting was held on September 4 with potential bidders.DIPAM has now posted its response to the queries raised by potential bidders on its website.To a query on intended stake dilution percentage, DIPAM said, “The indicative percentage is 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The exact details will be shared with the selected merchant bankers.”The government currently holds 87.40 per cent stake in IRCTC. To meet Sebi’s public holding norm, it has to lower its stake in the company to 75 per cent.Shares of IRCTC on Tuesday closed 2.57 per cent lower at Rs 1,378.05 on the BSE.Asked if payment would be made by the government to merchant banker after completion of every single tranche or cumulatively after the completion of entire transaction, DIPAM said, “GOI would not like to have an OFS overhang and hence would like to complete the transaction in minimum number of tranches as advised by merchant bankers based on market conditions.“In case more than one tranche is used, pro-rata payment would be made to the merchant bankers”.IRCTC, the only entity authorised by Indian Railways to provide catering services to railways, online railway tickets and packaged drinking water at railway stations and trains in India, was listed on stock exchanges in October 2019.The company had raised Rs 645 crore through the IPO.IRCTC OFS would help the government inch forward towards meeting the Rs 2.10 lakh crore disinvestment target for ongoing fiscal.Of this, Rs 1.20 lakh crore is to come from disinvestment of public sector undertakings and Rs 90,000 crore from stake sale in financial institutions.The government sold about 15 per cent stake in defence manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) via OFS to raise around Rs 5,000 crore last month.The Rs 900-crore OFS of Bharat Dynamics is underway, with institutional investor portion over-subscribed on Tuesday.However, DIPAM has not been able to sell strategic stake in any CPSE so far in the current fiscal as the coronavirus outbreak has impacted equity markets.The government, however, has garnered subscription worth Rs 11,000 crore for ‘AAA’ rated bonds of CPSEs through Bharat Bond ETF-II.The government is also looking at launching initial public offering (IPO) of Indian Railway Finance Corp Ltd (IRFC), and had filed draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in January for IPO of over 140 crore equity shares.The Union Cabinet had in April 2017 approved listing of five railway companies.While four of them—IRCON International Ltd, RITES Ltd, Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd and IRCTC—have already been listed, IRFC is likely to be put on block this fiscal.

Six were positive, all have recovered and returned to their island,” said Bhushan.In Nicobarese tribe which is not a PVTG, there are still 15 active cases.Particularly vulnerable tribal group is a classification created with the purpose of enabling improvement in the conditions of certain communities with low development indices.Bhushan also elaborated on the situation of other particularly vulnerable tribal groups in the archipelago."Another tribe is Jarawa. There are less than 200 Jarawas. They were tested and no one has been found positive. From another tribe, Ongees, all were found negative. Sentinelese and Shompen are cut off and confined to their islands and no report of death or visible symptoms has been received from them," he said.Presently, there are 312 active cases of COVID-19 in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

08-09-2020||London||Nirav Modi faces politically biased trial in India, alleges his legal team||Nirav Modi’s legal team on Tuesday alleged that he is unlikely to get a fair trial in India due to the politicisation of his case and the diamond merchant faces a “high risk of suicide” due to the lack of adequate medical facilities in Indian prisons.The 49-year-old fugitive diamond merchant is fighting extradition charges related to the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case brought by the Indian government at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London.On the second day of Modi’s five-day extradition hearing, the court was told about a “marked decline” in his mental health at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, where stricter coronavirus curbs have meant a lack of access to inhouse counselling facilities and very limited contact with family, with only 25 minutes allowed outside his cell in July.“He has increasingly suffered from severe depression and the latest assessment shows he is on the threshold of being subject to hospitalisation unless given proper treatment… and his fitness to plead may be in doubt here or in the requesting state (India) given a high risk of suicide,” Modi’s barrister Clare Montgomery said.She claimed that the availability of psychiatric help in Indian prisons was “utterly inadequate”.“The laconic assurance [of the government of India] and the prison video to say that he will be kept in humane conditions appears to be completely inadequate when one bears in mind his psychiatric condition and in addition the looming threat of COVID,” Montgomery said.During the hearing, Justice Samuel Goozee was taken through official Indian prisons data, including statistics on coronavirus cases at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai where Modi is to be held if he is extradited.Montgomery also laid out her plans to depose further expert witnesses during the course of week, including a former Indian Supreme Court judge referred to only by his last name of Katju.The Nirav Modi case has been made a “political issue, with no presumption made of innocence,” Montgomery told the court.She claimed that because the jeweller had been made into a “hate figure” in India, there was an “overwhelming political necessity” to condemn him and see him convicted.Modi’s legal team also indicated plans to depose an expert in tropical medicine in an attempt to counter Indian government claims that the COVID-19 outbreak reported at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai in May had been brought under control.“What is claimed is improbable and the management of COVID-19 within Arthur Road Jail does not add up,” Montgomery told the judge.The defence arguments follow the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) opening the second part of the extradition trial on Monday on behalf of the Indian authorities, which focused on establishing a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against Modi.CPS barrister Helen Malcolm took Justice Goozee through detailed witness statements by so-called “dummy directors” including Ashish Lad, who recorded a video back in June 2018 to say that his life had been threatened by Modi.She laid out details of how as the details of the fraud were beginning to emerge, the jeweller started by hiding most of the evidence, in particular the originals of “letters of undertaking” (LoUs) from PNB, and then went on to “threaten, intimidate, cajole and bribe officials”.“He destroyed mobiles of dummy directors and threatened one of the witnesses with death,” Malcolm told the court.Modi, dressed in a dark suit and white shirt, has been observing the court proceedings remotely from a room in Wandsworth Prison and referring to bundles of documents laid out before him from time to time.He is subject to two sets of criminal proceedings, the first brought by the CBI relating to a large-scale fraud said to have been committed upon PNB and the ED case, relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.A further extradition request was made in February this year, certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, of two additional offences relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by causing the disappearance of evidence and intimidating a witness.The CPS must establish a prima facie case against Modi to allow the judge to rule that he has a case to answer before the Indian courts. If the judge finds a prima facie case against Modi, it will go back to Patel to formally certify his extradition to India to stand trial.A ruling in the case is expected at the end of this year after a final hearing scheduled for December 1.Modi has made repeated attempts at bail over the past year, each of which were turned down as he is deemed a flight risk. The jeweller was arrested on March 19 last year on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nirav-modi-faces-politically-biased-trial-in-india-alleges-his-legal-team-138291

The NLSIU said it won’t accept CLAT scores for admissions to its law courses this year.The petition said the sudden unilateral decision of NLSIU has created unprecedented uncertainty, fear and confusion among the applicants who have been put to extreme pressure and mental stress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-make-nlsiu-island-of-exclusion-ex-vc-to-sc-138288

08-09-2020||New Delhi||Two ISIS operatives plead guilty before Delhi court||Two “remorseful” people have pleaded guilty before a Delhi court in a case of criminal conspiracy by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youth through different social media platforms to carry out acts of terror in the country.Accused Amjad khan and Mohammed Aleem moved applications before Special Judge Parveen Singh on Monday saying they were “remorseful for the acts alleged against them”, and undertook not to indulge in similar acts and activities in future, advocate Qausar Khan said.The accused want to return to the mainstream society and rehabilitate themselves, the lawyer told the court.“The accused are having clean antecedents, even their conduct in jail was satisfactory and there is nothing adverse against them...the accused are pleading guilty voluntarily without any pressure, threat, coercion, inducement or undue influence and he that he understands the consequences,” their plea said.The court is likely to take up their plea on September 11.The case, registered by the NIA on December 9, 2015, under various sections of the IPC and the UA(P) Act, pertains to the larger criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youth for the proscribed terror group through different social media platforms, the NIA said.The accused had formed Junood-ul-Khilafa-Fil-Hind organisation, seeking to establish a caliphate in India and pledging allegiance to ISIS, to recruit Muslim youth and commit acts of terrorism in India at the behest of Syria-based Yusuf-Al-Hindi who is purportedly the media chief of ISIS, the NIA said.The NIA filed charge sheets against the accused persons in 2016-2017.After six accused pleaded guilty in August 6, the court convicted them under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, and various sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Explosive Substances Act.This case was first of its kind in which terrorist conspiracy of this magnitude involving online radicalisation was effected on cyber space in the aftermath of declaration of Islamic Caliphate by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, the NIA had said.

This year, however, the four-month season has so far registered only six systems of which five have been in August, the month which received 27 per cent excess rains — the highest since 1926.Another low pressure system is expected around September 17.According to the IMD, August saw 27 ‘low pressure days’ against a normal of about 15 low pressure (LP) days.In fact, the normal number of LP days in the entire season is around 55, said the IMD.Incidentally, the five low pressure systems were all formed over north Bay of Bengal (August 4-10, 9-11, 13-18, 19-26 and 24-31) and they all moved nearly west-northwestwards across central India up to west Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, said the Met Department.The monsoon trough was active and south of its normal position during most days of the month, which received 27 per cent above normal rains. Last time August saw such an excess was in 1983 when it received 24 per cent above normal rains.So far during the period of 1901-2020, the highest August rainfall was in 1926 (33 per cent above normal), as per the IMD.Active monsoon conditions consecutively for four weeks led to excess rainfall activity over the country and floods over Odisha, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.Incidentally, the northwest (which is currently 10 per cent in the deficit) received lesser rains as compared to say central, western or southern parts of the country because majority of low pressure systems this season moved towards Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, bringing excess rains in those parts, said the IMD.  “Low pressure systems/areas is the key during monsoon days to determine rains, especially in  central and adjoining areas which is why August recorded excess and July less rains,” explained IMD Director General Mritunjaya Mohapatra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/august-received-27-excess-rain-due-to-increased-low-pressure-systems-says-imd-138278
08-09-2020||New Delhi||#MeToo: Delay in disclosing MJ Akbar’s action on lack of law, Ramani tells court||Journalist Priya Ramani told a Delhi court on Tuesday that she disclosed the alleged sexual harassment by former Union minister MJ Akbar around 25 years later because back then there was “a vacuum in law and there was no platform either”.Ramani made the submission before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja through her lawyer during the final hearing of a private criminal defamation complaint filed by Akbar against her.          In the wake of #MeToo movement, Ramani in 2018 accused Akbar of sexual misconduct around 25 years ago when he was a journalist.Akbar, who later became Union minister, resigned on October 17, 2018 following the allegations.Senior advocate Rebecca John said that Ramani’s tweets were based on her own experience with Akbar.“Her experience is the fulcrum on which good faith rests. It is validated subsequently by the combined experience of multiple women making similar allegations,” John said, adding that many spoke before her tweet while many spoke later.She said Ramani made the allegations in October 2018 since there was an “avalanche“ taking place in India during the global #MeToo movement and that she felt “compelled to speak” after she saw several women, who had worked under Akbar between 1993-2011, speaking out against him.She said that Ramani made the allegation in her “good faith” because “it was based on her own experience and that of multiple women who spoke publicly”.“Ramani said it was important for women to speak about sexual harassment at the workplace. She hoped that the disclosure would empower women and encourage them to speak up. Silence is not an option. Speaking out on sexual harassment at workplace is in public good,” John said.She added that “it was important and necessary for women to speak up. Women are taught that silence is a virtue. This case has come at a great personal cost. I have nothing to gain. By keeping silence I could have avoided (a lot of trouble). But that would not have been right.”She said the allegations were made 20 years later but it cannot be contested that in October 2018, an avalanche took place in India.“When my (Ramani’s) incident took place in 1993 there was a gap in the law...whom could have I complained to? Legally I could not have evoked sexual harassment act because it was not in place,” She said.John cited Ramani, saying that women fought a long battle.“The delay was on account of the fact that there was a vaccum in law and there was no platform either. Women at that time were told to keep silent. It was a different world in 1993. I cannot say with confidence that it was a fair world. It took us all a lot of time to fight and established our battles,” John said.John said that seeing other women speak, “I (Ramani) felt compelled to speak”.Citing the allegations made by various women, Ramani’s counsel refuted Akbar’s claim that he had a stellar reputation which was lowered by her, John said “none of his claims in respect of his stellar reputation can be sustained”.On Akbar’s question as to why she deleted her Twitter account, the counsel said: “I (Ramani) need nobody’s permission to delete my Twitter account.“It was not an evidence in the case. It is my democratic and constitutional right to do so. I was not ordered by court to not do so...moreover my Tweets the complainant is relying upon in the case have not been denied by me.”              John further said that the testimony made by Ramani’s friend Nilofer, whom she had reportedly stated about the alleged incident soon after it had taken place, “corroborates Ramani’s truth”.“Nilofer’s message to Ramani in October 2018, after she tweeted about alleged incident also corroborate the truth stated by the scribe,” she said, claiming that Nilofer was “a witness of impeccable quality”.She further said that Ramani’s allegation was not politically motivated and her tweets were based on her own experience with Akbar.        The court will hear further arguments on September 14.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.M J Akbar has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Akbar had earlier told the court that the allegations made in an article in the ‘Vogue’ and the subsequent tweets were defamatory on the face of it as the complainant had deposed them to be false and imaginary and that an “immediate damage” was caused to him due to the “false” allegations by Priya Ramani.Ramani had earlier told the court that her “disclosure” of alleged sexual harassment by Akbar has come at “a great personal cost” and she had “nothing to gain” from it.She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at workplace.Several women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by M J Akbar him while they were working as journalists under him.He has termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

08-09-2020||New Delhi||RPF disrupts ‘Real Mango’ software use for cornering confirmed railway tickets during pandemic||The Railway Protection Force has disrupted the use of illegal software ‘Real Mango’ for cornering confirmed train reservation during the coronavirus pandemic and made 50 arrests in an investigation spanning West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Gujarat, RPF DG Arun Kumar said Tuesday.In the course of systematic unravelling of the working of the illegal software, it has been found that it bypasses captcha, synchronises bank OTP with the help of a mobile app and feeds it to the requisite form to book tickets automatically. It also auto-fills the passenger and payment details in the forms, he said.“The software logs in to the IRCTC website through multiple IRCTC Ids. The illegal software is sold through a five-tiered structure with the system admin receiving payment in bitcoins,” the Director General, Railway Protection Force (RPF), said at a press briefing.Field units of RPF have been able to apprehend 50 people so far, including the system developer who was the kingpin and key managers involved in the operation of the illegal software and block live tickets worth more than Rs 5 lakh, he said.“Five key operatives of the illegal software have been arrested from West Bengal. The software has now been fully decimated,” Kumar said.The first red flag was when it was discovered that the developer of the software used YouTube to advertise his product and an analysis of the data of the popular video sharing platform led to key members of the gang.Kumar said in view of the apprehension of increase in touting activity after restart of the passenger services, the drive against touts was intensified by the force.“Operation of an illegal software called ‘Rare Mango’ (whose name was later changed to ‘Real Mango’) was revealed on August 9 during action against touts by the field units of RPF,” he said.“RPF units of North Central Railway (NCR), Eastern Railway (ER) and Western Railway (WR) apprehended some suspects and initiated the process of understanding and unravelling the operation of RareMango/Real Mango software,” he said.Various operations by the RPF during the coronavirus pandemic have led to the arrest of 994 touts and advance tickets worth Rs 87.70 crore have been blocked. It has also disrupted many illegal softwares like ANMS/ Red Mirchi/Black TS, TikTok, I-Ball, Red Bull, MAC, N-GET, Cycle, Star-V2 etc.The information supplied by RPF helped CRIS/IRCTC to strengthen security features in PRS system due to which the softwares stopped functioning at that time, the RPF DG said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rpf-disrupts-real-mango-software-use-for-cornering-confirmed-railway-tickets-during-pandemic-138274

On the margins of the last meeting of SCO Defence Ministers, Rajnath Singh discussed the border tensions with his Chinese counterpart. The threads will be picked up by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar who will meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of SCO Council of Foreign Ministers.Encouraged by this trend, Deputy Chief of Mission in the Russian Embassy Roman Babushkin on Tuesday hoped that India and Pakistan may follow suit. The Russian reasoning was that after India and Pakistan have worked together in SCO on common issues, they could build enough trust to enter into bilateral talks on its sidelines.“The important thing about SCO is this is quite a comfortable platform for expanding cooperation on common ground in order to build mutual trust and eventually create conditions for expanding the dialogue,” explained Babushkin.However, the Russian envoy made it clear that despite Pakistan’s membership of SCO which has led to closer working ties with Moscow, there will be no arms sale to Islamabad. Russia has decided not to enter into an arms relationship with Pakistan at the request of the Indian side, said Babushkin.The envoy was hopeful of India and Russia signing a logistics sharing agreement (LSA) that will give their security forces access to each other’s military bases. India already has a LSA with the US and is negotiating similar pacts with France and Japan. He also said military equipment ordered by India such as S-400 and Mig-29 and Sukhoi-30 aircraft will be delivered as per schedule.Russia was comfortable with India becoming a member of the Quad, said Babushkin but pointed out that to be a regional body, it must be more inclusive, open minded and based on the principle of undivided security rather than a “mysterious rules based order”.“We do not accept any attempts to create further alienation in the region by the philosophy of restricted security blocs and forced changes in supply chains. It will lead to more mistrust and take Indo-Pacific away from consensus,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-hopes-sco-may-facilitate-indo-pak-talks-too-138273

08-09-2020||New Delhi||Doc’s prescription not mandatory for COVID-19 testing in Delhi, carry Aadhaar for address proof: HC||Doctor’s prescription is not mandatory from now for those voluntarily going for RT/PCR test to detect COVID-19 infection in the national capital, the Delhi High Court Tuesday said, while expressing concern over the sharp and alarming increase in the number of cases.Till now it was mandatory for a person to have a doctor’s prescription or symptoms to get tested for the virus.A Bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said people need to carry Aadhaar card for Delhi address proof and fill a form as prescribed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for COVID-19 testing.The ICMR form specifies the category of patient as per the testing guidelines. The high court noted there was a sharp increase in the number of cases in Delhi and asked private laboratories to allow 2000 COVID-19 tests per day for those who voluntarily wish for it.As the sanctioned strength of conducting RT/PCR test is 14,000, the remaining 12,000 testing capacity per day is available with the Delhi government, it noted.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.The Bench said there was a sharp rise in cases of COVID-19 in Delhi from August 31, and that the figures were “rather alarming”.On August 31, the number of cases in Delhi was 1,358 and on September 7, it went up to 2077.Delhi government said it was “mulling over” the issue of allowing RT/PR tests without prescription and needed one more week to make a decision.However, the high court said having regard to the sharp increase in the COVID-19 cases, it was of the opinion that the situation does not call for any delay.“Henceforth from now, those who want to voluntarily get themselves tested, they need not obtain a prescription from a doctor. The person concerned will only be mandated to fill the ICMR form and attach Aadhaar card to show the proof of a Delhi residence,” the Bench said.It further said the private laboratories should prioritise the results of testing samples sent to them by the Delhi government and thereafter give reports of private persons.In case Delhi government sends additional samples to the private labs, they shall also be catered without any delay, it said.Delhi government counsel Satyakam informed the high court that in pursuance to its last order, COVID-19 testing camps have been set up at Inter-State Bus terminals (ISBT) Anand Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Kashmiri Gate and Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station and New Delhi Railway Station.Indian Railways has started operating more trains so testing at stations will also be increased proportionately, he said.The high court was informed that presently two mobile van facilities are deputed in each district in Delhi for the testing.The Bench directed the Delhi government to ramp up the mobile facilities from two to four on the sites which the state deems appropriate, if possible at prominent metro terminals.The high court said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) should advertise about the nearby COVID-19 testing camps at prominent spots near the entry and exit area of the stations.This should also be uploaded on Delhi government’s website for the convenience of citizens, it said.As the Delhi government counsel said that the third Sero-survey had commenced in the city on September 1 and concluded on September 7, the high court directed him to place on record the sero survey report along with a fresh status report before the next date of hearing on September 16.During the hearing, central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, submitted that social distancing norms are not being followed in district courts and testing camps be organised there.To this, the Bench said camps are being set up at the high court and district courts here on rotation basis and “social distancing is something which the legal community has to ensure”.“We have opened courts on the saying of lawyers and they should ensure social distancing is maintained. It was the bar associations which were asking for physical hearings. While judges, court staff and support staff are coming to courts, lawyers are desisting from coming to courts and court masters are flooded with requests to put matters through virtual hearing,” the Bench said.Ahluwalia and Satyakam submitted that physical hearing be done away with for some more time as the situation is very bad in Delhi and added that lawyers will make a representation on this.The Bench said they can give a representation to this effect to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice who is the final authority to take decisions.The high court had on August 31 expressed concern over spike in cases of COVID-19 in the city and had directed the Delhi government to re-strategise the testing so that maximum number of cases which are turning out to be asymptomatic can undergo a test at private laboratories to prevent spread of coronavirus infection.It was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increasing the COVID-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.

08-09-2020||New Delhi||Rafale jets to be formally inducted into IAF on Thursday||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, his French counterpart Florence Parly and India’s top military brass will attend a ceremony in Ambala airbase on Thursday to formally induct five Rafale fighter jets into the Indian Air Force, officials said.Parly and Singh will hold talks in Ambala on ways to further deepen bilateral defence and security cooperation after the ceremony, they said.The French defence minister is scheduled to arrive Thursday morning and will depart late afternoon, the officials said.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.The jets, produced by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are yet to be formally inducted into the IAF.Ten Rafale jets have been delivered to India so far and five of them stayed back in France for imparting training to IAF pilots. The delivery of all 36 aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021.     A second batch of four to five Rafale jets are likely to arrive in India by November.Sources said a preliminary discussion on a possible procurement of another batch of 36 Rafale jets by India from France may figure in the talks between Singh and Parly.The Rafale jets, known for air-superiority and precision strikes, are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale jet is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons.European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.Meteor is a next generation beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.Out of 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.While the first squadron of the Rafale jets will be stationed at Ambala air base, the second one will be based at Hasimara base in West Bengal.The new fleet will be part of the 17 Squadron of the IAF which was resurrected on September 10 last year.The squadron was originally raised at Air Force Station, Ambala on Oct 1 1951. The 17 Squadron has many firsts to its credit; in 1955 it was equipped with the first jet fighter, the legendary De Havilland Vampire. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-jets-to-be-formally-inducted-into-iaf-on-thursday-138263
08-09-2020||New Delhi||Complaints from states that people becoming lax in taking COVID-19 precautions: Health Ministry||Highlighting repeated complaints from states that people are becoming lax in taking precautions against COVID-19, the Centre on Tuesday said following public health measures like social distancing and wearing masks remains key to slowing the pandemic.Addressing a press briefing, NITI Aayog member V K Paul, who also heads COVID-19 national task force, stressed on the importance of testing in containing the pandemic.“People should not be afraid of getting tested. They should come forward to get themselves tested for COVID-19 if they have symptoms,” he said.At a time when coronavirus cases are on the rise, Paul said there have been repeated complaints from states about people becoming lax in taking safety precautions.“We are getting repeated complaints from states that people have become lax (in taking precautions),” he said.The official asserted that following social distancing, wearing masks, maintaining hand hygiene and avoiding big gatherings remain vital in preventing the spread of the infection.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said India’s COVID-19 cases per million population is 3,102, which is among the lowest in the world.“The COVID-19 deaths per million population in India is 53 as compared to the world average of 115 deaths per million. This is also among the lowest in the world,” he said.Giving a break-up of the cases, Bhushan said five states which account for approximately 70 per cent of total COVID-19 deaths in the country are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. The rest 31.37 per cent deaths are from other states and UTs.“A total of 28 states and UTs have COVID-19 case fatality rate lower than the national average of 1.70 per cent,” the official noted.He added that Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu account for 62 per cent of total active COVID-19 cases in the country.“While 14 states and UTs have less than 5,000 active COVID-19 cases, Lakshadweep has no active cases,” Bhushan said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/complaints-from-states-that-people-becoming-lax-in-taking-covid-19-precautions-health-ministry-138262
08-09-2020||Beijing||After fresh tensions in Ladakh, China says it hopes for disengagement as soon as possible||As a fresh border confrontation erupted between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, China on Tuesday hoped disengagement can be achieved as soon as possible through mutual consultations, flagging approaching harsh winter in the region.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian expressed this hope hours after India and China accused each other of firing in the air near the Pangong lake at the Line of Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh on Monday.The Indian Army said Chinese troops fired shots in the air and attempted to close in on an Indian position in eastern Ladakh on Monday as it rejected charges by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that it transgressed across the LAC.The remarks by the Army came after the PLA late on Monday night alleged that the Indian troops crossed the LAC and “outrageously fired” warning shots near the Pangong lake.The use of firearms along the LAC marks a serious escalation in border tensions as the previous instance of shots being fired at the de-facto border was in 1975.Spokesman Zhao spoke about disengagement when asked at a media briefing about restoration of the status quo by disengaging the troops.“You have a good wish. We all hope our troops get back to their camping area and there won’t be any more confrontation in the border areas.“You know that place has a very bad natural condition and it is above a height of 4,000 metres,” he added.“In winter this is not good for humans to live. So we hope, through diplomatic and military channels and through consultations on the ground we can achieve disengagement as soon as possible and reach consensus.”                 India has already called on China to work jointly for “complete disengagement and de-escalation” on the LAC, saying the future of the bilateral relationship is dependent on the situation along the border.This is the first time in the four-month-long border standoff that China has officially acknowledged the harsh conditions of the mountainous Ladakh region in winter where the temperatures plummet to minus 30 degrees Celsius posing major health hazards to the thousands of troops mobilised by the two armies.Reports from the area said both sides were making arrangements for a long drawn out faceoff especially at the Pangong lake area where the troops were positioned eyeball to eyeball with heavy weapons and armoury.Echoing the PLA’s comments, Zhao sought to blame Indian troops for firing warning shots first on Monday.Asked about Indian allegations that it was Chinese troops which took provocative steps first, he read out the statement of the PLA’s Western Theater command spokesman on Monday alleging that Indian troops illegally crossed the LAC and “outrageously fired warning shots” on Chinese border patrol soldiers forcing them to take countermeasures.“I also want to stress in this incident, the Indian side fired shots to the Chinese border troops first. This is the first time since 1975 that the tranquility is interrupted by the shots. And the Chinese side always stresses that both sides should peacefully settle our differences through dialogue and consultations. Confrontation won’t benefit either,” he said.Asked about what kind of consultations and countermeasures Chinese troops have taken, Zhao said “through diplomatic and military channels we have made stern representations asking the Indian side to immediately stop its dangerous actions, immediately withdraw the people who crossed the line and discipline its front-line troops and those who fired the warning shots and then make sure won’t happen again.”            “Currently I have no further information for you. I believe I made China’s position clear on this,” he said when asked whether the PLA troops fired back.

Following a request from the Chief Minister, Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy also approved the unveiling of the portrait of the former Prime Minister in the State Assembly. But at the same time the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) opposed the resolution and boycotted the proceedings. In a statement, the party chief Asaduddin Owaisi said "AIMIM has decided to boycott today's proceedings in Telangana Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council. Our party cannot support resolution and discussion on centenary Celebrations of late PV Narasimha Rao". The party opposed the resolution as Babri Masjid was demolished during PV Narasimha Rao term in office. The AIMIM legislators and floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi walked out of the Assembly after the motion was moved. The AIMIM is considered to be a “friendly party” by the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). The AIMIM critics have been questioning Owaisi's silence over KCR's move. The United Muslim Forum (UMF), of which the AIMIM is a part, has been vocal about the demolition of the Babri Masjid since December 1992. The resolution dubbed PV Narshima Rao as "the son of Telangana" and chief minister KCR said PV Narasimha Rao had become synonymous with statesmanship, intellectual and multi-linguist. “If Jawaharlal Nehru is the architect of modern India, PV Narasimha Rao is the architect of global India. He is the pride of Telangana and the first Prime Minister from South India. The State government has decided to honour him duly by celebrating his birth centenary throughout the year and started them at PV Gnana Bhoomi on June 28 on his birth anniversary.

Indian families, especially younger families, are financially vulnerable; 48 per cent cannot meet financial obligations longer than 3 months,” the survey said.FIS said banks can serve their customers as a partner in such challenging times by providing ‘need-it-right-now’ offerings such as real time/faster payment options, waiving penalty or fee for going below account minimums, increasing spending limits on cards as well as giving flexible terms and limits on personal loans.The ‘FIS PACE Pulse Survey Q3 2020’ involved people in the age groups of 18-23 years (Gen Zers), 24-28 (Young Gen Yers); 29-39 (Senior Gen Yers), 40-54 (Gen Xers) and 55-years plus (older consumers).The young and senior Gen Yers seem to be slightly more adaptive to the current situation than other age cohorts, the study said.“Indian families are not well prepared for a sudden drop in income. 5 per cent of the respondents surveyed already cannot make ends meet; nearly one half of surveyed respondents cannot be financially sustainable for more than 3 months (48 per cent),” FIS said.It said the younger Indian families are more financially vulnerable than older families, with 55 per cent of Gen Zers not being able to meet financial obligations for more than three months, while the figure drops to 36 per cent within the older consumers.On consumer shopping behaviour, it said 50 per cent have subscribed to streaming services for work, learning and entertainment, more than usual.“Demand for delivery services is up, 38 per cent use grocery delivery services more than usual, 27 per cent use restaurant delivery services more than usual,” it said.On the payments front, it said 45 per cent of surveyed respondents, including 49 per cent of senior Gen Y customers, have used cash and cheques less often than usual. On the other side, app, online and contactless payments have seen increase in use, led by young Gen Y users.The majority (83 per cent) of surveyed respondents said they would use contactless payments instead of cards or cash for in-store shopping in the aftermath of COVID-19.“Mobile payment wallets are very popular in India, as many as 93 per cent of respondents surveyed are mobile payment wallet users.“The most popular wallets are social-based wallet apps. Young and Senior Gen Yers are the heaviest users, they used one more wallet than the average mobile payment wallets users do,” said Mahesh Ramamoorthy, Managing Director, APMEA- Banking and Payments, FIS.As per the survey, Paytm is the top mobile payment wallet in India. Around 78 per cent of surveyed respondents are current users of Paytm, significantly higher than the second player Amazon Pay, which was used by 61 per cent of respondents.

08-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||India working on manufacturing and trial of Russian COVID vaccine||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Sept 8India is working on both manufacturing and trial of Sputnik V vaccine with the government in touch with several companies for potential manufacturing of the Russian candidate.Chairman of the National COVID-19 Vaccine Administration Taskforce VK Paul on Tuesday said India attached great importance to the Russian offer of manufacturing of the vaccine by Indian firms as well as phase 3 trials or bridging studies, as might be required to establish the efficacy of the vaccine."Russia approached India through appropriate channels on two counts – one is the manufacturing of Sputnik V through the network of Indian companies to achieve a scale of production that is the best in the world; the second is the possibility of conducting phase 3 human clinical trials in India as phase 1 and phase 2 trials on the vaccine have already concluded and the results have been published in The Lancet recently.“The Government of India attaches great importance to these offers from a special friend that Russia is and there have been significant movements on both these fronts," Paul said.India's overall COVID-19 case load surged to 42,04,613 with 33,23,950 recoveries, 8,83,697 active cases and 72,775 deaths.India's case fatality rate has reduced to 1.70 per cent with 28 states and UTs posting death rates lower than the national average and 14 states and UTs posting active case load of less than 5,000.Paul, however, minced no words to point to people's laxity and said the spurt in cases was not only due to increased testing but also due to lack of discipline among the people."State after state has complained of growing people's laxity towards the virus. Any further laxity will prove disastrous,” he said.“Also care seeking has to be instant and not delayed. We are hearing of people's resistance to getting tested. That can be very damaging as the virus travels from cities to villages," said Paul.He said around four Indian companies had come forward to manufacture Sputnik V and some others were also in talks with their Russian counterparts."The GOI is facilitating the process. It is a win-win situation for India and the world given large production capacities our companies have. Serum Institute alone has the capacity to make 100 million vaccine doses in a month," he said.On the regulatory front and phase 3 trial of the Russian vaccine, Paul said India was looking at the similar model as in case of the Oxford vaccine which Serum Institute was now making and testing in India."We can consider the same model for the Russian candidate which will then undergo Phase 3 trials on Indian volunteers. We are paving the way for phase 3 trials of Sputnik V as and when required. So, yes we are working with the Russian vaccine candidate on manufacturing, trial and regulatory facilitation fronts," said Paul.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-working-on-manufacturing-and-trial-of-russian-covid-vaccine-138248
08-09-2020||---||SC reserves order on plea for CBI probe into law varsity student’s death||New Delhi, September 9The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its order on a petition seeking a CBI probe into the mysterious death of Vikrant Nagaich, a National Law University (NLU), Jodhpur, student three years ago.A third-year law student of NLU, Jodhpur, Vikrant—who hailed from Gurugram in Haryana—was found dead under mysterious circumstances in August 2017.He had gone out with friends to a place near the campus. His friends came back but he told them that he would return later. Next morning, his dead body was found.A Bench led by Justice RF Nariman—which had on June 8 issued notice to the Rajasthan government on a petition filed by Neetu Kumar Nagaich --  mother of the deceased—reserved the verdict after hearing the petitioner and the state of Rajasthan.The Bench pulled up the state police for attempting to close the case.Following a 2019 order of the Rajasthan High Court, the case is being probed by a Special Investigation team (SIT) of the state police.The top court had earlier asked the state police to file a status report on the investigation done by them so far.The petitioner—mother of the deceased student—had contended before the top court that she had an “inescapable reasonable apprehension” that the lackadaisical and negligent investigation case was a result of “probable collusion” to shield some high, mighty and influential person/s. Even the FIR in the case was registered only after 10 months and there was hardly any progress made in the probe and there had been no efforts on the part of the police to arrest the culprits, she alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-order-on-plea-for-cbi-probe-into-law-varsity-students-death-138247

They have confirmed that the missing youths from Arunachal Pradesh have been found by their side. Further modalities to handover the persons to our authority is being worked out,” Kiren Rijiju, Union minister of state for sports and youth welfare and Lok Sabha member from Arunachal Pradesh, said in a tweet on Tuesday.Congress MLA Ninong Ering, who first highlighted the incident, told The Tribune that he was very happy that the Central government’s initiative to secure the release of the missing youths was bearing fruit.China's PLA has responded to the hotline message sent by Indian Army. They have confirmed that the missing youths from Arunachal Pradesh have been found by their side. Further modalities to handover the persons to our authority is being worked out.   “It should not take much time now for the boys to finally return to their worried parents,” Ering said over phone from Itanagar.Lt Col Harsh Wardhan Pande, spokesperson of the Army’s Tezpur headquartered 4 Corps, which takes care of operations in Arunachal Pradesh, said the Army had contacted the PLA on September 5 regarding the five missing youths. “The attitude of the Chinese is very positive and the boys will be released soon after the completion of the formalities,” Pande told The Tribune while refusing to spell out any timeframe for the release.Rijiju’s announcement today came as a pleasant surprise after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian was on Monday quoted by the state-run media at Beijing as having said that China considered the “so-called Arunachal Pradesh” as south Tibet and the PLA was having no detail about “missing Indians in the region”.China’s statement claiming Arunachal Pradesh as a part of its own territory attracted strong protests in the state located in the north-eastern side of India.“People of Arunachal Pradesh are proud Indians and staunch patriots. We don’t need any recognition or validation from a foreign entity. Instead of issuing misleading statements, the Chinese government should direct its armed forces to immediately release five civilians from Nacho area of Upper Subansiri district who were abducted by PLA soldiers recently,” the All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union (AAPSU), which enjoys widespread support among the local people, said in a press communique.AAPSU also urged the Central government to take recourse to “strong deterrent against recurring mischief by China along the LAC”.The five missing boys had gone to the Indo-China border at Lacho area in Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh accompanying Army personnel as hired porters. The boys, said to be teenagers, were picked up by the PLA when they were returning to their village.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pla-confirms-finding-five-missing-arunachal-youths-138244

However, they were missing for two days and came back on September 6,” their brother said.As they were feeling unwell, the family took them to a local hospital, which referred them to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital.“At the hospital, my sisters told us that they were gang-raped by five men and how they managed to escape and reach home. Then we got to know that they consumed poison after coming back home and due to which they fell sick,” the brother said.While the older sister died on Monday night, the younger one’s condition is critical, officials said.Police said they have arrested three persons in connection with the incident and a hunt is on for the other two.As the body reached the village this morning, locals started protesting, pointing fingers at the police. Last month, another 16-year-old girl was gang-raped in the same area, and her body was later found in the septic tank of a house, according to officials.Locals alleged the police are yet to arrest the main accused in that case.District police officials refused to comment on these allegations.Local Trinamool Congress MLA Khageshwar Ray met the girls’ father, who works at a tea garden, and said that he has asked the administration to take strict action.Police said the accused have been booked on charges of rape and abetment of suicide.

08-09-2020||New Delhi||NIA arrests 3 more accused in Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case||The anti-terror probe agency NIA on Tuesday said it has arrested three more accused persons in the Bhima Koregaon Elgar Parishad case and produced them before a special court in Mumbai today, which granted the agency their custodial interrogation till September 11.Officials in the probe agency identified the arrested persons as Sagar Tatyaram Gorkhe, Ramesh Murlidhar Gaichor and Jyoti Raghoba Jagtap, all in their 30s and residents of Pune district.They said all of them have been arrested under various sections of IPC and UAPA.“The arrested accused persons are members of Kabir Kala Manch, a frontal outfit of banned terrorist organisation CPI (Maoist),” a senior NIA official said, adding: “During investigation it was revealed that accused Gorkhe, Gaichor and Jagtap were propagating Naxal activities and Maoist ideology and were co-conspirators with other arrested accused.”“It has also come on record that the arrested accused persons were in contact with absconding accused Milind Teltumbde of the urban network of CPI (Maoist). Also it is established that during their visits (of Kabir Kala Manch members) in the jungle, they underwent weapon and explosive training and awareness programmes on various topics related to Maoist movement, the official said.The case arose out of a Pune police case in 2018 regarding inciting people and giving provocative speeches during Elgar Parishad organised at Shaniwarwada in the district by the activists of Kabir Kala Manch on December 31, 2017, which promoted enmity between various caste groups and led to violence resulting in loss of life and property and state-wide agitation in Maharashtra.“During investigation, it was revealed that senior leaders of banned CPI (Maoist) were in contact with the organisers of Elgar Parishad as well as the arrested accused persons in the case so as to spread the ideology of Maoism/Naxalism and encourage unlawful activities,” the official said.The NIA took up the probe in the case on January 24, 2020 and arrested accused Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha on April 14. Further, accused Hanybabu Musaliyavirtil Tarayil was arrested on July 28.'Threatened into turning state witnesses' Bhima Koreagaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, organisers of the Bhima Koregaon event in 2018, issued two statements condemning the arrests---one on Monday and the second on Tuesday.In its first press note issued on Monday, the organisation claimed the NIA had called Shahir Sagar Gorkhe and Shahir Ramesh Gaichor in for questioning on several occasions, and tried to “threaten” them into turning state witnesses and admitting that they had connections with naxalites.  “Shahir Sagar Gorkhe and Shahir Ramesh Gaichor, both members of Bhima Koregoan Shauryadin Prerna Abhiyan and Kabir Kala Manch have been arrested by the NIA under the Modi government,” the press note said. ”NIA has summoned both Shahir Sagar Gorkhe and Shahir Ramesh Gaychor on multiple occasions for questioning. Under the guise of questioning, they were repeatedly threatened arrest unless they turn witness for the state,” the statement said: “They were threatened, ‘you have to become witness for the state under CRPC clause 164 and admit (falsely) that you went to the jungle in Gadchiroli and met Naxals there and that you have connections to Naxalites unless you agree to this we will arrest you’”.It claimed that they two were arrested because they refused to heed. It also said that activists were being targeted to “stifle” dissent.“Even in these conditions both Shahirs did not bend to the pressure imposed by the NIA and scrambled their scheme,” the statement said. “At this point, various human rights activists, lawyers, professors, and authors have been arrested regarding Bhima Koregaon Eilgar parishad matter. This conniving state is now targetting Ambedkarite activists who have fought against the brahminical regime through constitutional means. These activists have been one with the people understanding their sorrow, pain, and struggle. It is clear that nor Pune Police nor NIA have any proof to justify these arrests. The arrests are being used to stifle the voices of social activists.”The second press note came after the arrest of Jyoti Jagtap.The statement said that the arrests were aimed at creating an atmosphere of “fear”.“Arrests of these three should be considered as an alert. Modi Government is once again starting an arrests series to create fear atmosphere in the country. In this case, police never had any evidences nor does it have today. Fabricated letters and utterly fake stories, that's what all they do. This government is again and again failing to solve people's issues, henceforth it is diverting public with creating false enemy like Urban Naxal,” the statement said, asking for Jagtap’s release. Pressnote 8 September 2020 *Bhima Koregaon arrests- Jyoti Jagtap has been arrested* Pune ATS has today arrested Jyoti...||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-3-more-accused-in-bhima-koregaon-elgar-parishad-case-138235
08-09-2020||Pune||Pune first district in India to cross 2 lakh COVID-19 cases||Driven by a surge in COVID-19 cases in the last few days, Pune has become the first district in the country to record more than two lakh cases.As per data of the Maharashtra government’s health department, the total number of COVID-19 cases in Pune district reached 2,03,468 on Monday after 4,165 more people tested positive for the disease.Officials here said increased testing was one of the main reasons for the surge in cases in the district.Pune crossed the one lakh-mark on August 5 and in a month’s time, the cases have doubled in the district according to official figures.Compared to Pune, Delhi reported 1,93,526 COVID-19 cases till Monday, while Mumbai recorded 1,57,410 cases.The COVID-19 positivity rate in Pune is around 22 per cent, Collector Rajesh Deshmukh told PTI on Tuesday.“Currently, Pune district is on top in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. The reason behind the surge in cases is the aggressive testing strategy adopted by the district administration,” he said.Not just recently, but Pune has been doing aggressive testing for the last two months and the number of cases is bound to increase, he said.“In fact, no other district is conducting tests the way Pune is doing,” he claimed.Effective contact-tracing, tracking of co-morbid people and isolation of patients have been possible due to the large number of tests, Deshmukh said.“Testing, tracking and tracing are the main factors behind the surge. Even the results of sero survey (conducted on nearly 1,500 people) found out that 50 per cent people had antibodies,” he said.Despite the number of COVID-19 cases being high, the recovery rate in Pune is encouraging as it is now about 78 per cent, he said.According to the district administration records, over 1.57 lakh patients have so far been discharged or have recovered from the disease.Till Monday, 4,651 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported in Pune as against 7,897 in Mumbai.Deshmukh said the fatality rate in Pune is around 2.3 per cent, which is better compared to Mumbai.“Our aim is to further bring down the fatality rate by detecting co-morbid patients at an early stage,” he said.District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said the number of cases will further rise in the coming days.“From today, we are setting up camps in 65 villages where more than 15 cases have been reported. Rapid antigen tests will be conducted on a large population there and as a result, the number of cases will go up,” Pawar said.Deshmukh said besides aggressive testing, the administration is stressing on awareness, strict implementation of social distancing norms and use of masks.“Considering the rise in cases, there is an emphasis on strengthening healthcare facilities in Pune city and in the district, and medical teams have also been set up to screen people aged above 60 having co-morbid conditions,” he added.While the district administration has claimed that health care facilities have been strengthened, there have been complaints about unavailability of beds in hospitals and other medical aids.Two jumbo facilities in Pune city and neighbouring Pimpri Chinchwad industrial area were opened last month.But, the functioning of the facility in Pune came under scanner after allegations of lapses and mismanagement there.Pune-based Congress leader and former MLC Mohan Joshi blamed the BJP-led Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the increase in number of COVID-19 cases in the city.“The BJP is in power in the PMC with a strength of 100 corporators. Besides, Girish Bapat of the BJP is a Lok Sabha member from Pune and five MLAs in the city are from the saffron party. Union minister Prakash Javadekar is from Pune, and despite all this, the situation in the city has become critical,” Joshi said.However, BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole, who represents Shivajinagar constituency in Pune, said the number of COVID-19 cases is bound to go up as testing has been increased.“Our thrust should be on bringing the mortality rate down and for that efforts need to be made,” he said.Talking about Pune’s jumbo COVID-19 facility and the alleged mismanagement there, Shirole said it was the state government’s decision to set up such facilities in Pune.“It is the state government’s responsibility to ensure proper functioning of the jumbo facilities in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Thrust should be on how to improve the situation at these facilities and how lives of people can be saved,” he said.

08-09-2020||Mumbai||Money laundering case: Deepak Kochhar in ED custody till September 19||A Mumbai court on Tuesday remanded Deepak Kochhar, husband of former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda, in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate till September 19 in a money laundering case.Deepak Kochhar was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here on Monday under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with the ICICI Bank-Videocon money laundering case probe.Officials had said he was placed under arrest as the agency wants to put him under custodial interrogation to obtain more details about some fresh evidence gathered in this case, that was filed under the criminal sections of the anti-money laundering law in January last year.The probing agency produced Deepak Kochhar before the court of special PMLA judge Milind V Kurtadikar, who remanded him in the custody of ED till September 19.The ED, while pressing for his remand, told the court that the investigation has revealed that on September 7, 2009, the ICICI bank sanctioned a loan worth Rs 300 crore to Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL).Deepak Kocchar’s wife Chanda Kochhar was the chairman of the bank’s sanctioning committee when this loan was given to VIEL.The probe further revealed that just a day after the loan was sanctioned, Rs 64 crore out of it was transferred from VIEL to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL), the ED said.NRPL was earlier known as NuPower Renewables Limited (NRL) and is a company of Deepak Kochhar.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court that Deepak Kochhar was not cooperating in the investigation and his custodial interrogation was required as there are crucial aspects of funds received by his company and money trail which need to be probed.Opposing his remand, Deepak Kochhar’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal submitted that his client has joined the investigation about 12 times and also submitted all documents.“So it is not a case of custodial interrogation,” the lawyer said.The judge, after hearing both the sides and perusal of remand papers, observed that the custodial interrogation of Deepak Kocchar was “necessary”.It is an economic offence which requires a certain different type of probe, so considering overall arguments, the accused is remanded in the ED’s custody, the court said.The ED had filed its case after studying an FIR registered by the CBI against Chanda Kochhar and Deepak Kochhhar, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot and others.It slapped money laundering charges against the Kochhars and their business entities for “illegal sanctioning of loans amounting to Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon Group of companies”.The agency had alleged that a “net revenue of Rs 10.65 crore was generated by NRL from these tainted funds”.“Therefore, proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 74.65 crore were transferred to or to say generated in NRPL,” the ED had claimed.Earlier this year, the ED also attached assets—including a Mumbai flat where the couple lived, land, and plant and machinery of a wind farm project based in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra—valued at Rs 78 crore “in possession of” Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and the companies owned and controlled by him.It had said Chanda Kochhar and her family “acquired” the Mumbai apartment, owned by one of the Videocon Group companies, by way of “acquiring that company through her family trust at a nominal price and by creating book entries”.

08-09-2020||New Delhi||'Rhea Chakraborty’s complaint goes against Supreme Court’s order': Sushant Rajput's family lawyer||Hours after the Mumbai Police registered an FIR on the complaint filed by Rhea Chakraborty against Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters and others, senior advocate Vikas Singh representing the late actor's family launched a scathing attack on the city police force.Speaking to media here, Singh said: "Today an FIR has been registers by the Mumbai Police. The Bandra Police station is like her second home. The FIR registered by the Bandra Police is a clear violation of the Supreme Court order."The Supreme Court last month closed all options for the Mumbai Police to continue the probe or register a criminal case in future in connection with the unnatural death of SSR."The right of registering the FIR with the Mumbai Police in this case was only for the 147 proceedings of the Mumbai Police which were already on. What Rhea is trying to say through this FIR should have been given by her to the CBI as a statement," he added.The Mumbai police on Tuesday registered the FIR against Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh, and a doctor from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in Delhi based on a complaint filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty.A case has been filed at Bandra police station under sections pertaining to cheating, forgery, abetment to suicide, criminal conspiracy and other sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The senior advocate said that the Mumbai Police has filled up the NDPS section as if they wanted to make her happy."This FIR is a clear violation of the Supreme Court proceedings. Moreover, there is another judgment which says that whenever an FIR is being registered against a Doctor, a medical team shall be constituted and only after that such a step can be taken," Singh said.He added that if the complaint was bonafide and genuine, their statement to CBI would have been a big enough blow to the family of the late actor.Earlier on Monday night, Singh had intimidated that if the Mumbai Police takes this complaint forward, he would "initiate a request for Contempt of court proceedings"."Mumbai Police shall not accept any such complaint as it would be a clear violation of the Supreme Court's order. The order clearly prohibits any other agency apart from CBI from registering any new complaint in this case," said Singh while holding a press conference here."This is a clear attempt to deflect the mind of the people and derail the probe. If the Bandra Police will take this complaint forward, we will initiate contempt proceedings," he added.Ordering a CBI probe into the matter, Justice Hrishikesh Roy in the apex court had said, "While according approval for the ongoing CBI investigation, if any other case is registered on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his unnatural death, the CBI is directed to investigate the new case as well."The top court had also noted that in the present case, the Mumbai Police has attempted to stretch the purview of Section 174 without drawing up any FIR and therefore, as it appears, no investigation pursuant to commission of a cognizable offence is being carried out by the Mumbai Police.

But later when they saw him doing it daily, they stopped doing so."I am afraid to fall. I will jump if I slip and try again," the boy said.A local doctor, R. K.

08-09-2020||Mumbai||Rhea appears before NCB for third day in row||Actor Rhea Chakraborty appeared before the Narcotics Control Bureau for the third consecutive day on Tuesday for questioning in the drugs case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Chakraborty reached the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) office, located at Ballard Estate in south Mumbai, around 10.30 am in a car escorted by a Mumbai Police vehicle.Earlier, she was questioned by the NCB for about eight hours on Monday and six hours on Sunday.The agency earlier said it was getting “her cooperation” in the drugs case probe linked to the case of death of Rajput (34), who was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14.After the questioning session on Monday, NCB Deputy Director General (south-west region) Mutha Ashok Jain told reporters that the agency was doing a “professionally thorough and systematic job” and it will inform the court about its “findings in detail” in this case.The agency has said it wants to question the 28-year-old actress and confront her with her younger brother Showik Chakraborty (24), Rajput’s house manager Samuel Miranda (33) and his house staffer Dipesh Sawant to ascertain their roles in this alleged drug racket.The NCB said it obtained mobile phone chat records and other electronic data that suggested some banned drugs were allegedly procured by these people.The NCB arrested the three men in this case last week.Rhea Chakraborty was earlier questioned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that are probing different angles surrounding Rajput’s death.In her interviews given to multiple TV news channels, the actress had said she has never consumed drugs herself. She had, however, claimed that Rajput used to consume marijuana.Nine people have been arrested till now by the NCB, with seven directly linked to this probe, while two were arrested when the investigation was launched under criminal sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.The NCB probe began after the ED shared with it a report following the cloning of two mobile phones of Rhea Chakraborty that suggested talks about procurement, transaction and consumption of banned drugs.

Besides, the last week has seen Chinese troops manoeuvring for more advantageous locations on the LAC.Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is also slated to attend the CFM but the chances of him meeting Jaishankar are bleak.The MEA said this would be the third CFM meeting that India will be attending as a full member of SCO. India has been taking an active part in various SCO dialogue mechanisms under the Chairmanship of the Russian Federation in this year. The SCO Summit will be held in the near future.The CFM meeting in Moscow will review the preparations for the forthcoming SCO Summit and also exchange views on international and regional issues.

The review committee will evaluate the functioning of the IHR during the pandemic so far and recommend any changes it believes are necessary,” the WHO chief said today.The committee will review the convening of the Emergency Committee, the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern, the role and functioning of national IHR focal points, and will examine the progress made in implementing the recommendations of previous International Health Regulations review committees.Depending on progress made, the committee may present an interim progress report to the resumed World Health Assembly in November and a final report to the Assembly in May, said Ghebreyesus.The IHR was last amended in 2005.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/review-of-who-global-treaty-on-health-emergencies-starts-today-138169

They reached there on Sunday morning and later the woman was reunited with her family, he said.West Bengal SLSA's member secretary Durga Khaitan told PTI over the phone that based on the information provided by CGSLSA, the district legal services authority of South-24 Parganas tried to trace the woman's family.In the process, the authorities found a man, Gopal Parui, who said his sister had gone missing when he was very young. Later, the woman's photographs were exchanged between the legal services authorities of the two states and her identity was confirmed, she said."According to her family, the woman was married and had a daughter, but was later abandoned by her husband. She subsequently came back to her father's place with her daughter and one day she went missing," Khaitan said."Everyone in her family was happy to see her again, especially her daughter, who is now married, and even we felt satisfied," she said.Meanwhile, Justice Sanjib Banerjee, executive chairman of SLSA, West Bengal, has ordered South 24 Parganas district authorities to provide free ration to the woman for her entire life, she said.

08-09-2020||Meerut (Uttar Pradesh)||Bodies of Covid victims swapped in UP district||Swapping of bodies of patients who die due to Covid is becoming a norm, rather than an exception in Uttar Pradesh.In yet another incident on Monday, a family, whose 84-year-old member had died due to Covid, stopped the cremation when one of the members lifted the shroud for a last glimpse of the deceased, after the body was placed on the pyre.According to reports, the family was about to cremate the body of another man, who was in his 50s, when they realised that they had got the wrong body.By the time the Meerut family contacted the family whose body they had, it was too late. They were returning home after doing the cremation and were carrying the ashes in an urn and had no inkling that their kin's body was still lying with another family.When the elderly man's family contacted the LLRM Medical College on the issue, they were 'scolded' by the authorities for unpacking the body of a Covid-19 patient.The nephew of the octogenarian told reporters, "We removed the shroud because some family members insisted on seeing him one last time. To our shock, the body was not of our uncle. It was someone else. When we contacted the LLRM Medical College, instead of accepting their fault, the officials started shouting at us for unpacking the body."Meanwhile, the other family was also in a state of shock.The son of the 50-year-old man said, "I got a call on Sunday morning that my father's body is yet to be cremated. And we have performed the last rites of someone else."Later, on Sunday, the body of the middle-aged man was handed over to the Modinagar family. And, in return, the Meerut family was given the urn of ashes.A probe in the matter has been set up by the District Magistrate Anil Dhingra."A team of additional District Magistrate (city) and Chief Medical Officer will probe the incident," the Dhingra said.Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College (LLRM) principal Gyanendra Kumar said, "The doctor, nurse and ward boy on duty have been asked to give an explanation on the matter. Action will be taken against whoever is found at fault."Several cases of bodies of Covid infected people being swapped in various districts have already taken place in Uttar Pradesh.

08-09-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India, China blame each other for 'firing shots' along LAC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 8Bullets were fired along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh on Monday night, for which India and China have blamed each other.It's the first such case in the area since November 1962.Incidentally, the firing was at the mountain top called ‘Mukhpari’ close to Rezang La, where a company of 13 Kumaon, led by Major Shaitan Singh, had held back the PLA in 1962. It is counted as one of the battles where the PLA could not progress.A statement issued by the Ministry of Defence on Tuesday morning said: “At no stage has the Indian Army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to using of any aggressive means, including firing.”Also read: China provokes: Arunachal ‘South Tibet’Amid Ladakh tensions, Jaishankar to travel to Moscow; may meet Chinese counterpartChina issues warning to India; says it is ‘over-confidently' provoking PLAIndia blamed the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) China for the incident on September 7.“It was the PLA troops who were attempting to close in with one of our forward positions along the LAC. When dissuaded, the PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate the Indian troops. However, despite the grave provocation, our troops exercised great restraint and behaved in a mature and responsible manner,” the statement by the Defence Ministry read.The Indian response was to a statement issued by China, in the wee hours of Tuesday, that accused the Indian troops of having fired bullets across the LAC in the area south of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial melt lake.A statement by the PLA’s Western Theatre Command spokesperson, Colonel Zhang Shuili, was reported by Global Times, the Chinese state-owned news outlet, at almost 2.30 am on Tuesday in China. India has termed the Chinese statement as misleading. “The statement by the Western Theatre Command (of the PLA) is an attempt to mislead their domestic and international audience,” the Indian statement said.India has said it is committed to disengagement and de-escalating the situation on the LAC but China continues to undertake provocative activities to escalate. It was the PLA that had been blatantly violating agreements and carrying out aggressive manoeuvres while engagement at military, diplomatic and political level was in progress, the Defence Ministry added.The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity; however, it is also determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs.The PLA had earlier said: “The Indian Army blatantly fired threats to the patrol personnel of the Chinese border guards, who had made representations, and the Chinese border guards were forced to take countermeasures to stabilise the situation on the ground.”The Chinese spokesperson said the Indian Army illegally crossed the LAC.This is the first incident of firing in Ladakh since 1962. Even during the Galwan clash, no bullets were fired.Apart from Ladakh since 1967, no bullets have been fired across the LAC, when an incident occurred at Nathu La in Sikkim and both sides were involved in a bloody skirmish. In another incident in 1974, a few Assam Rifles troopers had lost their lives when they had inadvertently crossed over the undefined boundary in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-blame-each-other-for-firing-shots-along-lac-138153

Following the arrests, the arrested accused were interrogated during which it was revealed that the mastermind was coordinating the operations from abroad by creating various layers of anonymity.“In a bid to overcome the current situation where scheduled international flight operations are suspended owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the mastermind and the syndicate involved were exploiting the international courier route,” a senior NCB official said.The operation began early this month with the seizure of a parcel, originating from South Africa, containing 970 gm of heroin from a courier service in the national capital.

This is not govt’s education policy, but country’s policy. —Narendra Modi, PMAddressing the inaugural session of the one-day Governors’ Conference, he said though the responsibility of education lies with the government, its interference in the policymaking should be minimal. It should have participation from stakeholders, students, guardians, teachers and education experts.“This is not the government’s education policy, but the country’s education policy,” he said in an apparent bid to address concerns expressed by some states and political parties. Exhorting states and universities to organise seminars and conferences till September 25 for a dialogue on its implementation, the PM said the new policy has been prepared after widespread consultations and suggestions with more than two lakh stakeholders, including students, guardians, teachers and experts. “It is after such a wide consultation that we have arrived at the NEP, a reason why it has received so much support and acceptability,” he added.‘States not consulted’The policy encourages privatisation. As states were not consulted before making it, implementing it will hurt the spirit of cooperative federalism. —Hemant Soren, Jharkhand CM“The new policy aims at not just about bringing changes in the education system, but also give direction and shape to India’s vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, building a strong economy and make India a global destination for education,” the PM said.Exhorting states to build on research and quality education, President President Ram Nath Kovind said the success of NEP 2020 depends upon the states’ participation. “Education comes under the concurrent list,” he said, asking the states to also resolve existing issues like filling vacancies and help make India a knowledge hub. Kovind appreciated the manner in which the policy is distilled into a coherent and effective document by drawing inferences from lakhs of suggestions from across the social spectrum.‘Won’t implement’There is no question of implementing NEP in Bengal for time being. It has been framed without taking WB into confidence. It undermines role of states. —Partha Chatterjee, WB Minister||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/education-policy-will-help-make-india-self-reliant-pm-138058

She will be protected by 10 armed commandos of the Central security forces round the clock.A decision in this regard was taken by the Ministry of Home Affairs ahead of Ranaut’s planned visit to Mumbai on September 9 from her home state Himachal Pradesh, where she has been staying for a while.Ex-cop sends noticeThe actress had expressed that she felt unsafe in Mumbai after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. She has also been quite vocal about drug use in a section of the film industry. She reportedly said she feared Mumbai Police more than the “movie mafia”, and would prefer security either from Himachal Pradesh or the Centre.Reacting to Ranaut’s remarks against Mumbai Police, Raut had tweeted: “We kindly request her not to come to Mumbai. This is nothing but an insult to Mumbai Police.” This lead to a Twitter war as Ranaut tweeted: “Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir?”In an apparent jibe at Kangana Ranaut, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said some people don’t have gratitude for the city where they earn their livelihood.Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik on Monday demanded a unanimous resolution in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for a legal action against Kangana, who he said has “maligned” the image of Maharashtra and Mumbai through her tweets.Meanwhile, Kangana Ranaut took to Twitter to share videos of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials at her office premises here, adding they may demolish the property.In a tweet, she said officials of the Sena-ruled civic body visited her office and may demolish the property on Tuesday.Stating that she has done nothing illegal on her property, the actor said BMC should show the illegal construction with a notice.Actor’s comment naive: CongressNew Delhi: Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “Kangana has been provided Y security so that she can openly carry out BJP’s political agenda, criticise us and defame Maharashtra. While we stand up for the actor’s right to dissent, no reasonable person can accept what she said about Mumbai comparing it with Pakistan occupied Kashmir.” He said to describe the business capital of India as PoK was naive, political opportunism, reprehensible and incorrect.

No doubt, the government and its bureaucrats are working hard as always, but they need to be “frightened out of their complacency and into meaningful activity,” Rajan wrote in a post on LinkedIn.Making a strong case for an economic stimulus, he said that without relief, “households (will) skip meals, pull their children out of school and send them to work or beg, pledge their gold to borrow, let EMIs and rent arrears pile up.... Similarly, without relief, small and medium firms — think of a small restaurant — (will) stop paying workers, let debt pile up, or close permanently.” Former World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu felt that divisiveness and lack of trust were hurting investment and job creation.State Bank of India’s Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh has said the loss of Rs 40-50 lakh crore of the GDP in one quarter could not be recovered by any amount of fiscal or monetary support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/complacency-wont-do-rajan-rings-alarm-bells-138064
08-09-2020||---||China provokes: Arunachal ‘South Tibet’||New Delhi, September 7Even as China is engaged in hostilities with India on the western portion of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), it reiterated its claim over Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern sector as well on Monday.Also read:LAC tense as China claims shots fired by Indian Army The Chinese iteration came in the context of five youths who went missing on September 3 with locals alleging that the PLA had abducted them from Nacho village of Upper Subansiri district. Local media has reported that the abduction was witnessed by two persons who were part of the group, but managed to escape.Asked about the missing youths from Arunachal Pradesh at a press conference, Zhao Lijian, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson, said: “China’s position with regard to the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, i.e. South Tibet region, is consistent and clear. We have never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh, illegally established on the Chinese territory. Regarding the specifics (missing youth), I am not aware of it now.”Beijing says not aware of 5 missing youthsWe have never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh. Regarding the specifics (missing youth), I am not aware of it now. —Zhao Lijian, Chinese Foreign Affairs SpokespersonChina had last raked up the issue in mid-February when Union Home Minister Amit Shah had visited Arunachal Pradesh on its statehood day. The Chinese MFA’s reaction then was stronger, accusing the minister of violating China’s territorial sovereignty and undermining the stability of the border area.The MEA had then shot back with its standard reaction, reiterating that Arunachal was an “integral, inalienable part” of India and added that “objecting to a visit of any leader of India to Arunachal Pradesh does not stand to reason and understanding of India”.This time, however, the Chinese objection, although milder than the previous reaction, comes when the LAC standoff in eastern Ladakh shows no signs of abating even after a recent meeting of the two Defence Ministers in Moscow and several rounds of military and diplomatic talks.Tagin tribe upset with the authoritiesThe five missing boys belong to the Tagin tribe.
