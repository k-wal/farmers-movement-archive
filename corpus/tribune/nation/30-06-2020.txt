30-06-2020||New Delhi||Indigenous airborne Locust control system on MI-17 helicopter at 3 BRD Chandigarh||The versatile MI-17 helicopter will now be used locust control operations.The Indian Air Force has tasked 3 Base Repair Depot located at Chandigarh to undertake the challenging task of indigenously designing and developing an Airborne Locust Control System (ALCS) for Mi-17 helicopters in view of envisaged delay in provisioning of modification kits from the UK due to COVID lockdown, according to a statement by Agriculture Ministry.Using all indigenous components, the atomised airborne spraying of pesticide has been successfully achieved in air through a configuration of nozzles mounted both sides on external trusses of a Mi-17 helicopter, it said. The nozzles used for the purpose are a mix of commercially available nozzles as well as the nozzles developed by CSIO, Chandigarh.Anticipating Locust attack, the Ministry of Agriculture had signed a contract with M/s Micron, UK to modify two Mi-17 Helicopters for spraying atomized pesticide to arrest locust breeding in May 2020. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the UK-based firm would be able to manufacture and supply the modification kit to IAF only from September 2020 onward for system integration and testing.  In the meanwhile, an unprecedented locust attack started manifesting from last week of May and was fast spreading practically across many states. Malathion in appropriate concentration would be filled in the internal auxiliary tank of 800 litres capacity fitted inside the helicopter and pumped into the nozzles by using an electrical pump as well as compressed air, achieving nearly 40 minutes of spaying duration in the infected zone covering an area of approximately 750 hectares in each mission.A team of Test Pilots and Test Engineers of Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment, Bangalore, have successfully carried out ground and airborne trials of ALCS on a modified Mi-17 helicopter.  Being an indigenously developed system, the ALCS would offer inherent advantages of in-house maintenance, future upgradeability, saving of foreign exchange and help in making the country Self Reliant in aviation related technology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indigenous-airborne-locust-control-system-on-mi-17-helicopter-at-3-brd-chandigarh-106693
30-06-2020||Patna||Shekhar Suman makes a strong pitch for CBI probe into Sushant’s death||Actor Shekhar Suman on Tuesday claimed that there was “more than what meets the eye” in the suicide of rising Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput, and made a strong pitch for a CBI inquiry into the case.Suman, who recently launched a campaign ‘Justice For Sushant Forum’, was addressing a press conference at the residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, a day after he met Rajput’s bereaved father at his residence here.“I strongly believe that Sushant’s death is not an open and shut case of suicide,” asserted Suman who claimed to have closely followed the investigation trail and pointed towards “missing links” like absence of a suicide note and facts like misplacement of a duplicate key to the house, and change of SIM card by the actor “50 times in a month”.Suman clarified that he was not insisting that the deceased actor’s death was “not a case of suicide” but added that even if the 34-year-old had taken his own life, “those guilty of abetment must be identified and brought to justice”.Asked about allegations levelled by many Bollywood insiders that the Patna-born actor was at the receiving end of “nepotism” in the film industry, Suman—who hails from the Bihar capital—replied in the affirmative.“Besides Shah Rukh Khan and I, Sushant was the only one to have started off as a TV actor and achieve success on the big screen thereafter. A self-respecting man who did not believe in massaging egos of big shots, he must have become an eyesore for many,” remarked the 66-year-old.He, however, refused to take a name when asked if he suspected anyone of giving a short shrift to the young actor, saying “it would be wrong to do so unless I was armed with evidence. And this is precisely the reason I am pressing the demand for a CBI inquiry”.Suman, who had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha polls from Patna Sahib on a Congress ticket, lamented that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not agree to meet him when he sought an appointment to garner his support in the matter.“I was told he is not meeting people because of COVID-19 scare. Tejashwi had no fears on this account and nor did I, so I asked him to extend a helping hand and he obliged,” he said, with the leader of the opposition seated by his side.Tejashwi Yadav, on his part, claimed that he was supporting the cause “not in the capacity of an opposition leader but as a young citizen of Bihar. I started off as a cricketer and I am aware that people from our state are discriminated against in all fields”.He said that during his visit to Rajput’s residence last week he met his “cousin Neeraj Bablu, a BJP MLA, and asked him to press for a CBI inquiry with the assurance that we would support it wholeheartedly, our political differences notwithstanding”.He also reiterated the demand that the upcoming film city project at Rajgir, in the chief minister’s home district of Nalanda, be named after the deceased actor.“As chief minister, he (Nitish Kumar) is the leader of not just his party or his government but all residents of Bihar. I would request him to step out and offer much-needed consolation to the actor’s bereaved family,” Yadav added.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||India needs to deal with China decisively, not with symbolic gestures like banning apps: Congress||The Congress on Tuesday said India needed to deal with China decisively and not with symbolic gestures like banning apps with Chinese links.India on Monday banned 59 apps with Chinese links, including hugely popular TikTok and UC Browser, saying they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.The ban, which comes in the backdrop of the ongoing stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, is also applicable for WeChat and Bigo Live.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate alleged that China had not only intruded into India’s territory but also the economy as under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch the trade deficit with China had gone up to 53 billion dollars.“I think we need to deal with China far more decisively than symbolic gestures of banning Apps. One has to move away from these symbolic gestures. The tension with China is nothing like it has been in the past and it is of grave concern,” she said at a virtual press conference.Asked about the party’s reaction to the banning of Apps with Chinese links, she said while China was in occupation of our territory and there was a serious intrusion, India’s retaliation after 20 brave hearts were martyred was by banning 59 apps.“What about the massive amount of investment that China has done under the Modi regime,” she asked.The Congress leader said when Congress demitted office, the FDI from China was 1.1 billion dollars which had risen to 26.6 billion dollars.“There is massive Chinese intrusion even in our economy. Under Mr Modi’s watch, the trade deficit with China has gone up to 53 billion dollars which were just 36 billion dollars during our government. So, our reliance on Chinese imports had doubled. From importing Rs 3,000 per person from China, we are now importing Rs 6,000 per person from China,” the Congress spokesperson said.“I think these are symbolic gestures, they are not going to cut ice with a country like China. We need to take more decisive steps, whatever those steps may be, we stand with the government of the day. But I don’t think, the government can do away with banning 59 apps,” she added.The list of apps that have been banned also includes Helo, Likee, CamScanner, Vigo Video, Mi Video Call - Xiaomi, Clash of Kings as well as e-commerce platforms Club Factory and Shein.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||Eastern Ladakh standoff: India, China hold marathon Corps Commander talks||Indian and Chinese militaries on Tuesday held an over 10-hour Corps Commander-level dialogue with a focus on finalising modalities for the disengagement of troops from various standoff points in eastern Ladakh, and explored ways to ease tension in the region, government sources said.In the meeting, the Indian delegation conveyed concerns over China’s “new claim lines” in the region and demanded restoration of status quo ante as well as immediate withdrawal of Chinese troops from Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and a number of other areas, they said.The talks took place on the Indian side of Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Chushul sector in eastern Ladakh. The meeting began at 11 am and was continuing beyond 9 pm, the sources said.The Indian delegation at the meeting was headed by 14 Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh while the Chinese side was led by the Commander of the Tibet Military District Major General Liu Lin.The sources said the Indian side also pitched for strictly following provisions of a number of agreements on dealing with issues relating to handling of border issues.The focus of the talks was on finalising the modalities for de-escalation, and disengagement of troops from various friction points, the sources said adding there were deliberations on confidence building measures as well.There was no official word on details of the meeting. It was the third corps commander-level meeting since the standoff began on May 5.In the previous two rounds of talks, the Indian side demanded immediate withdrawal of Chinese troops from various areas in the region.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last seven weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.In the talks on June 22, the two sides arrived at a “mutual consensus” to “disengage” from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh.  The previous two rounds of dialogue took place at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC.Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC, the 3,500-km de-facto border.The Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border in the last two weeks. The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizeable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases.In a strongly-worded statement, the external affairs ministry last week held China responsible for the standoff, saying it has has been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC since early May and that conduct of the Chinese forces is in complete disregard of all mutually agreed norms.The first round of the Lt General talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley.However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.Tensions had escalated in eastern Ladakh after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

Thus while making houses, buying or selling properties keep this in mind .We suggest that you consult a structural engineer,” reads the note.Not only the advisory, but authorities like District Town Planning (DTP) Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) too have started putting stringent earthquake resistant structural parameters in place before approving any buildings.The architects have been apprised to design keeping the same in mind and earthquake resistance has been made a key factor in issue of structural safety certificate to any building.“The recent tremors though of moderate or low magnitude should make people alert. Those buying properties or making new ones should know we are in high risk zone. Similarly the existing structures, the high rises should do a quality check and take necessary steps,” said DC Amit Khatri.Facing subsequent tremors, Gurugram authorities had in 2015-16 taken up earthquake safety on top priority and found majority of high rises risky, however with no major tremors over the years the efforts were shelved.It may be noted that Gurugram along with Delhi falls in zone IV which is second most earthquake threatened seismic zone.According to experts, Gurugram is at higher risk than Delhi as while Delhi sits on top of three active seismic fault lines Gurugram sits on 7 making it the riskiest area in Delhi-NCR.If any of these becomes active, it can cause an earthquake of up to 7.5 magnitude.In 1960, an earthquake with epicentre along the Delhi-Gurgaon border of 6.2 magnitude had damaged nearly 200 structures and killed and injured several people. The area was then amongst sparsely inhabited in Gurugram with just few mud houses and two people were reported dead and others injured.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/17-tremors-in-last-three-months-in-ncr-gurugram-authorities-put-earthquake-resistance-on-top-agenda-106674

Of these patients, 4 per cent required invasive mechanical ventilation when they entered the trial; 70 per cent required oxygen alone and 26 per cent required no respiratory intervention at all. There was no significant difference in endpoint 28-day mortality between the two groups. There was also no evidence of beneficial effects on the risk of progression to mechanical ventilation of length of hospital stay,” said the UK researchers.The study also ruled out any significant mortality benefit of Lopinavir and Ritonavir for COVID-19 patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hiv-drugs-lopinavir-ritonavir-show-no-promise-for-covid-treatment-reveals-uks-recovery-trial-106659
30-06-2020||London||UK MPs flag China’s ‘bullying behaviour’ with India||British MPs have raised concerns in the Parliament over China’s “bullying behaviour” in the border dispute with India and the “delayed declaration” of COVID-19 and urged an internal review into the UK’s dependence on China with a view to reducing collaboration with the country.Conservative Party MP Ian Duncan Smith raised the issue as part of an urgent question in the House of Commons on Monday evening on the “mistreatment” by the Chinese government of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang province.“Given the Chinese government’s appalling record on human rights, their attack on freedoms in Hong Kong, their bullying behaviour in border disputes from the South China seas to India, their blatant breaching of the rules-based order governing the free market and their delayed declaration on COVID-19, will the government now initiate an internal review of the UK’s dependence on China, with a view to significantly reducing that dependence,” questioned Smith.UK Minister for Asia Nigel Adams responded to say that the UK government had been regularly raising its concerns with China over various issues.“On a full government review, our approach to China remains clear-eyed and is rooted in our values and interests. It has always been the case that when we have concerns, we raise them and that where we need to intervene, we will,” he said.Opposition Labour Party MP Stephen Kinnock also pressed the minister over the “increasingly belligerent” behaviour of China towards its own people and neighbouring countries.“Does the Minister recognise that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) actions in Xinjiang reflect a wider pattern of behaviour of increasingly authoritarian policies at home and aggressive expansionism abroad, including in Hong Kong, Ladakh and the South China sea,” he questioned.Adams responded to say that the UK had been “very active” on these issues and has played a leading role in raising all concerns bilaterally and at the United Nations and also called on the UK companies active in the Xinjiang province to carry out due diligence over the treatment of minorities.“All British companies involved in the region must consider carrying out proper due diligence to ensure that human rights violations have not been taking place in their supply chains,” he said.Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made his first statement related to the India-China border conflict, describing it as “a very serious and worrying situation”.“We are encouraging both parties to engage in dialogue on the issues on the border and sort it out between them,” Johnson told the Commons in response to a question related to the conflict in eastern Ladakh.

30-06-2020||Hyderabad||Three held for hanging monkey to death in Telangana||Days after a video of a monkey being hanged to death from a tree in Khammam district went viral, three people have been arrested in connection with the incident.According to Sathupalli Forest Range Officer A Venkateswarlu they filed a Preliminary Offence Report (POR) under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 against the perpetrators and they were arrested on Monday.“As it is a bailable offence they were later granted bail on personal bond,” he said.The official told PTI that a notice under section 41 (A) of the CrPC (notice of appearance) was also served to them and they have to appear before the forest officials whenever they are asked to do so as part of investigation.The incident happened on June 26 at Vemsoor village and the video of the primate being hanged using a rope went viral, prompting the officials to investigate.Forest officials said the accused wanted to scare other monkeys by hanging the one which was caught and they later found the carcass in a decomposed state.Meanwhile, the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) condemned the brutal killing of the monkey.The apex animal rights organisation in a statement said it has reached out to government authorities including Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao seeking stringent action against the culprits as per law.“We cannot continue to call these heinous incidents, just acts of cruelty. These are criminal acts of violence involving torture and abuse against sentient, free, wild animals. And the Prevention of Cruelty Act is woefully inadequate to deal with such violence. We need a new law that punishes violent crimes against animals. Revisiting the penalties is important too. Animals should be #EqualBeforeTheLaw,” Varda Mehrotra, Executive Director, FIAPO, said.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||TikTok goes offline; removed from Google Play Store, Apple App Store||Short video sharing app TikTok went offline in the country on Tuesday following the government order banning it and 58 other apps citing threat to India’s sovereignty and security.The app was also removed from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.The status of other banned apps could not be immediately ascertained.According to some users, they were able to use the app for a brief period on Tuesday. It had 200 million users in India.“Dear users, we are in the process of complying with the Government of India’s directive to block 59 apps. Ensuring the privacy and security of all our users in India remains our utmost priority,” as per a message displayed by the app.The India website of TikTok, which employs about 2,000 people in the country, has also been pulled down.Besides ByteDance’s TikTok, other banned apps include e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s UC Browser, Tencent Holdings Limited’s social media platform WeChat, and Baidu Incorporation’s map and translation platforms.The ban in India would hit Chinese internet companies that were making headway in the world's fastest-growing mobile market.Blaise Fernandes, Director at policy think tank Gateway House, said there are essentially four types of Chinese apps functioning in India — economic activity apps, service-oriented apps, vanity apps, and strategic apps.“The Digital India story is globally tracked. Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are part of the digital ‘Silk Route’ of China. The ban of the 59 Chinese Apps in India, will negatively impact the valuations of these apps and their respective promoters,” he said.Fernandes also noted that a case in point is the upcoming IPO of TikTok, whose 30 per cent user base comes from India. This will impact the TikTok valuations negatively, he added.In a statement, TikTok India Head Nikhil Gandhi said the company had not shared any information of its users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese Government, and that it placed the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.Helo, another group company of ByteDance, said it was working with key stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications. It also said it strictly followed all rules and regulations of the region.Meanwhile, Roposo, which describes itself as a ‘Made in India’ short video app with over 65 million downloads, said many TikTok users, including influencers, have moved to its platform following the ban.“Influencers who have switched to Roposo include Prem Vats and Noor Afshan, who had fan followings of 9.5 million and 9 million, respectively, on TikTok,” InMobi Group-led Roposo said.On Tuesday, traders’ body CAIT called for an investigation into investments made by the Chinese firms in various Indian start-ups to ensure that data accrued by these start-ups was not being transferred to the Chinese investors and there was no threat to the country’s security.The CAIT has written to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal seeking a probe to ascertain that no “foul play” was taking place under the garb of investment.“We wish to state that the Chinese companies have major investments in many start-ups in India and the few majors are Flipkart, Paytm Mall, Paytm.com, Swiggy, Ola, OYO, Zomato, Policybazaar, BigBasket, Delhivery, MakeMyTrip, Dream 11, Hike, Snapdeal, Udaan, Lenskart.com, Byjus...,” CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said in the letter to Sitharaman.Chinese companies namely Alibaba, Tencent and others were lead investors in many of these start-ups and it should be ensured that no foul play was taking place under the garb of investment, he added.Industry executives believe that the government’s move to ban these Chinese apps presented an opportunity for home-grown companies to woo millions of young users and brands onto their platforms.Regional language social media platform ShareChat said MyGov India joined its platform, giving the citizen engagement platform the opportunity to connect and engage with over 60 million active users in 15 Indian languages.Chingari, an Indian app touted as TikTok rival, has seen manifold growth in usage in the past few weeks. It has crossed more than 2.5 million downloads from 550,000 downloads in about 10 days.Sumit Ghosh, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Chinagri app said the step taken by the government was good and welcomed TikTok users to try the app.Naveen Mishra, senior research director at Gartner, said with the ban of TikTok, 200 million Indian consumers are evaluating alternatives.“This ban creates immediate opportunities for Indian developers to create a similar robust platform. There are a bunch of early-stage similar Indian products, which will be aggressively tested by Indian consumers now.”Genius Consultants Limited CMD RP Yadav said this would open up great opportunities for the IT MSME sector. “They can work on developing application software that is similar or better.”Sunil Nair, the India CEO of Silicon Valley-based Firework, said for any platform that wanted to enter India and operate, it was important for it to understand the sensitivities towards the country’s culture and the importance of taking responsibilities for the actions of its users.Firework is a short video network and caters to an audience across nine countries.

The helicopter with a single pilot operation has a pesticide carrying capacity of 250 litres in one trip and can cover about 25 to 50-hectare area in one flight, according to an official statement.Meanwhile, an order had been placed for five aerial spraying machines from a UK-based company. Once these are received, they would be deployed in the IAF helicopters and pressed for locust control.Also read: Locust swarm re-enters Rewari after three days, passes over eight villagesAlong with ground equipment such as sprays and vehicles, deployment of helicopters in locust control operations follows the need to strengthen air control capabilities through drones, helicopters and aircraft, the Government said, adding that it was the first time that drones had been used for such operations.As per the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s locust status update of June 27, swarms that accumulate in northern Somalia are likely to migrate across the Indian Ocean to summer-breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border. In Pakistan, swarms have already started laying eggs in Sindh and are also present in the Indus Valley.Virtual meetings of the technical officers of the South West Asian countries (Afghanistan, India, Iran and Pakistan) had taken place on a weekly basis, the government saidSo far, 15 SWAC-TOC meetings have been done this year. Technical information related to locust control in the region is being shared during the meetings.An Empowered Committee finalised the firm for deploying the helicopter for aerial spray in the desert areas after getting all clearances from the DGCA and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.It is after a long gap of 26 years that India saw a locust attack, the Agriculture Minister said.“It was estimated that this year, there would be a greater locust problem. The government is in full preparedness and all state governments have been alerted and are working in close coordination with the Centre,” he said.Locusts fly during the day and settle down only after dark in the evening. According to experts, broadly four species of locusts are found in India — desert locust, migratory locust, Bombay locust and tree locust. The desert locust is considered the most destructive.The “worst locust outbreak seen in a quarter of a century” in India is yet another example of global warming/climate change.“Climate change is facilitating the breeding and the movement of locusts. Untimely rains and increased cyclonic activity have helped them breed faster. December had never seen a locust attack but in 2019, there was one. The warning was available well in advance and there was enough time for India to be prepared,” says agricultural policy expert Devinder Sharma.Several waves are expected until early July due to spring breeding in southern Iran and southwest Pakistan.Locusts thrive in wet conditions and outbreaks often follow floods and cyclones. Heavy rain leads to the growth of vegetation in arid areas, providing locusts with conditions needed to develop and reproduce.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/locust-control-govt-deploys%C2%A0helicopter-more-aerial-spraying-to-be-deployed-on-iaf-choppers-106646

Potluri for allegedly letting lose his pet dogs on police officers who had gone to his residence for investigation of a complaint against him.PVP, as Prasad is popularly known, his wife and another person were booked under Indian Penal Code's Section 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty).The case was registered at Banjara Hills police station on a complaint by sub-inspector D. Harish Reddy, who along with another officer and a home guard, had gone to PVP's house in posh Jubilee Hills.The police officers had gone as part of the investigations into a complaint lodged by a person with Banjara Hills police last week, alleging that PVP was stalling his house construction and threatening him.When the team reached PVP's house they were stopped at the main gate by a person and when they told him about the purpose of the visit, he went inside and came back only to inform them that PVP and his wife have asked him not to allow anybody in.When they tried to enter the house, five dogs came charging towards them, making them flee the place.PVP had joined the YSRCP on the eve of 2019 elections and contested unsuccessfully as the party candidate from Vijayawada Lok Sabha seat.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||India's ban on 59 Chinese apps: What lies ahead||With the Indian government announcing to ban 59 Chinese apps, millions of users were in flux on Tuesday as some of those popular apps were still there on their smartphones and available for downloads, barring TikTok and Helo which disappeared from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store.The next step for the government would be to tell various Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to remove these apps from devices owned by their subscribers and send users notifications, along with sending instructions to Google and Apple to remove all 59 apps from their respective online stores.Since most of the Chinese phones come bundled with pre-installed Chinese apps, users will also need to pro-actively remove those apps.The move to ban Chinese apps would affect roughly one in three active smartphone users in the country. Some of these apps like TikTok have been installed on hundreds of millions of smartphones."We now expect investments flowing in for local apps which are an alternative to some of these Chinese apps. The scale will be the key here as faster the scale, more user acquisition and retention for the desi apps," Tarun Pathak, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research, told IANS.Once the apps are removed from app stores, there will be no updates or upgrades. In that case, the users would automatically exit the platforms."We have done a few reports about lack of content moderation and offensive content on one of the blocked platforms, and we do believe that there are problems with the platforms that need to be fixed which may extend into being serious privacy and security violations," said Vineet Kumar, Founder of Cyber Peace Foundation."However, in light of the law on blocking under Section 69A of the IT Act and IT Rules, 2009, we believe that all these services should be given a reasonable chance to represent themselves before the government to demonstrate their compliance and security standards," Kumar said in a statement.Both TikTok and Helo, products of China-based content giant ByteDance, said that they will abide by the decision and have been invited to meet "concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications".TikTok had nearly 119 million active users in India and was among the top 10 apps on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.However, other banned apps like Alibaba Group's UC Browser and UC News, Xiaomi's Mi community, Tencent-owned WeChat, e-commerce platform Club Factory and document scanning app CamScanner were still available on the platforms for download.According to Pathak, users will proactively start deleting apps from their smartphones once they realise there are no install updates and the apps undermine their privacy and data security.Accessing these apps via VPN is also a solution but how many Indian users would try that route is not clear. They would, however, keep receiving short videos from folks from other countries as these apps are only banned within the boundaries of the nation."The picture will become clear soon. The China-India border dispute compounded with the economic stress caused due to the pandemic has forced the government to adopt a strategy similar to the US (like Huawei), to potentially retaliate in a way where it would hurt China the most," Pathak told IANS.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||BJP says 'Make in India', but buys from China: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday took a swipe at the BJP saying, the party says 'Make in India', but its government at the Centre buys from China.   "Facts don't lie. BJP says: Make in India. BJP does: Buy from China," he said in a tweet along with a graph showing comparative volumes of imports from China during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance's tenure and the current BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government.The graph shows a rise in Chinese imports under the current dispensation.Continuing his offensive against the government on the LAC standoff, Gandhi also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi when and how he will throw out the Chinese army from Indian territory."The entire country knows that China has snatched India's sacred land. Everyone knows that China has transgressed into Indian territory at four places in Ladakh," the Congress leader said in a video message ahead of Modi's address to the nation."Narendra Modi ji, please tell the country when will you throw out China's army from India's territory and how," he said in a video message."Hope the prime minister will definitely agree to these suggestions in national interest. This is true national service and patriotism," he said in a  tweet in Hindi, sharing his video message.Gandhi has been attacking Prime Minister Modi and his government over the India-China border standoff in eastern Ladakh, that led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a violent clash between the troops of the two countries on June 15. Targeting the prime minister over the Chinese incursions in Ladakh, he has accused the Modi of "surrendering" Indian territory”. Modi, in his address at the all-party meeting earlier this month, had said that no one has intruded into Indian territory and no one has occupied it.  The former Congress president has been attacking the government on the 'Make in India' initiative, alleging that it has "failed" to yield results.  In the video, Gandhi said COVID-19 has destroyed India's economy over the last three months and the entire country knows this. The biggest blow has been dealt to the poor, labourers, middle class and salaried class, he said.  "We have given some suggestions to the government. The first is to implement an income guarantee scheme for six months, and not a year, and directly put Rs 7,500 per month in the accounts of the poor. This will lead to creation of demand and revival of the economy," he said. The Congress leader said the government has not heeded to this proposal. Not once but three to four times, they have refused to implement it, he said, noting that the reason they give is that there is no money.  "I want to remind the country that the government waived of lakhs of crores of tax liabilities of the 15 richest crony capitalists and in the past three months the government has consistently increased petrol and diesel prices on 22 occasions.  "There is no shortage of money. The government has three lakh crore rupees, with which it can implement the Nyay scheme and directly put money into the accounts of the poor," he said.  Gandhi shared his video message on social media minutes before the prime minister's address, in which Narendra Modi announced extension of the PMGKAY, a free ration scheme, for 80 crore people across the country till end of November. Under the scheme, five kg of wheat or rice and one kg of pulses per month will be given free of cost to the poor. The scheme was initially rolled out for three months.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||ASHA workers played critical role in COVID-19 management in UP, tracked 30.43 lakh migrant returnees||In a major exercise, 1.6 lakh accredited social health activists have tracked in two phases over 30.43 lakh migrants who returned to Uttar Pradesh during the COVID-19 lockdown and assisted the state government in contact tracing and community surveillance, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.The ASHAs tracked 11.24 lakh migrant returnees in the first phases and 19.19 lakh in the second, the ministry said, adding that they not only identified 7,965 persons with symptoms but also regularly followed up on their health status.“With the surge in the cases of COVID-19 in the country and the influx of migrant population from hotspot areas, one of the major challenges in Uttar Pradesh was to cater to the healthcare needs of returnees and arrest the spread in its rural population. “ASHAs have played a critical role in supporting the state’s COVID-19 management during this crisis,” the ministry said.Uttar Pradesh has reported 672 deaths and 22,828 cases so far, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated at 8 am.The ministry presented a case study of a 20-year-old native of Bahraich district (Huzorpur Block, Nibuhi Kala village), who worked at a juice shop in Mumbai and returned home along with other migrant workers in a truck in early May after travelling for five days. As soon as Suresh reached home, the local ASHA—Chandra Prabha—met him and recorded his details. She informed the Rapid Response Team (RRT) of the district, which advised Suresh to quarantine himself at home, the ministry said.Chandra Prabha also counselled the family members and explained in detail the steps to be taken during home quarantine. She undertook regular follow up visits and kept in touch with the family.             Her alertness, motivational skills and support ensured that as soon as Suresh began experiencing symptoms, he was sent to the Community Health Centre in Chitaura, which is also a designated COVID Care facility.Chandra Prabha also ensured that Suresh’s family members and his fellow migrant workers were referred for COVID testing, the ministry said.According to the Union Health Ministry’s statement, ASHA’s have facilitated sample collection from 2,232 returnees of which 203 were found to be positive and were referred to COVID health care services. ‘Nigrani Samitis’ (Vigilance Committee) have been formed in all the villages under the ‘Gram Pradhan’.      The ‘samiti’ members and volunteer community patrols keep in touch with the ASHAs and provide details of the migrants in a village, who in turn help with the follow up.               “ASHAs have played a critical role in sensitising the communities about the preventive measures to be adopted such as regular hand washing with soap and water, importance of wearing masks when out in public spaces, and maintaining adequate physical distancing,” the ministry said.As a result of their efforts, there has been enhanced awareness about essential and non-essential healthcare services and how to access these. The ASHAs are provided basic protective gear like masks, soaps and sanitizers as they go about their duties, it said.

Hence, the EC concluded that an on-line test at a large number of centres compliant with physical distancing and public health safety prescriptions is in the best interests of the health and safety of candidates and test administrators,” the notification said.The coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown called to control its spread had put the examination, which was initially scheduled for May, to be put on hold.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/clat-to-be-held-on-august-22-106624

For the international audience, the title will be “A Journey of a Migrant”. The film will be subtitled in 20 languages.The film will be shot in locations that were part of Jyoti’s journey from Gurugram to Darbhanga.Jyoti had become the face of migrant grit during the lockdown as she went on to buy a second-hand cycle with her entire family savings and cycled from Gurugram to her home in Bihar, taking her injured father along.Amongst her various fans was US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump.Ivanka had praised her calling her journey a “beautiful feat of endurance”. She was also offered a trial chance from the Cycling Federation of India which was impressed by her endurance but she declined, saying that she wanted to study to get a steady job.“The journey has changed my entire life. When I reached home, I came to know I had become a hero on the internet and people outside India also knew my name. I have no special talent but did what a daughter would do for her father. I am feeling very good about being signed for a movie,” said Paswan.Jyoti said her father, Mohan Paswan, is an e-rickshaw driver who had met with an accident in March. Her mother was ill so she travelled to Gurugram to look after him.“Suddenly, the lockdown was announced and we finished all our savings. My father could not earn for the next few months so he could not live here. There was no transport but I had to take him back even if on my shoulders. We pooled all our money and bought a cycle from another migrant and left on an unpredictable journey. There were days when we had only water and no food but the urgency to get back home got me going. I was happy to get back but I had no idea I would ever be this celebrated. Migrants like us show such endurance take such risks all our lives. This is our fate,” says Jyoti.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cycling-from-real-to-reel-life-jyoti-kumari-to-be-protagonist-in-film-106605

Bye to all, daddy", the man said in the short video which went viral on social media.Officials said the man died of a heart attack on June 26 two days after he was admitted to the state-run hospital with some symptoms after testing positive for COVID-19.Asserting that the man was provided oxygen and treatment, Telangana Health Minister Rajender on Monday described as "unfair campaign" on the social media showing government hospitals in poor light when thousands of patients were cured by them.When contacted, a hospital official said there was no deficiency in treatment and that the man in the video, died in spite of the treatment.He was admitted to the hospital on June 24 after testing positive for COVID-19 and oxygen was provided to him continuously, the official said on Sunday.He said the patient would continue to have breathlessness if issues related to heart were involved.The man died despite the required treatment, he said, adding sudden death can happen in such cases.Rajender lamented 'campaign' showing government hospitals in poor light, saying it would hurt the morale of the staff.I appeal that the morale of government hospitals and staff at government hospitals should not be hurt by highlighting isolated incidents of deaths of persons who already have different health problems or those whose condition turned acute for different reasons, while thousands are saved, he told reporters here.He said arrangements were being made to provide oxygen facility to 10,000 beds and there was no shortage of beds.He said internet and phone facility was provided to COVID-19 patients in isolation in hospitals so that they can remain in touch with their family members and it should not be misused.The patient in question came to the government hospital after visiting various hospitals and treatment was given to him by providing oxygen, he said.Senior Congress leader and former MP Ponnam Prabhakar said he has complained to the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) about the incident.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||China says concerned about India banning Chinese apps; TikTok claims ban provisional||The central government’s virtual strike of banning Chinese 59 apps has become another cause for disagreement after Beijing asked New Delhi to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors including Chinese ones.Reacting to India’s ban of the Chinese apps at a Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing here, spokesman Zhao Lijian said, “China is strongly concerned about the relevant notice issued by the Indian side. We are checking and verifying the situation.“I want to stress that the Chinese government always asks the Chinese businesses to abide by international rules, local laws and regulations in their business cooperation with foreign countries,” he said.“The Indian government has the responsibility to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors including the Chinese ones,” he added.While the Chinese Foreign Ministry withheld further comment till it had verified the facts, the embassy here cited four grounds for seeking a review of the Indian Government’s announcement on Monday banning 59 apps, including the popular TIkTok, on grounds of national security due to apprehensions of surreptitious data mining and its transfer to servers abroad.The ban order has been widely welcomed on social media while the app disappeared from Apple iOs and Google Playstore in India.The ban comes after a month-long campaign led by Hindutva organisations for blocking TikTok though national security was then not among their reasons.A TikTok India statement gave the impression that the ban was provisional and the IT Ministry has asked it to give “clarifications’’. TikTok’s India chief Nikhil Gandhi said the company will not share information with anyone, adding that “if we are requested, we would not do so”. It was banned on the same grounds of lack of data privacy and security in March last year but the ban was lifted after nine days.The ban comes at an inopportune time for TikTok’s Beijing-based ByteDance, which was planning a massive ramp up of operations in India, where revenues are still low. But in a bigger blow to China, the campaign against TikTok, including by US Senators, has come at a time when it was emerging as the first example of Chinese soft power in the form of a globally successful social network, with an appeal that extended to the Western world.Though the Chinese Foreign Ministry withheld any more comments, its mission here said the grounds for the banning of the 59 apps was  “ambiguous and far-fetched”, grated against the general trend of global trade and e-commerce and was not conducive to consumer interests and the market competition in India. The embassy was even concerned about the employment prospects of the Indian staff, the interests of Indian users and livelihood of creators and entrepreneurHowever, the response on social media in India did not match the Chinese embassy’s expectations as most users, including those in Punjab, opted to say  “bye-bye” and were transiting to other apps since the trigger for the ban is widely understood to be the deaths of Indian soldiers on June 15 and Chinese intransigence in stepping back from the LAC. However, some social media users pointed out that the central government gave no explanation for lifting the ban last year, nor did it respond to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s call to return all the money donated by Chinese companies to the PM Care’s Fund.

30-06-2020||United Nations||India accounts for 45.8 million of the world's 'missing females': UN report||India accounts for 45.8 million of the world's 142.6 million "missing females" over the past 50 years, a report by the United Nations said on Tuesday, noting that the country along with China formed the majority of such women globally.The State of World Population 2020 report released on Tuesday by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the world organisation's sexual and reproductive health agency, said the number of “missing women” had more than doubled over the past 50 years - from 61 million in 1970 to a cumulative 142.6 million in 2020.Of this global figure, India accounted for 45.8 million missing females as of 2020 and China accounted for 72.3 million.“Missing females” are women missing from the population at given dates due to the cumulative effect of postnatal and prenatal sex selection in the past, the agency said.“Between 2013 and 2017, about 460,000 girls in India were ‘missing' at birth each year. According to one analysis, gender-biased sex selection accounts for about two-thirds of the total missing girls, and post-birth female mortality accounts for about one-third,” the report said.Citing data by experts, it said China and India together accounted for about 90-95 per cent of the estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million missing female births annually worldwide due to gender-biased (prenatal) sex selection.The two countries also accounted for the largest number of births each year, it said.The report cites data by Alkema, Leontine and others, 2014 ‘National, Regional, and Global Sex Ratios of Infant, Child, and under-5 Mortality and Identification of Countries with Outlying Ratios: A Systematic Assessment' from The Lancet Global Health.According to their analysis, India has the highest rate of excess female deaths, 13.5 per 1,000 female births, which suggests that an estimated one in nine deaths of females below the age of 5 may be attributed to postnatal sex selection.The report notes that governments have also taken action to address the root causes of sex selection. India and Vietnam have included campaigns that target gender stereotypes to change attitudes and open the door to new norms and behaviours.“They spotlight the importance of daughters and highlight how girls and women have changed society for the better. Campaigns that celebrate women's progress and achievements may resonate more where daughter-only families can be shown to be prospering,” it said.The report said successful education-related interventions include the provision of cash transfers conditional on school attendance; or support to cover the costs of school fees, books, uniforms and supplies, taking note of successful cash-transfer initiatives such as ‘Apni Beti Apna Dhan' in India.It said that preference for a male child manifested in sex selection had led to dramatic, long-term shifts in the proportions of women and men in the populations of some countries.This demographic imbalance will have an inevitable impact on marriage systems. In countries where marriage is nearly universal, many men may need to delay or forego marriage because they will be unable to find a spouse, the report said.This so-called "marriage squeeze", where prospective grooms outnumber prospective brides, has already been observed in some countries and affects mostly young men from lower economic strata."At the same time, the marriage squeeze could result in more child marriages,” the report said citing experts.Some studies suggest that the marriage squeeze will peak in India in 2055. The proportion of men who are still single at the age of 50 is forecast to rise after 2050 in India to 10 per cent, it said.The UN report said that every year, millions of girls globally are subjected to practices that harm them physically and emotionally, with the full knowledge and consent of their families, friends and communities.At least 19 harmful practices, ranging from breast ironing to virginity testing, are considered human rights violations, according to the UNFPA report, which focuses on the three most prevalent ones: female genital mutilation, child marriage, and extreme bias against daughters in favour of sons.“Harmful practices against girls cause profound and lasting trauma, robbing them of their right to reach their full potential,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr Natalia Kanem.This year, an estimated 4.1 million girls will be subjected to female genital mutilation. Today, 33,000 girls under age 18 will be forced into marriages, usually to much older men and an extreme preference for sons over daughters in some countries has fuelled gender-biased sex selection or extreme neglect that leads to their death as children, resulting in the 140 million “missing females.”The report said that ending child marriage and female genital mutilation worldwide is possible within 10 years by scaling up efforts to keep girls in school longer and teach them life skills and to engage men and boys in social change.Investments totalling USD 3.4 billion a year through 2030 would end these two harmful practices and end the suffering of an estimated 84 million girls, it said.A recent analysis revealed that if services and programmes remain shuttered for six months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional 13 million girls may be forced into marriage and 2 million more girls may be subjected to female genital mutilation between now and 2030.“The pandemic both makes our job harder and more urgent as so many more girls are now at risk,” Kanem said.

30-06-2020||Guwahati||Gauhati HC grants divorce to man after woman refuses to wear 'sindoor', 'shaka'||The Gauhati High Court has granted divorce to a man, observing that the refusal to wear 'shaka' (conch shell bangle) and 'sindoor' (vermillion) as per customs by a Hindu married woman amounted to her refusal to accept the marriage.After hearing a matrimonial appeal filed by the husband, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Ajai Lamba and Justice Soumitra Saikia set aside an order of the family court which rejected his prayer for divorce on the grounds that no cruelty was found on the part of the wife against him.The man had appealed in the high court against the family court's order."Her refusal to wear 'sakha’ and ‘sindoor' will project her to be unmarried and/or signify her refusal to accept the marriage with the appellant (husband). Such categorical stand of the respondent (wife) points to the clear intention of the respondent that she is unwilling to continue her conjugal life with the appellant," the high court said in the judgment passed on June 19.The man and the woman had married on February 17, 2012, but they started fighting soon as she started demanding not to live along with his family members. As a consequence, the two have been living separately since June 30, 2013.She had lodged a police complaint against her husband and his family accusing them of torturing her, but the allegation of subjecting her to cruelty was not sustained, the bench said."Such acts of lodging criminal cases on unsubstantiated allegations against the husband and/or the husband's family amount to cruelty as held by the Supreme Court," they said in the order.The family court completely ignored the fact that the woman prevented her husband from performing his statutory duties towards his aged mother under the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, the judges said."Such evidence is sufficient to be construed as an act of cruelty," the order added.

30-06-2020||New Delhi||Blood banks can collect plasma only after treatment established: Centre||The Union Government on Tuesday said blood banks in the country could collect convalescent plasma from patients cured of coronavirus only after treatment efficacy of the plasma modality is firmly established.The Ministry of Health, in revised national guidelines related to blood transfusion services, said it would issue guidelines for convalescent plasma collection after the trial on plasma therapy is over and the treatment is approved by relevant authorities.The advisory is crucial as it comes amid growing demand for convalescent plasma—which is not currently proven to be a treatment for COVID-19.The ICMR Clinical Management Protocol for COVID allows plasma therapy as an experimental therapy in trial mode at select hospitals.The Drug Controller General of India has issued a detailed protocol on which COVID patient can be recruited for plasma therapy trial and how.Not everyone can take plasma therapy, Ministry sources said.The new guidelines by the government seek to caution gullible people who are frantically searching for plasma donors and are not aware of the modalities the treatment in India.A multicentric plasma therapy trial is underway in some Indian hospitals and results from the trial are yet to be published.The guidance reiterated that there was no current evidence of blood transfusion linked transmission of respiratory viruses.The guidance also asked blood banks to be ready with systems for plasma extraction should the trial results of the therapy be encouraging and should the government allow the use of this therapy as a treatment modality in India.Currently, plasma therapy remains an untested experimental therapy being tried on select recruited COVID patients who are hospitalised with poor respiratory parameters.Whether plasma helped these patients is yet to be known.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blood-banks-can-collect-plasma-only-after-treatment-established-centre-106571

He is ranked as India's oldest ICU survivor of Covid-19.Chhabra's 86-year old younger brother, Tara Singh, who was also infected, spent days in the ICU, and has now been shifted to the ward, awaiting discharge from the hospital in a couple of days.But for nearly a month, the senior Lahore-born Chhabra's entire family was practically on tenterhooks though Chhabra remained largely unaware of the potentially deadly infection afflicting him."On May 31, he tested positive. We downplayed it and requested him to get admitted to a hospital for proper care. He agreed without any fuss, so we didn't see any point in unnecessarily alarming him at his advanced age," his 39-year grandson Gurdeep K Chhabra told IANS.After his swabs tested positive, he was wheeled into the KMFT Hospital on June 2 as his sons and grandchildren prayed, while his young great-grandchildren waited for the great grandpa to return home to play with them.Tara Singh had come to visit the family briefly and lived with his elder brother, and hence both got infected and were admitted to the same hospital.Chhabra's month-long stay in hospital was mostly lonely and without the hustle-bustle of his large family, due to the Covid-19 protocols, but he braved it through remarkably well."He had a very tricky course, going uphill and coming downhill. He was twice in and out of the intensive care unit, required non-invasive ventilation, inotropic supports to maintain his heart and lung functions for moderate Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, along with Covid pneumonia," said KMFT's Head of Critical Care Medicine Amit Lala Khomane.A special team of doctors, comprising Khomane, Jayprakash Pednekar and Santosh Dwivedi, was assigned to treat Chhabra on the long road to recovery.However, they generously acknowledged that "it was the patient's own determination to fight out Covid-19 at this advanced age," which was very important."We as doctors left no stone unturned to make him and our other patients win the battle," said another doctor.Marvelling at Chhabra's "miraculous recovery", KMFT Trustees Amol Bhanushali and Sameep Sohoni decided to waive the treatment costs for Chhabra, said Shiv Sena Municipal Corporator Gurmukh Singh.After he was accorded a warm send-off with a resounding round of applause, the weary Chhabra returned to the comfort and safety of his home."Before lockdown, he was very active as usual. He even visited Gurdwara Shri Dashmesh Darbar, climbed the stairs independently, prayed, took 'prasad' at the langar and returned home," said Gurmukh Singh, also the president of the gurdwara.Gurdeep Singh Chhabra said his grandfather is quite weak and is on an intravenous semi-liquid diet for the next few days at his bungalow in Khopat locality of Thane."We are confident that he will soon bounce back to his active self after he starts savouring his favourite Punjabi vegetarian dishes that he has missed for weeks now," he laughed.Besides his younger brother Tara Singh, elder Chhabra has two sons, Kesar Singh, 68, Niranjan Singh, 58, several grandchildren and many great-grandchildren living nearby.

30-06-2020||Washington||Top US senators slam China’s ‘unwarranted armed’ aggression against India||Top US senators have expressed solidarity with India as they slammed China for its “unwarranted and lawless armed aggression” against the country.Top Republican Senator Marco Rubio on Monday spoke with India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu and expressed solidarity with the people of India on the Chinese aggression.“I spoke to Amb Sandhu to express our solidarity with the people of #India as they firmly confront unwarranted and lawless armed aggression by the Communist Party of China,” Rubio tweeted.“India has made it clear, they will not be bullied by Beijing,” the top Republican Senator from Florida said.On the Senate Floor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for the second time in less than a week, accused China of aggression against India.A day earlier, Senator Tom Cotton slammed China for its aggression against India.Today I spoke to @SandhuTaranjitS to express our solidarity with the people of #India as they firmly confront unwarranted & lawless armed aggression by the Communist Party of #China. India has made it clear,they will not be bullied by Beijing.  “China has resumed its submarine intrusions in the Japanese contiguous zones and picked deadly fights with India at high altitude,” the top Republican Senator from Arkansas said.“Just go around the horn. You started in India, where, high up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours. And they have killed 20 Indian soldiers,” Cotton told Fox News.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last several weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out the brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan.The two sides are holding diplomatic and military-level talks to ease the situation along the LAC. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-us-senators-slam-chinas-unwarranted-armed-aggression-against-india-106556
30-06-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally rises to 5.66 lakh; 66 per cent cases in June alone||As Unlock-2 begins from Wednesday, India’s COVID-19 tally climbed to 5,66,840 with nearly 66 per cases reported in June alone, and a concerned Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it is a cause of worry that people are not strictly adhering to rules and precautions as they did during the lockdown.From June 1, when relaxations were introduced under Unlock-1, the country has reported 3,76,305 cases. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Gujarat account for nearly two-third of the total cases till now.Speaking on the coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Modi, in his address to the nation on Tuesday, said India is in a better position compared to many countries of the world, as timely imposition of lockdown and other decisions have saved lakhs of lives.He, however, lamented that there is an increasing “negligence” in personal and social behaviour during the easing of restrictions and urged them to be more vigilant.“We have also seen that since ‘Unlock-1’, there is increasing negligence in personal and social behaviour. Earlier, we were very careful with respect to wearing of masks, social distancing and washing of hands for 20 seconds. But today, when we need to be more careful, increasing negligence is a cause of worry,” he said and urged the people to follow all necessary precautions.He emphasised on strict enforcement of rules, especially in containment zones.“Those not following the rules will need to be stopped and cautioned,” he said, stressing “be it a village pradhan or the prime minister, no one is above the law in India”.“As the country enters Unlock-2, we are also entering the season of increasing cases of cough, cold and fever. I, therefore, request all of you to take special care of yourselves,” he said.The prime minister also reviewed vaccine development efforts as well as India’s preparations for vaccinating its vast population once it is available and asserted that vaccination must be affordable and universal.With 18,522 people testing positive for coronavirus, it was the seventh day in a row that over 15,000 cases have been reported in the country. The death toll rose to 16,893 after 418 new fatalities.India is the fourth worst-affected country after the US, Brazil and Russia.The number of active cases stands at 2,15,125, while 3,34,821 people have recovered, and one patient has migrated, according to the updated data at 8 AM.“Thus, around 59.07 per cent of patients have recovered so far,” an official said.Maharashtra remained the highest contributor to the single day rise in cases, registering over 5,200 coronavirus infections, according to Union Health Ministry.Recording nearly 4,000 cases in the last 24 hours, Tamil Nadu has again surpassed Delhi to regain the second spot among the list of worst-hit states by the pandemic.Tamil Nadu Higher Education Minister KP Anbalagan has tested positive for coronavirus, according to hospital in Chennai. It said he is “very stable and all vital parameters are normal.” Karnataka also recorded more than 1,100 cases overtaking Haryana and Andhra Pradesh.Delhi saw an increase of 2,084 cases. The coronavirus recovery rate in the national capital reached 66.03 per cent on June 29.In June, the national capital added over 64,000 fresh cases to its tally, while over 47,357 patients recovered, were discharged or migrated.Maharashtra has reported the highest number of cases at 1,69,883, followed by Tamil Nadu at 86,224, Delhi at 85,161, Gujarat at 31,938, Uttar Pradesh at 22,828, West Bengal at 17,907 and Rajasthan at 17,660, according to the ministry data.The Union Health Ministry lauded the work of 1.6 lakh accredited health workers, ASHA, in tracking over 30.43 lakh migrants who returned to Uttar Pradesh during the COVID-19 lockdown and assisting the state government in contact tracing and community surveillance.The number of COVID-19 cases has gone up to 15,394 in Telangana, 14,295 in Karnataka, 14,210 in Haryana, 13,891 in Andhra Pradesh, and 13,370 in Madhya Pradesh.It has risen to 9,640 in Bihar, 7,752 in Assam, 7,237 in Jammu and Kashmir and 6,859 in Odisha. Punjab has reported 5,418 coronavirus infections so far, while Kerala has 4,189 cases.A total of 2,831 people have been infected by the virus in Uttarakhand, 2,761 in Chhattisgarh, 2,426 in Jharkhand, 1,380 in Tripura, 1,227 in Manipur, 1,198 in Goa, 964 in Ladakh and 942 in Himachal Pradesh.The Tripura government said it is not thinking of extending the coronavirus lockdown as the situation in the state is “stable”.“Even though the lockdown has been extended in three northeast states—Assam, Manipur and Meghalaya—we are not thinking on that line now. Our condition is stable and our frontline workers are doing a commendable job,” Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath said on Tuesday.Arunachal Pradesh reported 187 cases, Mizoram has 148 cases, Andaman and Nicobar Islands has 90, Sikkim has registered 88 infections so far, while Meghalaya has recorded 47 cases.The government on Monday issued guidelines for the month-long ‘Unlock 2’ beginning July 1,  during which more domestic flights and passenger trains will be allowed in a calibrated manner, but educational institutions, Metro Rail services, cinema halls and gyms will remain shut.Night curfew shall remain in force between 10 pm and 5 am, except for essential activities.Meanwhile, a special Air India flight carrying 144 Indian students, who were stranded in Ukraine due to the coronavirus-induced restrictions, landed at the Indore airport in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday morning, an official said.

There was no official communication from Google or Apple on its removal from their respective stores.ByteDance-owned TikTok said that it places the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.“TikTok has democratized the internet by making it available in 14 Indian languages, with hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers depending on it for their livelihood, many of whom are first-time internet users,” said Gandhi.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) on Monday issued a list of 59 Chinese apps that are now banned in the country.“These measures have been undertaken since there is credible information that these apps are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order,” said a MeitY statement.The ministry received complaints from various sources including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India.The MeitY said the move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile users.Other Chinese apps in the banned list are Club Factory, SHAREit, Likee, Mi Video Call (Xiaomi), Weibo, Baidu, Bigo Live and others.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-comply-with-india-ban-not-sharing-users-data-with-china-tiktok-106542

UP, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Karnataka blended closer to the Indian target of 2021 — between 8.5% and 9.8% — according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).Of the supply contracts of 170 crore litres (between ethanol manufacturers/sugar mills and oil marketing companies) for 2019-20, as much as 92.5 crore litres have been supplied between December 1, 2019, and June 22, 2020, achieving an average all India blending of 5.09%, the sugar association said.India has a target to achieve 10% blending of ethanol in vehicle fuel by 2021.Despite a lesser production, Punjab and Haryana are being able to blend more ethanol because of supplies from UP, said ISMA.Meanwhile, due to better water availability and increased acreage under sugarcane cultivation, ethanol production is expected to increase to 375-400 crore litres in 2020-21, more than double (170 crore litres) than what sugar mills and distilleries committed to supply for the ethanol blending programme (EBP) this season.The government is hoping to achieve 7.5-8% blending levels in the season commencing from December 2020.With a Covid air quality report showing pollution levels falling to dramatic levels in 10 major cities across the world, including Delhi and Mumbai, during the lockdown, experts have been  pitching for achieving the target of 10% blending of biofuel ethanol for vehicular fuel faster.As per the National Biofuels Policy, 2018, the Government intends to achieve ethanol blend levels of 10% by 2022 and 20% by 2030. Efforts are being made to achieve the targets with the Government giving huge importance to the EBP emphasising the need to encourage more production, especially from B-molasses and cane juice, to serve the twin purposes of achieving the target level as well as reducing more surplus sugar production, said ISMA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blending%C2%A0of-ethanol-in-petrol-in%C2%A0haryana-punjab-much-higher-than-india-average-106541

The induction of assets like C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Super Hercules and CH-47 Chinook over the past few years has enormously enhanced the IAF’s ability to ferry troops and equipment.With no immediate signs of de-escalation, IAF sorties to the Himalayan frontier continue unabated, bringing in military equipment and supplies. The most significant aspect of the air effort, perhaps, is airlifting of India’s newest and most powerful tank, the T-90, which now spearhead the Army’s strike formations, from the plains to Ladakh.Airlifting the T-90 was possible due to the payload capacity of C-17. A T-90 weighs about 46 tonnes, which is more than the capacity of the IL-76, which can airlift about 45 tonnes, says an IAF officer. Another six IL-78 midair refueling tankers based at Agra, which are same as IL-76, can also be used in the conventional transport role. The IAF’s workhorse is 104 AN-32 medium lift aircraft.The Army had three regiments of the older T-72 tanks, which weigh around 40 tonne, deployed in this sector. Many of these tanks, along with BMP-2 mechanised combat vehicles, have been airlifted to Ladakh by IL-76 since 1990s. Given the weight and length of the tractor-trailer, it is not practical to negotiate the high mountain passes, hairpin bends and narrow stretches that lie on the road link from the mainland to Ladakh. Terror alert in J&K, Delhi and BiharNew Delhi: Amid continuing India-China border tension and recent firing by Nepal Police along borders in Bihar, intelligence agencies have sounded an alert of possible terror attacks in J&K, Delhi and Bihar.

A number of foreigners were blacklisted for 10 years for their alleged involvement in Tablighi activities.A Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar posted the petitions filed by foreign nationals for hearing on July 2. The Bench said if visas of the foreign nationals were cancelled then the government should explain why they were still in India. But if their visas were not cancelled, it’s a different situation, it added.On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate CU Singh said blacklisting note was a general order for over 900 foreign nationals. Noting that the MHA notification said the decision had to be taken on case-to-case basis, the Bench sought to know if such orders were passed and served on the foreigners in question. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/clarify-visa-status-of-foreign-tablighis-sc-tells-centre-106416

However, many go beyond the declared norms and dictate their own terms.A senior functionary of the United RWA Joint Action — an umbrella body of more than 2,000 housing associations in Ghaziabad, said the government should come up with specific guidelines for RWAs as well so that arbitrariness could be avoided. “In this regard, welcome reports have come from Maharashtra, where district administrations warned housing societies that action will be taken against them if they bar delivery of newspapers and domestic helps are not allowed to enter,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/call-for-norms-as-rwas-ban-entry-of-vendors-maids-106414

So far, there has been very slow progress and the physical separation has been partially met at just two points along the 826-km-long LAC, sources said. At several other places, gun-toting troops remain within firing range of each other.A minimum distance, based on geographical features of the mountains, had been specified and agreed upon at the June 22 meeting. Since there is no demarcation of the LAC on the ground, the specified distance was to be such that troops of either side remained at least 2.5 to 3 km apart. The present friction is also because the PLA pulled back a bit and then returned to build up again at certain areas, including the Galwan valley and Hot Springs, which The Tribune had reported in its edition dated June 25.Also read: Enhanced airlift capability key to India’s LAC buildupKeeping physical distance is part of the targeted “baby steps” as both the nuclear-armed neighbours have amassed huge inventories of heavy weapons, artillery, tanks and fighter jets. Rolling back all these would be a long-drawn “mutual disengagement” process along the LAC.Physical distance was specified to ensure that no Galwan-type clash would take place again. In a deadly clash on the night of June 15, 20 Indian troops were killed in action while an unspecified number of PLA men were killed. China has also moved in massive air defence equipment along the LAC to counter Indian missiles, drones, fighter jets and other airborne platforms. Indian strength is adequate in Ladakh, matching China’s with guns, tanks and airborne platforms.The meeting tomorrow will be at Chushul, the designated meeting point on the Indian side. So far, both meetings (on June 6 and June 22) have been conducted on the Chinese side at Moldo.

When I talk to the minister incharge, he tells me that he does not have any officer or received a single file connected to the ministry,” she said.She said since it was a Centrally sponsored scheme, the onus to push through the projects was on respective states.“The Centre has sanctioned three mega food parks in Punjab. The Ladowal food park is the only among 40 mega food parks where units have become functional, but the Punjab Government has not been able to ensure the functioning of cold storage and electricity supply,” she added.“I can keep giving grants and sanctioning projects, but unless the state comes forward we cannot achieve the optimum,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/food-processing-scheme-to-generate-9l-jobs-government-106350
