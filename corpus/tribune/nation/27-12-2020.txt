27-12-2020||Pune||For Ramdas Athawale, ‘Go Corona Go’ is passe; it is ‘No Corona’ now||Union Minister Ramdas Athawale, whose ‘Go Corona, Go’ chant became a national sensation, on Sunday came out with a new slogan, ‘No Corona’, saying it was in response to the new strain of the novel coronavirus.“I gave the ‘Go Corona Go’ slogan and the virus is now going. But it also came near me, leading to my hospitalisation (after testing COVID-19 positive). I thought coronavirus would not reach me but it can reach anywhere,” Athawale said.“For the new coronavirus strain, I would say ‘No Corona, No Corona’ as we don’t want either the old coronavirus or the new strain to infect us,” he told reporters in Pune.Athawale was discharged from a private hospital in Mumbai last month, 10 days after testing coronavirus positive.In February, a video of Athawale, along with a Chinese diplomat and Buddhist monks chanting “Go corona, go corona” at a prayer meeting went viral on social media.The video was reportedly shot at the Gateway of India here on February 20 during a prayer session to stop the spread of coronavirus in China.Athawale (60) is a member of the Rajya Sabha and minister of state for social justice in the Narendra Modi-led government.“I will be meeting BJP president J P Nadda to discuss a possible alliance for West Bengal Assembly elections,” he said. “We expect (BJP to set aside for us) around 10 seats,” he added.

It is not a good sign for alliance politics,” Tyagi told reporters.“The partners should follow the ‘alliance politics’ as was practiced during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure or being followed in Bihar for the past 15 years.“The coalition partners should follow ‘Atal Dharma’ while running alliance government, Tyagi said.He pointed to the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee successfully ran a coalition government of 23 partners where there were no contradictions among them (allies).He was sharing information about the decisions taken at partys national executive and national council meeting held at Karpoori Thakur Sabhagar at partys state headquarters here.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha member Ramchandra Prasad Singh better known by the initial RCP Singh, a close confidant of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, was on Sunday chosen as the new president of JD(U).Kumar had proposed the name of Singh for the top post, which was then approved by other members during the party’s national executive and national council meeting.Stating that party leader had told home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda that they would not find an opposition who could create any sort of trouble for the government and hence they may be included in the Arunachal cabinet, Tyagi said “instead of accommodating them (JDU MLAs) into the cabinet, they (BJP) included them in their party”.“This is against the basic spirit of alliance government”, he said while suggesting that “love and brotherhood should be the base of alliance.Asked whether the party would apprise the BJP leadership of its displeasure, he said the displeasure will be communicated through media to them.Referring to Nitish Kumar’s speech delivered at the party’s meeting, Tyagi said Kumar did not want to become the CM after the assembly results were declared, the decision which he (Kumar) had conveyed to both his party and ally BJP.Stating that those who raise the issue of strength of numbers, the JD(U) leader asserted that Nitish Kumar is man known for his “credibility” and not for “numbers”.“Neither his credibility is affected at all nor partys vote share has gone down in the recently concluded Bihar polls”, Tyagi said while adding that Nitish Kumar would give more time to other states.In reply to a query, Tyagi said that party would contest West Bengal assembly polls.When pressed further about the number of seats that the party will be contesting, he said that decision will be taken in a day or two in consultation with party’s state incharge and state president.The party has also asked all its district president and candidates who fought Bihar assembly polls to find out the reasons, persons and groups responsible for the defeat of the nominees, Tyagi said.In reply to a query, JD(U) leader said Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) was neither the part of NDA in Bihar nor at the Centre.LJP had worked against the JD(U) in Bihar elections despite being an alliance partner of the NDA at the centre.Whether the party would join union cabinet, Tyagi said that the party would consider joining the cabinet if it gets a “proportionate representation”, the issue which the party has already made it clear in the past.

This is the third summons issued to her after she skipped the earlier two on health grounds, they said.The summons for questioning has been issued to her under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The ED wants to question Varsha Raut with regard to “receipt” of some funds that were allegedly siphoned from the bank, official sources claimed.The ED had filed a PMLA case to probe the alleged loan fraud in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank in October last year against the Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), its promoters Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan and his son Sarang Wadhawan, its former chairman Waryam Singh and ex-managing director Joy Thomas.The agency took cognisance of a Mumbai Police Economic Offences Wing FIR against them for allegedly causing “wrongful loss, prima facie to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore to PMC Bank, and corresponding gains to themselves”.The Shiv Sena, which is part of Maharashtra’s ruling alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) along with the NCP and the Congress, had earlier alleged that central probe agencies have been targeting them unfairly.Former BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who recently joined Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has also been summoned by the ED for questioning on December 30 in Mumbai in connection with a money laundering case linked to a land deal in Pune’s Bhosri area. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pmc-bank-money-laundering-case-ed-summons-sanjay-rauts-wife-for-questioning-on-december-29-190189

Today you are opposing what you were advocating yesterday. You have no concerns for national good or the good of farmers. Your interesting is in playing politics. But your hypocrisy won’t work now. The farmers and the people know your double standards,” Nadda said.Responding to the tweet, Congress media chief Randeep Surjewala said: “Mr Nadda, before misleading, you should have known there’s no MSP on potatoes. We are farm reforms but the current laws attack the livelihoods of farmers. That’s the question. And also tell us why are you importing ten lakh tonnes of potatoes from abroad while ignoring your own local farmers?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-leaves-for-italy-amid-farm-laws-debate-190188

27-12-2020||New Delhi||I appeal with folded hands to Centre to repeal farm laws: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to the Centre to repeal the new farm laws and said farmers are protesting for their survival.In his second visit to the Singhu border, where thousands of farmers have been protesting against the laws since November last week, Kejriwal said: “I challenge any Union Minister to have an open debate with the farmers and it will be clear how harmful these laws are.”The Chief Minister had first visited Singhu on the Delhi-Haryana border on December 7.“More than 40 people have lost their lives here. Today, through this platform, and at such a sacred place, I want to appeal to the central government with folded hands to repeal these farm laws. These are our people, our brothers, sisters, mothers and elders. These are the people of our nation, listen to them, and end their struggle here. How many lives will you take?” he said.Kejriwal, who is also the Aam Aadmi Party’s national convener, claimed that through these laws, corporates would take over the country’s farming sector.“What will the farmers do if you take farming away from them? The farmers who are sitting on the borders today with their elders and children are sitting here for their survival. If the big companies take over farming, the farmers will be left with nothing,” he said.Kejriwal said ministers, big leaders and some Chief Ministers had been speaking in support of these laws.“I heard all their speeches but I have not heard even a single leader talking about how these farm laws benefit farmers,” he said.The Chief Minister said these big leaders, while counting the benefits of these farm laws, first said land would not be taken away from the farmers. “Is this a benefit?” he asked.“Then they say MSP and the mandis of the farmers will not be revoked, is this a benefit? Why have you brought the laws then? Instead of telling the benefits, they are justifying that these laws are no harm to the farmers. Who will benefit then?” he asked.Kejriwal claimed that the only benefit the Centre told is farmers would be able to sell their produce anywhere in the country outside of mandis.“If a crop is being sold at Rs 800 per quintal in Bihar where there are no mandis, and the MSP is Rs 1,850 per quintal where do our farmers from Bihar and UP sell their produce for more than Rs 1,850? They cannot even get 50 per cent of the price outside of mandis. This is not a benefit to the farmers but to the big companies and the rich,” he said.Kejriwal said the whole country is divided — one side wants to benefit the rich by harming farmers, and the second is standing with farmers without caring for the rich.“They are also playing blame games by saying that the farmers are being misled. I want to challenge the Centre to send in their experts on these farm laws and have a public debate with the leaders of the farmer unions. They say that the farmers do not fully know about these laws, the public debate will show how much they know,” he said.Kejriwal said a debate between a central minister, who is an expert on these laws, and farmer leaders would clear everything, and the whole nation would get to know how dangerous these farm laws were.“I want to appeal to the Central government to not let any more farmers sacrifice their lives. This is a fight for their survival. The Central government should repeal these farm laws as soon as possible, guarantee MSP in the law, and end the struggle of the farmers,” he added.Kejriwal was accompanied by his Deputy, Manish Sisodia.“Farmers are protesting for their survival. These laws will snatch away farming from farmers. I appeal with folded hands to the Centre to please repeal the three agri laws,” he said.Sisodia told the protesting farmers: “We are closely watching all the arrangements and we are ensuring that the pain you (farmers) endure is minimum.”Kejriwal joined the ‘Safar-e-Shahadat’ Kirtan Darbaar organised by the Delhi government at the Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial at the Singhu border.During his first visit, Kejriwal had checked the arrangements made for farmers by the Delhi government.Kejriwal and his party AAP have strongly come out in favour of the farmers protesting against the new agri laws.Besides Singhu, farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are also protesting at various other border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-appeal-with-folded-hands-to-centre-to-repeal-farm-laws-kejriwal-190179
27-12-2020||New Delhi||Nadda posts Rahul’s old speech to take swipe at him; Cong hits back||BJP president J P Nadda on Sunday shared an old video of Rahul Gandhi's speech in Lok Sabha in which he seems to be advocating the need for farmers to get rid of middlemen and sell their produce directly to industry, as he accused the Congress leader of playing politics over the ongoing farmers' protest.The Congress hit back at the BJP president, alleging that he was trying to mislead the farmers."What is this magic happening Rahul ji. You are opposing now what you had advocated earlier. You have nothing to do with the country's or farmers' interests. You have to play politics only. But this is your bad luck that your hypocrisy will not work. People of the country and farmers have recognised your double standards," Nadda tweeted in Hindi along with the video clip.ये क्या जादू हो रहा है राहुल जी?पहले आप जिस चीज़ की वकालत कर रहे थे, अब उसका ही विरोध कर रहे है।देश हित, किसान हित से आपका कुछ लेना-देना नही है।आपको सिर्फ़ राजनीति करनी है।लेकिन आपका दुर्भाग्य है कि अब आपका पाखंड नही चलेगा। देश की जनता और किसान आपका दोहरा चरित्र जान चुके है। pic.twitter.com/Uu2mDfBuIT  The Congress has backed the farmers' protest against three agriculture-marketing laws which give cultivators an option to sell their produce directly to private players.Agitating farmers have argued that these laws are aimed at weakening the existing government's support for the farm sector, a charge denied by the Centre.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that before targeting Gandhi, the BJP chief should have known there is no MSP on potatoes and asked him why the government had to import potatoes when there is enough within the country.मा. नड्डा जी,बरगलाने से पहले ये तो जान लेते कि आलू का MSP नही होता।और...कृषि क्षेत्र में सुधार हम भी चाहते हैं पर तीन काले क़ानूनों से किसान के जीवन पर जो हमला किया है, सवाल उस का है।हाँ, ये भी बताएँ कि देश के किसान को छोड़ आप 10 लाख टन आलू विदेश से क्यों आयात कर रहे हैं? https://t.co/thcFGnqAhI  "Dear Nadda ji, before misleading the farmers, you should have known that there is no MSP on potatoes. And...we also want reforms in the agriculture sector, but the question here is the way the life of farmers has been attacked with the three black laws," he said in a tweet in Hindi."You should also tell why you are importing one million tonnes of potatoes from abroad while leaving the country's farmers," he said, replying to Nadda's tweet.In his speech, apparently made in the last Lok Sabha when he was an MP from Amethi, Gandhi is heard saying that a farmer during his trip to Uttar Pradesh asked him to explain the "magic" behind a packet of potato chips costing Rs 10 while farmers sell potato for Rs 2 per kg.When he asked what they thought was the reason for this, the farmer said factories are located very far from them and if they could sell their produce directly there, they will get all the money without middlemen earning any cut, Gandhi is heard saying in the short video posted by Nadda.That was the idea behind a food park, and this is in a way what farmers and labourers of Amethi and 10-12 districts of Uttar Pradesh have been fighting for, he says in the clip.Gandhi had accused the Modi government during its first term of shelving the food park project in Amethi.The government had denied the charge and said the park never had land.

27-12-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi to flag off first driverless train on Magenta Line of Delhi Metro on Monday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will flag off the country’s first ever fully-automated driverless train service on the Magenta Line of the Delhi Metro on Monday that will herald a new era of enhanced mobility driven by cutting-edge technology.With the commencement of these new-generation trains, the DMRC will enter the elite league of “seven per cent of world’s Metro networks” which can operate services without drivers, the Delhi Metro said on Sunday.After starting driverless services on the 37-km Magenta Line (Janakpuri West–Botanical Garden), another major corridor of the Delhi Metro, 57-km Pink Line (Majlis Park–Shiv Vihar) will also have driverless operations by mid-2021, the DMRC said in a statement.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to inaugurate India’s first ever driverless train operations on the Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line (Janakpuri West–Botanical Garden) as well as the fully operational National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) services on the Airport Express Line via video conferencing tomorrow, scheduled at 11 am,” it said.These innovations are going to herald a new era of travelling comfort and enhanced mobility for the residents of Delhi and other cities in the National Capital Region.The commercial operation of these new-generation trains, set to be a major technological feat, will begin later the same day, after the event, a senior Delhi Metro official said.“The driverless trains will be fully automated which will require minimum human intervention and will eliminate the possibilities of human errors. Delhi Metro has been a pioneer in introducing technology driven solutions for passenger comfort and this is another step in the same direction,” the statement said.Once the driverless trains are operationalised on the Pink Link too, the Delhi Metro will have a driverless network length of about 94 km which will be approximately nine percent of the world’s total driverless metro network, it added.After the launch, also it will be the first time when commuters will be able to use the NCMC on any corridor of the Delhi Metro.Prime Minister Modi in March 2019 had launched the indigenously-developed NCMC to enable people to pay multiple kinds of transport charges, including using metro and bus services across the country.Dubbed as ‘One Nation One Card’, the inter-operable transport card allows the holders to also pay for their bus travel, toll taxes, parking charges, retail shopping and even withdraw money.The NCMC, which will be fully operationalised on the Airport Line will also be a major milestone as anyone carrying a RuPay-Debit Card issued in the last 18 months by 23 banks (all these are NCMC compliant as per directions of the Department of Financial Services, Government of India), from any part of the country will be able to travel on this line using that card, the Delhi Metro said.The same facility will become available on the entire Delhi Metro network by 2022, it added.This is the first major event of Delhi Metro in 2020 which saw an unprecedented lockdown in the earlier months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Delhi Metro had resumed services with curtailed operation on the Yellow Line from September 7 after being closed for over five months. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-flag-off-first-driverless-train-on-magenta-line-of-delhi-metro-on-monday-190175
27-12-2020||New Delhi||Mercury below 5 degree C at many places in north India||Several places in north India, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, recorded their minimum temperature below the five-degree Celsius mark on Sunday, with the India Meteorological Department forecasting severe cold wave in parts of the region later this week and warning of dense fog.Though the mercury rose slightly in Delhi due to a Western Disturbance, the department said the relief would be short-lived as cold and dry northerly and northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas are likely to bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius.“Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan from December 28-29. Ground frost and dense fog are likely in isolated pockets in the region,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Gurdaspur in Punjab and Churk in east Uttar Pradesh recorded lows of 2 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius respectively, while cold wave intensified in Kashmir with minimum temperatures dropping across the region to stay several notches below the freezing point.Gulmarg in north Kashmir recorded a low of minus 7.2 degrees Celsius, Qazigund minus five degrees Celsius, Kupwara minus 4.8 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, in the south, recorded minus 4.9 degrees Celsius, according to the meteorological (MeT) department in Srinagar.“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh; scattered rainfall/snowfall over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and isolated rain/thundershowers over northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on 27-28 December,” the IMD said in its all-India weather bulletin.The minimum temperature in Delhi rose slightly under the influence of the Western Disturbance (WD) affecting the upper Himalayas, according to the IMD.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6 degrees Celsius as against 4.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday.However, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the relief would be short-lived.The WD will lead to “scattered to fairly widespread” snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“Once the wind system withdraws, cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely to occur in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan from December 28-29,” it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.Biting cold conditions continued to prevail in Haryana and Punjab, with Gurdaspur recording a minimum temperature of 2 degrees Celsius.While Gurdaspur was the coldest place in Punjab, Narnaul was the coldest at 3.3 degrees Celsius in Haryana, the MeT department in Chandigarh said.In Haryana, Karnal, Rohtak, Ambala and Hisar recorded respective minimums of 3.8 degrees Celsius, 5.4 degrees Celsius, 4.6 degrees Celsius and 5.8 degrees Celsius.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, registered a low of 4.1 degrees Celsius.In Punjab, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala recorded respective minimums of 4.8 degrees Celsius, 4.2 degrees Celsius and 3.9 degrees Celsius.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’, the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the famous Dal Lake, as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.“The weather has remained dry and cold across Kashmir since the snowfall on December 12, with the night temperature staying several degrees below the freezing point,” the MeT Department said.It has forecast light rain or snow in the Kashmir Valley over the next three days.The officials said Srinagar — the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir — recorded a low of minus 5.2 degrees Celsius – down from the previous night’s minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.They said the mercury in Pahalgam tourist destination in south Kashmir settled at minus 5.9 degrees Celsius, up more than a notch compared to the previous night’s low of minus 4.5 degrees Celsius.The chances of snowfall are most frequent and maximum during the 40-day period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall, the officials said.While ‘Chillai-Kalan’, which began on December 21, will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).Himachal Pradesh’s Keylong, Kalpa, Manali, Mandi, Solan, Sundernagar and Bhuntar shivered at sub-zero temperatures.Keylong was the coldest place in the state at minus 11.6 degrees Celsius, MeT Centre, Shimla, Director Manmohan Singh said.Kalpa in Kinnaur district and Manali in Kullu district recorded lows of minus 3.4 and minus 0.6 degree Celsius, he added.Besides Mandi, Bhuntar, Sundernagar and Solan recorded lows of minus 2, minus 1.6, minus 1.2 and minus 0.5 degrees Celsius respectively. Dalhousie and Kufri recorded lows of 2.9 and 3.6 degrees Celsius, respectively.In Uttar Pradesh, cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places, while some places witnessed dense to very dense fog, the MeT department in Lucknow said.The weather in the state was dry, it said.State capital Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 5.9 degrees Celsius, Allahabad 7.2 degrees Celsius, Kanpur 5.8 degrees Celsius, Bareilly 4.3 degrees Celsius and Fursatganj 3.1 degrees Celsius.Mount Abu, the only hill station of Rajasthan, was recorded the coldest place in the state at 2 degrees Celsius even as several places saw an increase of two-three notches in night temperatures.In the plains, Sriganganagar, Alwar and Sawai Madhopur recorded 6.2, 7.2 and 7.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday night.“Madhya Pradesh, especially its western region, is likely to experience cold wave conditions for the second time this month from December 29,” an IMD official said.Large parts of the state had witnessed biting cold conditions last week. However, the chill had subsided slightly and the minimum temperature had increased to some extent over the last few days.“Cold wave conditions are likely to prevail in Madhya Pradesh, especially its western part, for the second time this month from Tuesday. These conditions may continue for the next three to four days after that,” PK Saha, a senior meteorologist with IMD’s Bhopal office, said.“The westerly disturbance has caused snowfall in northern India. This is going to bring chilly winds to Madhya Pradesh by Tuesday. But the cold wave conditions are not expected to last long in the state,” he said.Extreme cold wave conditions are unlikely next week, he said.

27-12-2020||Kolkata||Farmers’ issue: 10 political prisoners start fasting in Kolkata||Extending solidarity to the farmers’ protest demanding repeal of the three new farm laws, at least 10 political prisoners of a correctional home here started a hunger strike on Sunday.In a statement released from the Dumdum Central Jail, the protesters described the laws as anti-farmer and alleged that the BJP-led Central government passed the agri laws taking advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation.They also hit out at the BJP-led central government claiming that the laws will actually benefit corporates.Sources in the state correctional department said eight other political prisoners lodged in Berhampur Central Jail in Murshidabad district will start fasting from Monday on the same issue.Thousands of farmers have been camping at three Delhi border points—Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—for nearly a month, demanding repeal of three agri laws enacted in September and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).While the government has presented these laws as major reforms aimed at helping farmers, protesting unions have maintained these Acts will leave them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the mandi and MSP system.

We celebrate ‘Sahibzada Diwas’ on December 27 but I feel that this day is actually ‘Children’s Day’, as the Sahibzadas made the supreme sacrifice at such a tender age,” he said.“The day should be celebrated at schools as a festival and debates and various programmes must be held as a mark of respect to the Sahibzadas which, in turn, will inspire children. December was known for Christmas, now it will be known for ‘Sahibzada Diwas’,” he said.The Chief Minister said, “The state government is identifying all the places related to Guru Nanak Dev and the beautification work is being carried out on priority.”Speaking at the occasion, Parvinder Singh, the member of State Minority Commission, said, “It is for the first time that ‘Sahibzada Diwas’ is being celebrated at the residence of the Chief Minister which used to host only Iftar parties in the past.” Adityanath wore traditional Sikh attire, including a saffron turban, on the occasion.

The total solar eclipse on December 4, the last of 2021, will, however, not be visible from India,” he added.This year, there were two solar and four lunar eclipses. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-eclipses-in-2021-two-to-be-visible-in-india-190157
27-12-2020||Chandigarh||Protesting farmers clang ‘thalis’, ask PM Modi to listen to their ‘Mann ki Baat’ too||Farmers on Sunday beat “thalis” at a few places in Punjab and Haryana during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme as part of their protest against the Centre’s new agri laws.While addressing a press conference on December 20 at Delhi’s Singhu border, farmer leaders had asked people protesting against the laws to beat utensils during the programme, the same way the prime minister had asked them in March to beat ‘thalis’ (steel plates).Modi had asked people to express gratitude towards those at the forefront of combating the coronavirus and extending essential services by giving a five-minute standing ovation by clapping, beating plates or ringing bells.Farmers beat “thalis” during protests at Amritsar, Ferozepur, Sangrur, Talwandi Sabo, Bathinda, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts in Punjab and Rohtak and Jind districts in Haryana, among other places in the two states.“The common people too are with farmers in their agitation against the farm laws,” said a protester in Amritsar as he beat a “thali” with a spoon and raised “Jai Kisan” slogan.At many places, farmers, who were joined by people from other sections of society, raised slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre.Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni went to the Makrauli toll plaza in Rohtak district along with a group of farmers to protest against the legislations.They beat ‘thalis’ with shoes during the prime minister’s monthly radio broadcast.“We are here to oppose Modi’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’. We are registering this protest because the prime minister only says what he has to without listening to the voice of the people,” Chaduni said during the protest.He said feedback has been received from protesting farmers that toll collection on highways in Haryana should be halted till the Centre accepts the demands of the agitating farmers.Read also: Remember sacrifices of Sikh Gurus, says Modi as farmer protests show no signs of waningPM, ministers should sleep on floor till farmers out in cold: BittuThousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting against the laws since the last week of November at various border points of Delhi and demanding that the legislations be repealed.“We went to many toll barriers and farmers who are protesting there said no toll should be charged from people till the government accepts our demands,” the BKU leader said.Intensifying their agitation against the Centre’s new agri laws, farmers on December 20 had also announced that they will halt toll collection on highways in Haryana from December 25 to 27.“From December 25 to 27 all toll booths in Haryana will not be allowed by us to collect toll, we will halt them from doing so. On December 27, our prime minister will say his ‘Mann ki baat’ and we want to appeal to the people to beat ‘thalis’ during his address, the same way the PM had asked the country to bang utensils for coronavirus,” BKU leader Jagjeet Singh Dalewala had said at the press conference.When the prime minister will speak, “we appeal to the people of the entire country to bang utensils in your houses throughout the duration of his programme to drown out his Mann Ki Baat”, he had said.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protesting-farmers-clang-thalis-ask-pm-modi-to-listen-to-their-mann-ki-baat-too-190155
27-12-2020||Patna||Bureaucrat-turned-politician RCP Singh becomes new JD(U) president||Bureaucrat-turned-politician Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, better known by his initials RCP, owes his rise to become the president of the Janata Dal (United) to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.Singh, a close confidant of Kumar, was on Sunday chosen as the new president of the JD(U).At the party’s national executive meeting, Kumar proposed the name of Singh for the top post and it was then approved by other members.The chief minister, who was re-elected as the JD(U) president in 2019 for three years, gave up the post in favour of Singh, its leader in the Rajya Sabha.The man who prefers to keep a low profile was so far the general secretary (organisation) of the regional party.The 1984-batch IAS officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre has been with Kumar since his stint as the Railway minister in the government led by late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.When Kumar returned to the Bihar politics becoming chief minister in November 2005, Singh too came to his native state and became Principal Secretary to the CM.Months before retirement from service, he quit the job and joined politics in 2010. Kumar soon made him a member of the Rajya Sabha and he continues to be part of the Upper House of Parliament.A man of a few words, Singh loves to stay in the shadow of his master (Kumar) with whom he shares not only the Kurmi caste affiliation but also close personal bondage.With the JD(U) passing through hard times losing its “elder brother” status to the BJP in the NDA in Bihar after not faring well in the recently concluded assembly election, the task is cut out for the 62-year-old Singh to strengthen the organisation as well as deal astutely with the saffron party.The JD(U) could win only 43 seats in the Bihar polls, down from 71 in the last elections held in 2015. The BJP, on the other hand, bagged 74 seats to help the NDA retain power in the state.The saffron party kept its promise of making Kumar a chief minister irrespective of numbers scored by the partner parties, but Kumar lost the sheen which he enjoyed in the ruling coalition since the Vajpayee-LK Advani era.The exodus of six of the seven JD(U) MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh to the BJP and the upcoming polls in neighbouring West Bengal are immediate challenges for the new JD(U) president.Polls in West Bengal, which is due in April-May next year, also came up for discussion at the national executive meeting.Born on July 6, 1958, at Mustafapur in Nalanda district, Singh did his schooling from a School at Hussainpur in the same district.He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from Patna College and did Master of Arts from Jawaharlal Nehru University.Singh married Girija Singh on 21 May 1982, and they have two daughters. One of his daughters, Lipi Singh, is a 2016-batch IPS officer.She had hit the national headlines when the police opened fire on a group of people going for immersion of goddess Durga idol in Munger district in October. In the face of raging protests over the event, she was removed as the district SP on the order of the Election Commission.

A total of 21 chain-snatchings were reported this year compared to 56 last year,” he said.Similarly, the number of rape cases stood at 152 compared to 163 such cases last year, he added.He said the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) 2019 data showed a high crime rate in Nagpur per one lakh population.“However, the NCRB had based its data taking into consideration the population of 25 lakh, but the population exceeds 30 lakh if (areas under) police stations from rural Nagpur are counted,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-to-recruit-5-295-police-constables-soon-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-190152

27-12-2020||Chennai||AIADMK says it is big brother in TN, asks BJP to fall in line or rework its 2021 poll options||In its first poll rally here, the ruling AIADMK on Sunday bluntly told ally BJP that it could not make a dent in Tamil Nadu and ruled out accommodating the saffron party in the government if it won the assembly elections, due next year, and retained power.The BJP has to endorse Chief Minister K Palaniswami’s candidature for the CM’s post for the polls and agree to its other terms — like non-participation in government — and if not, should rethink of its 2021 electoral options, the AIADMK indicated at its meet.Pointing to the deaths of AIADMK’s top leader J Jayalalithaa and DMK’s M Karunanidhi who opposed her, senior leader and AIADMK deputy coordinator KP Munusamy said in the absence of such leaders, ‘many’ parties were now trying to make a political entry into Tamil Nadu and succeed.Some national parties, “opportunists, betrayers and a crowd,” were blaming the Dravidian outfits, alleging they ruined Tamil Nadu by their 50 plus year rule of the state, he said.Munusamy wondered how accusations of inefficiency could be hurled against the AIADMK government when the Centre had given so many awards to Tamil Nadu for its stellar performance in many sectors.Also, the state overall had superior infrastructure and facilities, be it education or health care amenities, he said.All such forces eying political gains should realise that Tamil Nadu would not endorse them as the Dravidian ideology was the bedrock of the state’s social and cultural milieu, he said.“Tamil Nadu’s socio-political landscape was nurtured by the Dravidian movement, which was built on the ethos of Tamil culture, language and valour and hence the state was entirely different from the rest of the country,” Munusamy said.The distinctive feature and undercurrent of the Dravidian movement had effectively blocked the entry of national parties into the state for over half a century, he said, adding it was only the offshoots of the movement — AIADMK and DMK — that have been ruling Tamil Nadu since 1967.Munusamy made the remarks in the presence of Chief Minister K Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and other senior leaders.In his fiery speech, Munusamy, a senior leader seen as close to Panneerselvam, who is also the party coordinator, was clear in his message that the BJP could not succeed independently in Tamil Nadu and was very much dependent on the AIADMK.He hinted that the BJP should accept that the AIADMK was the senior partner, endorse the candidature of Palaniswami or the saffron party may reconsider its electoral options for the 2021 polls.Though Munusamy did not mention BJP by name directly, it was clear that the message was intended for the national party that led the Central Government.“Be it a national party or state party. The government will be led by the AIADMK. There is no necessity for a coalition government. If any political party comes forward for an alliance arrangement with an idea of a coalition government, let them please think about it,” he said.The senior leader exhorted party cadres to work hard to ensure the party emerged victorious in the polls next year.The provocation for the Dravidian major to be blunt seemed to be the continuing hesitancy, seen by political observers as a strategy, of the state BJP leadership in endorsing Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate of the overall AIADMK-BJP alliance for the 2021 polls.Besides the BJP, there are other constituents in the AIADMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu, including the PMK.The saffron party’s TN unit had all along maintained that the CM nominee of the NDA in Tamil Nadu would be decided and announced by the BJP’s national leadership.To make matters worse, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, who was here on Friday, toed the state unit’s stand and declined to categorically say if his party continued its ties with the AIADMK or if it endorsed the candidature of Palaniswami.Some social media posts claimed that either BJP wanted to break away from the AIADMK alliance and form a separate front with Rajinikanth’s proposed party or was merely ‘posturing’ to bargain for a cabinet berth if AIADMK retained power.The Tamil Nadu BJP, in general, is opposed to Dravidian politics, which, it had often said, showed some tendencies of separatism, resulting in the state going off the national mainstream.Of late, the saffron party had not targeted the AIADMK on the ground of Dravidian ideology.The AIADMK senior leader’s comments that many were trying for a political space in Tamil Nadu is seen as aimed at a number of people.Top star Rajinikanth, who is set to launch a party next month, Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam and Tamil nationalist and leader of Nam Tamizhar Katchi (We Tamils Party), Seeman, whose stand against both Dravidian and national parties is well known, appeared to be among Munusamy’s targets.Notably, Chief Minister K Palaniswami, who had all along batted for the Centre’s farm laws — in public events that he participated — was silent on the matter today.

27-12-2020||Chandigarh||ITBP introduces first ever Centralised Liquor Management System for the Central Armed Police Forces||Going digital for the first time in the liquor issue management within the force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has introduced a Centralised Liquor Management System (CLMS) for its personnel. This is the first of its kind system amongst all the Central Armed Police Forces under the Ministry of Home Affairs.There was a long standing demand from ITBP personnel that good quality liquor should be made available to them in the vicinity of their native places. Untill recently, the jawans could purchase their authorised liquor quota only from the canteens of the formation or unit where he was posted and there was no system which could enable them to buy liquor from canteens of other unit of the force even if it is located nearby his home town. Due to this difficulty, jawans deployed in the remote and far flung areas had to face many difficulties in carrying the liquor due to different excise rules and duties of different states. Also, the liquor was sold in a manual manner and limited brands were available.The Centralised Liquor Management System has been prepared for the retired and serving personnel of the ITBP by the Force Headquarters and it was first introduced on July 31, 2020, an ITBP spokesperson said today. Under the system, the serving jawans can visit the main page of the ITBP website by using the CLMS tab on the portal and can generate their account through an online PIN and thereafter choosing the option of a liquor canteen of any formation or unit of the Force which is located nearby his home town. Further, the jawans can get easy access to his selected liquor canteen to get his authorised liquor quota on payment after login. Under this system, the issue of liquor is supported by automated SMS facility on the personal registered mobile numbers of the jawans. After the introduction of the CLMS system software, jawans are now able to select multiple liquor brands as per their choices and prescribed quota. The online availability of liquor’s brand, price, information, authorised quota and online purchase history can also be easily viewed or accessed through the system.CLMS is a fully transparent and centralised digital system. This system also enables jawans to easily view the online approved selling price of any variety of liquor or brands and their personalised prior purchase history. With this software, availability of quality liquor has now been ensured to ITBP jawans. The liquor is being made available to the Force personnel under CLMS on the basis of authorised monthly quota and approx 85 brands of different kinds of liquor are presently available on the CLMS. Based on requirement, number of available brands may increase in future. The Central Armed Police Forces have their own canteen set up on similar lines to the Defence Ministry’s Canteen Stores Department, that make various grocery, daily needs and household items available to their personnel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-introduces-first-ever-centralised-liquor-management-system-for-the-central-armed-police-forces-190138

27-12-2020||New Delhi||Protesting farmers stay put at Delhi borders amid harsh winter||Thousands of farmers agitating against the three new Central agriculture laws stayed put at their agitations venues near Delhi, which is going through a harsh spell of winter, unrelenting in their demand of withdrawal of the legislations.The farmers had reached Singhu border over a month ago.The protesting farmer unions had on Saturday decided to resume their dialogue with the Centre, and proposed December 29 for the next round of talks.They had also decided that a tractor march will be held on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal highway on December 30.Security remained tight at the Delhi borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri where the farmers have been camping.The protests have also led to traffic congestion forcing police to divert vehicular movement.Taking to Twitter on Sunday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed owing to the agitation and suggested them to take alternative roads.“The Chilla & Gazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Gaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. People are advised to take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara, Bhopra & Loni borders.“Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli & Mangesh borders closed. Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Rd, GTK road & NH 44,” it tweeted.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middleman and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protesting-farmers-stay-put-at-delhi-borders-amid-harsh-winter-190122

27-12-2020||New Delhi||Pandemic taught people resilience: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday the COVID-19 pandemic taught people resilience. In his last Mann ki Baat braodcast of the year, Modi said the pandemic had throuwn some challenges, but also taught people to endure. "This resilience had its source in the inner resource strength of ‘Aatam Nirbhar’,” he said.  He said people have supported 'vocal for local' campaign and asked manufacturers and industry leaders to ensure that world-class products are made in the country. Noting that the issue of single-use plastic could not be discussed much due to the COVID-19 pandemic this year, he asserted that ridding the country of single-use plastic is one of the resolves for the new year. Modi also asked people to use Kashmiri saffron and said that his government is working to make it a "globally popular brand".The GI tag has given it a unique identity, he said. --- TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pandemic-taught-people-resilience-modi-190116
27-12-2020||New Delhi||2020: When Indian scientists shifted focus to COVID-19 and made huge strides||India reported its first case of COVID-19 in the last week of January and scientists have been on the research treadmill ever since, deftly moving from what they were doing to focus on the trajectory and evolution of the fast-spreading disease, diagnostics and vaccine development.While many modified their research to suit COVID-19, others started afresh to cater to the more pressing and immediate demand – beating the pandemic.One year on, their efforts have paid off with Indian scientists at the forefront of the global fight against the disease despite the constraints of limited funding and available resources. Even before the first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in India, Debojyoti Chakraborty, for instance, had anticipated that scientists had their work cut out and it was only a matter of time before the virus would cut a wide swathe across the country and leave no one unscathed. In January, Chakraborty and his team at New Delhi's CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology were working on a prototype for the diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia based on gene-editing technology CRISPR.“Once the information about the pandemic came to light, we started reorienting our platform for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, gathering all the intelligence and reagents along the way,” Chakraborty told PTI.And so in January itself, the team started working on a CRISPR-based COVID-19 test --  ‘FELUDA' is billed as a cheaper, faster and simpler alternative to the standard RT-PCR diagnosis. Named after Satyajit Ray's famed detective, the test is priced at an affordable Rs 500 and can deliver a result in 45 minutes. It is able to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses even if genetic variations between them are minute. The FELUDA test is just one of several accomplishments. From developing computer models to predict the trajectory of the disease and creating diagnostics for designing masks and aiding vaccine research, India's scientists have made remarkable contributions in multiple fields.Like Chakraborty, Rajneesh Bhardwaj and Amit Agrawal from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay were busy in their line of research -- understanding the physics of evaporation of droplets for applications in spray cooling and inkjet printing and several other topical problems from the domain of thermal and fluid engineering.However, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, they turned their attention to applying their knowledge to understanding the evaporation of respiratory droplets on surfaces and the spread of cough clouds -- the main cause of airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus.“We were among the first scientists worldwide to start working on these scientifically and socially relevant problems. For example, the second paper and subsequently three more papers in the special issue on COVID in the prestigious journal Physics of Fluids came from our group,” Bhardwaj told PTI.“Our plans were to continue in the domain of thermal and fluid engineering. However, the pandemic came as an opportunity in our research plan. We thought of extending and applying our knowledge to several unanswered questions in the context of COVID,” Agrawal added.The year saw several research groups in India trying to get to the root of COVID-19 by understanding the different aspects of the viral disease, including the way it spreads, the role of masks and developing diagnostic tests.“The medical community has also reported clinical data and development of vaccines in an unprecedented way,” says Bhardwaj.A special issue on “Technologies for fighting COVID-19” published in the journal Transactions of Indian National Academy of Engineering summarised these efforts and highlighted 49 accepted papers published by Indian researchers.“It is a difficult task to develop new technologies within a short span but many of the existing technologies can be deployed with subtle changes to meet the immediate needs challenged by COVID-19,” the authors of the special issue said.Before the pandemic struck, Murali Dharan Bashyam and his team at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Hyderabad, were on the verge of completing two major projects -- one on pancreatic cancer, and the other on colorectal cancer, a result of work done for more than 10 years.“It was very disconcerting for my group when the lockdown was implemented. However, we realised that we needed to wait. By June 2020, we thought it was our duty to contribute to COVID-19 research,” the scientist told PTI.   After intense discussions between researchers at several national institutions and the Department of Biotechnology, the government identified four major areas of COVID-19 research  -- viral genomics, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development.“My group decided to contribute in the area of viral genomics since that was our area of expertise,” Bashyam added.The team's work on evolutionary genomics of the viral strains infecting the Telangana state appeared in the preprint repository MedRxiv and is expected to be published in a peer-reviewed journal soon.“In addition, we are one of the three leading groups coordinating a pan-India viral genome sequence consortium,” he said.The project was undertaken to sequence 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from samples to understand the evolving behaviour of the coronavirus. There are several others devoting their knowhow, time and efforts towards understanding COVID-19, which has infected almost 80 million people globally with the US topping the list with 18.7 million cases and India number two with more than 10 million cases.Gyaneshwar Chaubey deals with the phylogeny or evolutionary history of various organisms in his routine work. In 2020, the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) zoologist had planned to map the Lakshadweep Islands, several Bangladeshi and many Northeast Indian populations.“However, COVID-19 changed everything,” the scientist told PTI.Chaubey shifted his work towards analysing the mutations in the human gene responsible for the expression of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein on the surface of cells which is believed to act as a gateway for the novel coronavirus into the human body.By October, his team published a paper which described a variation in a genetic mutation among Indians that may be the main reason behind the difference in the death rates due to COVID-19 across various states of the country.“We were sure that 'nature' is so smart that whenever any such event happens, it doesn't destroy the whole humanity. Because we are so diverse and diversity always provides immunity to some people against diseases,” Chaubey added.Bashyam noted that Indian scientists have responded very well to the pandemic with cutting edge research in the four areas of research.“Several national-level collaborations were established and the rapid and specific response from several national laboratories are now bearing fruit. This definitely has been one of the fastest and efficiently managed responses from Indian scientists,” he added.

27-12-2020||New Delhi||Padma Shri dance historian Sunil Kothari passes away, had tested positive for COVID-19 a month ago||Padma Shri dance historian and critic Sunil Kothari passed away on Sunday morning at Fortis in New Delhi after he suffered a cardiac arrest a month after testing positive for coronavirus.He was 87.Kothari, who is residing in the Asiad Village, is currently facing government’s eviction notice to vacate the house allotted to him under the eminent artistes’ category. The eviction deadline December 31, 2020.Hailing from Baroda, Kothari took to dancing in the 1940s.He studied chartered accountancy, but could never stay off the dance circuit and was eventually pulled into it by the legendary Mulk Raj Anand, the editor of the art magazine “Marg.”It was Anand who first invited Kothari to edit an issue on Chhau among other masked dances of India.The edition was published in 1968 and there was no looking back since.Kothari, who struggled to pursue his passion, went on to pen more than 15 books on art and dance and was currently working on his autobiography.His latest work to be published was the “Sattriya Dances of Assam” in 2013."Kothari was single and is not survived by any immediate family", said Kathak dancer, Geetanjali Lal, who took care of him in his last days.Lal, also a resident of Asiad Village, said Kothari had contracted COVID-19 and recovered, but he could not fight fitfully.“He was in and out of the hospital over the past few days. He was also out a lot lately to complete the formalities of evicting the house he had been allotted under the eminent artiste quota. He has no immediate family and would eat with us often. It’s a great loss to the world of art and culture,” said Lal.Leading dancer Pratibha Prahlad remembered Kothari saying, “We lived, laughed and cried together. We fought vehemently. But through it all, we chew it up and spit it out. Now that he is gone, the dance world that he loved so much will have a void that would be impossible to fill.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/padma-shri-dance-historian-sunil-kothari-passes-away-had-tested-positive-for-covid-19-a-month-ago-190109
27-12-2020||New Delhi||Remember sacrifices of Sikh Gurus, says Modi as farmer protests show no signs of waning||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that people should to remember the sacrifices made by Guru Tegh Bahadur, Guru Gobind Singh, Mata Gujri and the four "Sahibzadas".In his last ‘Mann ki Baat’ address of the year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to several revered Sikh personalities, including sons of Guru Gobind Singh, saying their sacrifices helped keep our culture safe."We pay tributes to the brave Chaar Sahibzaade, we remember Mata Gujri, we recall the greatness of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. We remain indebted to these greats for their sacrifices and their spirit of compassion," he said.He also spoke of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it taught the country hard lessons.“It was challenging,” Modi said, “but taught people resilience. This resilience had its source from the inner resource strength of ‘Aatam Nirbhar’,” he said.  His remarks that come as Modi’s government grapples with an ongoing farmers’ protest that comprise, in large part, of Sikh farmers.The prime minister and has government has been trying to mollify protesters and has been trying to reach out to the Sikh community in particular since the protests escalated in November.PTI reported that the IRCTC sent out nearly two crore emails between December 8 and December 12 to its customers listing 13 decisions taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to support the Sikh community, amidst farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.Read also: Protesting farmers clang ‘thalis’, ask PM Modi to Listen to their ‘Mann ki Baat’ tooPM, ministers should sleep on floor till farmers out in cold: BittuPunjab 2020: State's farmers lay siege to Delhi's bordersAdditionally, the prime minister’s recent visit to Delhi’s Gurdwara Rakabganj amid a standoff with farmers also drew attention from the press.Farmers mainly Punjab and Haryana have been protesting three controversial farm laws Parliament passed in September. Farmers primarily fear that the laws would render the APMC, or the mandi system, weakened and would leave them open to exploitation. Another objection is the clause that allows contract farming, which they say could lead to losing their lands to big corporations. Centre disputes both claims. Farmers laid siege to Delhi in November---they blocked national highways leading into Delhi and have since refused to budge. Their numbers have continued to swell since, as farmers from across the country began joining the protests. Talks with the central government have so far yielded no results, with both parties sticking to their guns---farmers want a complete repeal of the laws and another legislation to promise a minimum support price, while the central government has offered several “concessions” short of rescinding the laws.Farmers' unions meanwhile claim that the central government has been trying to malign the movement by calling them variously as "Khalistanis" and "urban naxals". The central government meanwhile accuses opposition and what they claim are vested political interests of misleading protesters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remember-sacrifices-of-sikh-gurus-says-modi-as-farmer-protests-show-no-signs-of-waning-190106

27-12-2020||Lucknow||Back from UK eight test COVID-19 positive, one missing in Uttar Pradesh||With eight of the 609 UK returnees, who were tracked and tested in Uttar Pradesh, testing positive to Covid-19, the Yogi Adityanath government has pressed the panic button. Out of the eight positive patients, one has been reported missing.Even though the strain of the virus is yet to be identified, the state government is not taking any chances.State Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to maintain the effective system of contact tracing and surveillance. He said that the arrangements of the Covid-19 hospitals should be up-to-date and senior doctors should take regular rounds of Covid-19 wards.Adequate availability of medicines, medical equipments and oxygen, including backup, should be ensured in Covid-19 hospitals and the testing work should be conducted with full capacity. He has further asked the nodal officers to visit districts and monitor the situation.It may be recalled that the Centre had provided a list of 1,655 persons who had returned from or via the UK to the state."Of these, 1,087 have been tracked. 609 have been tested of whom eight were found to be positive," said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad.He said that the samples of these persons had been sent for genome sequencing."It is not clear whether the old or the mutant strain caused Covid-19 in them. Therefore, their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. The report is expected soon," he stated.According to health sources, three of these patients are from Meerut while two each are from Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar districts. Those from Meerut had travelled to London and came back to India on December 14. The travel history of others has not been revealed.One of the city residents with a travel history to the UK between December 9 and 22 is yet to be traced, even four days after the identification."One traveller could not be traced as his mobile phone is constantly switched off. The residential address given by him in documents reads Kathauta in Lucknow but the exact location is vague," an officer said.Sources confirmed that the samples had been sent to CSIR's Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Amit Mohan Prasad also said that seven of the eight positive persons were undergoing treatment in the state at the special international ward set up by the state health department while one was under treatment in New Delhi's Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital.Officials are worried over the lack of support from some of these returnees who have switched off their phones."Several districts have reported that the returnees have switched off their phones which is not good. The state government is getting them tested in their individual interest besides ensuring the well-being of everyone else. They must come forward and cooperate in public interest," said Navneet Sehgal, Additional Chief Secretary, information and public relations department.Meanwhile, 1,102 new Covid cases took the state's tally to 5,81,080 on Saturday. Of these, 5,56,912 have recovered while 8,293 have succumbed to the infection.Health officials said that the state's recovery rate had reached 95.8 per cent.A scrutiny by district health officers found that 22 travellers had given their permanent addresses in Lucknow but were found to be living in other districts of the state.

27-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's minimum temperature rises slightly||The minimum temperature in the national capital rose slightly on Sunday under the influence of a Western Disturbance affecting the upper Himalayas, according to the India Meteorological Department.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6 degrees Celsius as against 4.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday.However, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the relief will be short-lived.  The WD will lead to "scattered to fairly widespread" snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.  After the wind system withdraws, cold and dry northerly/northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas will bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius, the IMD said."Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP and north Rajasthan from December 28-29. Ground frost and the dense fog is likely in isolated pockets in the region," it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.   On Sunday last, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far.

27-12-2020||Aurangabad||Worrisome trend: Elderly being abandoned by kin at hospital||The authorities of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Aurangabad said they have been observing an increasing trend of elderly persons being abandoned at the facility by their kin after they are brought for treatment.The GMCH-Aurangabad is one of the biggest health facilities in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra. People from across the eight districts in the region come to the hospital for treatment, one of its senior officials said.He said the number of elderly persons being left at the hospital by their family members is growing."The number of such abandoned old people had gone up in the initial phase of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.But we carried out a campaign with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and sent many of them to local shelter homes. However, as per our experience, many of them escape from the shelter homes," GMCH superintendent Dr Suresh Harbade said.Many of the abandoned people then start living on the hospital campus, footpaths or areas around the facility. They prefer to stay at such places as they easily get food and other basic things from the passers-by. Which is why, they don't want to stay at shelter homes and such facilities, he said."After the initial drive, the number of abandoned persons decreased. However, such cases have started going up of late. Therefore, we are planning to undertake a similar exercise once again by roping in NGOs," he added.The authorities, however, do not have the exact number of such people.Dr Harbade said that patients are admitted to the hospital even if they are not accompanied by their family members."Our staff and social workers take care of such people. But if we try to contact their family members, the latter do not give a positive response. It has been observed in many cases," he said.During the previous drive, the hospital authorities had contacted the local governing bodies from where these old people come, he said, adding, "We sent some of them back to their native places under this initiative."An elderly man named Nivrutti, who stays on the footpath in front of the casualty ward of the GMCH, said: "I come from a village near Badnapur tehsil in neighboring Jalna district. Some days back, a rat bit me and my son brought me here for treatment. But he left me alone at the hospital and returned home...I can barely walk.""After that, I started living on this footpath. At night, I see many people like me here," he said."I had worked as a labourer throughout my life, but my family does not want to keep me with them. My son is busy with his own family now...But I am sure that even if I die here, someone or the other will perform my last rites...I am fine the way I am now." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/worrisome-trend-elderly-being-abandoned-by-kin-at-hospital-190082
27-12-2020||Chandigarh||After two decades, Kargil martyr’s 80-year-old mother gets pension||Over two decades after a soldier from Mansa was killed during the Kargil war in June 1999, the Army has awarded a part of his liberalised family pension to his 80-year-old mother.Jagir Kaur was in a bad condition, living in a dilapidated house. Her case was taken up by the Mohali-based Ex-servicemen Grievance Cell (ESGC) after a video highlighting her condition surfaced on social media.After NK Nirmal Singh of the Sikh Light Infantry died, the family was given all due benefits by the Central and state governments, but his widow Paramjit Kaur took away everything and remarried.According to the ESGC, Nirmal had been married for four years, but Paramjit never lived at her in-laws’ place. Even no ‘Part-II order’ recording the marriage, as is required for administrative purposes, was published by the Army. However, after Nirmal’s death, Paramjit had managed to get the Part-II order published.Jagir Kaur, being illiterate and from a remote place, never knew her entitlements. She had six sons, out of whom two died, and four daughters, who are married. Her sons work as labourers or do odd jobs.After the ESGC took up the case with the Army in August this year and presented various documents and court records, the Army issued a new pension order granting Jagir Kaur one-third of the liberalised family pension that was being paid to Paramjit. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-two-decades-kargil-martyrs-80-year-old-mother-gets-pension-190000

It had nothing to do with politics. “We are only seeking the guidance of Dhindsa and have joined him for that,” added Pal, who has also been a member of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).The other four members of the front are Kulwant Singh Batth, Jatinder Singh Sahney, Paramjit Singh Rana and Malkinder Singh. All of them are also part of the executive committee of the DSGMC.The DSGMC has 46 elected members and 15 of these comprise the executive board.“The maintenance of gurdwara is not the priority of the ruling combine. It’s more about personal politics of the party, Sukhbir Singh Badal and Manjinder Singh Sirsa,” Pal said justifying his decision to leave.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-akali-dsgmc-members-join-dhindsa-group-189833

The LJP came a cropper in the elections though it succeeded in cutting into JD (U)’s votes, with BJP rebels fighting on its tickets in many seats. “The BJP’s strategy was, firstly, to cut Nitish to size which it did successfully in the Assembly polls.

27-12-2020||---||Talks on December 29, farmers set 4-point agenda||Chandigarh/New Delhi, December 26The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint forum of farmers’ organisations protesting at the Delhi borders against the Centre’s farm laws, today decided to resume dialogue with the government. It has proposed December 29 as the date for talks.The Morcha put forth a four-point agenda — modalities for repealing the three farm laws and a mechanism for remunerative MSP (as recommended by the National Farmers’ Commission) and a legally guaranteed entitlement for agricultural commodities. The other two proposals are — amendments to the Commission for the Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance in order to exclude farmers from the ordinance’s penal provisions and lastly changes in the draft Electricity Amendment Bill to safeguard the interests of the farmers. The Morcha wanted the dialogue to proceed in that order.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 farmers’ unions protesting at the Delhi entry points. Dr Darshan Pal, a union leader, said it was also decided that farmers would organise a tractor march on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway on December 30. “We appeal to the farmers from surrounding states to turn up in large numbers in their tractor-trailers.“If the government doesn’t want us to block the KMP expressway, the three farm laws must be repealed before that,” said Pal.He also urged the residents of Delhi and other parts of the country to celebrate New Year with the protesting farmers on the Delhi borders and enjoy ‘langar’ with them. He said the call for suspending fee collection at toll plazas —earlier for three days — had been extended indefinitely.In their reply to the government’s December 24 letter, the unions have accused the Centre of “suppressing facts” on the deliberations held in the previous meetings. “We have consistently demanded repeal of the three laws. The government, however, has tried to portray as if we were seeking amendments. The government must not spread misinformation. The campaign launched by the entire state machinery to defame the farmers’ movement must stop forthwith,” the morcha said in its response addressed to Vivek Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture.Centre may not agree to repeal demand, say govt sourcesThe farmers’ condition of repealing the three laws is unlikely to be accepted by the Union Government and it may only be ready for certain amendments, said govt sources. PM Narendra Modi had hinted at the same while addressing farmers at a PM-Kisan scheme event on Friday.Former MP Khalsa quits BJPChandigarh: Former Fatehgarh Sahib MP Harinder Singh Khalsa on Friday resigned from the BJP to protest the alleged insensitivity shown by the party leadership towards the farmers’ stir.

27-12-2020||---||Some in Delhi trying to teach democracy: PM’s dig at Rahul Gandhi||New Delhi, December 26Launching a free health insurance scheme for Jammu and Kashmir residents today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a swipe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying “those lecturing me on democracy are refusing to conduct local body elections in Puducherry where their party is in power.”Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterWhy no local polls in Puducherry?The very people who give me lessons in democracy are in power in Puducherry. Despite Supreme Court’s 2018 orders to hold local elections, the government there continues to dither“While J&K has successfully conducted three-tier local body elections within a year of becoming a UT, some people in Delhi keep rebuking me all the time and using unparliamentary language against me. I want to show them the mirror,” the PM said, noting that J&K voters were hoping for a better future and putting the past behind.In clear reference to Rahul who had earlier this week termed Indian democracy as “imaginary”, PM Modi noted, “The very people who give me lessons in democracy are in power in Puducherry and you will be surprised that the Supreme Court orders to hold local elections came in 2018, but the Puducherry Government, which has no faith in democracy, continues to dither.”The PM said the last local body elections were held in Puducherry in 2006. “The term of elected members expired in 2011. Some political parties obviously say one thing and do another. The non-conduct of elections shows how serious they are about democracy,” the PM said.He said the DDC elections had written a new chapter in J&K. “The people here have worked to strengthen the roots of democracy. Elections have been held transparently and in the right earnest. This moment heralds the beginning of a new decade and a new era of leadership in the UT,” the PM said.He earlier justified BJP’s exit from a coalition government in the state, saying, “We quit the government over our insistence to hold panchayat elections.

27-12-2020||Imphal||PM Modi ended era of insurgency to bring flood of development in NE: Amit Shah||Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the North East in his heart and so brought a flood of development in the region ending an era of insurgency, bandhs and road blockades, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday.“The BJP government under Modi has given a new identity to the region which is now experiencing a new thrust in development,” Shah said at the inauguration and foundation laying programme of several projects at Hapta Kangjeibung here.Earlier, Manipur was known for insurgency, bandhs and road blockades but now, most militant organisations had joined the mainstream and those left would also do so following efforts of the BJP government, he added.He attacked the Congress for failing to solve the problems of Manipur when they were in power and asserted that since last three years under Chief Minister N Biren Singh the state was moving ahead on the path of growth.Taking a swipe at the Congress, Shah said the grand old party which ruled the north-eastern states for a long time only paid lip service to the economic prosperity of the area.“During Congress long rule in the region they just laid foundation stones of projects which the BJP government completed in the last six years under Narendra Modi,” the Home Minister said.“Earlier Congress government used to give Rs 89,168 crore budget to North East but BJP enhanced it to Rs 3,17,375 crore now”, Shah said.The Inner Line Permit (ILP) has been the biggest gift by the Prime Minister to the people of Manipur which they got even without asking for it, the Home Minister said.“Modiji realised that Manipur is not having the Inner Line Permit when other states surrounding it had it which is an injustice to the indigenous people and he found a way”, Shah said.“It was a matter of great satisfaction for us when Manipur got it (ILP) on December 11, 2019”, he added.The Inner Line Permit (ILP) is an official travel document issued by the concerned state government to allow travel of an Indian citizen into a protected area for a limited period.It is obligatory for the citizens from outside those states to obtain a permit for entering into the protected state.Shah said Prime Minister’s attachment to the northeast could be understood from the fact that in the past six years of being in the power, Modi visited the region more than 40 times.“In the past, the northeast used to face floodwaters but now people are witnessing a flood of development in the region,” he added.Shah arrived here from Guwahati Sunday afternoon on the last leg of his three-day visit to the North East and laid the foundation of seven projects, including a medical college at Churachandpur, inaugurated the Thoubal Dam and dedicate the Bishnupur-Tupul-Thoubal-Kasom Khullen Road to the public.Lauding the efforts of the BJP-led central government and the Biren Singh ministry in Manipur, Shah said while prior to 2014 only 6 per cent of the households had access to pure drinking water in the state which has increased to 31 per cent in just six years now.“Similarly, there has been 222 per cent increase in the arrival of tourists in the state in last six years,” he said, adding a total of 1186 youths of Manipur had launched their start-ups during this time.Union Minister of State for the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) (Independent charge) Jitendra Singh lauded efforts of Modi government to usher development in the north-eastern region.Chief Minister Biren Singh also spoke on the occasion.BJP came to power in Manipur for the first time in 2017 ending longtime rule of the Congress.

As a result, after overtaking the UK in 2019, it has surpassed India again in this year’s forecasts and will stay ahead till 2024,” the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said in an annual report published on Saturday.The UK appears to have overtaken India again during 2020 as a result of the weakness of the rupee, it said.The CEBR forecasts that the Indian economy will expand by 9 per cent in 2021 and by 7 per cent in 2022.“Growth will be naturally slow as India becomes more economically developed, with the annual GDP growth expected to sink to 5.8 per cent in 2035. This growth trajectory will see India become the world’s third largest economy by 2030, overtaking the UK in 2025, Germany in 2027 and Japan in 2030,” it said.The UK-based think tank forecast that China will in 2028 overtake the US to become the world’s biggest economy, five years earlier than previously estimated due to the contrasting recoveries of the two countries from the pandemic. Japan would remain the world’s third-biggest economy, in dollar terms, until early 2030s when it would be overtaken by India, pushing Germany down from fourth to fifth. The CEBR said India’s economy had been losing momentum even ahead of the shock delivered by the Covid-19 crisis. The rate of GDP growth sank to a more than 10-year low of 4.2 per cent in 2019, down from 6.1 per cent the previous year and around half the 8.3 per cent growth rate in 2016. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-will-be-5th-largest-economy-in-2025-3rd-by-2030-uk-think-tank-189930
