I told him you will go miles ahead of me and become a superstar due to your tremendous acting talent,” he said.Sinha decried those in the Hindi film industry who mocked aspirants from small towns and villages, calling them people from “chhote shahar aur chhoti soch” (small town people with petty thoughts).“Is Patna a chhota shahar? Great personalities like the first president of independent India Dr Rajendra Prasad, Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan and a host of top bureaucrats...IAS and IPS officers have their roots in Patna and Bihar,” he said.Sinha admitted “nepotism and favouritism” existed in Bollywood and said he himself had to face hardship on his way to becoming “zero to hero”.He, however, refused to speak about actress Rhea Chakraborty, who Rajput’s father has accused of abetting his son’s suicide, saying he never met her and does not know much about the case.

21-08-2020||Mukesh Ranjan||No reason for Kerala Govt to oppose privatisation of Thiruvananthapuram airport: Hardeep Puri||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Aug 21Pointing out at the number of airports in the state which are being run under the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday questioned the “real reason” for the Kerala Government’s opposition to the Centre’s decision of handing over the Thiruvananthapuram airport to a private entity.In an official statement, the Minister said, “Kerala is the pioneer as far as airports under the PPP model are concerned. The first PPP airport in India came up in Kochi in Kerala. It is a successfully run airport with a capacity of 13 million passengers per annum and was handling 9.62 MPPA in 2019-20 before COVID19.”Puri went on to add that another very successful example of the PPP model was Kannur. “In fact, it was during the UDF regime in Kerala that the foundation for Kochi airport was laid in 1994 and the airport was inaugurated in 1999 during the LDF regime,” he said.Questioning the rationale behind opposing the handing over of Thiruvananthapuram airport under the PPP model, the Minister said it was for all to know that the state already had two very successfully running airports in the PPP model.“It has come to my knowledge that an all-party meeting in Kerala has opposed the PPP model at Thiruvananthapuram airport,” he added.The Minister further said, “If Kerala Government is against privatisation, then why did it participate in the bidding process? The state government was given a fair chance and Right of First Refusal (RoFR) if their bid was within 10% below the range of the highest bid. However, they bid 19.64 % below (the range).”“The Union Cabinet has given its go-ahead for awarding the airport to the private party subject to the outcome of the writ petition and in accordance with provisions of undertaking given by the Concessionaire,” Puri said.The Minister further said it should be borne in mind that these airports would come back to the AAI after the lease period of 50 years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-reason-for-kerala-govt-to-oppose-privatisation-of-thiruvananthapuram-airport-hardeep-puri-129383

21-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Members of WhatsApp group created to avenge Hindus lost individuality: Court||Members of a WhatsApp group created to avenge Hindus allegedly lost their individuality and started working with mob minds, said a Delhi court on Friday while taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed against nine persons in a case of alleged murder of a resident during the communal violence in north east Delhi in February.The court said some youths allegedly failed to perceive the “bottomless stupidity” of the propaganda to take revenge against the Muslims created the WhatsApp group ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purushottam Pathak took cognisance of the offences including rioting, unlawful assembly, murder and criminal conspiracy against nine persons in the alleged murder case of Hashim Ali.The court directed all the accused—Lokesh Kumar Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chuadhary, Prince, Rishabh Chaudhary, Jatin Sharma, Vivek Panchal and Himanshu Thakur—to be produced before it through video conferencing on August 28 for further hearing in the case.“I am of the opinion that there is sufficient material on record to take cognisance of the offences alleged to have been committed by accused persons.“I hereby take cognisance of the offence punishable under section 302 (murder), 144 (), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 201 (destruction of evidence), 427 (mischief), 432 (mischief by causing inundation or obstruction to public drainage), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code alleged to have been committed by accused ,” the judge said in his order.The court said from the statements of the witnesses and the charge sheet, it was prima facie revealed that there was a well hatched conspiracy amongst the accused persons.“Same is also evident from the fact that in order to take revenge from Muslims some youths of that area who failed to perceive the bottomless stupidity of the propaganda, they as saviours of their community created a WhatsApp group. The group’s members as discussed herein above lost their individuality and started working with mob mins.“’Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ which are the sacred slogans and are attached to the victorious yelling, deadened their minds and paralysed their creative nature. They planned the manner of committing offence of rioting, murder and other offences and were instrumental for gathering of the unlawful assembly at Bhagirathi Vihar Nala Pulia on February 26 in conspiracy with each other having common intention and unlawful object,” it said.It added thereupon the mob allegedly turned rioters and in the process of rioting, they caused death of Ali by inflicting multiple injuries in a brutal manner and with a view to conceal the evidence all of them in furtherance of their common intention threw his body in the drain.It said that it has been found that the common object of the unlawful assembly was not only to kill but also to destroy all evidence of that crime.“Thus, all of those involved in the present case actively participated in connection with the carrying of the dead body or disposal of it by throwing it in the drain must have been actuated by the common object. There cannot be any doubt that the accused who killed Hashim Ali were certainly up to their neck in the conspiracy and were thus very active members of the unlawful assembly,” the court said.It, however, said in a case where a group of people conspired, thereafter assembled to take revenge and where the victims have been targeted on the basis of their religious identity, the relevant provisions of law attracting relevant offences should have been mentioned in the charge sheet.“It is also clear that there were averments in respect of promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion and acting in a way that are prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony,” it said in the order.According to the charge sheet, the body of Ali was found on February 27 in a drain in the Gokulpuri area and injury marks were found on his face.The charge sheet said all the accused persons were allegedly present at the spot on February 26 carrying stones, cudgel, sticks, swords and rion rods etc and were shouting slogans like ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’.They were allegedly leading the mob and giving directions to their associates by calling each other by their names and were alleged to have been involved in killing of nine Muslims after checking their identity, police had said.Public witnesses stated that a mob allegedly stopped two persons riding on the Apache bike and after establishing their Muslim identity, they killed both the persons with stones, cudgel, sticks, swords and iron rods and threw their bodies in the Nala (drain) along with the bike, the charge sheet said.It said during the course of investigation, data of mobile phones of Sharma and Bhardwaj revealed that they were members of WhatsApp group namely “Kattar Hindu Ekta”.Further investigation of this group was carried out which revealed that it was created on February 25 for allegedly taking revenge from Muslim community, the charge sheet said.It further said they allegedly conspired to teach Muslims a lesson for attacking the Hindus and equipped themselves with lathis, danda, sticks, swords and firearms and killed many innocent persons including Hashim Ali and his brother Aamir Khan.

Meanwhile, the rift between the NDA allies, the JD-U and the LJP, is deepening.Chirag Paswan has been targeting Nitish Kumar regarding his handling of the migrants’ crisis, the COVID pandemic and floods.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-political-parties-strengthen-their-position-rjd-seems-to-pursue-nda-ally-ljp-129375

Out of these, there are 21,687 active cases, and the numbers are rising.A recent study has indicated that there could be as many as two lakh asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in the city of Hyderabad alone. Responding to the ban, BJP Telangana unit president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay said, "The TRS government, which distributed biryanis and kaju pista during Ramzan is imposing strict rules, depriving devotees from offering pulihora prasadam during Navratri. There is nothing more shameless than this."  The BJP leader accused the state government of making attempts to divide Hindus by eyeing the minority vote in the upcoming Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections.  BJP’s Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind also hit out at the government for banning public celebrations on ‘Vinayaka Chavithi’.  The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi on the other hand rubbished the BJP charge saying that the party is trying to create communal unrest in the state.TRS spokesperson Manne Krishank said, "BJP state president is speaking like a street leader. He should rise up to a level of state president of a national party and an MP. He should at least know what other states, where BJP is in power, are doing." Krishank said, "There were restrictions for Ramzan, there are restrictions for Muharram, such statements from Bandi Sanjay and Arvind appear as a desperate attempt to break public harmony in Telangana for political gains."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-opposes-state-ban-on-setting-up-of-ganesh-pandals-in-telangana-129373

21-08-2020||Kolkata||Visva Bharati violence: NGT directive misinterpreted by some stakeholders: Environmentalist||Environmental activist Subhas Dutta, whose petition to the National Green Tribunal led it to frame guidelines for holding the annual Poush Mela in Santiniketan, said on Friday that the directive of the green bench had been misinterpreted in the recent move by some stakeholders.Refusing to name anyone in particular, Dutta said some “illegal and unfortunate developments” had taken place in recent times around the Poush Mela.Dutta hinted that erection of boundary fencing was not the mandate of NGT.“The directive of NGT with regard to holding the Poush Mela in a specific time frame and following certain environmental norms like solid waste management seems to have been misinterpreted ... Some illegal activities took place in the wake of the misinterpretation of the NGT order and a political conflict has come to the fore. This is not expected,” he said.“Visva Bharati which has Prime Minister Narendra Modi as its chancellor cannot shy away from taking necessary measures to make the fair environment-friendly in cooperation with the state government and stop holding the fair blaming non-cooperation from a section of traders. They should take necessary action, “ Dutta commented.The NGT order had emphasised on the environmental aspect of the famed Poush Mela, started by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, and saving the fairground from ecological damage, Dutta had said after the violence at the Visva Bharati University campus over the erection of a wall around the Poush Mela ground on Monday.The environmentalist had been part of NGT appointed three-member committee to oversee if all guidelines were being followed in holding the over 125-year-old fair.His petition in 2017 had led to the NGT framing certain guidelines on holding the over 125-year-old Poush Mela in an environment-friendly manner.The quiet university town was witness to violence on August 17 when a large number of locals assembled at the mela ground after fencing work began at the behest of Vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty and other varsity officials. The mob vandalized construction equipment and tore down one of university gates next to the ground.Visva Bharati has demanded a CBI inquiry into the violence and blamed a Trinamool Congress MLA and some local ruling party leaders for the violence which was preceded on Sunday by a rally of the VC and some other varsity officials to the fairground to prevent attempts by local traders to stop fencing work.The central university has said it will remain closed until those involved in the vandalism are punished.On October 29, 2019, a two-member NGT Bench of Justice S P Wangdi and Prof (Dr) P C Mishra had asked Visva-Bharati to cooperate with Birbhum district administration for safety, security and protection of environment during the four-day fair.The bench, which had enclosed its 2017 order along similar lines with certain guidelines for holding of the fair, had said that food stalls should be set up in an enclosed area with adequate measures for controlling dust and waste removal, besides facilities for clean drinking water and toilets.The bench had also directed the varsity to ensure proper management of solid waste and to stop fossil fuel burning during the fair in cooperation with the state government.The fair commenced in 1894 by Rabindranath Tagore’s father, Maharshi Debendranath, and Visva Bharati started organising the Poush Mela in 1951.

21-08-2020||---||India could strike a small trade deal with US soon: Taranjit Singh Sandhu||New Delhi, August 21Indian Ambassador to the United States Taranjit Singh Sandhu is hopeful of a mini trade deal with the US even in the closing months of the current administration and despite the disappointments of the last few months.Speaking at a webinar, the Indian envoy said the restoration of cuts in the H-1B and the L-1 visas continues to be his mission’s top priority.Sandhu, who took over as the Indian envoy in January this year after the then incumbent Harsh Vardhan Shringla moved over to Delhi as the Foreign Secretary, said he had written to all principals of the top US universities to inform them about the Indian government’s decision to allow them to set up campuses in the country.“A mini trade deal is very important. It is one of the areas under discussion. We are very keen. It is a work in progress, perhaps in its final stages,” he said while advising an Indian importer of sophisticated medical devices to put pressure on the US Trade Representative.Productive conversation with business leaders, industry experts & investors on India-US economic cooperation including partnership in Global Value Chains. Discussed policy reforms in FDI and new opportunities for US companies to invest in India. ⁦@ficci_india⁩ pic.twitter.com/SHODkMyRjq  The envoy said the Indian diplomats had been approaching the US Senators and Representatives to point out that Indians, who had arrived on H-1B and L-1 visas, had brought with them important skill sets and bridged technological gaps that made US companies globally competitive.“With innovation and technology leading the path to post-pandemic economic recovery, their role (in the US) becomes even more significant. We have been raising it with the US and will continue to do that. It is a developing situation,” he said while indicating the decision to clamp down on the visas was more of a political decision than one that had economic merit. “We are hopeful,” he added.Drawing on his experience of the past five COVID-hit months, the envoy said every TV discussion in the US had doctors who were Indian Americans which “sends a significant signal”.In recent weeks, Sandhu has been hopeful of an Indo-US mini trade deal but the pandemic has been a distraction for both sides. He indicated that the US should temporarily shelve its reservations about India’s e-commerce policy because, at the end of the exercise, New Delhi would attempt to address the concerns of all stakeholders.India and the US have been discussing a limited trade deal since September last year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the US.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-could-strike-a-small-trade-deal-with-us-soon-taranjit-singh-sandhu-129363

21-08-2020||Bengaluru||Bengaluru violence: HDK urges BJP, Congress to shun ‘petty politics’||Accusing the BJP and the Congress of indulging in “mudslinging” over recent violence in the city, JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy on Friday said both national parties stood exposed before the people, as he urged them to leave “petty politics”.In an open letter to the Congress and the BJP, the former Chief Minister has questioned both parties regarding their conduct in connection with the incident.“DJ Halli riots are a Law and Order issue. The incident should have been investigated and the guilty should have been punished. Any responsible government and the party in power should have learnt lessons from the incident and initiated preventive steps to avoid recurrence of similar events,” Kumaraswamy said.Instead, both national political parties have used it to indulge in “mudslinging”, he said.This way, the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress stand exposed by losing both leadership and the confidence in the minds of the people.Accusing both parties of looking out for ‘political polarisation’ from every incident, he asked them to answer some of his questions while urging them to “leave petty politics”.Political slugfest is currently on between both parties over the August 11 riots, with Ministers in the BJP government citing investigation so far alleging that local political differences within the Congress and the SDPI’s larger conspiracy to disturb law and order were among the major reasons for the violence.The Congress has charged the BJP with using power to fix its leaders and workers in the incident to “cover-up” its failure in handling the riots.Pointing out that the Congress alleges that there was a political conspiracy behind the riots, Kumaraswamy asked: “Is this conspiracy being from within the party or outside? or ticket aspirants? Does the Congress have the courage to make public these secrets? Do at times, leaders who came from other parties become unpalatable for the Congress?”Also suggesting that whenever there was a discussion on banning the SDPI, the Congress became over-reactive and challenged those in power to ban, he asked the grand old party to explain what was the benefit that they were going to get by banning or not banning it.Terming the DJ Halli incident as the “biggest law and order failure” on the part of the government, Home Department and the Intelligence, while turning towards the BJP, Kumaraswamy said the government, which should have owned the responsibility, had absolutely become “irresponsible”.“Is any action initiated against any Home Department official in connection with this incident? Instead, the BJP has gone one step ahead conspiring for a political polarisation. BJP, aren’t you shameless?” he asked.Asking as to why BJP, which is blaming the Congress for not initiating action, despite being in power, the JD(S) leader said the government had become so weak and powerless that it couldn’t even ensure the safety of the MLA who won with a huge majority.“How can this powerless government protect the interests of the ordinary people? If they cannot, what is the point of such a government in power? Or did the BJP want such riots during the BBMP elections?” he questioned.The violence in DJ Halli and adjoining areas on August 11 night was unleashed by hundreds of people over an inflammatory social media post allegedly put out by P Naveen, a relative of Pulakeshinagar Congress MLA R Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy.The MLAs residence and a police station at DJ Halli were torched by rioters, who also set many police and private vehicles afire and looted the belongings of the legislator and his sister.Murthy, who was in JD(S), had jumped ship to the Congress ahead of the 2018 assembly polls and won the election.

21-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: HC asks police to show videos of Pinjra Tod member making instigating speeches||The Delhi High Court Friday asked Delhi Police to show the videos of a member of Pinjra Tod group, a women's collective, allegedly making instigating speeches during the communal violence in northeast Delhi early this year.The police, however, said they do not have the videos of the time when the group's member Devangana Kalita, a JNU student, was allegedly making instigating speeches during the riots incident.The police said it has the videos of her allegedly instigating people before the riots took place on February 24 and 25 and also of February 22 and 23 when a large gathering was sitting and protesting outside Jafrabad metro station in northeast Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).While hearing the arguments on Kalita's bail plea in a case related to the communal violence in Delhi during protests against the CAA, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said, “Show me any portion of the speech recorded by the media or anyone else which showed that Kalita instigated the mob to commit the crime.” During that period, the media was everywhere and recording everything, the court said.“I want to know what she said which instigated the mob,” the judge said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju, appearing for the police, said there were no media on February 25 when the incident happened and the witness accounts showed Kalita's role in instigating the mob.When the law officer stated that Kalita's call detail records showed her location to be that spot, the judge said even she has admitted that she was there.“It was well planned and organised at a time when US President Donald Trump was to come here. It was done to damage the image of the country. Public property was destroyed and a large number of people were injured and one person died,” the ASG argued while opposing the bail plea.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Kalita, said the police was not showing any instigation or speeches allegedly given by her but was only relying on statements of others recorded under the CrPC.The counsel shared a video with the court to show that the police were recording the protest and said the officials were still not showing any videos to the court. “Accused in not a politician. She is an academician and a research scholar. She has already been granted bail in two cases. Let the police show us the video and the hate speech. The police are not showing us that there is any possibility of her fleeing from justice,” Sibal submitted.The high court, after hearing the arguments, reserved its order on the plea challenging a trial court's order which had dismissed Kalita's bail application.During the hearing, the ASG said it was a case where a large number of persons were involved and it is not possible that everyone comes in video footage and the evidence showed that Kalita was involved in the riots.Countering Sibal's arguments, he said the academic record of a person is not required for considering bail and it is the nature of the offence which is required to be seen for bail and whether she can tamper with the evidence.“Others are poor illiterate ladies who were instigated to turn violent. They were given false statements. It was a case of conspiracy and violation of section 144 CrPC order. Poor people were misled by her that they will be thrown out of the country,” Raju contended.He added “they are very clever operators. She is educated and knows the law, so she also knows how to evade the law. It is a very case.” When the court asked the investigating officer in the case whether he had recorded the speech given by Kalita, he said there was a mob of 10,000 people and even media persons were not there and that she was making the statement a kilometre away.“If she was 1 km away, how did you manage to hear what she was saying,” the judge asked.To this, the IO replied the SHO who had gone near Kalita had heard her making an instigating speech.Kalita and another member of the group Natasha Narwal were arrested in the case in May by the Crime Branch of the Delhi police and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder.They have also been booked under the stringent anti-terror law - Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a separate case related to the communal violence, for allegedly being part of a "premeditated conspiracy" in the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.In all, four cases have been registered against her, including in relation to the northeast Delhi riots earlier this year and violence in old Delhi's Daryaganj area during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.Kalita has secured bail in two cases -- Daryaganj and one northeast Delhi matter. On June 14, a trial court had dismissed Kalita's bail plea on the ground that there was no merit in the application and that it was amply clear from the charge sheet that the investigation was still pending and it has been filed against other accused persons also Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.

About 95 per cent VL cases in the world are reported from Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Nepal, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan.While general symptoms of VL include fever, weight loss, fatigue, anaemia and substantial swelling of the liver and spleen, infliction of the disease can also be asymptomatic in some cases. Since it is spread by insects and parasites, VL is a community problem and requires individual and society participation in its control.In their project, supported by the Department of Science and Technology - Science and Engineering Research Board’s (DST-SERB) Early Career Research Award, INST scientists have developed an oral nano-medicine with the help of surface-modified solid lipid nano-particles-based combinational system for treating the disease.According to the INST team, till date, there is no study reported where a combination of two anti-leishmanial drugs has been delivered through nano-modification as a potential therapeutic strategy against VL. This work suggests the superiority of the combination prepared by them as a promising approach towards the oral delivery of anti-leishmanial drugs, the Ministry of Science and Technology said on Friday.The INST team was led by Dr Shyam Lal. Anti-leishmanial drugs Amphotericin-B and Paromomycin were encapsulated in solid lipid nano-particles and further modified with a Hydroxypropyl-Cyclodextrin compound. The nano-particle combinatorial drug delivery system developed by them enhanced the efficacy of the formulation by reducing intracellular amastigote growth in cells without causing any significant toxic side-effects.This study by the INST team, published in the journals ‘Scientific Reports’ and ‘Materials Science and Engineering C’, may lead to product and process patents, enhancing indigenous capability for developing innovative therapy against neglected diseases. The usage of lower therapeutic dose of the purified drugs through nano-modifications will greatly help in reducing toxicity, which has been a major hindrance in the existing conventional treatment, when administered orally.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mohali-inst-scientists-develop-new-nano-particle-based-treatment-for-kala-azar-129319

I will order a detailed inquiry into the matter to find out the truth behind the incident," the Chief Minister told reporters.Yediyurappa expressed his sorrow over Dr Nagendra taking his own life at his residence at Alanahalli in Mysuru district on Thursday morning."Generally Rs 30 lakh is given to the doctors who die in line of duty but considering this as a special case, Rs 50 lakh will be given (to his family) and I have also decided to give a government job to any one person of the family."Later, the Chief Minister said the inquiry would be completed in seven days.He said that besides Rs 50 lakh, whatever is due to be given to the next of the kin will be given expeditiously.Meanwhile, an audio conversation purportedly between Nagendra and a senior district-level officer who is heard taking him to task for not conducting enough tests, went viral."How many swabs have to be taken and how many are you extracting? Is it a joke? Have you come here to play? You are playing with the patients. For a week if you are conducting only 25 or 26 (COVID) tests (a day), then I will teach you a lesson. You were supposed to do 150 tests a day," the officer is heard shouting at Dr Nagendra.The situation in Nanjangud was tense following protests over his death.Representing the medical fraternity on coronavirus duty in Mysuru, another government doctor Dr Ravindra poured the woes of medical professionals to the state Medical Education Minister Dr K Sudhakar, who is in charge of coronavirus management in Karnataka."Look at the attendance register. Ever since the outbreak of coronavirus, Nagendra has not taken any leave. He was staying alone for six months because he was afraid that his family may get the coronavirus," a teary-eyed Dr Ravindra told Dr Sudhakar.The Karnataka State Medical Doctors Association has threatened to go on a state-wide strike if those responsible for Dr Nagendra's death are not suspended."We will go on state-wide strike from Monday if those responsible for Dr Nagendra's death are not suspended.Barring emergency cases, no cases will be taken up from Monday," Dr Gulur Srinivas, president, KSMDA, told PTI.

The bus was hijacked on Wednesday and Gupta arrested a day later.The police intercepted the accused Pradeep Gupta in the Fatehabad area of Agra after a brief encounter in which he suffered a bullet injury in his leg.According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Agra, Babloo Kumar, money dispute and not delay in the EMI payment, was the reason for the hijacking of the bus which was owned by Pawan Arora from Gwalior.It is said that Pradeep Gupta was involved in a monetary dispute with Ashok Arora, the father of Pawan Arora.Ashok Arora died due to Covid-19 on Tuesday and the hijacking was planned by the accused Pradeep Gupta to realise the outstanding money Arora owed him.The government spokesperson, on Wednesday, had said that the Shri Ram Finance Company was responsible for taking away the bus with 34 passengers due to non-payment of loan instalments.A district official admitted on Friday that the incident had 'led to panic and some wrong information was given out'.Meanwhile, the Shri Ram Finance Company issued a statement saying that the vehicle is not "repossessed by us nor any of our representative. Company has no relevance to this incident. The loan done against this vehicle from our Gwalior branch has already been settled in the year 2018. We have already met today morning and informed to SHO, Hari Parwat and SP city, Agra pertaining to this matter." The Agra SSP said that Pradeep Gupta was identified by the CCTV footage at the toll plaza on Wednesday as he led the hijacking of the bus.The family members of Ashok Arora identified Pradeep Gupta from the CCTV footage at a toll plaza. He was in the SUV car used by the alleged hijackers.The bus was hijacked on Wednesday at the New Southern By-Pass in Agra. The driver, conductor and helper were asked to get down from the bus and passengers were asked to get into another bus. The hijacked bus was later traced in Etawah district.During interrogation, Gupta told the police that he had business relations with Ashok Arora and his family since 2012. He said that Arora owed him Rs 67 lakh for the registration and permit of his buses that he had arranged for him from Etawah and was not paying back despite repeated reminders. He said that he planned to take away his bus forcibly to recover the amount.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reason-for-up-bus-hijack-not-emi-non-payment-but-monetary-dispute-129311

"Let the BMC face the music before the SC if there is any impediment for the CBI when it comes here."The CBI is here on the orders of the Supreme Court," the bench noted.The court was presiding over two pleas, one filed by law student Dwivendra Dubey, and another by lawyer Priyanak Tibrewal.Rajput (34) was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14.A CBI team has already landed in Mumbai and started probe into the actor's death.The BMC has exempted the visiting CBI personnel from home quarantine rules which have been put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.

He had remained a Judge of the Supreme Court for seven years and six months between April 2012 and November 2019.Justice Gogoi, who retired on November 17, 2019, headed the five-judge Bench which decided the Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute and paved the way for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.Terming the PIL “infructuous”, the Bench wondered why the petitioner didn’t press for a hearing in last two years and now that Justice Gogoi had already retired, he was seeking directions in the matter.“Why did you (petitioner) not press it for hearing in the last two years? This plea has become infructuous as he has demitted office,” it said.Hublikar said he had met the Supreme Court Secretary-General for a listing of his petition but it was not listed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-inquiry-into-conduct-of-ex-cji-ranjan-gogoi-as-judge-129300

21-08-2020||Washington||Joe Biden's elusive quest for 'Biden from Mumbai' continues||When Joe Biden was elected as one of the youngest US senators in 1972, one of the first letters that he received was from Mumbai, with the sender having the same last name as his.About five years ago, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee learned that there are five Bidens living in Mumbai, but is probably yet to make a connection with them.The 'Biden from Mumbai', then known as Bombay, had congratulated Biden on his election as the senator from Delaware and told him that they were related to each other.Biden, then 29, wanted to follow up on the letter and get in touch with the 'Biden from Mumbai'. However, his family and active life in politics meant that this wish remained a wish, something he still wants to fulfil nearly five decades later.The wish may have remained unfulfilled, but the 77-year-old Biden never misses a chance to narrate the 'Biden from Mumbai' story when he meets Indian-Americans and the Indian leaders.The former vice president assures them that he too has an India connection, however, distant it might be.In his address to the Bombay Stock Exchange, Mumbai, on July 24, 2013, during his maiden visit to India as the Vice President of the US, he went off-script to narrate his story of the 'Biden from Mumbai'."It's an honour to be back in India and to be here in Mumbai. Off script for a second here, I was reminded - I was elected to the United States Senate when I was a 29-year-old kid back in 1972, and one of the first letters I received and I regret I never followed up on it. Maybe, some genealogist in audience can follow up for me, but I received a letter from a gentleman named Biden - Biden, my name - from Mumbai, asserting that we were related,” Biden had told the audience amidst peals of laughter."Seriously. Suggesting that our mutual, great, great, great, something or other worked for the East India Trading Company back in the 1700s and came to Mumbai," Biden said.A few years later at another speech in Washington DC, Biden said that their forefathers were same, who worked for the East India Company and visited India then."He (Biden from Mumbai) went back to our mutual great, great, great grandfather, 1848, who was a British captain in the East India Tea Company. And he married I believe an Indian woman. And he settled in India," Biden said in his address to the US India Business Council on September 21, 2015."And so I was thinking about it, if that's true, I might run here in India for office. I might be qualified (to run for elected office in India). But I've never followed up on it (the letter from Biden from Mumbai)," Biden told the Mumbai audience in 2013, who could not stop laughing at it."But now that I'm back for the multiple times, I'm going to follow up to find out whether there is a Biden and whether we're related. I hope he's in good standing if we are," he said, evoking bouts of laughter from the audience.In the Washington DC event hosted by US Indian Business Council, Biden said that a day after his Mumbai speech, a journalist gave him a list of five Bidens living in Mumbai."The next day the press, I guess trying to prove that I was probably making this up - because I never followed up. It was right after I got elected, and then some things happened in my family, and I never followed up. One reporter stood up and gave me the names of five Bidens in Mumbai," he said."So, show me more respect," Biden has told the Washington DC audience while asserting his Indian connection."You know what I mean? I didn't realise I had so many... And I haven't actually followed up and embarrassed the Bidens in Mumbai. But the point is, it makes it even clearer what a small, small world this is and how this global economy is suited for, quite frankly, the two largest democracies in the world," Biden said in 2015.

We survived because of the dedication shown by the medical staff...it is nothing short of a miracle," the centenarian woman's son said before heading home.District collector Ravindra Binwade and district superintendent of police S Chaitanya, who were present for the farewell programme, appreciated the efforts of the hospital staff.

21-08-2020||Naveen S Garewal||9 killed in fire at Telangana hydel power plant||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, August 21In a tragic turn of events, all nine persons trapped in a tunnel in the Srisailam Dam since last night have died.Nine people were trapped in a tunnel following a fire, possibly due to a short circuit. The announcement of the fatalities came on Friday afternoon. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has ordered an inquiry into the incident.For over 14 hours, a relentless effort was made to rescue those trapped at the Telangana State Generation Corporation (TS Genco) plant at Srisailam canal’s left bank in Nagarkurnool district.The dead include assistant engineers and divisional engineers. The rescue teams led by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have pulled out the bodies that suggested death by suffocation.Those who have been identified include Assistant Engineers Mohan Kumar, Uzma Fatima, and Sunder; Divisional Engineers Srinivas Goud and Mahesh; and an employee of a battery company.From the 30 odd persons reported to be present at the spot, 15 escaped to safety through a tunnel and another six were rescued by the rescue personnel. Employees from the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) pitched in the rescue operations after the local staff was unable to douse the fire caused by a short circuit in unit one of the underground powerhouse.Telangana Energy Minister Jagadish Reddy said: “A series of explosions took place leading to chaos.

It would be “act of impropriety”, the Bench told Dave.However, it said the punishment would not be acted upon until his petition seeking review of the August 14 order convicting him of contempt of court was decided.Attorney General KK Venugopal requested the top court not to punish Bhushan for contempt of court. “It would be tremendously good if Bhushan is given some time,” Venugopal said.However, Bhushan said his statement was a well thought-out. “It’s unlikely there will be substantial change in my statement,” Bhushan said. “We can give you time… and it is better if you consider it… we will give you two or three days,” the Bench told Bhushan.Justice Mishra, due to retire next month, said, “In my judicial career, I have never held anyone guilty of contempt.” The Bench said it could be very lenient if Bhushan realised his mistake. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prashant-gets-4-days-to-tender-apology-129096

The maximum number of stakeholders have opted for mobile phones as a medium for teaching-learning during the Covid-19 outbreak,” the survey by the NCERT said.“About 36 per cent of the students used the textbooks and other books available with them.
