Remaining 10 years other Leftists like VKRV Rao,” he tweeted.In the same slide he questioned what did they do?“Industrial scale distortion of History, negation and whitewashing of bloody Islamic invasions/rule.... Enormous patronisation of pro-Left & pro-Minority academicians/ scholars by Govt; Systematic sidelining/elimination of all pro-Hindu Nationalist academicians/scholars by Govt,” he tweeted.              This was among four slides that Rao, an Odisha cadre officer of 1986-batch, tweeted on Saturday.Rao was given interim charge as the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after the government had sent then Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana on forced leave in October, 2018.After new Director Rishi Kumar Shukla took over, Rao was posted as the Director General of Home Guards, Fire Services and Civil Defence, a post offered to Verma earlier but he had rejected it.              In a tweet accompanying the slides, Rao said, “Story of Project Abrahamisation of Hindu Civilization” which listed six points below: “1. Deny Hindus their knowledge, 2.Vilify Hinduism as collection of superstitions, 3. Abrahamise Education, 4. Abrahamise Media & Entertainment, 5. Shame Hindus about their identity, 6. Bereft of glue of Hinduism Hindu society dies.”     The tweets were questioned by academics and journalists over service rules and propriety.The All India Service Rules mandates every member to maintain high ethical standards, integrity and political neutrality.Adding tweets in same series on Sunday, Rao went on to say, “Adhominem attacks neither alter reality nor rebut facts. Rather they confirm it. Some questioned my alleged violation of Constitution and rules. But I ask, do the Constitution and rules ordain abrahamisation of Hindu civilisation? Debate on Facts rather than usual boring propaganda.”              Rao had faced controversy earlier after the West Bengal Police alleged that his wife had received payments from a businessman, a claim he denied through his signed press statement while being interim chief of the CBI.He had called the transaction as a loan which was repaid.

Two days later, a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had also decided to resume hearing in another contempt of court case against Bhushan pending since 2009. The two cases are listed for hearing on August 4 and 5.The group, which included former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice AP Shah and several retired bureaucrats and academics, appealed to the top court to drop the criminal contempt proceedings against Bhushan.Describing Bhushan as a relentless crusader for the rights of the weakest sections of society, the group asked the court to withdraw the contempt proceedings at the earliest in the "interest of justice and fairness" and to maintain dignity of the court.The signatories to the statement also included author Arundhati Roy, former Navy chief Admiral L Ramdas, CPI General Secretary D Raja, CPI(M) Politburo member Brinda Karat, former Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and RTI activists Aruna Roy, Anjali Bharadwaj and Nikhil Dey, besides others.They said an institution as important as the Supreme Court must be open to public discussion without the fear of retribution or action of criminal contempt.Noting that Bhushan spent his career in pro bono legal service to those who didn't have ready access to justice, they said, "He has fought cases at the Apex Court on issues ranging from environmental protection, human rights, civil liberties, corruption in high places, and has been an outspoken champion for judicial accountability and reforms, especially in the higher judiciary.""In the past few years, serious questions have been raised about the reluctance of the Supreme Court to play its constitutionally mandated role as a check on governmental excesses and violations of fundamental rights of people by the state," the statement read.Questions have been raised by all sections of society, including media, academics, civil society organisations, members of the legal fraternity, and sitting and retired judges of the Supreme Court, they said.The group also questioned the Supreme Court's alleged reluctance to intervene in a timely manner to avert the migrant crisis during COVID-19 lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-judges-activists-come-out-in-support-of-prashant-bhushan-118663

As IAF fighters are not going to overfly Pakistan, they will first hit the Gujarat coast after taking off from Al Dofra and then turn northwards.The direct distance from Al Dofra to Jamnagar is 1,610 km and from Jamnagar to Ambala is 1,100 km.This makes it roughly 8,140 km from the origin to the destination. Aircraft never fly directly between two places and the route comprises several waypoints, depending upon airspace availability, restricted areas, international treaties, etc., where they are supposed to make turns or change course.Read also | In photos: First batch of 5 Rafale jets takes off from France for IndiaAmbala gets ready to receive first 5 IAF Rafale jetsSince the exact air traffic route that the Rafale aircraft are taking is known and they have to overfly several countries, the route would predictably be a bit longer than the direct distances between the aforementioned places.According to a fighter pilot, the cruise speed of aircraft during long range ferry missions is about 14 km per minute, which translates to 840 km per hour. If the Rafales have to traverse a total distance of over 8,140 km, the pilots could end up spending over 10 hours in the cockpit, albeit in two phases. Start-up procedures, taxing time, overhead circling and approach also have to be considered.The Rafale has a top speed of 2,223 kmph at high altitude and 1,390 kmph at lower altitude. Pictures of IAF Rafales taking-off from France have shown them to be equipped with three drop tanks for extra fuel – one under each wing and one on the underbelly centerline, giving them a ferry range of about 3,700 km. A French Air Force tanker would render mid-air refueling support during the Merignac – Abu Dabhi leg, which IAF officer estimate would be done over the Mediterranean Sea, closer towards the coast of Egypt or Israel.The stretch from Abu Dabhi to Ambala, via Gujarat can be covered without mid-air refueling.In recent times, IAF pilots have flown fighters over long distances on several occasions before when SU-30s and Jaguars have gone to Europe and North America for joint military exercises. IAF IL-78 aerial refuellers accompanied them. There have been instances in the past when newly purchases fighters have flown in from Europe after making several stops enroute.Continuous flight in a fighter over several hours has physical, psychological and physiological implications for pilots. Unlike a transport aircraft, the cockpit of a fighter is cramped with no room for bodily movements and the physical and mental demands of flying a fighter and the endurance required are more than that in larger aircraft.Once the five aircraft, three single seaters and two twin-seater trainers, touch down at Ambala Air Force Station and are inducted into No. 17 Squadron, the Golden Arrows, it would be all work.While the first batch of the aircraft and the pilots and ground crew accompanying them are said to be fully operational, their immediate task would be to train and indoctrine additional pilots and ground crew as more aircraft come in. As the squadron begins forming and expanding more and more officers and airmen would be posted in.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-will-take-10-hours-flying-from-france-for-rafales-to-reach-home-118654
27-07-2020||New Delhi||Concerns are founded on draft EIA 2020 notification, Jairam Ramesh tells Javadekar||A day after Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar termed as “unfounded and based on misinterpretation” his “suggestions” regarding the contentious draft EIA notification 2020, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change Jairam Ramesh said on Monday that his “concerns are founded very much on what is there in black and white” “You accuse me of misrepresenting the provisions of the Draft EIA 2020 Notification. Please allow me to respond in detail correlating my stated objections with specific provisions contained in the Notification,” Ramesh said in a detailed four-page letter to Javadekar.“You say my suggestions (surely you mean my concerns!) are unfounded. All I can say is that these concerns are founded very much on what is there in black and white in the draft EIA 2020 Notification,” added the former Environment Minister Regarding the most contentious provision in the draft, the post-facto project clearance, Ramesh said in March 2017 the ministry issued a Gazette notification giving projects that violate the EIA notification a one-time six-month window to approach the ministry for post facto approvals. Since then the ministry has set up a special “Violations” EAC that is regularly reviewing post facto approvals, including two large mining and real estate projects and also projects like LG Polymers where there was a recent gas leak, he said The draft notification now accepts that “such violations being recurring in nature” and introduced a mechanism of dealing with violation cases, Ramesh said, adding that with the notification the government is “routinising” the recurrent nature of violations. The Supreme Court has observed that post facto clearances are not recognised under the environmental jurisprudence and are also against the precautionary principle, he added. Ramesh wrote about his other concerns, including “reducing” public participation in all steps of environmental clearance process and “doing way” with environment impact assessment all together in very many cases of modernisation and expansion, referring to specific clauses in the notification. In his previous letter he claimed that proposed changes “are not based on audits, assessments and analyses or any research but reflected a mindset that sees environmental regulation as an unnecessary regulatory burden”. The proposed changes in environmental clearance process will “routinely legitimise illegality and promote land grab, not development”, Ramesh said to which Javdekar told him on Monday that all his “suggestions are unfounded and based on misinterpretation”.  The Environment Minister said the draft notification is kept in the public domain for comments and suggestions. “Your suggestions are noted. There are 15 more days for suggestions. I will reply to you in detail. Government will finalise after considering various suggestions,. Government decisions are always open for scrutiny by Parliament and Standing Committee,” Javadekar said.The notification that aims to overhaul the environmental clearance process has received widespread criticism from several environmental experts who are questioning various provisions, especially post-facto project clearance, doing away with the mandatory process of public consultation for a wide range of projects and increasing validity of the environment clearances.  According to Ramesh the draft “has provisions that will routinely legitimise illegality” and “reduces public participation in all steps of the environment clearance process”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/concerns-are-founded-on-draft-eia-2020-notification-jairam-ramesh-tells-javadekar-118652
27-07-2020||New Delhi||DBT readies 5 sites for final phase of human trials of Oxford COVID vaccine||Five sites across the country are ready for the third and final phase of human trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Secretary Renu Swarup said on Monday.This is an essential step because it is necessary to have data within the country before the vaccine is administered to Indians, Swarup told PTI.The Serum Institute of India, the largest vaccine maker in the world, has been chosen by Oxford and its partner AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine once it is ready. Trials results for the first two phases were published earlier this month. According to Swaroop, the DBT is part of any COVID-19 vaccine effort in India “… whether it is funding, whether it is facilitating the regulatory clearances or whether it is giving them access to different networks which exist within the country”.“The DBT is now setting up Phase 3 clinical sites. We have already started working on them and five sites are now ready to be available for Phase 3 trials,” Swarup told PTI in a telephonic interview.The Pune-based SII has also sought permission from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for conducting Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the potential vaccine.It had said earlier it will start manufacturing the vaccine even before the final nod so it is ready with sizable volumes once the vaccine gets all permissions.“DBT is closely working with every manufacturer and Phase 3 trial of Serum (institute) is important because if the vaccine has to be successful and it has to be given to the Indian population we need to have the data within the country.“For that a Phase 3 trial has been proposed. Five sites are ready. Within some more weeks, they should be ready for manufacturers to take them up for clinical trial studies,” the DBT secretary said.On July 20, scientists announced that the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University appears safe and induces a strong immune response within the body after the first phase of “promising” human trials against the deadly disease that has infected over 1.45 crore people across the world and claimed more than six lakh lives.Doses of the vaccine were given to 1,077 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 in five UK hospitals in April and May as part of the Phase 1 clinical trial and results, published in The Lancet medical journal.The results show they induced strong antibody and T-cell immune responses for up to 56 days after they were given. T-cells are crucial for maintaining protection against the virus for years. The findings are seen as promising, but experts feel it is too soon to know if this is enough to offer protection as larger trials get underway.Scientists behind the trials found the response could be even greater after a second dose.In Phase 1 of human trials, a vaccine is given to a small number of people to test safety. It is also given to check if it stimulates the immune system.In the second phase, it is administered to hundreds of people split into groups such as children and the elderly to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. The two phases focus on safety and immunogenicity in humans.In the third phase, the vaccine is administered to thousands of people.In India, two indigenous vaccines – one by Zydus Cadila and the other by Bharat Biotech – have reached the stage of phase one of human trials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dbt-readies-5-sites-for-final-phase-of-human-trials-of-oxford-covid-vaccine-118649

Further to check the rising cases touching almost a lakh, the state has also announced mandatory RT-PCR test for those who test negative for COVID-19 antigen test.Health, Medical, and Family Welfare Department issued an order on Monday saying the hospitals and the labs where the tests are carried out must have permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It would now be mandatory for the hospital or laboratory to be affiliated with the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH).According to the latest data released by the state government, the number of COVID-19 positive cases has crossed the one lakh mark with a whopping rise of 6,051 cases in the past 24 hours. The recovery in the past 24 hours stands at 3,257 with 49 deaths. The total number of deaths stands at 1,090 in the state.The Andhra Pradesh Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Nani) said that out of the 51,701 active cases recorded in the state, over 15,000 were in-home quarantine and about 14,000 were admitted to COVID-19 hospitals and about 16,000 were in COVID-19 care centres. The minister also stated that his government is spending Rs 5 crore per day on testing and a total of Rs 350 crore per month on COVID-19 management.The price of Rs 750 test will include the cost of the rapid kit, Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and manpower. The Andhra Pradesh government has set a price cap of Rs 2,800 per sample for RT-PCR testing. All institutions that intend to do rapid antigen tests should necessarily have to tie up with ICMR approved Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), the government order reads.Through this Government Order (GO), the Andhra Government also intends to give login credentials to primary, community, area, and district health care facilities across the state and also to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) labs. Besides, the state government had also decided to issue login credentials to as many hospitals as possible, to speed up uploading of COVID-19 test results to the ICMR portal to keep the data current.Neighbouring Telangana that has been questioned for lower testing has reported 1473 new cases in the past 24 hours with 8 more deaths from COVID-19. The total number of COVID-19 cases reported in Telangana so far stands at 55,532 out of which 12,955 are active cases.

Movements of such terrorists have also been seen along the LoC near Samba and Rajouri-Poonch in Jammu.Even as security forces have reasonably been successful in stemming infiltration bids along the LoC Kupwara and south of Pir Panjal, sources in the security establishment said the armed forces are aware that they can’t lower the guard both in Jammu and the Kashmir Valley, particularly when they have been alerted “Pakistan’s ISI and terror groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are waiting for an opportunity to look for gaps in the security grid to disrupt the peace in the valley”.The sources said thus keeping in view the heightened threats in the coming days the security agencies have been asked to remain on a high vigil, particularly in the light of upcoming festivals like Eid, Rakshabandhan and Independence Day.The inputs are specific to suggest that Pak-based terrorists were seen looking for infiltration routes falling in these areas, they added.According to officials in the security establishment two terrorists were killed at the LoC on July 11 while making bids to infiltrate, as three of them were injured on June 30 in a similar attempt. These attempts were made from Pakistani posts, Chakpatra or Tariq under Mandal sector (Leepa Valley), opposite the Tungdhar sector in Kupwara, they added.The intelligence sources later confirmed that after they were injured they were taken to the Field Trauma Centre in Leepa run by Pakistan Army. Similarly, on May 25, three terrorists were killed along LoC in Naushera area of Rajouri sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intel-agencies-alert-forces-along-loc-as-300-terrorists-waiting-to-cross-over-ahead-of-festivities-118638
27-07-2020||Islamabad||Jadhav case: Pakistan government presents ordinance in National Assembly||The Pakistan government on Monday presented an ordinance in the National Assembly in view of the International Court of Justice’s ruling in the case of Indian death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav, despite protests by the Opposition parties.Under the ‘International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance 2020’, which was enacted on May 20, a petition for the review of a military court’s decision can be made to Islamabad High Court through an application within 60 days of its promulgation.Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.Under the law, the ordinance should be presented in Parliament. The Prime Minister’s Advisor on Parliamentary Affairs, Babar Awan, placed the ordinance before the lower house, Geo TV reported.Last week, a similar effort was foiled by Opposition parties---Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan People-s Party (PPP)---which staged a walkout by pointing out lack of quorum to transact any business in the house.Law Minister Farogh Naseem on Friday asked the Opposition parties to ‘”void politics” on the issue and warned them that India would take the matter to the UN Security Council if the ICJ verdict was not implemented.In a unilateral move, Pakistan last week filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court, seeking appointment of a “legal representative” for Jadhav.However, the main parties, including the government of India, were not consulted ahead of the filing of the application by the Ministry of Law and Justice under the ordinance.In New Delhi, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said Pakistan has once again exposed its “farcical” approach by denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence which is also in contravention of the ICJ verdict, and asserted that it will explore further options in the case.Srivastava said Pakistan has blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available to India in the case, while noting that New Delhi has so far requested consular access to Jadhav for 12 times over the past one year.“The whole exercise of not providing documents related to the case even after repeated requests, not providing an unimpeded consular access and some reported unilateral action of approaching the High Court on part of Pakistan again exposes the farcical nature of Pakistan’s approach,” he said.The MEA spokesperson said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of ICJ, but also of its own ordinance.

27-07-2020||---||India transfers 10 diesel locomotives to Bangladesh||New Delhi, July 27India and Bangladesh have further strengthened their communication ties with the transfer of 10 diesel locomotives. Indian Railways has sent WDM3D locomotives which were specifically requested by the Bangladesh side after an inspection.Based on technology by General Motors, the Railways had modified the engines to Indian conditions and had even altered the microprocessor that had given teething troubles.These engines, manufactured at Varanasi, are already doing duty on new lines laid in northern Sri Lanka as part of Colombo’s efforts to bring development to the region after the end of the civil war with LTTE.The WDM3D has also been exported to Myanmar.Indian Railways first began exporting locomotives to Bangladesh in 1996 and since then it has supplied an estimated 50 locomotives of different gauges and variations.More important, the export of diesel locos will open up an avenue for India which has a high quality of expertise in this area but is tapering off their production as it is shifting to much more powerful diesel locos and electric traction.On the other hand the traffic load in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh and even Pakistan is not high enough to justify huge capital investment in the electrification of tracks. Hence, such locos with mid-range horse power are ideal for these nations whereas India has a huge production base and immense experience in their upkeep. India produced about 600 diesel engines of this make, of which about 500 are still in operation.In line with this thinking, sources in the Ministry of External Affairs said Indian Railways is keen to partner with Bangladesh Railways for the supply and maintenance of all types of rolling stock. These locos will also enable interchange with Indian Railways.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-transfers-10-diesel-locomotives-to-bangladesh-118630

27-07-2020||New Delhi/Mumbai||Education dreams fade for millions in digitally divided India||The digital divide stretches long and deep across the expanse of India, further separating the haves from the have-nots and the tech-empowered from the tech-deprived with millions of children struggling to keep up with the challenges of online classes.The coronavirus pandemic that forced people into their homes and forced schools and colleges to move to virtual classes has edged education dreams with conditions aplenty---a computer or at least a smartphone, proper internet connectivity and uninterrupted power supply.The education playing field, never really level, is now potholed and bumpy as students, and their teachers, in cities, towns and villages scramble to cope with the demands of the times.Children in a small settlement in the floodplains of the Yamuna along the Delhi-Noida border, for instance, have never had it easy. They would cross the river in a boat to reach school, just minutes away from the bright lights of the national capital and its suburb.Four months ago, when India went into lockdown, their odds increased manifold.Joshna Kumar, 12, has a phone but often no electricity so it is difficult to attend her online classes everyday.Most residents of the settlement rely on Charan Singh, a cattle rearer who visits daily, to charge their phones. And so does she.“Every evening I give my phone for charging. He brings it charged next morning,” she said, sitting on a charpoy in the backyard of her home, quickly scrolling through her Whatsapp messages to take down notes and finish her homework. To save battery, Joshna keeps the brightness of her phone low.Her 10-year-old brother studying in the same school mostly stays away from class. When he does attend, Joshna has to miss school and catch up through pre-recorded videos. Their father is a daily wage worker and another phone cannot happen for them.Her story finds echo in Faridabad, Haryana, where Suchi Singh, a Class 8 student, said there is only smartphone between her three siblings and her. So, the four take turns in attending class.That Suchi, a topper, is forced to miss class troubles her father Rajesh Kumar, a newspaper vendor, but he said he has no option. A smartphone is a luxury when he is struggling to provide for his family.“E-classes have made life difficult,” he said, pessimistic about what the future holds for him and his children.Hundreds of kilometres away in Mumbai’s Aarey Colony, Jyoti Randhe, a Class 10 student in a municipal school, shares a smartphone with her mother who takes it to work. Her classmate Roshni Nere has to divide her phone time with two sisters who also take e-classes. Roshni’s mother said she is worried about her future and appeals to authorities to at least equip them with the required technology.Some students don’t have that option either.Like Sumit Wadakar, who studies in the same school and whose father Laxman Wadakar works as a security guard in Mumbai’s Film City. He said candidly his salary is not enough to buy a smartphone.The numbers tell the story of e-education deepening the rift.According to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation for 2017-18, only 10.7 percent Indians have computers while 23.8 per cent have internet facilities.A nationwide survey of villages conducted by the Ministry of Rural Development in 2017-‘18 estimated that 16 per cent of households received one to eight hours of electricity daily, 33 per cent received nine-12 hours and only 47 per cent received more than 12 hours of electricity a day.In Srinagar, the circumstances are different but the helplessness the same.Sheik Sulayman Mushtaq’s parents can afford his private school education but there is only 2G connectivity in Kashmir Valley. The slow speed means the Class 10 student can’t exchange large files and or live stream classes on his computer.While students juggle between problems of connectivity, lack of screens and no electricity, teachers are in a bind too.  Jeyaishwari RC Nadar, who teaches Maths to Class 5 and Class 6 children in a Mumbai school, uses a transparent tray from her refrigerator as her mobile stand when she conducts classes. She said about 10-15 students in her class are not able to attend online sessions.It is difficult even for those who are able to attend because Maths particularly requires one-on-one interaction with students for better understanding, she said.Jaishwar Sulochana, who teaches Hindi and History in a school in Mumbai’s densely populated Dharavi slum, believed to be Asia’s largest slum, said many of her students live in one-room houses. The background noise breaks their concentration. And while most families have smartphones, some students are unable to join classes as their parents take their devices when they step out for work.“The need of the hour is to equip these students with mobile phones and tabs so that they can at least attend classes. There is no satisfaction in teaching students via online classes,” she said.Children with special needs face a whole different set of challenges.“Despite connectivity and other issues, online classes have the potential to be more beneficial for these students as their parents sit with them and are able to explain to their children. This helps in educating both the child and parent,” said Neeta Hemant Dhuri, a speech therapist in Mumbai who takes classes for the hearing impaired. She uses daily objects, pictures and toys to teach language concepts such as prepositions and verbs through her laptop.NGOs working with people with disabilities have expressed concern over the issues faced by students in e-education. Akhila Sivadas, executive director at the Centre for Advocacy and Research, a non-profit organisation, said the government needs to provide education that is accessible to students with disabilities.Innovation is often the name of the game.Sandeep Saggar, a PE teacher in Delhi, uses a broom and everyday daily objects that he can grab to teach students hockey from his garage. He said parents must pay fees on time so students and teachers can look after each other and continue whatever little learning is possible in these difficult COVID-19 times.

27-07-2020||Noida||Noida varsity makes self-sanitising gloves, devices that alert user on social distancing breach||Researchers at a private university in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida have developed smart devices that raise alarm when social-distancing norms are breached and a user touches their face, besides designing gloves that dispense sanitiser automatically.The wearable-devices are affordable and operate on battery, they said, claiming they can be effective in fighting the spread of the novel coronavirus.The device for social-distancing alarm can be worn like a wrist band and warns users if someone comes closer than six feet to them, according to the research scientists at Amity University, Noida. “It’s a handy, small, portable, low-cost, low-powered battery-operated smart electronic device. This electronic device can maintain the social distance of 6 feet between two persons by giving signal through buzzer and light indications alarm. It warns both the persons, having the same device, if violating the social distancing conditions,” the varsity said. “The pocket-friendly device is in the form of a band and can be worn like a wrist watch which will work even if a group of people is coming closer from multiple directions. Each unit of this invention will cost around Rs. 400-500 and the option of chargeable battery can also be easily made in these devices,” it said.The research group has been working for around three months under VK Jain, a distinguished scientist and professor at the university’s Institute of Advanced Research and Studies (Materials & Devices).The group has also developed a “locket” which notifies the user every time they touch their face, a common habit, the scientists said, that spreads the virus. “This wearable, small, portable, low-cost and low-powered battery operated electronic device will support individuals in building positive habits by raising an alarm every time a user moves their hands to touch their face. This novel electronic gadget is very affordable, lightweight and can be worn around the neck like a locket,” the university said. “The device can within no time detect whenever a person’s hand approaches their face using an infrared-based proximity sensor technology. The buzzer alarm, LED light and vibration motor shakes out as an alert that will become stronger as the hand gets closer to the face,” it said.The researchers have also designed a unique type of gloves which not only protects the person who is using it but also prevents any spread of virus through its special design. “The inner layer is the same as a normal safety glove followed by a second layer consisting of a special material loaded with antiviral agents or sanitiser or disinfectant. The top-most layer is perforated to release the antiviral agent on the top surface which makes the gloves free from virus and prevent its spread,” the university said. “The pressure to release the sanitiser on the surface of the gloves is generated by the movement of the fingers when they hold any object. Along with providing safety, these gloves won’t allow the spread of virus on disposal as it contains sanitiser,” it added.Jain, who led the researches, said the group has focussed upon the three basic attributes of ensuring social distancing, usage of gloves and stopping people from touching their face to limit the spread of the virus. “If we can curb these three basic instincts the spread of the virus can be limited,” he said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/noida-varsity-makes-self-sanitising-gloves-devices-that-alert-user-on-social-distancing-breach-118621

Before starting any construction work we worship the Mother Earth, seek her permission to dig and construct structures and obtain her blessings for the mission which cannot be done through video-conference," Kumar added.Meanwhile, CPI parliamentary group leader Binoy Viswam on Monday wrote a letter to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar asking him not to allow use of the national broadcaster, Doordarshan, to broadcast the religious function at Ayodhya on August 5.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-on-edge-over-bhumi-pujan-at-ayodhya-118620

A French Air Force plane will deliver the equipment on Tuesday, a day before five French-made Rafale fighter jets land in India.An expert medical mission on inter-hospital transfers of extremely critical cases will also arrive by the same plane to strengthen Indian capabilities in this regard.In fact, the main focus of the French aid is to enable safe transfer of critically-ill Covid patients. The matter was discussed in a letter President of France Emmanuel Macron wrote last week to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said the Embassy of France in a news statement.The French Air Force A330 which is bringing in the medical team, test kits and ventilators is equipped with a “Morpheus” kit, which enables the transport of critically ill patients. In March, the A 330 MRT (multi-role tanker) had first flown six patients severely hit by Covid with an onboard medical evacuation unit.In the letter, Macron noted that when France was going through a critical phase of the public health crisis, India was “by our side”. Now that India is going through a difficult phase, France has responded to the needs identified by the Indian Government, added the French President.As part of the medical assistance package, France is donating 50 Osiris-3 and 70 Yuwell ventilators. Osiris ventilators are particularly useful for emergency transport while Yuwell ventilators have a non-invasive technique to supply oxygen to the lungs.France will also donate 50,000 high-quality serological test kits and 50,000 nose and throat swabs and modes of medical transport.The Ambassador of France Emmanuel Lenain will hand over the medical equipment to Indian Red Cross Society officials at the Palam Air Force Station.France previously provided credit of 200 million Euros to help India provide relief to the poor through a programme designed by the World Bank. In addition, French companies have contributed over Rs 48 crore to national relief funds, including the PM CARES Fund.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/france-to-donate-high-end-ventilators-to-india-118613

I am willing to argue on merits," Dave had said, adding, "Habeas Corpus petitions cannot be delayed and dragged in this manner."Qayoom, who suffers from many ailments, has been under detention since August 5, 2019, following nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution.On May 28, a division Bench of the J&K High Court had dismissed his petition against his detention under the Public Safety Act.While upholding his prolonged detention, the High Court had suggested that he should submit a representation declaring that he had "shunned" his ideology. Then the government authorities would exercise their discretion "to take a decision" on any such representation, it had said.On July 15, the Supreme Court had sought to know the basis of Qayoom's continued detention under the J&K Public Safety Act."These are COVID19 times...He is 73 years old. We want to know on what basis you would like to detain him in Delhi's Tihar (Jail)? Moreover, his detention period per order is about to expire," the Bench had told Mehta.As the Solicitor General said Qayoom's ideology went against national interest, the Bench had said, "His ideology remains the same.”“All the earlier FIRs against Qayoom date as far back as 2010. In the current scenario would you still like to keep this pending?" it had asked.On June 26, the top court had issued notice to the J&K Administration on Qayoom's petition challenging the May 28 order of the J&K High Court upholding his detention under the Public Safety Act, 1978.It had also directed the authorities to provide him summer clothing and daily essentials in Tihar Jail where he is currently lodged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-extend-kashmir-bar-association-chief-abdul-qayooms-detention-beyond-aug-6-government-tells-sc-118604

27-07-2020||Mumbai||Rising COVID-19 cases: Report says India’s FY21 GDP to contract by 6 per cent||Expecting prolonged restrictions in movements due to rising COVID-19 cases, a foreign brokerage has cut India’s FY21 GDP estimate sharply to a contraction of 6 per cent as against 4 per cent earlier.In the “bear case” scenario, if the vaccine against the novel coronavirus is delayed, the GDP contraction can go up to 7.5 per cent, analysts at Bofa Securities have said.To arrest the spread of the virus, the Centre first announced a country-wide lockdown in March, which brought economic activities to a standstill.Later, it began a process of unlocking, but localised lockdowns continue because of high number of cases. All the analysts, including those at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), expect a contraction in GDP in FY21, with some pegging a negative growth of up to 9.5 per cent.The analysts at Bofa said they now expect the current restrictions to stretch till mid-November because of a spike in the number of cases and added that as per its base case, 1 percentage point of GDP is lost for every month of lockdown.A base case is the most probable case or expected case. While a bear case means a typically pessimistic case.“India’s daily COVID-19 cases have risen by 5.8x to 48,661 since Unlock 1.0 began in June,” it said, adding that both the total number of cases at 1.39 million and the 32,063 deaths are “relatively limited” to the overall population of 1.4 billion.It also added that despite limitation on the health infrastructure side, the testing has ramped up to 4 lakh a day.If the global economy has to wait for a vaccine against the virus for a year, India’s real GDP will contract by 7.5 per cent in FY21, it said, adding that its earlier estimate on the same was for a 5 per cent contraction.In response to the sharper contraction in GDP, the RBI will go for further easing in its monetary policy, it said.It can be noted that the central bank has already delivered rate cuts of 1.15 per cent in two moves since the onset of the pandemic.The brokerage said high real lending rates, adjusted for core WPI (wholesale price inflation) as a proxy for pricing power, constrain recovery beyond the COVID-19 shock at present.It said while the nominal Marginal Cost of funding based Lending Rate (MCLR) has come off by 1.05 per cent since March 2019 on RBI easing, the real MCLR has jumped 0.44 per cent, as the WPI dropped to 0.8 per cent in June from 2.3 per cent in March 2019.The decline in GDP will also impact the fiscal math and the Centre’s fiscal deficit will come at 7 per cent (as against a budget target of 3.5 per cent) in the base case scenario, it said.

He had insulted our soldiers at the time of the surgical strike, the Balakot airstrike and now again he has insulted them,” Rao said.He further said Rahul Gandhi’s political career ended in 2019 after he insulted the soldiers.Citing a reply given by the Congress-led UPA government in November 2012 in the Parliament, Rao said during the tenure of various governments led by the Gandhi family, they ceded more than 43,000 sq kms of land to China.Gandhi made his remarks in a tweet, along with an over-a-minute-long video, as part of a series launched by him on the India-China face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“If you want me to lie that the Chinese have not entered this country, I am not going to lie. I will simply not do it. I do not care if my whole career goes to hell. I am not going to lie. This disturbs me. Frankly, it makes my blood boil. How can some other nation just come into our territory? Hiding the truth is anti-national. Bringing it to people’s attention is patriotic,” Gandhi said in his video.

They were later released and arrived here on Sunday after India granted them visas and facilitated their travel.Recalling his ordeal, Sachdeva, who was released on July 18, said he was given death threats several times in captivity and had lost all hope of returning alive. “I was beaten up and traumatised. I was told ‘we will send your head back to India’,” he said.Sachdeva says he still gets nightmares of the beatings that he endured in captivity. “We saw a lot of violence in front of our eyes. I keep getting nightmares and wake up all panicky,” he said.“But now that I have returned to India, I feel all the pain that I endured due to constant beatings in captivity has vanished,” Sachdeva said.Calling India “heaven”, he thanked the Indian government for facilitating their return. “There are many Sikh brothers and sisters in the country (Afghanistan) still. I request the government to bring them back too,” he said.Pyaara Singh, who was also among those who returned, said India was his home and other Sikhs who were stranded there also want to return.“India is our home and I want to request the government to bring all Sikhs back and give them citizenship. They all want to return to India. We feel safe and secure here,” he said.Gurjeet Singh, 30, said he was looking forward to starting his life in India.“I have lost many family members in attacks. I am happy on returning and I hope others also get to return to India. The situation in Afghanistan is not conducive but that does not mean that everyone is bad there. There are people who were sympathetic to our plight too,” he said.“But then there are also people who consider us infidels and look down upon us,” Gurjeet Singh added.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had last week said India had been receiving requests from members of Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan which had faced a spurt in attacks terrorists.“They want to move to India, they want to settle down here and despite the ongoing COVID situation, we are facilitating these requests,” he had said at a weekly briefing.“The Indian Embassy in Kabul is providing them necessary visas to come here and once they reach here, their requests will be examined and acted upon based on existing rules and policies,” Srivastava had said.

We believe that Lord Ram is our ancestor,” he said.Wasi Haider, also a native of Faizabad, echoed similar sentiments.“We believe in the fundamentals of Islam and we practice Islam, but we also believe that Lord Ram was our ancestor. It will be great that we will witness the construction of the Ram temple,” he said.Haji Saeed said Indian Muslims consider Lord Ram as ‘Imam-e-Hind’.Rashid Ansari said he hopes he gets a chance to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the Ram Janmabhoomi site.“If due to security and other reasons I don’t get a chance to go there, I will celebrate the beginning of the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” he said.Awadh province in charge of Muslim Rashtriya Manch Anil Singh said some Muslim devotees of Lord Ram are coming to Ayodhya from other states to join the celebrations in the holy town.“One of the devotees is coming to Ayodhya with bricks from his native state Chhattisgarh for the construction of the temple,” he said.According to members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Ayodhya for the ceremony to begin the construction of the Ram temple.Anil Mishra, a member of the trust, told PTI on Sunday that veteran BJP leaders LK Advani, MM Joshi and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat were among those being invited to the ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony which will be telecast live by Doordarshan.Besides, there was a plan to invite spiritual leaders from all faiths, he had said.In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and social-distancing restrictions, there will be a limited gathering of up to 200 people at the event, they said according to Mishra.

As per established conventions of the Constitution, principles of parliamentary democracy, the relevant articles of the Constitution and authoritative pronouncements of the Supreme Court, the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in the matter of convening the state assembly.The position of the Governor, his role and the limits of his constitutional jurisdiction have been elaborated by the Supreme Court, in its seven-judge judgment in Shamsher Singh versus Union of India case as early as 1974 and more recently in Nabam Rebia of 2016,” the ex-ministers said.They said, “You are well aware that constitutional functionaries are charged by the oath of office to vindicate the Constitution in letter and in spirit. This obliges the Governor in accordance with established traditions of constitutional and parliamentary democracy to defer to the wisdom of an elected government that expresses the will of the people.”The Congress veterans said the office of the Governor envisaged under our constitutional scheme is above and beyond the constraints and compulsions of partisan politics so that its holder can act freely and fairly to uphold the Constitution.“Having served as union ministers of Law and Justice in different periods of time and as students of constitutional law, we are of the clear view that established legal position obliges the Governor to call the assembly session in accordance with the advice of the state cabinet. Any deviation from an established constitutional position in the present circumstances would be an avoidable negation of your oath of office and will create a constitutional crisis,” the former ministers said.Ashwani Kumar, speaking to The Tribune, said, “Refusal of the governor to accept the advice of the state cabinet for convening the assembly session for a second time is an unprecedented infraction of the constitutional process and a brazen transgression of the powers of the governor. Regrettably, the conduct of the governor will inevitably lead to inter-institutional conflict undermining the foundations of parliamentary democracy.

Our production capacity of just one day will be enough to cover every Parsi on the planet...given the size of our community." Srewvala in his tweet, wherein he had tagged Poonawalla, said, "On a lighter note, Since Parsi's are to be Extinct race (Though avg age of Parsi's show otherwise) there is a lobby that as the vaccine does come in there will be a special quotaunder saving from extinction race..& why not if a Parsi is at the forefront of it."Yes, @RonnieScrewvala, we will keep more than enough for the community. Our production capacity of just one day will be enough to cover every Parsi on the planet...given the size of our community! https://t.co/qkCDrynMeW  Poonawalla last week said the company aims to manufacture 300 million to 400 million doses by the year-end, following the success of initial and licensure trials.He said as part of the agreement with AstraZeneca, SII can manufacture one billion doses for India and nearly 70 low and middle income countries.There are no challenges in manufacturing of the vaccine doses and the company will be starting by making 60 to 70 million doses per day, he said.The high prevalence of COVID-19 infections in Mumbai and Pune will help test the efficacy of the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, SII said last week.By end of August, between 4,000 to 5,000 people in Pune and Mumbai will be injected with the vaccine as part of trials that are scheduled to last over two months, it said.The Oxford University has reported satisfactory progress from the vaccines test results and is conducting bigger field tests in the UK.In India, it has chosen SII as the manufacturing partner, which has to conduct field trials before getting the final nod to ensure they are safe and effective for Indians.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ronnie-screwvala-tweets-about-covid-vaccine-quota-for-parsis-adar-poonawalla-replies-118565

27-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||Rajasthan governor returns proposal; asks govt if it will take floor test||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 27Rajasthan political crisis seems nowhere near end with Governor Kalraj Mishra and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot continuing to engage in a battle of nerves over a plain issue of calling an assembly session.Two days after the Gehlot-led cabinet sent a fresh proposal to the governor asking for a session from July 31 and answering his queries, the governor on Monday returned the proposal to the Chief Minister asking him categorically if he wanted to take a floor test during the proposed session.In the revised proposal to the governor, who earlier flagged the part about missing agenda in the first cabinet note on the session, the state cabinet had mentioned COVID-19 as the principal agenda along with other political matters and had also said the governor did not have the right to seek the session agenda before the session is called.Also read: SC allows Rajasthan Speaker to withdraw plea against HC orderDelay in calling session will create a constitutional crisis, former law ministers tell Rajasthan governorHope President intervenes and instructs Rajasthan governor to convene assembly session: ChidambaramHave written to Prez, spoken with PM on current political situation: Rajasthan CM“Listing of the agenda is the prerogative of the government and is done once the session is notified,” Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, adding that if the governor house didn’t know this elementary fact, it indicated a sorry state of affairs.The Governor on Monday sent back the cabinet note asking if a floor test would be held and also saying the government should consider giving a 21-day notice to the MLAs.The Congress had earlier clarified to the Governor that sessions had been called at short notices and even at five-day notices in the past.The Congress doesn’t want to specify the political agenda for the session and says the agenda would be fixed by the business advisory committee once the session is notified.Singhvi, on Sunday, said the Governor was powerless in the matters where he was supposed to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers.“Calling an assembly session is one such area,” Singhvi added.The Congress has also made it clear that the battle of Rajasthan would be fought on the floor of the assembly and not in courts.As reported by The Tribune on Sunday, the Speaker on Monday withdrew his Special Leave Petition in the SC that had challenged the previous Rajasthan HC order asking the Speaker not to act on the disqualification notices of rebel MLAs until Friday last.Since the HC has pronounced a final order of status quo on the matter, the SLP in the Apex Court had turned infructuous.Meanwhile, the Congress has been accusing the Governor of acting on the ruling BJP’s behest to dislodge the Rajasthan government and denying the government the Constitutional right of calling a session.The party will also protest outside Raj Bhavans across the country today, alleging misuse of constitutional posts by the centre to topple democratically-elected governments.In another trouble for Congress, the BSP today has issued directions to six of its Rajasthan MLAs, who earlier joined Congress, to vote against the Congress should a floor test happen.Singhvi had made it clear on Sunday that the party would take a test of strength in the assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-governor-returns-proposal-asks-govt-if-it-will-take-floor-test-118554

The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop the required infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.Out of the 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.

27-07-2020||New Delhi||High ammonia levels in raw water from Haryana hit supply in Delhi: DJB||A spike in the ammonia levels in the raw water discharged from Haryana hit water supply in parts of Delhi on Monday, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) Vice Chairman Raghav Chadha said."Due to increase in pollutants (ammonia levels) in raw water discharged from Haryana, the water supply will be affected in parts of West Delhi, North Delhi, Central Delhi and South Delhi. We endeavor to restore normal water supply ASAP. Please use water judiciously," Chadha wrote on Twitter.On Friday, too, the DJB had curtailed supply at the Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants due to high levels of pollutants in the Yamuna river.A DJB official said Haryana had opened the gates of drains that had stagnant water with a high pollutant concentration, following heavy rainfall.Effluents from industrial units upstream of the Wazirabad barrage might also have increased the pollutant levels in the river, the official said.Meanwhile, the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) has also sought a report from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and industries commissioner on the reasons behind a "sudden froth" in the river.The two-member committee, comprising retired National Green Tribunal expert-member B S Sajawan and former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra, has asked the CPCB, DPCC Chairman Sanjeev Khirwar and Industries Commissioner Vikas Anand to take prompt action to detect the source of the froth in the river and act against those responsible.The panel has asked the anti-pollution bodies to keep it informed of the matter.In November last year, the YMC had asked the CPCB, DPCC and industries commissioner to take necessary action to close down the industries causing such environmental hazards.The directions had come after "shocking pictures of froth in the river got extensive media coverage" and "very damaging comments" on the toxicity in the river during the Chhath festival.The CPCB, in its report, had said a high phosphate concentration, mostly from household waste water, was the major reason behind frothing in the Yamuna.

Dissenting voice can't be shut in a democracy, it had said.A day after the SC order, the HC ordered status quo on the disqualification notices, effectively restraining the Speaker from going ahead with the disqualification proceedings against the rebel Congress MLAs.It had also allowed adding the Union of India as a party as the petitioners have challenged certain provisions of the anti-defection law i.e the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-rajasthan-speaker-to-withdraw-plea-against-high-court-order-118536

27-07-2020||---||Rafale 1st imported jet since 90s||New Delhi, July 26Rafale fighter jets, India’s latest military acquisition, are set to arrive at the Ambala airbase in Haryana on July 29. The jets are fitted with “deadly” missiles and weapons, which are a way ahead when compared with similar capabilities of Pakistan and China. Features of the war bird1,389 km/h3,700 km9,979 kgThis will be the first induction of the new type of foreign-origin jets since Sukhoi started coming in late 1990s. A total of 272 Sukhoi are on order. Another 12, other than these 272, are to be added. Deliveries of such huge numbers are usually staggered. The only other induction of jets has been LCA Tejas, an indigenous product.Last week, the Indian Air Force (IAF) had said its pilots and ground crew, after having undergone training, were “fully operational”. India and China are locked in a tense stand-off since early May. Owing to Ambala’s location, Rafale can take off and fly northeastwards towards the G219 highway of China.Five of these Rafale jets will be flown in from France by Indian pilots. They will be fuelled mid-air. Pilots will take a break at the base of a friendly country in West Asia before flying into Ambala. Post-arrival, efforts will focus on operationalising the aircraft at the earliest. A formal induction ceremony will take place in the second half of August.The jets come fitted with weapons and missiles from European missile-maker MBDA. These will include Meteor, a beyond visual range air-to-air missile, that can hit enemy targets in the air 150 km away. The Meteor is powered by a rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power and much longer range. This means it can travel much farther, giving Meteor the ability to chase down and destroy agile hostile fighters.India’s Rafale fighters will also be equipped with the SCALP deep-strike cruise missile. It can strike at hardened and protected targets deep inside hostile territory without the need for Rafale to enter hostile airspace. SCALP has long range, around 300 km, and it can hit targets in Pakistan and China even if it is hovering over Jalandhar or even Chandigarh.ImportanceRafale is a medium multi-role combat aircraft that is said to boost India’s air dominance exponentially, currently safeguarded by fighter jets like Russia-made Sukhoi Su-30MKI and MiG-29, along with French Mirage-2000 and indigenously built HAL Tejas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-1st-imported-jet-since-90s-118391

The world witnessed the valour of India’s brave soldiers, he said. India would not forget that betrayal, he said.In his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” radio address, which coincided with the 21st anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas, the PM also recalled late Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s Independence Day speech after the Kargil war.“Atalji said, before taking any important decision, we should think whether our step is befitting to the honour of the soldier who laid down his life in those remote mountains,” he said.The PM also spoke of the dangers of social media. “There are times when we forward things out of sheer curiosity. Despite knowing that it is wrong, we keep doing it. These days, wars are fought not just on borders, but on many fronts simultaneously within the country too,” he said.“And every citizen has to decide his or her role in that. We, too, should determine our roles, fully keeping in mind the soldiers fighting on the border in the harshest of conditions,” he said.Pitching for “vocal for local”, he urged people to buy locally made goods. To check Covid-19 spread, he urged people to observe physical distancing norms and exercise caution while getting back to normal business.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-narendra-modi-salutes-kargil-martyrs-says-pak-was-given-befitting-reply-118390
