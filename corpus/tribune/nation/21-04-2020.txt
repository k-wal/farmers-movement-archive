21-04-2020||New Delhi||Health Ministry seeks ban on export of anti-TB drugs||The Union Health Ministry has sought a ban on the export of anti-tuberculosis drugs over concerns that the lockdown due to COVID-19 has affected the production of such medicines.Delay in production and receipt of supply may cause acute shortage of these drugs, Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan said as she requested an empowered group of government officials to direct the department of pharmaceuticals under the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers and commerce ministry for issuing necessary directions for prohibiting export of anti-TB medicines.In a letter to Drinking Water and Sanitation Secretary Parameswaran Iyer, who is also the chairman of the empowered group for facilitating supply chain and logistics management, she said, “In view of the emergency measures undertaken, the availability of limited number of manpower and material to the pharmaceutical industry, the production capacity of the leading anti-TB drug manufacturers of India has been affected.”Such a situation will worsen the treatment of TB patients within the country, she added. Sudan said suppliers have communicated that anti-TB drug supplies will be delayed because “force majeure” due to COVID-19 response activities, limited material (API), for production, limited manpower (because of restrictions) and limited transportation facilities.The leading anti-TB drugs manufacturers at present having contract agreement with National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) are Macleods and Lupin. Major factories for these drugs are in Bharuch and Ankleshwar in Gujarat, Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Daman and Diu.Under these circumstances, needless to emphasise that the situation calls for extraordinary measures to ensure that TB patients of the country simultaneously don’t face any challenges in accessing either diagnosis or the treatment of the tuberculosis across the country under the NTEP, Sudan said.“Therefore it is requested the Empowered Group may issue directions to Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and Department of Commerce for their intervention in this regard and also issue direction for prohibiting export of anti-TB medicines while considering mandatorily the need of the country as overriding priority to ensure smooth supply of these drugs,” she said in the letter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-ministry-seeks-ban-on-export-of-anti-tb-drugs-74187

21-04-2020||Lucknow||UP CM asks medical authorities to examine plasma therapy in COVID-19 treatment||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday asked the state’s medical authorities to promote plasma therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients after examining its efficacy.The chief minister, while chairing a high-level meeting of officials to take stock of the UP anti-COVID fight, also stressed upon the need for thorough testing of people living in and around the areas declared hotspots, said Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi.He said the chief minister also appealed to the people, visiting hospitals for emergency treatment, to go only to the hospitals approved by the Medical and Health Department.Awasthi said “the chief minister pointed out that several news items on positive results of plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have appeared in media recently”.“In view of this, the efficacy of the new treatment protocol should be examined and promoted in the state,” said Adityanath, while chairing the meeting in which, he also instructed officials to ensure availability of oxygen for the COVID-19 patients.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recently allowed states to start clinical trials of the plasma therapy for COVID-19.Nearly 100 institutes have shown interest in studying how safe and efficient is the plasma therapy in treating COVID-19 patients.Several states like Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab have already started using plasma therapy for the corona-infected patients.Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for COVID-19 patients.In this treatment, plasma from a cured COVID-19 patient is transfused to a critically-ill coronavirus patient.The idea behind this therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma.This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a cured coronavirus patient to treat another critical patient.The recovered COVID-19 patient’s blood develops antibodies to battle against COVID-19. Once the blood of the first patient is infused to the second patient, those antibodies will start fighting against the coronavirus in the second person.The process for donating plasma is similar to donating blood and takes about an hour.Several countries around the world including United Kingdom and United States have also started plasma therapy trials.While the meeting, the chief minister also issued directions to halt inter-district and inter-state transportation, and ensure that ration is available to one and all, said Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awasthi.Talking about the need to visit only approved hospitals for emergency treatment, Awasthi said, “If anyone falls ill, he/she should go to the hospitals, only approved by the medical and health department, and not to any other place. Do not go to non-approved hospital for emergency.”“Going to the emergency units of non-approved hospitals will also pose a danger to the lives of other patients. Emergency services have been allowed in only those hospitals, where there are sufficient equipment and trained staff,” he said.

21-04-2020||New Delhi||Everyone is trying to do their best, says SC; refuses to order govt to pay wages to migrant workers||Maintaining that everyone was trying to do their best during the COVID-19 crisis, the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to order the government to pay wages to lakhs of stranded migrant workers in various parts of the country.“Who knows the task better than the government? We may say this...we may say that... but what if government is not able to provide that. It’s an unusual situation. Someone may say something is working well or something may not be working well. Everybody is trying to do their best,” a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said.Petitioners Harsh Mander and Anjali Bhardwaj had sought a direction to the Centre and states to ensure payments of minimum wages to all the migrant workers within a week.The court’s comments came after petitioners’ advocate Prashant Bhushan said the government itself has recognised the need for payment to these workers by asking private employers to pay full wages to them during the lockdown.“But most of the private employers don’t have money to pay. Eighty nine per cent of those surveyed say they have not been paid any wages since the lockdown,” Bhushan said.The government said it will pay Rs 5000 to construction workers. But construction workers constituted a very small minority of the population, he pointed out.Thousands of migrant workers still didn’t have access to food and shelter, he said, adding“They have created a mockery of the system.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta questioned Bhushan’s submission and said there were active and vigilant helplines across the country to ensure food reached those who needed it.He also questioned the authenticity of the survey mentioned by Bhushan.The Bench disposed of the PIL after asking the government “to  look  into  such material  and  take  such  steps  as  it  finds  fit  to  resolve  the  issues raised in the petition”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/everyone-is-trying-to-do-their-best-says-sc-refuses-to-order-govt-to-pay-wages-to-migrant-workers-74176
21-04-2020||---||Not matters for court intervention, says SC on Indians stranded abroad||New Delhi, April 21The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to direct the government to evacuate Indian citizens stranded the US COVID19 and Indians stranded abroad Iran due to COVID19 lockdown, saying it’s a global problem.“The court will not tell government to do anything in a particular manner. It’s a worldwide problem. Each country is doing their best. These are not matters for court intervention. The government will lay down roadmap,” a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said.The court’s observations came after senior advocate Vibha Datta Makhija urged it to direct the government to evacuate Indians stranded in the US due to COVID19 crisis.While appreciating the work done by the government, Makhija said, “We have list of 110 people in dire need of help.”However, the Bench said, “We will not entertain this challenge. These are not subjects that can be entertained in these times. Whatever you’re asking for we will not entertain.”It said, “They cannot be brought in no matter how much we want. Assistance is being given to them. They are spread across the US. The US government is extending their visas. Let’s wait for some time.”Makhija said they needed to be helped out because application for extension of visas cost 500 dollars i.e. around Rs 35,000 and there was no guarantee of visa getting extended. “It’s a different government. We can’t control their decisions. Indian government can request the US government to ensure there was no problem in visa extension,” the top court said.Noting that it was not possible to bring back all Indians stranded abroad at this juncture, the Supreme Court on April 13 said they should stay put wherever they were.On the issue of evacuation of Indians stranded in Iran—from where it had airlifted around 600 Shia pilgrims last month—the Bench left it to the Centre to take a decision.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Indian Embassy in Iran was taking care of Indian citizens over there.The Bench disposed of the petition after asking the Centre to look into the grievances of the petitioner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-matters-for-court-intervention-says-sc-on-indians-stranded-abroad-74175

But remember it is five years old, this also needs to be kept in mind while casting aspersions on the BJP,” a party functionary said after India’s ambassador in the UAE also reminded the diaspora there of the importance of adhering to the rule of law.Ambassador Pavan Kapoor said India and the UAE share the value of non-discrimination on any grounds. “Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this,”he said. A couple of days back Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking.  The fact is not just Surya, similar remarks by some right-wing supporters by expats in Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, blaming Muslims for the spread of novel coronavirus and dubbing the spread as ‘Corona Jihad’ on social media triggered an outrage from  prominent Arab nationals who took to social media to condemn and question their remarks. Princess Hend Al Qassimi, a member of the UAE royal family, said “the ruling family is friends with Indians but as a royal your rudeness is not welcome. You make your bread and butter from this land which you scorn and your ridicule will not go unnoticed”.  Later she also retweeted a comment that said “in response to the anti-Muslim bias in the media and even official messaging over the coronavirus, the intelligentsia in India-friendly Gulf countries has started critically examining the ruling BJP’s attitudes towards Muslims and Arabs”. Archived comments tweeted by citizens from Gulf show Surya justified the remarks. Reports suggest that despite many Indians being sacked, the list of expats landing in trouble for alleged “Islamophobic” posts is growing. Apart from Princess Hend Al Qassimi, the posts were also criticised by prominent Gulf citizens and Indians reminded that “every year more than $55 billion are transferred to India from Gulf countries and more than 120 billion annually from all Muslim countries”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-tejasvi-suryas-controversial-remarks-observers-fear-deeper-ramifications-bjp-sees-conspiracy-to-malign-74171

The MoD in 2017 accepted 65 of 99 suggestions. Of these 65, some are pending for implementation. The review meeting took these points.Former Defence Minister Parrikar had set-up the Shekatkar panel. It suggested how to enhance combat potential of forces, re-balance expenses. It listed steps to trim, redeploy, integrate manpower. It suggested expenses ‘could be cut by Rs 25,000 crore over 5 years’.The committee had spoken about lack of jointness and how it was ramping up costs. Over the past few decades, the Army, IAF and Navy have grown as three separate verticals with sparse ‘horizontal links’.With no commonality, each service had its own wings doing the same things separately on communication, maintenance, logistics, operations, support services, etc., ‘wasting’ crores of rupees annually in manpower and literal triplication of effort. This is unlike the way other modern-day armed forces have evolved in the past five decades or so.Newly-minted contours for the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), announced by the Narendra Modi government, set a timeline on sorting out some vital issues that are ‘holding back’ integration and jointness of forces.Already the DMA is looking to have a common training command and a war doctrine. This would have common doctrine and cross-postings of middle-level officers and common logistics is being worked out for all command platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-okays-sharing-of-resources-by-armed-forces-74168

While Zargar is the media coordinator of Jamia Coordination Committee, Haider is a member of the committee.The police have also booked Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Umar Khalid under the UAPA in the case, said advocate Akram Khan who is representing Haider in the case.Haider (35) is a PhD student and the president of RJD youth wing’s Delhi unit, while Zargar is an MPhil student of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university.In the FIR, the police have claimed that the communal violence was a “premeditated conspiracy” which was allegedly hatched by Khalid and two others.The students have also been booked for the offences of sedition, murder, attempt to murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and rioting.Khalid had allegedly given provocative speeches at two different places and appealed to the citizens to come out on streets and block the roads during the visit of US President Donald Trump to spread propaganda at international level about how minorities in India are being, the FIR alleged.In this conspiracy, firearms, petrol bombs, acid bottles and stones were collected at numerous homes, the FIR claimed.Co-accused Danish was given the responsibility to gather people from two different places to take part in the riots, the police alleged.Women and children were made to block the roads under the Jafrabad metro station on February 23 to create tension amidst the neighbourhood people, it said.Over 20 film personalities, including Anurag Kashyap, Vishal Bhardwaj, Mahesh Bhatt and Ratna Pathak Shah, on Sunday had released a statement raising their voice against the arrest of the students and activists by Delhi Police for protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and demanded their release.Following this, the police had said investigations into the JMI violence and northeast Delhi riot cases were done impartially, and arrests were made after analysis of forensic evidence.In December last year, the police had allegedly entered the JMI campus after protests over the CAA, being held a few metres away from the varsity, turned violent.Rajya Sabha MP and RJD leader Manoj Jha had tweeted, “Delhi Police called him for investigation and then received orders from above and arrested Meeran Haider, who has been helping people during the time of coronavirus outbreak”.The Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), a group comprising students and alumni from the varsity, had condemned the arrest and demanded his immediate release.“The country is facing a massive health crisis, however, the state machinery is busy harassing and framing student activists in false cases to suppress voices of dissent,” they said.The JCC said Haider was diligently working to provide ration to the needy during the lockdown. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-violence-police-books-jamia-students-under-uapa-74163

The move was however abandoned following concerns that the anti-malarial could adversely affect people with undiagnosed conditions."Even the high-risk contacts of the people here who have tested positive for the virus cannot be given HCQS unless they are monitored regularly in a clinical environment," says a doctor from the civic body.The administration is presently giving HCQS as a prophylaxis to healthcare workers and police personnel.The civic body has now decided to conduct trials of HCQS on people who are under institutional quarantine.

21-04-2020||New Delhi||Amid COVID crisis, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day assumes greater importance||Coming amid the Covid-19 crisis, the Earth Day on Wednesday assumes greater meaning, especially when cleaner air highlighting the need to urgent climate action remains the greatest spin-offs of the economy- dilapidating lockdown. Air pollution levels may have dipped remarkably, including in some of the worst polluted spots, but so have major economies of the world. Given that the global event strikes half a century this year, the 2020 Earth Day was meant to be extra special. But the pandemic appears to have not only changed plans of organisers to completely digital and virtual platforms but also shifted the discourse to protecting against future global threats and management of hazardous medical and chemical wasteExpected push on transition to carbon neutral economies remains wherein also lies the debate. Humanity depends on action now for resilient and sustainable future say experts but efforts to “flatten the novel Coronavirus curve” have also flattened economies.  “SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a highly contagious disease but it was our globalised economies that created the pandemic,” says environmentalist Soumya Dutta“It is mixed feeling as over-stressed, over-polluted ecosystems of the Earth improved remarkably quickly, dirty rivers started flowing with clear water and animals started bouncing back in pockets. And all these have a clear positive effect on human lives and well being. However, shutdowns and complete stoppage of economic activities is not sustainable. Millions of poorer workers are in dire straits, lacking incomes, shelter, even food.  “But when the global economic activities are restarted soon, there is s great opportunity and urgency to learn and act upon what the nature forced upon us. Can we produce and consume with much lower pollution move towards an economic, social and ecological order that hinges on prioritising the rights of Earth on equitable sharing of her gifts, that is the question,”  says Dutta, amid the debate between livelihoods and environment.According to the United Nations Environment Programme Emission Gap Report 2019 by the end of 2020, global CO2 emissions need to have dropped by 7.6% and continue to fall by 7.6% each year for us to have keep global heating under 1.5 degree C. The pandemic is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of humans and the planet in the face of global scale threats, says UNEP. Responding to socio-economic impacts of Covid-19, United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres was quoted as saying “had we been further advanced in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we could better face this challenge”.Incidentally, the Earth Day is when the Paris Agreement was also signed According to a UNEP statement, “the first Earth Day took place in 1970 when outraged by oil spills, smog and polluted rivers, 20 million people took to the streets, protesting what they recognised as an environmental crisis.“It was the planet’s largest civic event at the time and compelled governments to take concrete actions, including passing environmental laws and establishing environmental agencies. In addition to these practical outcomes, the event demonstrated just how much can be achieved when people come together and demand action.“April 22 is a timely reminder to embrace the opportunities of the natural world for green jobs, sustainable economic stimulus, for urgently taking action to protect ourselves against unsurvivable global heating and for securing healthy, dignified futures. Nature is in crisis, threatened by biodiversity and habitat loss, global heating and toxic pollution. Failure to act is failing humanity”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-covid-crisis-the-50th-anniversary-of-earth-day-assumes-greater-importance-74158

21-04-2020||New Delhi||Most companies may review their ‘work from home’ policy: Survey||With ‘work from home’ turning into the new trend in corporate sector amid the coronavirus crisis, a survey has found that around 83 per cent companies have said that they are considering revision of their ‘work from home’ policy.The ‘COVID-19 India Readiness Survey’ by Willis Towers Watson finds that 83 per cent of organisations plan to review their work-from-home policy, and 46 per cent indicated that they would reimburse employees the expenses incurred for setting up their home internet for work purposes.“Employers are also taking several measures to keep employees engaged in the new scheme of things. These include team-based virtual or social engagement initiatives, regular company-wide or department level communications, and town halls organised to address employee concerns,” said the report.Further, amid the growing concern over Covid-19, around 57 per cent of companies in India expect a moderate to large negative impact on their business in the next six months, it said.The report said that 46 per cent expect this to last over a 12-month period.“Signalling the long-term business impact of the coronavirus, 19 per cent expect such an adverse impact to last over a two-year period,” said the report by the advisory, broking and solutions company. Only 5 per cent of organisations expect a positive business impact within the next 12 to 24 months.“The tough economic conditions and anticipated business impact could drive organisations to consider workforce optimisation. Employers should take an emphatic and considerate approach and evaluate options such as staff redeployment, reduced working hours/days, long service leave, sabbatical, furlough, hiring freeze and voluntary pay cuts, before any serious consideration of a workforce reduction,” said Rohit Jain, Head of India, Willis Towers Watson.He added that in a post-Covid-19 world, some companies may need to re-hire and potential employees will factor in the consideration of organisational culture and how companies have treated their employees during the crisis.

21-04-2020||New Delhi||HC allows woman to end over 23-week pregnancy as foetus had serious abnormalities||The Delhi High Court has allowed a woman to terminate her over 23-week pregnancy as her foetus had several abnormalities and the baby would have required multiple surgeries right after birth to survive.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said there was a "substantial risk" that the baby would, after birth, suffer from abnormalities that would be "seriously detrimental to its healthy and normal life"."The child would be exposed to numerous intraoperative and postoperative complications and if any such problems arise, it would affect the quality of its life."The lack of compatibility of the foetus with a healthy and normal life is, therefore, looming large," the court noted."In view of the above, we are of the opinion that given the medical condition of the foetus, the rigours imposed by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act ought to be relaxed and the request of the petitioner for termination of her pregnancy...be acceded to," the bench said.The order came on the basis of a report submitted by a multi-disciplinary medical board, set up by AIIMS to examine the woman, which said that while the pregnancy would not pose a risk to the mother's physical and mental health, the baby after birth would have to undergo major surgeries.The report also said that there was a 30 per cent chance the surgeries would be unsuccessful and the infant may die within a month or so.Taking note of the findings in the report, the bench allowed the woman's plea and disposed of her petition.According to the petition, the foetus has "echogenic bowel and hepatic calcification, a condition associated with increased risk of aneuploidy, fetal cystic fibrosis, bowel obstruction and other infections".

21-04-2020||New Delhi||Popularity of 'Ramayan', 'Mahabharat' serials prompts review of DD programme selection process||The massive popularity of 'Ramayan' and 'Mahabharat' serials on Doordarshan has prompted the national broadcaster to review the way it picks its entertainment programmes so that people constantly prefer it over private channels, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar has said.The Union minister said the current process, referred as L1 under which work is allotted to the lowest bidder, of programme selection had "destroyed" quality.The consequent "low quality content" took Doordarshan (DD) down before it saw a revival of sorts with the rerun of 'Ramayan' and 'Mahabharat' serials.The public broadcaster decided to re-telecast 'Ramayan' on DD National and 'Mahabharat' on DD Bharati during the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, and both serials have been the most watched programmes.The two serials based on the Hindu epics of the same names had been massively popular when they were first telecast more than three decades ago as well.Javadekar said the L1 method of serial selection was "unfortunately" introduced 1990s onwards."We want to review this fully. The best serials should be on the national broadcaster. This is our target.... We have decided that we must bring in good (programmes), allow the system to bring good serials and programmes so that people prefer public broadcasters over others," Javadekar told PTI."L1 has destroyed... and low quality of our content was the problem which took DD down," he added.He noted that other old serials being telecast by Doordarshan have also drawn good response.DD National has been the number one entertainment channel for nearly a month now, he said.The public broadcaster used to commission projects to producers, and though that would at times entail big budgets, this also brought it huge viewership before private channels left it far behind.To a question about the coronavirus crisis hitting the media hard and demands to the government made by groups representing the industry, the minister acknowledged that it is facing problems and expressed confidence that it will come out of this soon.

They are made of surplus cloth meant for uniforms for our employees which remained unused. We have received orders from a RWA and we will be supplying them with the reusable masks," Arun Arora, Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer of Northern Railway told PTI.The zone will be fabricating 10,000 such masks every week, some of which will be given to railway employees while others will be given to associations which are requesting them on a payment basis, he said.The Jagadhri Workshop of northern railway has in fact also made disposable masks for the railways' medical staff, the cloth for which is being bought separately.The washable masks are currently in use in the five divisions of northern railway, RDSO Lucknow and by its own workshop staff, besides the railway hospitals where the disposable ones are being used."We want people to know that we are making these masks, that they are available and we will ramp up production if needed," said Arora.However, it is not just masks that the zone is manufacturing to augment the government's efforts to fight coronavirus, specially in areas where there is major shortfall.It has produced DRDO approved coveralls for medical staff and hand sanitisers for their staffers.While the railways' coveralls come for Rs 447, similar pieces in the market are pegged at Rs 808. Similarly, railways has produced sanitisers for Rs 119 for a litre, while in the open market it costs Rs 468.Developed at the Jagadhri Workshop, the coveralls were approved by DRDO within five days.

It is seen that both the state and the private players have not yet managed to overcome technical challenges, for instance, in providing adequate power supply and ensuring effective connectivity as the data reveals," the report said."Although, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the world had witnessed a massive shift from the traditional Face to Face (F2F) to the online platform as a mode of delivery of classes. Due to lack of proper infrastructure, a shift to a total reliance on the online platform for the delivery of lectures seems to be a distant dream," it added.According to the report, the survey with over 7600 respondents found that in order to use the internet at home, 72.60 per cent of the respondents use mobile hotspot, 15 pc use home broadband, 9.68 pc use WiFi dongle and 1.85 pc have poor to no internet connectivity."The data revealed that amongst the respondents who used home broadband, over 3 pc faced cable cuts, 53 pc faced poor connectivity, 11.47 pc faced power issues and 32 pc faced signal issues. When it came to mobile hotspot, 40.18 pc faced poor connectivity, 3.19 pc faced power issues and 56.63 pc faced signal issues."Studies and reports regarding the consumption of power by the state authorities reveal that the states are not using power entirely due to COVID-19 situation thereby leaving a surplus supply for private entities and general public," it said.Schools and colleges were closed in the country ahead of nationwide lockdown announced on March 24 to contain the spread of coronavirus. The lockdown has now been extended till May 3."The education sector is amongst the many which has taken a strong blow due to the COVID-19 situation. No more are the stakeholders involved in higher education able to function conventionally and the prospect of operating back to the status quo seems quite uncertain. In such a time, the only recourse that universities and institutions across the globe are resorting to is that of functioning online," the report said.

But it is important that we also understand that plasma therapy is no magic bullet".During the patient's treatment at Max Hospital, Saket, other standard treatment protocols were followed and one can say that plasma therapy could have worked as a catalyst in speeding up his recovery, he added."We cannot attribute 100 per cent recovery to plasma therapy only, as there are multiple factors which carved his path to recovery," he said.Hospital authorities said the family came forward to arrange a donor for extracting plasma."The donor had recovered from the infection three weeks ago and again tested COVID-19 negative at the time of donation along with other standard tests to rule out infections like Hep B, Hep C and HIV," the statement said.The critically ill patient was administered fresh plasma as a treatment modality as a side-line to standard treatment protocols on the night of April 14, it said.After receiving the treatment, the patient showed progressive improvement and by the fourth day, he was weaned off ventilator support and continued on supplementary oxygen thereafter, the hospital authorities said.He has been shifted to a room with round-the-clock monitoring at present. He has started taking oral feed since Sunday and is faring well, they said.Budhiraja said, "One donor can donate 400 ml of plasma which can save two lives, as 200 ml is sufficient to treat one patient".The patient is now doing well and his two consecutive COVID-19 tests have come negative, the hospital authorities said.

21-04-2020||New Delhi||Please send us home, says 220 Indians stranded in Japan||A research scholar waiting to meet his newborn baby, a graduate worried about the job offer in Bangalore and a pregnant woman whose four-day work trip now stretches interminably are among the at least 220 Indians stranded in Japan and getting increasingly desperate to return home.Stuck in a foreign land as COVID-19 tightens its grip on many countries, dwindling financial resources and expired medical insurances are adding to their tensions.The group of 220 Indians, including 92 dependants, have collectively reached out to the Indian Embassy in Tokyo asking to be evacuated to India, which has been under lockdown since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement on March 24.In a signed letter, the stranded Indians have also assured that they will quarantine themselves when back and cooperate with authorities.Japan's partial lockdown is also a source of worry with some saying they live in constant fear of getting infected with the coronavirus that has infected more than 2.4 million people and claimed over 1,70,000 lives.Rahul Joe, a research scholar at the University of Hokkaido till his contract expired last month, was all set to move back to Ahmedabad to be with his pregnant wife. The date was set and the tickets booked.“We were blessed with a baby girl two days back and I don't know when will I able to see my baby for the first time. My medical insurance expired with my contract and now I am scared that if I fall ill I will have no means to get myself treated," Joe told PTI over the phone from Tokyo.With the number of cases rising in Japan, the country on April 16 expanded the state of emergency to the entire nation in an attempt to prevent the new coronavirus from spreading further and straining the healthcare system. The country has reported more than 11,000 cases.However, it is not like the lockdown in several other parts of the world as Japan's post World War-II constitution lays out strict protections for civil liberties, Joe said."Public transportation is operating as normal. Most states of emergency measures are in the form of requests and instructions. Violators cannot be punished unless they fail to comply with orders related to storage or shipment of emergency relief goods and medical supplies. So the risk is even higher. We are stuck inside and living in constant fear," Joe said.For Kamal Vijayvargiya, a four-day trip to the country has taken on nightmarish overtones and he can't wait to get back home to Jaipur."I am in the business of tea and I come to Japan annually for business meetings. I came on March 18 and now I am stuck here. At present, I am staying in an office friend's single room but I cannot stay too long because herself she is a dialysis' patient and it is risky for me to be here,” he said.A 28-year-old pregnant woman, from Ahmedabad like Joe, said she also went to Japan for four days and has no clue when she will get back home"I was in the first trimester of my pregnancy when I came to Tokyo in March. It was an official trip for four days but first the Janta curfew and then the travel restrictions. It has been a month now, my office has arranged for accommodation and other necessities are being taken care of but it is depressing to be indoors all day in a foreign country without any clarity," she told PTI on the condition of anonymity.Akhilesh Sharma, a Ghaziabad resident, has been in Tokyo since December for a project that was to end in March. He has been living off his savings since then."The embassy did help me with a discounted voucher to stay in a hotel but how long can that be managed?”A fresh graduate from Nihon University, who was supposed to join a firm in Bangalore from April 10, is now worried about the plans.“My studies were over here. I had a job offer. I was supposed to join them in April. The offer has not been withdrawn yet but I am still worried considering all the news about layoffs and paycuts,” the young woman said, refusing to be identified.According to Indian government officials, bringing back stranded Indians is an ongoing process.“Some questions have come about Indians abroad. It is a situation where we cannot give a definite answer because the lockdown is still there. We need to assess the situation... it will be the government's decision on how we manage the return of Indians from other countries," Dammu Ravi, COVID-19 coordinator, said at the press conference."Our ambassadors and high commissioners in all these countries are in regular touch with all Indians abroad and giving all support to them. The MEA COVID control room helplines are active, teams are taking calls and guiding them in these matters. The situation is under control. We will review at a later stage about their return," the MEA official said earlier this month.

Neither have I tweeted anything like that nor is that my Twitter display picture. Had I tweeted that, at least someone would have replied to it. The one who took the screenshot would have also abused it," he said. The actor mentioned the Twitter handle of a person who apparently shared the screenshot first and that of another who tweeted a video, asking the actor to reply if "you dare."      "I have both, courage and the answer. Just like your agenda, this screenshot is also fake. People should have at least verified. Now, either you prove the authenticity of the screenshot or make a video and apologise. We have learnt that this fake picture was first started on Facebook," he said mentioning the name of the person.  I normally don’t post personal videos inspite of being trolled often, but had to now. In a time when humanity is faced with a pandemic and race religion colour country are no concern, some Indians are still indulging in #FakeNews #HinduMuslim #HateMongering.We need love not hate pic.twitter.com/4ckWzUVE4l  "There will be a legal enquiry against him because our honourable Prime Minister has also said that strict action should be taken against fake news and hatemongers. So we are going to file a defamation suit against him," the actor said.Jaaferi said it's "shameful" that at a time when people across the world are rising above "caste, creed, religion and race in the name of humanity," some are still spreading "lies and hate."      "I want to request my fans and friends that please share this video as much as possible so that people, who spread hate through fake news and misinformation, know that sensible and secular Indians will not tolerate this," he said.

But I am ending my life, as I am tired now. We, all four, are mentally tortured and harassed on a daily basis by my father, two uncles and cousin over property."The police have arrested her father on charges of abetment to suicide, while the rest of the accused are on the run.The autopsy report stated 'asphyxia due to hanging' as the cause of the death.The girl in her suicide note also stated that, "prior to marrying my mother, my father had murdered his first wife and her four children, including a foetus. My uncle, too, has served jail term. They molested me and did wrong things. They all must be given stringent punishment after my death." According to the FIR lodged by the girl's mother, on the morning of April 16, the family was assaulted by the four men.Later, in the afternoon, the girl was found dead. "The four men murdered my daughter, while I was out for work," alleged the mother.Sadar SHO Kamlesh Kumar Singh said, "After the autopsy, a case of IPC section 302 (murder) was changed to 306 (abetment to suicide). We have arrested the father, but the others are still on the run." "We are investigating all the allegations made by the girl prior to her suicide. We will add more sections as the case progresses," he said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/teen-asked-by-dad-to-kill-mother-siblings-commits-suicide-74110

One death has been reported from Karnataka.Of the 603 deaths, Maharashtra tops the tally with 232 fatalities, followed by Gujarat at 77, Madhya Pradesh at 76, Delhi at 47, Rajasthan at 25, Telangana at 23 and Andhra Pradesh at 22.The death toll reached 20 in Uttar Pradesh while Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have reported 17 cases each.Punjab has registered 16 deaths while West Bengal has reported 12 fatalities due to coronavirus infection so far.The disease has claimed five lives in Jammu and Kashmir, while Kerala and Haryana have recorded three COVID-19 deaths each.Jharkhand and Bihar have reported two deaths each, while Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha and Assam have reported one fatality each, according to the ministry data.However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states and union territories, as on 6.50 pm on Tuesday, showed 605 deaths.There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of deaths announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.According to the health ministry’s data updated in the evening, the highest number of confirmed cases in the country are from Maharashtra at 4,669 followed by Delhi at 2,081, Gujarat at 2,066, Rajasthan at 1,576, Madhya Pradesh 1,540 and Tamil Nadu at 1,520.The number of COVID-19 cases has gone up to 1,294 in Uttar Pradesh, 919 in Telangana and 757 in Andhra Pradesh.The number of cases has risen to 415 in Karnataka, 408 in Kerala, 392 in West Bengal, 368 in Jammu and Kashmir, 254 in Haryana and 245 in Punjab.Bihar has reported 114 coronavirus cases, while Odisha has 74 such cases.Forty-six people have been infected with the virus in Uttarakhand and Jharkhand each.Himachal Pradesh has 39 cases, Chhattisgarh has 36 while Assam has registered 35 infections so far.Chandigarh has 26 COVID-19 cases, Ladakh 18, while 16 cases have been reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Meghalaya has reported 11 cases, while Goa and Puducherry have seven COVID-19 patients each.Manipur and Tripura have two cases each, while Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have reported a case each.“Our figures are being reconciled with the ICMR,” the ministry said on its website. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-death-toll-rises-to-603-number-of-cases-near-19-000-74098
21-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||Sangh affiliate welcomes govt move to reverse permission to e-commerce, crackdown on Zoom||Tribune News serviceNew Delhi, April 21A day after the Narendra Modi government rescinded permission to e-commerce firms to resume delivery of non-essential items, RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) welcomed the move besides the recent “crackdown” on virtual meeting app Zoom, asking the Home Ministry to also investigate other popular Chinese social platforms like Helo and TikTok. Ruling BJP’s sister organisation in the Sangh parivaar said the Home Ministry’s decision to exclude e-commerce and movement of their supply vehicles from list of relaxations in previous guidelines would provide a “level playing field to offline players” namely local traders.The move to exclude supplies of non-essential goods by e-commerce players for the rest of the period of the lockdown 2.0 is being linked to opposition from local traders (the saffron party’s original supporters) whose businesses continue to remain shut down because of the lockdown.While an e-commerce major called the new guidelines “disappointing not only for the consumers whose list of essentials had expanded to work from home and study from home products but also the thousands of small businesses, sellers and manufacturers across the country, who had geared up in the last 48 hours to provide millions of people with safe access to products,”. According to SJM’s Ashwani Mahajan, the exemption would have led to a “non-level-playing field for offline retailers”.“Moreover, e-commerce players can neither keep their own inventory nor can indulge in the sale of private labels. The exemption would have only helped them to use their own network of retailers. This would not only have been unfair to the local retailers, but would have given unfair advantage to the giant e-commerce players,” he said.Mahajan said in the fight against the pandemic grocery stores did exemplary work and used their skills to not only ensure the supplies to consumers but have also shown maturity in maintaining social distancing and hygiene. “The services of small traders and grocers are appreciated by one and all. We hope the state governments which have issued guidelines for e-commerce would also withdraw their permissions,” he said.Also, welcoming the changes in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms, he said it had been SJM’s demand for long. It had become necessary after reports of Chinese funds and banks started picking up stocks of various Indian or India-based critical companies, Mahajan said, demanding similar provisions for Chinese investments coming from countries like Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.Meanwhile, also backing the “crackdown on the virtual meeting app Zoom”, he said globally there are allegations that its critical encryption goes to their servers in China. "And there is no clarity on how much access PLA or other Chinese government agencies have on this information,” he said, urging the government to instead incentivise domestic players to develop such products.“There are Indians players, who can not only develop the product but also can create a global brand for India. This must be encouraged,” he said, asking MHA and CERT-In to also investigate other Chinese apps, especially Helo and TikTok.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sangh-affiliate-welcomes-govt-move-to-reverse-permission-to-e-commerce-crackdown-on-zoom-74097
21-04-2020||London||Disappointed, but will continue legal fight against extradition: Vijay Mallya||Embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who lost his UK High Court appeal against an extradition order to India, has said that he is “disappointed” with the ruling but will continue to seek legal remedies as advised by his legal team.The 64-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss reiterated that he has repeatedly offered to pay the Indian banks the loan amount owed by his now-defunct airline, an offer which the banks have rejected.“I am naturally disappointed with the High Court decision. I will continue to pursue further legal remedies as advised by my lawyers,” Mallya said in a statement on Monday evening.“I have repeatedly offered to repay the banks in full, but sadly to no avail,” he said.The dismissal of the appeal this week means Mallya has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court.As he has now indicated his intention to seek further legal measures, the UK Home Office would wait for the outcome of that appeal before it can formally certify the court order for Mallya to be extradited to India.The businessman, who has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail after his arrest on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard in April 2017, also expressed his disappointment with the “media narrative” which quotes Rs 9,000 crore as the amount owed in the fraud and money laundering case brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him.“I am also disappointed with the media narrative which states that I must face trial in India for a fraud of Rs 9,000 crore. Please note that the allegations against me and others are specifically and only related to three tranches of borrowing from IDBI Bank for a total of Rs 900 crores in 2009.“This loan was subsumed along with loans from other banks within the Master Debt Recast Agreement of 2010. Following the DRT (Debt Recovery Tribunal) order for the payment of approximately Rs 5,000 crore by way of Principal and Rs 1,200 crore by way of unapplied interest making a total of Rs 6,200 crores, the banks have already recovered in cash a sum of Rs 2,500 crores, which is 50 per cent of the Principal amount,” he claimed.Mallya refers to paragraphs contained within the High Court judgment handed down by Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench at the Royal Courts of Justice in London presiding over the appeal, which refers to these specific amounts.The judgment notes that between April and November 2009, five banks – the State Bank of India (SBI), the Bank of India, the Bank of Baroda, the United Bank of India (UBI) and United Commercial Bank (UCO) – extended loans to Kingfisher Airlines (KFA) totaling Rs 1,250 crore, leaving a shortfall of Rs 750 crore from the desired infusion of Rs 2,000 crore.The KFA then approached an additional bank, the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), to make up that shortfall.“The Requesting State, the Government of India (“GoI”) seeks the extradition of the Appellant (Mallya) in respect of these loans. It is said that the loans were obtained by means of a conspiracy to defraud and by means of fraudulent misrepresentations; it is further said that the Appellant engaged in money-laundering some of the proceeds of the loans,” the judgment states.In the judgment handed down on Monday, the High Court judges upheld the December 2018 extradition order of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London and accepted that “there is a prima facie case both of misrepresentation and of conspiracy, and thus there is also a prima facie case of money laundering”.Mallya’s legal team had claimed that the loan defaults by KFA were the result of wider issues faced by the aviation industry at the time.But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, managed to establish a “blueprint of dishonesty” against the businessman and co-conspiring bankers. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disappointed-but-will-continue-legal-fight-against-extradition-vijay-mallya-74096

21-04-2020||---||Trump says will sign executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into US||Washington, April 21President Donald Trump has said that he will sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into America, amid the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 40,000 people in the US, the country with the most fatalities in the pandemic.The number of people killed in the US due to COVID-19 has reached 42,094, according to Johns Hopkins University, and more than 750,000 cases have been confirmed."In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” Trump said in a tweet late on Monday night.Details of the Trump's executive order were not immediately known. He also did not indicate when he will sign such an order.While Trump talked about suspending immigration visa, the H-1B visa, which is more popular among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa. But his reasoning that he needs to protect jobs of American citizens indicates that non-immigrant work visas too might be on his target.The United States, due to coronavirus, has experienced a record layoff.

A compassionate and responsible government will and can find the resources to put money into Jan Dhan accounts; pension accounts of old age, widows and disabled; and PM Kisan accounts. The question is not how funds will be generated. Funds must be generated,” Ramesh said.The former minister also said the government was sleeping during the onset of Covid-19 and was busy destabilising the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh before imposing the lockdown on March 24.“It is a reality that the PM didn’t act with seriousness to deal with the situation at hand. The fact is the country realised only after the March 24 lockdown that there was a major crisis at hand. The government knew since January what was happening. But I don’t want to go into history right now and we did not discuss these issues today in our meeting. Today is not the time for blame game.

The move will also compel Indian diplomats in China to do a volte face.Unicorns concernedOver 70 per cent of India’s unicorns (a startup company valued at over $1 billion) such as Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, BigBasket, Paytm and OYO Rooms backed by Chinese investors, fear that the pace of top-up investments from China will become slow at a time when infusions are quickly required||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/change-in-fdi-norms-to-screen-investments-govt-73869

Please do not believe in rumours,” he said.According to the police the three — Swami Kalpvruksha Giri (70), Swami Sushil Giri (35) and their driver Nilesh Telgade — were traveling from Kandivali in Mumbai to Gujarat to attend a funeral when they were lynched in the village close to Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Local officials say most attackers were tribals from the nearby villages.Thackeray scotched rumours of a communal angle behind the attack. “There is no communal angle behind the lynchings,” he said. The Chief Minister added that the sadhus and their drivers were trying to drive into the Union Territory when they were stopped at the border by the police. The occupants of the vehicle then tried to enter Gujarat from a rural road passing through the village when they were attacked by the local villagers.Forest officials and local police personnel who tried to protect the sadhus were attacked by the villagers.
