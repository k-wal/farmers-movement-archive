An economic offence is committed with cool calculation and deliberate design with an eye on personal profit regardless of the consequence to the community,” he observed.He further said economic offences having deep-rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds need to be viewed seriously and be considered grave offence affecting the economy of the country.Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang are accused, besides several others, in the Rs 4,355-crore PMC Bank scam which surfaced in September last year.The case is being probed by Enforcement Directorate, along with Economic Offences Wing of Mumbai police.The case stems from massive loans given by PMC Bank to the now-bankrupt HDIL.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court dismisses anticipatory bail pleas of man in 3 cases||A Delhi court on Friday dismissed anticipatory bail pleas filed by a man whose name has been mentioned in the charge sheets in three different cases for allegedly being part of an unlawful assembly during the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav dismissed the anticipatory bail pleas filed by Raj Singh in three different cases, saying there was prima facie evidence about his alleged involvement in the riots.During the hearing held through video conferencing, Special Public Prosecutor Saleem Ahmed told the court that according to details of the charge sheets, the complainants in the three cases have individually identified Raj to be allegedly part of the mob which had vandalised their houses in Shastri Park area.The complainants Abdul Nazir, Mohd Irshad and Mehboob Hassan have clearly identified separately that Raj was allegedly also a member of an unlawful assembly which had vandalised several houses of the locality in village old Garhi Mendu, the counsel noted.He has also been identified by Constable Ali Javed and was also allegedly visible in the video footage of the incident of the locality, the public prosecutor said.The counsel further added that Raj was wanted in six cases of arson, looting and rioting in the area.Advocate Chaudhary Rajinder Singh, appearing for Raj, told the court that he being the resident of the same locality has been roped in the matters in a mechanical manner.Raj was neither a part of unlawful assembly nor participated in riots and was falsely implicated in the three cases, the lawyer claimed.The judge said in his order, “It is apparent that from February 24 to February 25 huge riots had taken place in the area of northeast Delhi and large scale destruction of public and private property had taken place. The loss of lives of public persons had taken place and injury to the innocent persons were also caused.                 “I prima facie find the involvement of the applicant in the matters. In my considered opinion, the applicant (Raj) has not been able to make out any case for grant of anticipatory bail. The application for anticipatory bail in all the three matters stands dismissed.”         The cases have been registered under sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 380 (theft), 436 (mischief by fire), 427 (mischief) of Indian Penal Code.The offences entail a maximum punishment of 10 years.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

All passengers must have ICA approval from the government of Abu Dhabi before they travel and will not be permitted to check-in without the necessary approvals,” the airline said in its press release.The ICA stands for the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship. A person with a valid residency permit of the UAE needs to take ICA approval before taking any flight to enter that country.The airline said it would operate services to Abu Dhabi from Bengaluru, Chennai, Kochi, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai.India suspended all scheduled international passenger flights on March 23 due to COVID-19.Many Indian nationals who have valid residence permits of the UAE and are currently in India have been complaining on social media for the last few weeks about the lack of flights between the two countries.The Civil Aviation Ministry announced on Twitter on Thursday: “As part of the close strategic partnership between the governments of India and the UAE, and with a view to assisting UAE resident nationals who are at present in India to return to the UAE, the civil aviation authorities of both countries have agreed to operationalise the following arrangement from July 12, 2020.”Charter flights operated by the UAE carriers will now be permitted to bring Indian citizens from the UAE to India and carry “ICA-approved UAE residents'” on their return leg, the Ministry said.On India to the UAE journeys, all these flights will carry only those passengers who are destined for the Gulf country, it noted.The Ministry also said: “Indian carriers operating repatriation flights to bring Indian citizens from UAE to India will be allowed to carry the ICA-approved UAE residents (returning to the UAE from India) on the outward journey from India to the UAE.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/etihad-airways-to-operate-special-flights-from-six-indian-cities-to-abu-dhabi-between-july-12-26-111111
10-07-2020||New Delhi||Congress attacks govt over removal of masks, hand sanitisers as essential commodities||The Congress on Friday attacked the Centre over the removal of face masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities, asking why the government wants people to be charged high prices for these items amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Face masks and hand sanitisers are no more essential products as their supply is sufficient in the country and, therefore, are now kept out of the purview of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan had said on Tuesday.Tagging an office memorandum issued by the Consumer Affairs Ministry on the removal of the items as essential commodities with his tweet attacking the government, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the government has removed face masks and hand sanitisers as ‘essential commodities’ and now they “can be sold at any MRP”.“On June 16, BJP government said—As lockdown has been relaxed, demand for hand sanitisers may increase and it should continue to be covered under EC Act till Dec 31, 2020,” Surjewala said in a series of tweets.If on June 16, hand sanitisers were ‘essential commodities’ up till December 30, 2020, then what changed in 15 days, he asked.“Why does the Government wants the people to be charged high prices? Why no price limit on these essentials to fight COVID-19? Is the war on COVID over?” he asked.On March 13, the Union Consumer Affairs Ministry had declared face masks and hand sanitisers as essential commodities for 100 days to boost supply and prevent hoarding of these items in its fight to check the spread of coronavirus.Masks (2-ply and 3-ply surgical masks, N95 masks) and hand sanitisers were brought under the Essential Commodities Act, empowering states to regulate production, distribution and prices of these items and also crackdown on hoarding and black marketing.

(One, which is done by spreading the dough in thin circular form and then folded into layers with air pockets),” he says displaying his mask parotta proudly.Madurai has seen a spurt in the number of infections in the last few days, having a total of 5299 cases as on Thursday, with 95 deaths.The state government has imposed a total shutdown in Madurai and nearby places till July 12 to curb the spread of the pandemic.

People will keep a close watch on the PROCESS and the PROGRESS (sic).”   “But let us remember, the declared goal is restoration of status quo ante as on May 5, 2020,” he also said.Gandhi has been attacking the government ever since the violent stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 claimed lives of 20 Indian soldiers.Questioning the government on whether there have been Chinese incursions, he has been attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accusing him of “surrendering” Indian land.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Animal rights body seeks probe into death of 30 elephants in one month||Animal rights body FIAPO on Friday urged the Centre to constitute a committee to probe the death of 30 elephants across the country within a month.In a letter-cum-petition to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations complied and attached news reports regarding the deaths of 30 elephants that took place between May 27 and June 29, 2020.The written petition recommends the committee to include representatives from investigating agencies, forest departments, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, government and non-government agencies (including wildlife experts and scientists) to investigate the deaths of elephants, and propose long term, effective policy changes to protect elephants from violent crimes.“Most of the mentioned cases are from the 12 states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Assam, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand and Kerala appear to have involved violence.                 “In some cases, it is even clear that the deaths are linked to illegal poaching for ivory,” FIAPO said.The body also pointed out that the existent legal framework for protection of elephants was lenient.Currently, hunting of these protected species is a crime under Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act with imprisonment for a term which may only extend to three years, or with fine not below Rs 10,000.         “As a result of such lenient laws, illegal activities, with animals being subjected to violence and being treated as commodities, don’t stop,” it said.Varda Mehrotra, Executive Director FIAPO, said it was worrying as elephants are protected under the UN convention for migratory species.“This is a highly worrying trend, as elephants are endangered and protected under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and also the UN Convention for Migratory Species.         “They are officially recognised as a National Heritage Animal in India with the highest protection under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. We need to address the elephant in the room,” he said.Ramesh AS, an independent activist who has followed the trail of elephant deaths since the death of elephant Saumya, who died in Kerala after consuming fruit loaded with firecrackers, set up an online petition that has garnered over 2,500 signatures.         “When the government does not have funds and facilities to rehabilitate existing sick and old captive elephants in private custody, capturing wild elephants in conflict and maintaining them in captivity is not sustainable.“It is against the rights and welfare of existing captive elephants who need rehabilitation. The only solution we can arrive at is to address it in the wild itself,” said Ramesh.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Chinese JV among six bidders for 44 Vande Bharat trains||Chinese state-owned CRRC Corporation has emerged as the only foreign player for the Railways’ global tender for its ambitious semi-high speed indigenous Train 18 project, officials revealed on Friday.CRRC Pioneer Electric (India) Private Limited, whose bid for the project is a joint venture of the Chinese firm CRRC Corporation Limited with a Gurugram-based company according to its website, is one of the six contenders for the tender for procuring propulsion systems or electric traction kits for 44 trains to function as the Vande Bharat Express or Train 18.The other contenders include Bharat Heavy Electricals, Hyderabad-based Medha Group, Electrowaves Electronic Private Limited and Mumbai-based Powernetics Equipments Private Limited.Officials said going by the cost of manufacturing the first Train 18 which was launched last year at an expense of Rs 100 crore out of which Rs 35 crore was for the propulsion system alone, the present tender for 44 such kits would be worth over Rs 1,500 crore.“We have got bids from six players for the train set tender,” said Vinod Kumar Yadav, chairman of the Railway Board.This current tender was floated on December 22 last year by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai, and was opened on Friday. It is the third such tender floated for these trains.Floated under the Make in India initiative, the tender was for the supply of electrical equipment and other items for 44 train sets of 16 coaches each.The first one was for 43 sets. Orders for only three were given, including one for Spanish major CAF and Medha Group that supplied for the first Train 18 which was christened Vande Bharat Express.Then a second tender was floated for 37 Train 18 propulsion systems which were cancelled.Surprisingly, major players like Bombardier, Alstom, Siemens, CAF, Talgo and Mitsubishi did not participate in the bids.The emergence of a Chinese company for these train sets being promoted as indigenous products comes after a violent face-off between India and China in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh last month.Following a standoff with the neighbouring country, the national transporter cancelled a Rs 471-crore signalling and telecommunication work for a stretch of 417-km on the Kanpur-Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) section by a Chinese company and also scrapped a tender for thermal screening cameras after Indian vendors complained of the bid document favouring the Chinese.The officials say it might take at least two-and-a-half years for the next Train 18 to be manufactured, thus causing a delay in the target set by Railways Minister Piyush Goyal who had said that the plan was to produce 160 coaches in 2019-20, 240 coaches in 2020-21 and 240 coaches in 2021-22 at the ICF in Chennai.All coaches in these trains will be Chair Car type for day travel. They will be provided with cab AC, fully air-conditioned passenger compartment with vestibule arrangement, automatic plug doors with retractable footsteps, automatic intercommunication door, in-coach displays, speakers, side destination boards, luggage racks with reading lamps, direct lighting and diffused lighting (for luggage racks), continuous LED light fixtures, modular pantry equipment and a GPS antenna in all coaches, Mobile/laptop charging sockets in the passenger seats, CCTVs and Emergency talkback units with networking system in all coaches.

Australia and New Zealand were responsible for 72 projects and the Nordic and Baltic region 134, an increase for both regions.The number of Indian projects at 106, resulting in a job creation figure of 4,858 last year contrasts with 120 projects and 5,429 jobs for this year.“During the COVID-19 crisis, we have been working with India to keep supply chains open and keeping trading routes alive and as we emerge from COVID, it is vitally important we don't move to protectionism,” said UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, addressing the annual India Global Week 2020 virtual summit on Friday.“On the trade side, we are not letting the grass grow under our feet and the UK and India are carrying on negotiations virtually given the current crisis,” she said, in reference to a planned virtual India-UK Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) summit this year.The latest UK FDI figures show that while the number of new jobs as a direct result of foreign investment has declined — a global trend as seen in other FDI reports this year — the number of jobs safeguarded by FDI increased by 29 per cent.The DIT said it worked closely with existing investors to safeguard 26 per cent more jobs compared to 2018-2019, demonstrating the broad range of support DIT delivers for the UK economy by promoting investment.“These figures further demonstrate the resilience of the UK economy and the work of the government to continue to build and attract inward investment into the UK. Developing key sectors such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences and renewable energy will help us to rebound post-pandemic and build on our attractive business environment across the UK for investors around the globe,” added Truss.All the regions of England, Wales and Northern Ireland saw an increase in the number of projects each nation attracted, though Scotland saw a decline in the number of projects from the previous year.

His wife and two daughters were buried alive.Eight-year-old Lokam Rona ran out of the house and a girl, Lokam Gandhi (15), who was trapped inside the debris, was rescued, Amo said, adding that she sustained injuries on her leg and was shifted to the Ramkrishna Mission Hospital here for treatment.Police and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel retrieved three bodies from the debris, while a hunt for the missing person was on, Amo said.The deceased were identified as Kamduk Kagung (30), wife of Kamdak Tado, and Kamdak Karna (9) and Kamdak Jita (8) — both daughters of Tado.A hunt is on for another woman, Lokam Minu (20).With this, the death toll due to monsoon-related incidents in the state has climbed to 14.Expressing grief, Chief Minister Pema Khandu ordered all possible relief and an ex-gratia amount of Rs 4 lakh each for the next of kin of the deceased.He appealed to the people residing in vulnerable areas to be cautious and move to safer places.Khandu said according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), heavy rain was expected across the state in the next few days, and urged people to take all precautionary measures.Incessant rains for the last five days have triggered landslides and floods that have left a trail of devastation in the state, damaging roads, houses and inundating low-lying areas.Landslides have been reported from various locations in and around the state capital region.Besides, road communication has been badly affected and the water level in the streams and rivers in the state capital has risen. The water supply project at Poma has also been damaged due to a landslide.The Public Health and Engineering Department officials said water supply to Itanagar would be affected as the restoration work would take at least four days.A mudslide at the Dokum colony damaged houses in the Chimpu area. A road in Niti Vihar was also affected due to a landslide on Thursday, officials said.A landslide hit the Waii International Hotel here, damaging its staff quarters, they added.Besides damaging a long stretch of road from the gate of Dera Natug Government College to Upper Vivek Vihar here, landslides have blocked a road from the Hilltop colony to the IRBN colony.PWD Assistant Engineer B Tadar said a large stretch of the Papu Nallah-Itanagar road via Jullang had also been damaged.A culvert near the Nyishi Elite Society (NES) secretariat at Richi has washed away, due to which the road has been closed, officials said.A series of landslides and flash floods have left a trail of destruction in East Siang district.The washing away of a 30-foot approach road to a bridge over the Sile river has affected communication on the Mirem Mikong-Ruksin road under Ruksin sub-division.Several pockets of Pasighat, the district headquarters of East Siang, are facing a flood-like situation with the low-lying areas completely inundated.The Siang river and all its tributaries are flowing above the danger mark and the district administration has issued advisories, asking people not to venture into the rivers.East Siang DC Kinny Singh has activated the Incident Response Team and directed the district disaster management officer and incident commanders to remain alert.He has also cautioned people against venturing into the Siang and Sibo Korong rivers for fishing and other activities.All major rivers and their tributaries are in spate in Lohit, Dibang Valley, Lower Dibang Valley, West Kameng and Namsai districts.

10-07-2020||---||Chinese envoy seeks to avoid trade boycott||New Delhi, July 10Maintaining that front line troops at the line of actual control (LAC) are disengaging, Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong on Friday made the case for turning the page over the Galwan Valley incident, which was a situation “neither China nor India would have liked to see”.In the immediate term, the Chinese envoy was looking at avoiding an Indian boycott of Chinese trade and investment, calming tempers to discourage India from labelling China as a strategic enemy and salvaging the 70th anniversary celebrations of diplomatic ties.Sun mentioned these aspects in “five fundamental points” about India-China ties in a video address. He also addressed emerging opinions in India after the Galwan Valley clash about Chinese expansionism and viewing Beijing as an enemy and a strategic threat. “It is not the fact. It is harmful indeed and not helpful,” he observed.Instead India and China should be partners rather than rivals, push for peace rather than confrontation, avoid a zero-sum game, build trust and move forward rather than backward.Stating that China is “neither a warlike state nor an assertive country”, Sun nevertheless repeated Wang’s observation that “what recently happened at the Galwan Valley is very clear”.On averting a trade boycott, Sun said Chinese investment of over Rs 60,000 crore in India had brought local jobs and boosted several sectors. Any restrictive measure will be unfair to Chinese enterprises, as well as to Indian employees and consumers.Any complete exclusion of “Made in China” products will amount to ignoring global industrial and supply chains formed in a process of natural selection. “It will eventually hurt oneself as well,” cautioned Sun while referring to several forward looking but unimplemented agreements between Modi and Xi on a high-level economic and trade dialogue mechanism and developing a “manufacturing partnership”.The envoy hinted that the 70th anniversary of China-India diplomatic ties should be observed in some form because for most of these years, bilateral ties had withstood tests and made hard-won progress.Sun said the India-China relationship today had world significance but is facing a complex situation which required a broader and far-sighted view. It should be turned around as soon as possible by meeting each other halfway, he suggested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-envoy-seeks-to-avoid-trade-boycott-111087

Yesterday the state had reported 1,555 new cases, while the previous to that the figure was 1,322 cases in 24-hour period. The total coronavirus cases have crossed touched 25,422 with the death toll now standing at 292.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/outrage-over-indecent-disposal-of-bodies-of-covid-victims-in-nellore-111081
10-07-2020||K V Prasad||RS panel on science and technology meets, Naidu expresses satisfaction on resumption||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 10 More than three months after Parliament was adjourned abruptly, the Rajya Sabha Committee on Science & Technology met on Friday with three scientific bodies making presentations to the panel on preparedness for Covid19 and beyond.The meeting of the panel headed by former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh assumes significance as it marks the resumption of the process that remained halted since March 23. A scheduled meeting last month of the Anand Sharma-led Standing Committee on Home Affairs could not be held since some MPs expressed inability to attend due to travel restrictions and quarantine rules in states they represent. The Committee is now due to meet on July 15.“I am glad that Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees have resumed functioning, three and half months since the last sitting of Parliament on  March 23,’’ Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said in a tweet.He said the coronavirus pandemic did cast a shadow on the working of these committees, which function on behalf of the Parliament.While many MPs, especially those in the opposition, were keen that the Committees begin their oversight work through virtual meetings, under the existing rules and confidential nature of the work it could not be held without physical presence of members. The Committee meetings are not open. It is only after a report is finalised and presented to Parliament or to the Chairman/Speaker its contents can come out.Opposition MPs have been raising the issue of holding of virtual meetings of the panels and Parliament session too. Several parliaments have devised ways to hold sessions in the face of the global pandemic that requires following of strict protocols, including social distancing.On his part, the Chairman said all possible measures were taken to enable Committee meetings by complying with the norms of social distancing, wearing of masks further to the lifting of restrictions on domestic air travel in May following lockdown.At today’s meeting, sources privy to the proceedings said the Principal Scientific Adviser, and officials from the Department of Bio-Technology, Department of Science and Technology and Central Scientific and Industrial Research gave presentations related to health, equipment, vaccines, drugs and pharmaceuticals in regard to coronavirus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-panel-on-science-and-technology-meets-naidu-expresses-satisfaction-on-resumption-111077
10-07-2020||New Delhi||Season of two viruses? Scientists worried that dengue outbreak may aggravate COVID-19 crisis||As dengue season sets in across large parts of India with the onset of the monsoon, scientists warn that COVID-19 and the mosquito-borne disease have overlapping symptoms and worry the country’s healthcare infrastructure won't be able to cope with this double whammy.The impact of a ‘dengue-COVID-19’ season would entail two different diagnostic tests and extract a huge toll on patients too, each disease making the other more complicated to deal with and perhaps more fatal.While the number of COVID-19 cases races towards the 8,00,000-mark with 7,93,802 cases on Friday and 21,604 fatalities, the incidence of dengue is also high.Based on the 2016-2019 data, virologist Shahid Jameel estimated that India gets about 1,00,000 to 2,00,000 confirmed cases of dengue each year.According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), 1,36,422 dengue cases were diagnosed in 2019 and an estimated 132 people died.“The virus is endemic and present around the year in southern India, and in monsoon and early winter in northern India,” Jameel, CEO at DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance, a public charity that invests in building biomedical sciences and health research framework, told PTI.Both COVID-19 and have symptoms such as high fever, headache and body pain.The dengue season may aggravate the COVID-19 situation as both viruses may supplement each other, warned Dhrubjyoti Chattopadhyay, virologist and Vice Chancellor of the Amity University in Kolkata.“This situation is not yet well studied. But the information available from South America is dangerous and found to create a major challenge to their medical infrastructure,” he said.“The effect will be very critical. As major symptoms are overlapping, the simultaneous infection will be much more fatal. Weakened immune systems will help the other to be more fatal.” Once the dengue season starts, added virologist Upasana Ray, the infection spreads aggressively due to high prevalence of its mosquito vector, aedes aegypti.“Each season, we experience heavy loads in the hospital wards due to dengue outbreak and those times it gets almost unmanageable. So, have we thought about what will happen when we have two menaces to handle together? Both of them have overlapping symptoms. Are we geared to distinguish if a person has dengue or COVID 19?” asked the senior scientist, CSIR-IICB, Kolkata.The challenges are many.Almost every patient with a three-day fever would need to undergo a test for dengue and another for the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19.“Considering the current numbers of COVID-19 patients, will our hospitals have beds available for dengue patients? Or will only severe dengue cases be handled at hospitals?” she asked.Explaining how the viruses manifest in the human body, Jameel said the dengue virus enters via a mosquito bite through the subcutaneous layer of the skin from where it reaches the lymph nodes that are rich in types of blood cells called monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells.The virus, he said, primarily reproduces in these cells and can severely alter cytokine production by these cells, a fundamental response to injury and infection in the body.On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells primarily through mucosal membranes of the mouth and nasal cavity and initially replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract.“In some cases, however, the infection moves down the trachea into the lungs, where it infects the air sacs that exchange oxygen with blood. This causes inflammation as the immune system tries to fight the virus and leads to fluid accumulation in the lungs, which results in respiratory distress and oxygen demand.“So, you see, both viruses infect via different pathways and different cell types. There would, of course, be overlaps in physiological effects and immunological responses. They would most likely make each disease worse than either infection alone,” Jameel noted.The most likely effect, he said, would be on healthcare capacity.“Since initial clinical presentation is similar -- high fever -- one would be ignored at the expense of the other. With hospitals mainly in COVID-19 mode, they may also refuse dengue patients,” Jameel said.He said this had been already seen in connection with pregnancy care and deliveries, dialysis and tuberculosis treatment.“We need to be careful and deploy tests for dengue also for febrile illness. Thankfully, India makes some very good tests for dengue virus, e.g. NS1 antigen test that is positive on the first day of fever,” said Jameel.Ray pointed out that there is no vaccine available clinically for either and no specific antiviral to treat them.“This infection may show low to severe forms of infection including simple dengue fever, severe dengue and the haemorrhagic fever,” said Ray.“We are already amidst the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and hospitals are running out of beds although the government is trying its level best. We are yet to attain enough facility to handle the increasing coronavirus cases every day in India,” she said.According to Ray, careful preparation is needed as the country has very little time before a full-blown dengue season starts.“While many dengue patients don't end up in critical care units (CCUs),  a good fraction do. Do we have enough ICUs and CCUs to tackle dengue and COVID 19 together? Do we have enough trained manpower?”Healthcare and research, she said, need to gear up to fight this “upcoming very realistic situation”.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Sincerity must in settling LAC row: India||Officials from India and China on Friday agreed that it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between Senior Army Commanders. The 16th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) noted that Senior Army Commanders will meet soon to discuss further steps so as to ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation in a timely manner. The Indian read out of the meeting stressed on the word “sincerity” in two key areas---first, complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and, second, de-escalation from India-China border areas.The WMCC is a key mechanism chaired by senior diplomats from both sides to iron out the on-ground wrinkles in implementing the consensus reached between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi. In limbo for over a year, it was activated after the Galwan Valley clash. The WMCC meeting noted the importance of maintaining the ongoing communication at diplomatic and military levels and agreed to interact again in the near future.The delegations were led by Joint Secretary (East Asia) from the MEA and DG of the Boundary & Oceanic Department of the Chinese MFA, respectively.A MEA statement issued after the meeting said the two sides recalled the agreement reached between the two Foreign Ministers (S Jaishankar and Wang Yi) on June 17 as well as the agreement between two Special Representatives (Ajit Doval and Wang Yi) on July 5 that it was essential to maintain “enduring” peace and tranquillity in border areas for the overall development of bilateral relations.The meeting reviewed the progress made in the ongoing disengagement process along the LAC in the Western Sector and agreed that it was necessary for both sides to sincerely implement the understandings reached between Senior Commanders, added the Indian readout.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sincerity-must-in-settling-lac-row-india-111075
10-07-2020||New Delhi||In 2017-18, NHRC sent multiple notices to UP govt on ‘encounters’ by police||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had sent notices to the Uttar Pradesh government over a number of alleged encounter killings by the state police in 2017-18.The issue has gained significance in view of gangster Vikas Dubey being shot dead Friday by UP police, who claim that he tried to flee after the car carrying him following his arrest in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh overturned on the outskirts of the city.In November 2018, the NHRC had sent notices to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary and the Police Chief of the state, taking suo motu cognisance of a media report about a 20-year old man, Irshad Ahmad of Muzaffarnagar district, being shot dead in an alleged fake encounter on November 27 that year.Reportedly, Ahmad’s father had said his son had no criminal history and was killed in cold blood in a fake encounter, the rights panel had said in a statement while observing that the contents of the news report raised serious questions about violations of human rights of the victim and his family.It is the “solemn duty of the police force to protect the people and not to create an atmosphere of fear under the garb of dealing with crime. Any death caused in an encounter, if not justified, would amount to an offence of culpable homicide,” the Commission had observed in its notice.In February 2018, the NHRC had sent notices to the state’s chief secretary and the police chief, taking suo motu cognisance of media reports that a 25-year-old man was shot in Noida allegedly by a sub-inspector of the UP police on the night of the February 3 that year, and that the policeman was reportedly heard “telling his colleague that the encounter would earn him an out-of-turn promotion”.However, reportedly, the Noida police had “denied receiving any message of an encounter”, the rights panel had said in a statement.The Commission, while issuing the notices, in this case, had observed that it seemed the “police personnel in the state of Uttar Pradesh are feeling free, misusing their power in the light of an undeclared endorsement given by the higher-ups”.It had observed that the police force is meant to protect the people and that incidents such as encounters sent a “wrong message” to the society. “Creating an atmosphere of fear is not the correct way to deal with the crime,” the statement said.In November 2017 too, the human rights watchdog had issued notices to the state government and the DGP, taking suo motu cognisance of media reports about the Adityanath government allegedly endorsing killings in encounters by police to improve the law and order situation in the state.The NHRC had sought replies from them, including a detailed report on the issue within six weeks.“According to the official statistics, as reported on October 5, 2017, 433 such encounters had occurred over a period of six months starting from March 2017 when the present government came into existence. A total of 19 alleged criminals were killed in these encounters and 89 injured,” the NHRC said in a statement. It pointed out that 98 officials were also injured and one had died.Another news story of September 16, 2017, said 15 people had been killed in encounters since the new government had come to power in Uttar Pradesh, the rights body said.The state government had reportedly described the encounters as “achievement and a proof of improvement in the law and order situation,” the NHRC said.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was quoted in a newspaper on November 19, 2017, as saying that “criminals will be jailed or killed in encounters”, the rights panel had said, promoting it to send the notices.According to the NHRC guidelines for all states and Union Territories, in case of custodial deaths the rights’ body should be intimated within 24 hours, and within 48 hours of the incident in case of an encounter death, in order to protect and promote human rights.The Commission had noted that it had also received intimation of “about 22 encounter deaths from the state police authorities in 2017”, as per its standing guidelines.The NHRC, while issuing the notices had observed that “even if the law and order situation is grave, the state cannot resort to such mechanism, which may result in the extrajudicial killings of the alleged criminal”.“It is not good for a civilised society to develop an atmosphere of fear, emerging out of certain policies adopted by the state, which may result into violation of their right to life and equality before law,” it said in a statement.Vikas Dubey was the sixth man to die in a police encounter after the ambush he allegedly masterminded in Kanpur’s Bikru village past midnight on July 2, killing eight policemen who had come to arrest him.Madhya Pradesh police arrested Dubey outside the Mahakal temple in Ujjain on Thursday morning and were handed over to an Uttar Pradesh police team.Dubey was shot dead Friday by police, who claimed that he tried to flee after the SUV carrying him from Ujjain overturned on an isolated stretch of a highway. Police said the gangster snatched a pistol from one of the policemen injured in the accident and was shot when he opened fire while trying to flee, an account being questioned by opposition parties.

10-07-2020||Hyderabad||Telangana Governor’s questioning state over COVID response irks TRS government||Telangana Government appears to be bristling under Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan’s questioning about its handling the COVID-19 health crisis.  Soundarajan, T a former BJP National Secretary and was president of the party’s Tamil Nadu unit before her appointment to the position in September 2019, has been reported as saying she was unhappy with the state’s response to the crisis. Herself a doctor, Soundarajan has even been visiting hospitals in Hyderabad to assess the state’s preparation for handling the crisis.She visited the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) last week after allegations of mismanagement and overcharging were reported in the press. Then, earlier this week, she called Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and Special Chief Secretary (Health) Shanti Kumari to Raj Bhavan to discuss the state’s arrangements.None of this has gone down well with Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s (KCR) government, sources said.The Congress meanwhile has called for President’s Rule in the state saying KCR, as the chief minister is popularly called, has been unavailable at a time of the pandemic.Former state Congress president Ponnala Lakshmaiah said on Thuesday: “KCR had abandoned the people when the state needed him most”. The opposition’s digs have been also been a cause of fissures between the BJP-appointed Governor Soundararajan and leaders of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), the ruling party.When the state chief secretary and home secretary skipped meetings with the governor citing “prior engagements”, it sent out a message from the ruling party that it did not appreciate the Governor’s involvement in the state’s administration. But an adamant Soundararajan scheduled a video conference the next day with the top management of several super-specialty hospitals and is believed to been severe in her assessment, including pulling up doctors for overcharging COVID-19 patients.Taking an aggressive stand, Sounderajan had asked her staff to follow up on the complaints with the hospitals in question. Her relentless questioning finally led to the chief secretary and health secretary visiting her to discuss the situation.As Telangana’s cases rise and opposition pitch grows louder against the state government’s handling of the public health crisis, the ruling TRS has begun taking her criticism seriously.Meanwhile, both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been seeing arise in COVID-19 cases, seeing close to about 2000 fresh cases every day. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area continues to see over 1500 new cases every day.Keeping the rapid increase in cases, the Telangana Government has cancelled the supplementary exams for intermediate and declared all candidates had passed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-governors-questioning-state-over-covid-response-irks-trs-government-111070
10-07-2020||New Delhi||Justifiable grounds for extending probe time in UAPA case against Sharjeel: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday held there were good and justifiable grounds for extending the time to complete investigation against JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a case related to alleged inflammatory speeches during the protests against the CAA and the NRC.The high court said after perusing the details of the investigation carried out till the application or report was filed by the prosecution in the trial court and the points still pending to be carried out by the investigating authority, the decision to extend the period for carrying out the probe could not be faulted with.Justice V Kameswar Rao dismissed the plea by Imam, who was arrested on January 28, challenging the trial court’s June 25 order granting three more months to the Delhi Police, beyond the statutory 90 days, to complete the investigation in the case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or the UAPA.“This court has already held there are good/justifiable grounds for extending the investigation. In view of my above conclusion, the present petition filed by the petitioner (Imam) is devoid of merit and is as such dismissed,” the judge, in its 54-page order, said.The high court noted that the prosecutor’s report filed in the trial court stated “since March 24, 2020, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic a lockdown has been imposed due to which the pace of investigation was seriously disrupted” and said this “clearly depicts the reasons for not completing the investigation in 90 days”.Imam was arrested on January 28 from Bihar’s Jehanabad district in the case related to the violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university here in December last year.The statutory period of 90 days from the arrest had concluded on April 27.He had also sought default bail in the matter on the ground that the probe was not concluded within the statutory period of 90 days and when the police had filed an application for more time to complete the investigation, he was not given a notice as required under the law. The trial court had dismissed the bail plea.The high court, in its verdict, said Imam had not challenged the addition of Section 13 (punishment for unlawful activities) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) to the list of offences, he was accused of.The high court said the submission of Imam’s counsel was “not appealing” that mere reproduction of the application of the investigating authority by the prosecutor and recording his satisfaction for praying to extend the time of the probe did not demonstrate application of mind.It said the submission of senior advocate Rebecca John, representing Imam, that the filing of the application by the prosecution on the 88th day of the arrest was clearly malafide only to deny the statutory bail to the petitioner, was also not convincing.“This I say so because the addition of Section 13 of the UAPA to the offences has not been contested. The UAPA provides for extension of the period of investigation for a further period of 90 days, that is, totalling 180 days,” the judge said.The high court noted that the submission of Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, representing the police, that the intent of the investigating authority was to complete the investigation in the original time period.“It is only, when the period prescribed for completing the investigation is expiring that an application for extension of the period of investigation would lie and further moving the application / report much in advance would be clearly premature and the court could comment that sufficient period is still available for completing the investigation and may reject the same. It is only when despite efforts, investigation could not be completed in time, that the investigating authority approached the court for extension. In any case there is no bar in law for moving the application on the 88th day, are appealing,” the high court noted as Lekhi’s submissions.Regarding Imam’s submission that no formal notice was given to him or his lawyer by the trial court informing them about the police’s application, the high court said written notice giving reasons is not the requirement of law.“The fact that the counsel of the petitioner was in the knowledge about the impending application / report seeking extension of time for completion of the investigation beyond 90 days and a written notice giving reasons is not the requirement of law, I find, there is a compliance of principles of natural justice,” the judge said, adding that no prejudice has been caused to the accused.Imam is currently lodged in Guwahati jail in a case related to the UAPA registered by the Assam police.Initially, a case under Section 124 A (Sedition) and 153 A of the IPC (promoting enmity between classes) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC was lodged by the Crime Branch here, pursuant to the alleged speeches addressed by Imam, allegedly instigating a particular religious section of the society to disrupt/block the access to North East region of India from rest of India, police had claimed.Imam was allegedly involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges.Separate cases have also been registered against him in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.

The Chinook is a multi-role, vertical-lift platform, primarily used for transporting troops, artillery, equipment and fuel.India finalised a multi-billion dollar contract with Boeing to procure 22 Apache helicopters and 15 Chinooks for the IAF in September 2015.Both the Apache and Chinook helicopters have been pressed into service as part of the IAF’s deployment along the LAC in view of the bitter standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, officials said.“With this delivery of military helicopters, we continue to nurture this partnership and are fully committed to working closely with India’s defence forces to deliver the right value and capabilities to meet their operational needs,” said Surendra Ahuja, Managing Director, Boeing Defence India.India is one of 17 nations to select the Apache and has the most advanced variant, the AH-64E Apache.Defence and security ties between India and the US have been on an upswing in the last six years. The bilateral defence trade touched USD 18 billion mark in 2019, reflecting growing defence cooperation between the two sides.Both sides have also been pushing for joint venture and collaboration between private sectors of the two countries in defence manufacturing.In June 2016, the US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner,” intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing with New Delhi to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.In a statement, Boeing said the AH-64E Apache has an improved modernised target acquisition designation system that provides day and night target tracking system.“In addition to classifying air and ground targets, the fire control radar has been updated to operate in the maritime environment. It is uniquely suited to meet a commander’s needs, including reconnaissance, security, peacekeeping operations, and lethal attack, across myriad environments - without reconfiguration,” the Boeing said.It said 20 defence forces around the world either have Chinooks in service, or are on contract to receive them.“The iconic tandem-rotor helicopter has been the world’s most reliable and efficient heavy-lift helicopter for more than 50 years, allowing customers to operate in climatic (hot), altitude (high), and crosswind conditions,” the company said.It said the CH-47F(I) Chinook contains a modern machined airframe, a common avionics architecture system cockpit, and a digital automatic flight control system.“Those innovations and technologies will help the Indian Air Force meet evolving mission demands, maximize interoperability, and reduce life-cycle costs,” it said.Earlier this year, India and the US signed a contract for the acquisition of six Apaches for the Indian Army during President Donald Trump’s visit to Delhi.       Boeing’s joint venture with Tata in Hyderabad has been producing aero-structures for the AH-64 Apache helicopter for both US Army and international customers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-aerospace-major-boeing-completes-delivery-of-37-military-helicopters-to-india-111053
10-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||Vikas Dubey ‘encounter’: What it means for BJP govt in UP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 10Key state Uttar Pradesh will vote for a new Assembly in about a year and a half from now. The term of the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath government is expiring in March 2022.   It is in such a dynamic situation that dreaded criminal Vikas Dubey was today killed by the police in an “encounter”, a week after the horrific Bikru incident where he and his men killed several policemen. It also coincides with the ‘Brahmin Chetna Samvad’ initiated by Congress leader Jitin Prasada to regain support of “upper caste Hindus” feeling “neglected and sidelined” by ‘thakur’ CM Adityanath. Regional players SP and BSP have also pulled out all stops, raising questions about the “encounter” that ended the free run the hardcore criminal in the state under various regimes, including theirs.Also read: In 2017-18, NHRC sent multiple notices to UP govt on ‘encounters’ by policePolitical observers are sensing interesting dimensions to the multi-layered situation unfolding in UP, a state driven by caste and community equations, in the run-up to the polls. Asserting that criminals need to be given exemplary punishment in a proper way, they say the current situation may be used to “widen the existing gap” between castes while Dubey’s protectors, in police and political parties, go scot-free. UP-based political observer Sudheer Panwar explains: “Because of media and public attention the killing of Dubey assumes political implications. Congress’ ‘brahmin’ face, Prasada, has started movement to wean off the caste from the BJP on the pretext of ‘thakur’ dominance. “He has criticised encounter of Dubey’s relatives, alleging misbehaviour of the police with his mother, father, wife and son, which may find resonance with members of the caste. The killing of Dubey may deepen further the gulf between ‘thakurs’ and ‘brahmins’. However, the CM will get support from those who appreciate his ‘thok do’/ tit for tat policy,” says Panwar. After the killing/encounters of criminals belonging to so-called upper caste Hindu community, the Opposition may also find it hard to question ‘dharmnirpekshata’ (secularism) of Adityanath government. While Dubey’s end may boost the image of the CM is it the answer to the real problem, the politician-police system that provides patronage to criminals, they question."SP, BSP and Congress may blame Aditynath but the state is in current pitiful situation because of all political parties, including the BJP. In the hinterlands of UP and Bihar, criminals have a tremendous hold on people," they say.BJP sources say Adityanath wants to end the nexus and is prepared for the criticism because he is aware that is what a large majority of people want. “Dons like Dubey have been encouraged, patronised by all parties, most by SP and BSP. In the past 15 years law and order became a major issue with politicisation of police force. Yadavs were hired during the SP regime, resulting in a corrupt, inefficient and politicised police force and deteriorating law and order,” they say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vikas-dubey-encounter-what-it-means-for-bjp-govt-in-up-111050
10-07-2020||New Delhi||Vikas Dubey’s killing raises handcuffing issue vis-a-vis SC guidelines on ‘inhuman’ practice||The alleged encounter killing of dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey on Friday has kicked up dust over his not being apparently handcuffed by the police, against the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s disapproving the practice in various orders, calling it “inhuman, unreasonable, over harsh and arbitrary”.The police, on the other hand, have all along been supporting handcuffing at various judicial forums on the ground that the practice has been quite helpful in ensuring that a dreaded accused or convict does not flee the custody.The apex court has from time to time issued a slew of directives on the procedure to be followed while handcuffing an undertrial, maintaining that the insurance against escape does not compulsorily require handcuffing.According to police, Dubey was killed after he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti during his transit from Ujjain to Kanpur and their car met with accident.               It said the gangster snatched a pistol from one of the policemen injured in the accident and was shot when he opened fire while trying to flee, an account being questioned by opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh.Six policemen, including two from the Special task Force, were hurt in the accident and the exchange of fire around 6 am, an official said.With this incident, the debate over handcuffing criminals while taking them from one place to another has ensued once again.The apex court in 1995 held that minimal freedom of movement cannot be cut down by application of handcuffs or other hoops.It had categorically stated that handcuffing of prisoners without judicial consent was illegal.“We clearly declare—and it shall be obeyed from the Inspector General of Police and Inspector General of Prisons to the escort constable and the jail warder—that the rule, regarding a prisoner in transit prison house and Court house, is freedom from handcuffs and the exception, under conditions of judicial supervision we have indicated earlier will be restraints with irons to be justified before or after,” the apex court said.In another case—Prem Shankar Shukla vs Delhi Administration, the top court in 1980 made important observations on the issue and said that there were other measures whereby an escort can keep safe custody of a “detenu without the indignity and cruelty implicit in handcuffs or other iron in contraptions”.It said: “Handcuffing is prima facie inhuman and, therefore, unreasonable, is over harsh and at the first blush, arbitrary. Absent fair procedure and objective monitoring to inflict “irons” is to resort to zoological strategies repugnant to Article 21.                 “Surely, the competing claims of securing the prisoner from fleeing and protecting his personality from barbarity has to be harmonised.”The top court has observed that to prevent the escape of an undertrial is in public interest, reasonable, just and cannot, by itself be castigated.“But to bind a man hand and foot, fetter his limbs with hoops of steel, shuffle him along in the streets and stand him for hours in the courts is to torture him, defile his dignity, vulgarise society and foul the soul of our Constitutional culture,” it said.Referring to Articles 14 (Equality before law) and 19 (Freedoms of speech), the top court had said that when there is no compulsive need to fetter a person’s limbs “it is sadistic, capricious, despotic and demoralising to humble a man by manacling him”.“Such arbitrary conduct surely slaps Article 14 on the face. The animal freedom of movement, which even a detained is entitled to under Article 19, cannot be cut down cruelly by application of handcuffs or other hoops.       “lt will be unreasonable so to do unless the State is able to make out that no other practical way of forbidding escape is available, the prisoner being so dangerous and desperate and the circumstances so hostile to safe keeping,” it had said.

Dubey was the prime accused in the ambush in which the policemen were killed.Prior to Dubey’s encounter, five of his alleged associated were killed in separate encounters.The plea, filed in the apex court by advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay, has referred to media reports and claimed that encounter of these five co-accused by the police is “not only extremely illegal, inhuman, but also it is shocking to the conscience of the court and is nothing but Talibanisation of the country, which cannot be countenanced at all”.“I had done e-filing of the petition at 2 AM and provisional number was also allotted,” Upadhyay told PTI over phone.It has sought direction to the Uttar Pradesh government and police to register FIR for demolition of residential building, vehicles and other properties of Dubey and also regarding encounters of the co-accused.The plea said the investigation must be transferred to the CBI and the probe agency should be directed to submit its periodical reports before the top court.“In view of the extremely high handed and illegal action of Uttar Pradesh Government/Police so carried out inasmuch as completely pulling down/demolishing the residential building, shopping mall of accused Vikas Dubey….there is every possibility of even accused Vikas Dubey being killed by Uttar Pradesh Police after his custody being obtained by them from MP police and then concoct a story of encounter….,” the plea alleged.It claimed that killing of accused by police and then “giving the same colour of encounter is extremely inhuman and against the very rule of law and orderly society” and the same cannot be countenanced under any circumstances.“Though, it cannot be denied the act of the accused of killing eight policemen is extremely heinous crime, yet the accused were/are required to be dealt with in accordance of law and in the process, upon their guilt being proved after full-fledged trial, they could have been convicted even for death sentence….,” it said.It said that FIR should be registered against the concerned policemen and officials involved in demolition of residential building of Dubey and encounter of five co-accused.The plea said that in India, even criminals like 2008 Mumbai attack case accused Ajmal Kasab and those involved in the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts were given complete opportunity to defend themselves during the trial and appeal up to the apex court.“Time has come when this court being ultimate custodian of law and Constitution, under which the country needs to be ruled/governed, needs to take serious view of the matter or else, a time will come when there will be only police raj in this country, which cannot be countenanced,” it said.It claimed that emergence of people like Dubey is a glaring example of “corruption in police department and law enforcing machineries”.Referring to media report, it alleged that Dubey had blessing of politicians of various political parties and had deep connection with police department.While on July 3, two of his alleged associates, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey, were killed by police in an encounter in Kanpur, on July 8 the police killed, Amar Dubey, who carried a reward of Rs 50,000, in Maudaha village in Hamirpur district.On July 9, two more alleged aides—Kartikeya alias Prabhat and Praveen alias Bauwa Dubey—were killed in separate encounters in Kanpur and Etawah districts. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hours-before-vikas-dubeys-encounter-plea-in-sc-claims-possibility-of-his-killing-by-cops-111018

10-07-2020||Lucknow||Endgame, all in a week: This is gangster Vikas Dubey’s story||Vikas Dubey was a relatively unknown name in Uttar Pradesh and its underworld till Friday, July 3.As the sun dawned on Friday, Dubey had become the most dreaded name in the country.He and his accomplices had shot dead eight police personnel in Bikru village under Chaubeypur police circle in cold blood.The police team had gone to Vikas Dubey's house in the wee hours of Friday to arrest him in a case of attempted murder.Dubey, who had been tipped off about the police raid by some moles in the police force, was prepared with his gang and opened fire on unsuspecting police personnel.He fled the scene with his accomplices, leaving behind a trail of blood, rage and horror.The incident, first of its kind in Uttar Pradesh, led to nationwide outrage and cast aspersions on the Yogi Adityanath government and the state police force.The Kanpur police shot dead two suspects, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey, within four hours of the incident.In another knee-jerk reaction, the police demolished Dubey's house in Bikru village a day after the massacre and trampled over his two vehicles and two tractors with an earthmover.The action made political leaders like former Union Minister Salman Khurshid question the legality of the action and the action on his family earned him support from the Brahmin community.Station officer Vinay Tiwari and inspector KK Sharma were suspended after their call detail records confirmed their conversation with the gangster. The two were arrested on Wednesday.As investigations progressed, the political connections of Vikas Dubey grabbed headlines. His photographs with top political leaders across the political spectrum added to the discomfiture of the people in power and in the opposition.Investigations revealed that Vikas had amassed wealth and property through deals in real estate, liquor business and contracts.Political parties indulged in mud-slinging and played the blame game as the STF hunted down and killed his lieutenant Amar Dubey on Wednesday in Hamirpur and Bauan Dubey in Etawah. Prabhat Mishra, who was arrested from Faridabad on Wednesday, was shot dead in an encounter on Thursday - ironically, at the same spot where Vikas Dubey would later be felled on Friday.Vikas Dubey, meanwhile, remained elusive for the police. Fifty teams of state police and Special Task Force raided all his hideouts and picked up his relatives in an attempt to mount pressure on the gangster.The borders of the state were sealed and frantic searches were carried out on the highways while Vikas remained holed up in a relative's house in Kanpur itself for two days.He then managed to reached Faridabad where he was caught in a CCTV camera at a hotel. The police reached after he had left.Every move of Vikas Dubey was hungrily lapped up by the media, turning the gangster into a much-dreaded don almost overnight.Even as the police continued its attempts to arrest the gangster, Vikas quietly slipped into Madhya Pradesh and then to Ujjain. On Thursday morning, he went to the famous Mahakaal temple where he revealed his identity and got himself arrested.The Madhya Pradesh police claimed the credit for his arrest and Vikas was handed over to the UP STF on Thursday night.He had reached Kanpur on Friday morning when the SUV he was being brought in overturned and he was killed while trying to flee.When he died, Vikas Dubey had completed his journey form a nonentity to a much-dreaded gangster -- all in a week, from Friday to Friday.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/endgame-all-in-a-week-this-is-gangster-vikas-dubeys-story-110995
10-07-2020||Kanpur||UP gangster Vikas Dubey killed in 'encounter' while being taken to Kanpur||Gangster Vikas Dubey was shot dead Friday by police, who claim he was trying to flee after the car carrying him from Ujjain overturned on an isolated stretch of the highway on the outskirts of the city.The SUV met with the accident at Bhaunti in Kanpur district, toppling on the road which was slippery after the rains, police claimed. The car was part of a small convoy of police vehicles.Police said the gangster snatched a pistol from one of the policemen injured in the accident and was shot when he opened fire while trying to flee, an account being questioned by opposition parties.Six policemen, including two from the Special Task Force, were hurt in the accident and the exchange of fire around 6 am, an official said.Also read: 'Yes, I am Vikas Dubey from Kanpur'; here is how gangster was arrestedEndgame, all in a week: This is gangster Vikas Dubey’s storyVikas Dubey ‘encounter’: What it means for BJP govt in UPCulprit killed, what about those who gave patronage: PriyankaHours before Vikas Dubey’s encounter, plea in SC claims possibility of his killing by copsDubey was the sixth man to die in a police encounter after the ambush he allegedly masterminded in Kanpur’s Bikru village past midnight on July 2, killing eight policemen who had come to arrest him.Madhya Pradesh police arrested Vikas Dubey outside the Mahakal temple in Ujjain on Thursday morning. He was handed over to an Uttar Pradesh police team late in the evening.Kanpur Range Inspector General Mohit Agarwal said Dubey fled from the car with an injured policeman’s pistol.He was chased and surrounded by policemen and was asked to surrender. When he started firing with an “intention to kill”, police opened fire in self-defence, Kanpur police said.A press release said he was immediately taken to a hospital, where he died during treatment.Ganesh Shankar Vidhyarthi Medical College principal Dr R B Kamal said he was brought dead to the hospital. “Dubey sustained four bullet injuries, three in the chest and one in the hand,” he told reporters.Two policemen also suffered wounds, one in the arm and the other in the hand.Dubey’s post-mortem will be conducted by a panel of doctors. He had tested negative for coronavirus, the doctor said.Hours before the encounter, an advocate had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Uttar Pradesh government and police to ensure that he is not killed.Uttar Pradesh’s Inspector General (Civil Defence) Amitabh Thakur had also apprehended the possibility of Dubey’s death, a day before it happened.“Vikas Dubey has surrendered. It is possible he might try to escape from the custody of the UP police tomorrow and get killed. With this, the Vikas Dubey chapter will end,” he had tweeted in Hindi.Questions were being raised over the police version, challenging the account of the attempted escape of a gangster who had made no attempt to flee when nabbed near Ujjain’s Mahakal temple a day earlier.There was also some scepticism over the possibility of someone managing to snatch a policeman’s weapon and then extricating himself from an overturned vehicle.There were allegations that the media trailing the police convoy was stopped for a few minutes before the encounter took place. Video clips also appeared to show Dubey sitting in a different car when the convoy set out from Ujjain.The UP police have denied any switching of cars and said the media may have been stopped for checks.Opposition parties targeted the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh after the encounter.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the encounter as well as the ambush in which eight policemen died last week.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the criminal is now gone and asked what about those who had “protected” him. Her party has demanded a judicial probe in the entire Vikas Pandey episode.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said it was not the car that had toppled but the encounter had saved the state government from toppling, had facts come to light.Eight policemen, including Deputy Superintendent of Police Devendra Mishra, had died in a hail of bullets from the rooftops in Dubey’s Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur on July 3.Police suspect that Dubey, who faced about 60 criminal cases over the past several years, was tipped off by someone from Chaubeypur station that a team was heading out to arrest him.Dubey was also alleged to have links with politicians.Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar said of the 21 people named in the FIR registered after the Bikru ambush, six are now dead and three arrested.Seven others were also arrested in connection with the same crime. Twelve people, carrying rewards for their arrest, are absconding, he said.On the day the Bikru ambush took place, two of Dubey’s alleged accomplices, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey, were killed in an encounter with police in Kanpur district.On July 8, police killed another aide, Amar Dubey, in Maudaha village in Hamirpur district.Two more alleged accomplices were killed in Kanpur and Etawah districts on Thursday. One of them, Prabhat, died in circumstances similar to Dubey’s killing, according to the police versions.He was being brought to Kanpur on transit remand after his arrest in Faridabad when he snatched the pistol of a policeman and tried to flee, police had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-gangster-vikas-dubey-killed-in-encounter-while-being-taken-to-kanpur-110992

In Maharashtra, migrants who wanted to leave earlier have now decided to stay back as the state opened up employment opportunities,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Maharashtra Government, told a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.The Bench had taken suo motu cognisance of migrant workers’ plight last month. “This reverse migration is happening because industries are opening up. Since May 1, around 3.5 lakh workers came back to work again,” Mehta said even as the top court was not satisfied with the Maharashtra Government’s affidavit.“You cannot say everything is fine…. You (Maharashtra) have a responsibility to find out which group of migrants are getting food etc. Your affidavit says food is being provided to all migrant workers, but we think it’s far from truth. File a proper affidavit. You have treated this as an adversarial litigation,” said the Bench, which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah.But the Solicitor General’s submission on reverse migration was supported by senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing Bihar. “In Bihar, reverse migration is happening. Migrants want to go back to cities. Trains to cities are full,” Kumar said.The Bench, which had earlier ordered states to make arrangements for sending migrant workers back to their native places, posted the matter for further hearing on July 17.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi suggested that an insurance scheme for migrant labourers should be prepared.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrants-want-to-return-to-cities-maharashtra-tells-sc-110890

There is faith that the story of global revival will have India playing a leading role. I see this closely linked with the two factors… we are laying a red carpet for all global companies to come and establish their presence in India.

The meeting was deferred for the fourth consecutive time in a bid to provide enough time for the two chairmen of the party to sort out their differences amid the heightened intra-party rift.The political future of 68-year-old Oil is expected to be decided on Friday during the Standing Committee meeting, amid the growing involvement of Hou Yanqui, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, to save his chair.The Prachanda faction, backed by senior leaders and former Prime Ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal, has been demanding Oli’s resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were “neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate”.The differences between the two factions of the Nepal Communist Party — one led by Oli and the other by ‘Prachanda’ on the issue of power-sharing — has recently intensified after the Prime Minister unilaterally decided to prorogue the budget session of Parliament and over to the government’s lackluster response to the Covid-19 pandemic and his unilateral actions, bypassing the party.Oli and Prachanda have held a series of meetings to iron out their differences, but both factions appeared to have gone back to locking horns, the Kathmandu Post reported.There were sporadic demonstrations across the country on Wednesday in support of Oli, despite an agreement with Prachanda not to direct any street protests.According to a Standing Committee member, the protests in Oli’s support have not made things any better.In Kathmandu alone, at least seven sporadic demonstrations took place on Wednesday, followed by others in different parts of the country, including Saptari where the Oli rally was confronted by a Dahal rally.“Oli’s supporters are coming out on the streets instead of supporting rapprochement inside the party. We are firm in the belief that the party should not split as it would be a betrayal of the people’s mandate,” NCP spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha said.According to party insiders, this indicates the failure of dialogue between the two warring party chairs. — PTITransmission of Indian news channels stopped||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-communist-party-inching-towards-a-split-110841
