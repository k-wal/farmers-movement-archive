He had requested the CJI to look into the matter and consider initiating steps "as may be considered fit and proper to ensure that the state judiciary's neutrality is maintained".The chief minister had alleged that the senior apex court judge had proximity to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and that a "former judge of the honourable Supreme Court placed this fact on record".

25-10-2020||Chicago||Foreign students show less zeal for US since Trump took over||On a recruiting trip to India’s tech hub of Bangalore, Alan Cramb, the president of a reputable Chicago university, answered questions not just about dorms or tuition but also American work visas.The session with parents fell in the chaotic first months of Donald Trump’s presidency. After an inaugural address proclaiming “America first”, two travel bans, a suspended refugee programme and hints at restricting skilled worker visas widely used by Indians, parents doubted their children’s futures in the US.“Nothing is happening here that isn’t being watched or interpreted around the world,” said Cramb, who leads the Illinois Institute of Technology, where international scholars have been half the student body.America was considered the premier destination for international students, with the promise of top-notch universities and unrivalled job opportunities. Yet, 2016 marked the start of a steep decline of new enrolees, something expected to continue with fresh rules limiting student visas, competition from other countries and a haphazard coronavirus response.The effect on the workforce will be considerable, experts predict, no matter the outcome of November’s election.Trump has arguably changed the immigration system more than any US president, thrilling supporters with a nationalist message and infuriating critics who call the approach to his signature issue insular, xenophobic and even racist.Before the election, The Associated Press is examining some of his immigration policies, including restrictions on international students.For colleges that fear dwindling tuition and companies that worry about losing talent, the broader impact is harder to quantify: America seemingly losing its luster on a global stage.“It’s not as attractive as it once was,” said Dodeye Ewa, who’s finishing high school in Calabar, Nigeria. Unlike two older siblings who left for US schools, the aspiring paediatrician is focused on Canada. In America, she fears bullying for being an international student and a Black woman.Roughly 5.3 million students study outside their home countries, a number that’s more than doubled since 2001. But the US share dropped from 28 per cent in 2001 to 21 per cent last year, according to the Association of International Educators, or NAFSA.New international students in America have declined for three straight years: a 3 per cent drop in the 2016 school year — the first in about a decade — followed by 7 per cent and 1 per cent dips, according to the Institute of International Education, which releases an annual November report.The National Student Clearinghouse Research Centre’s fall snapshot shows a 13.7 per cent drop in undergraduate international students. The government cites high college costs, but students tell another story.“I feel I am more comfortable in my home country,” said Priyadharshini Alagiri, 22, of India, who’s pursuing a master’s in electrical and computer engineering at IIT.The Chicago university known for engineering, computer science and architecture saw a 25 per cent decline in international students from fall 2016 to fall 2018.Alagiri said the pandemic exacerbated things, including a short-lived Trump administration rule requiring international students to leave if their schools held online-only classes. Students panicked, universities protested and lawsuits followed.The Trump administration has floated curtailing Optional Practical Training, a popular programme allowing international students to work. Roughly 223,000 participated in 2018-19, according to the Institute of International Education.This month, the administration announced plans to limit H1-B skilled-worker visas, often a path for foreign students. It was pitched as a way to address pandemic-related job losses, following a June order temporarily suspending H1-Bs. It’s prompted a lawsuit.Nearly 60 per cent of US colleges reported the social and political environment contributed to the decline of new international students, according a 2019 Institute of International Education survey.Most colleges in the survey said the difficulty in obtaining US visas was also to blame. Student visas issued under Trump shrunk 42 per cent, from nearly 700,000 in 2015 to under 400,000 last year, according to the State Department.There are signs of waning interest in America in India, which, with China, provides the most international students globally.In 2018, about 90 per cent of Indians studying abroad chose the US, with fewer than 5 per cent in Canada. For the 2021 school year, roughly 77 per cent plan to study in America, and nearly 14% chose Canada.That’s according to a survey by Yocket, a Mumbai-based startup helping roughly 400,000 Indian students plan study abroad.Yocket co-founder Sumeet Jain said there’s still wide belief America is unmatched for science, technology, engineering and math fields, but students have a backup these days.Several nations have made it easier for international students. Canada allows foreign scholars to count part of their schooling toward a residency requirement for citizenship. The UK allows them to stay for two years after graduation while seeking work.International students contributed roughly $41 billion to the American economy in 2018 school year. NAFSA estimated that since 2016, the decline of new international students cost the US nearly $12 billion and at least 65,000 jobs. --- AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-students-show-less-zeal-for-us-since-trump-took-over-161033
25-10-2020||Mumbai||Improve economy instead of toppling governments, Uddhav Thackeray tells BJP||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said there would be anarchy in the country if the BJP remained interested only in toppling governments rather than improving the nation’s economy.Addressing the Sena’s annual Dussehra rally, Thackeray dared the BJP to topple his 11-month-old government and also asked it to first protect its government at the Centre.“Instead of the ‘no alternative’ factor as was the case earlier, people have now started thinking that anyone will do except you,” Thackeray said, without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Rather than working on improving economy, steps are taken to topple governments. We are heading towards anarchy,” he said, adding Shiv Sena was not greedy for power.“Though the country is facing a pandemic, how can one indulge in politics? Shiv Sena’s Hindutva is being questioned. Maharashtra government and Mumbai police are being maligned,” he said.Citing RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s speech in Nagpur earlier in the day, Thackeray said: “The RSS chief said Hindutva has been narrowed down to only observing puja rituals”.“Those who wear black cap like him should understand this if they have brains (sic),” Thackeray said, in a veiled attack on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on his remarks over Hindutva while asking for reopening places of religious worship.“I take no pleasure in shutting down places. Lifting of restrictions is being done cautiously and gradually,” he said.He said Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in alliance with the BJP, had once called for a “Sangh-mukt Bharat” and had also sought a “secular face” in 2014 as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate.“Has Nitish donned Hindutva robes or has BJP become secular now,” Thackeray said.He also hit out at Kangana Ranaut over her equating Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).“People who have no means of livelihood in their home come to Mumbai and betray it. Calling Mumbai as PoK is in fact the failure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had said he would get back PoK into India,” Thackeray said.He said Maharashtra-haters had left no stone unturned to defame the state.The Sena’s annual Dussehra rally was held at the Savarkar hall in Dadar due to coronavirus norms instead of the usual venue, the sprawling Shivaji Park, also in Dadar area.“Those crying for justice for Bihar’s son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra’s son,” Thackeray said, breaking his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya Thackeray in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.Thackeray said the time has come to reconsider the present GST system and if necessary, to modify it as states are not benefiting from this system. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/improve-economy-instead-of-toppling-governments-uddhav-thackeray-tells-bjp-161032

Uddhav to BJP||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday slammed the BJP over its poll promise of free COVID-19 vaccine in Bihar, adding does that party think those from other states hail from Bangladesh or Kazakhstan.He was speaking at the Sena’s annual Dussehra rally, held at the Savarkar hall in Dadar due to coronavirus norms instead of the usual venue, the sprawling Shivaji Park.“You promise free COVID-19 vaccine in Bihar, then are people of other states from Bangladesh or Kazakhstan,” Thackeray said. “Those speaking like that should be ashamed of themselves. You are at the Centre,” he added.In a veiled attack on actress Kangana Ranaut, Thackeray said some people come to Mumbai for bread and butter and abuse the city by calling it Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK).“Those crying for justice for Bihar’s son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra’s son,” Thackeray said, breaking his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya Thackeray in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.Thackeray said the time has come to reconsider the present GST system and if necessary, to modify it as states are not benefiting from this system. “We (Maharashtra) are yet to get our Rs 38,000 crore as GST refund,” he said.Thackeray also warned BJP not to divide people over caste, creed and religion.

25-10-2020||New Delhi||US Secy of State Mike Pompeo, Defence Secy Mark Esper to arrive in India tomorrow||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper will arrive here on Monday for the third edition of the two-plus-two ministerial dialogue, which is taking place just a week ahead of the American presidential election and in the midst of India’s festering border row with China.The two-plus-two dialogue will be held on Tuesday. The Indian side at the talks will be represented by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.A host of crucial bilateral, regional and global issues including China’s efforts to expand influence in the Indo-Pacific region as well as its aggressive behaviour in eastern Ladakh is likely to figure in the talks.In the last few months, the US has been ramping up attack on China over a range of contentious issues, including the border row with India, its military assertiveness in the South China Sea and the way Beijing handled the anti-government protests in Hong Kong.Last week, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the talks would entail a comprehensive discussion on cross-cutting bilateral issues as well as deliberations on regional and global developments.Pompeo and Esper will have bilateral meetings with their Indian counterparts as well. They are also scheduled to make a joint call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Officials said US Secretary of Defence Esper would be given a tri-services guard of honour at the lawns of South Block in the Raisina Hills on Monday afternoon.It is expected that the two sides may finalise the long-pending BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties. The BECA will provide for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.In June 2016, the US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner” intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.The two countries inked the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other’s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two countries signed another pact called the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for the sale of high-end technology from the US to India.The first edition of the two-plus-two dialogue was held in Delhi in September 2018 after the mechanism was approved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump.The second edition of the dialogue took place in Washington in December last year.The new framework of the ministerial dialogue was initiated in order to provide a forward-looking vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries.

25-10-2020||Indore||Indecent remarks: Politicians, media to blame, says former CEC||Former Chief Election Commissioner OP Rawat on Sunday expressed concern over the choice of words of leaders during speeches these days, in particular in the bypoll campaign underway in Madhya Pradesh for 28 Assembly seats.The bypolls, scheduled for November 3, are seeing a bitter tussle between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress and the terms used include “item”, “lucha lafanga”, “rakhail” etc.“There are enough provisions in the model code of conduct and the People’s Representation Act to deal with such indecent language. However, I am of the view that the use of such language cannot be checked by punitive provisions,” Rawat told PTI.He said politicians are usually banned for a few days for the use of un-parliamentary words but such moves do not last long.Rawat claimed politicians had lost the opportunity to gain knowledge in the age of social media and do not have the time to study about new things.“High standards in language should be promoted so that politicians can enhance their knowledge on basic issues and policies. This will be more effective and meaningful in the national interest,” Rawat said.He said politicians use such language to get media coverage, which they receive in the form of news headlines, while real issues get sidestepped. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indecent-remarks-politicians-media-to-blame-says-former-cec-161009
25-10-2020||New Delhi||From resuming ‘mulaqat’ to making diyas & sweets, Delhi jails inch closer to normalcy||From resuming ‘mulaqat’ to manufacturing candles and diyas to preparing sweets, the Delhi Prisons is gradually moving towards normalcy amid coronavirus pandemic, jail officials said on Sunday.The officials maintain that all safeguards are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease as the jails resume pre-COVID-19 activities.The Delhi Prisons comprises Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails.The first case of coronavirus was reported in Rohini Jail on May 13.A total of 93 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 till October 24. Out of these, 84 inmates have recovered, two died and seven are active cases, data shared by the Delhi Prisons said.Besides, 223 prison staff have tested positive, out of which, 210 recovered and 13 are active cases, it said.According to jail officials, Central Jail No 2 of Tihar and Jail No 14 of Mandoli, which house the bakeries, have gradually started increasing the quantity of sweets they prepare, just like how they used to earlier.‘Gulab Jamun’, ‘laddu’ and ‘coconut burfi’ are among the most sought after sweets prepared in these bakeries and later supplied in jails of Delhi Prisons for sale.The inmates can purchase these sweets and outsiders can get them through shops in the jail complex.These shops were closed in view of the pandemic situation, but they have now opened and gradually started supplying material.“The bakeries inside the jails were functional earlier amid the pandemic. However, less quantity of sweets were prepared. The preparation is done with extra precautions keeping in mind the risks involved in the pandemic situation,” Sandeep Goel, Director General (Delhi Prisons) said.He said the prisons are moving towards normalcy by taking all due precautions against coronavirus.“We have also resumed ‘mulaqat’ between the inmates and their family members with due precautions. But now the inmates are allowed to meet their kin once a month to avoid overcrowding as against twice a week earlier,” Goel said.The jail administration had suspended the bi-weekly mulaqat (family meeting) following the COVID-19 outbreak. It, however, resumed the meetings from October 1, but now only one member of a family is allowed to meet the prisoners. Earlier, three members of a family were permitted.Since March, all activities inside the jails were suspended, but now the administration has given its go-ahead to tasks like painting ‘diyas’ (lamps) and manufacturing candles.With Diwali approaching, the jail authorities said the inmates of Central Jail No 4 of Tihar have started painting and decorating earthen diyas.These diyas are usually purchased from outside but painted by the prisoners and later sold through the shops in the jail complex, they said.Also in Jail No 6, which houses women members, the inmates have started manufacturing candles, the officials said, adding that they are quite popular during Diwali.

The acclimatisation process was not only consuming time but also required commensurate infrastructure and logistics for accommodating the troops, he added.Many formations that are also meant to be deployed in the high-altitude areas in addition to other roles, have their peacetime locations in the plains.“The recent crisis has shown that troops may be required to move to high-altitude areas urgently for which they have to be acclimatised at all times so that they can be deployed operationally at the earliest, an officer said, adding: “We are now laying stress on redressing this issue.”Acclimatisation is critical for troops because low-oxygen levels and inclement climate can have adverse physiological, psychological, biochemical and hormonal effects on the human body and can result in acute mountain sickness, high-altitude pulmonary edema and high-altitude cerebral edema.Both the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Directorate-General Armed Forces Medical Services (DGAFMS) have been carrying out multi-faceted research in this regard.A recent study by the Indian Army medical specialists suggests that troops can be inducted from the sea-level to high-altitude areas in as little as four days if they are administered certain preventive medications such as Acetazolamide and Dexamethasone.Another option being explored is the simulation of the high-altitude conditions at lower levels where earmarked formations are based. Atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels prevalent in high altitudes can be simulated in rooms to which troops can be exposed for the required period.Some DRDO laboratories dealing with life sciences have developed small-sized chambers for research where the desired environmental conditions, be it high mountains, hot deserts or humid forests, can be created. The size and scope of such chambers can be expanded and modified to cater to larger requirements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/learning-from-ladakh-experience-army-steps-up-work-on-cutting-acclimatisation-period-for-troops-161003

We want to ask Tejashwi Yadav whether along with Congress, his party (RJD) has also made an understanding with the Jamaat-e-Islami and other radical elements in Bihar. These are questions of national security, not politics,” Naqvi said, adding that the Sena, which had formed a government in Maharashtra in alliance with the Congress, should also answer similar questions.Vadakkan claimed that when Rahul Gandhi was contesting the 2019 general elections from Wayanad in Kerala, people across the country were shocked to see more flags of the Jamaat-e-Islami than of his party in the political rallies there.Naqvi also alleged the Congress leader never missed a chance to meet the families of the PFI members and those who were arrested by police for involvement in anti-national activities in an apparent reference to his recent meeting with the wife of a journalist from the state, who was arrested while on his way to Hathras, to meet the family of the Dalit woman who died last month after being allegedly raped by four upper-caste men.The journalist, Siddique Kappan, is alleged to have links with the PFI.Political group Jamaat-e-Islami has been banned by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act while the PFI is an alleged radical group facing allegations of providing funds for protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-has-formed-radical-syndicate-with-jamaat-e-islami-pfi-rjd-also-its-part-bjp-160996
25-10-2020||---||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurates alternate road to Nathu La||Shubhadeep ChoudhuryTribune News ServiceKolkata, October 25China’s irritation over the rapid infrastructure development close to the Line of Actual Control has failed to prevent India from bolstering its road connectivity.In a bold step, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday inaugurated the ‘Alternate Alignment Gangtok-Nathu La Road’ constructed by the Army's Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in Sikkim, via video conferencing from the Headquarters of 33 Corps in Darjeeling’s Sukna.“The 19.85 Km Alternate Alignment of the National Highway 310 was dedicated to the nation today. This new alignment will bolster defence preparedness in the Nathu La Sector. Congratulations to BRO for its unwavering commitment towards delivering outstanding quality infrastructure”, the Defence Minister tweeted after the inauguration.Besides military, the new road will also be big help for civilians.  NH-310 connecting Gangtok to Nathu La is the lifeline of the people living in eastern Sikkim.“By constructing 19.35 km long alternate route BRO has fulfilled the aspirations of the Army and residents of east Sikkim,” Rajnath said while speaking after the e-inauguration of road constructed by BRO.“The previous alignment of the road has seen extensive damages due to sinking and other natural hazards,” a spokesperson from the Ministry of Defence said.Giving an outline regarding the works being executed by the BRO in Sikkim, Rajnath said most of the border roads were being upgraded to double lane. Out of this, 65 km of road construction work is in progress in eastern Sikkim. Construction of 225 km double lane road to ‘Mangan-Chugthang-Eumsemdong’ and ‘Chuganthang-Lachen-Jima-Muguthang-Nakula’ was planned under the “Bharatmala Project” in north Sikkim. These works are planned in nine packages with an estimated cost of Rs 5,710 crore, he said.The Defence Minister, who is on a two-day trip to the eastern sector, praised the positive role played by the Sikkim government. He said BRO was helped by the state government with regard to land acquisition and prompt clearance from the forest department for the construction of the road.Opening up of the alternative road to Nathu La (where India and China fought a bloody battle in 1967) followed the October 12 inauguration by Rajnath of 44 bridges built in the border areas of Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.Earlier in the day, Defence Minister performed 'Shastra Puja' at Sukna.“India wants an end to the ongoing border tension with China and the restoration of peace. This is our objective. But at times, some nefarious incidents keep happening. I am very confident that our soldiers will never allow even an inch of our land to be taken away by anyone”, Rajnath, who was accompanied by Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, said after performing the puja.The Defence Minister also greeted the soldiers on the occasion of Dussehra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-inaugurates-alternate-road-to-nathu-la-160994
25-10-2020||New Delhi||Indian Army to hold 4-day Commanders’ Conference from Monday||Top commanders of the Army will carry out a comprehensive assessment of India’s combat readiness in eastern Ladakh as well as other sensitive areas along the Line of Actual Control with China at a four-day conference beginning Monday, government sources have said.The commanders will also deliberate on a slew of long-pending reform measures like cutting down on ceremonial practices and non-military activities to ensure a rational distribution of resources, they said.Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane will chair the Army Commanders’ Conference (ACC), which is an apex level biannual event that formulates important policy decisions through a collegiate system of deliberation.It will be attended by all Army Commanders, Principal Staff Officers (PSOs) of the Army headquarters and other senior officers.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh and Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria will address the commanders on Tuesday, the sources said.“The Army Commanders will carry out a comprehensive review of the security challenges facing the nation including the situation in eastern Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir,” said a source.The situation in eastern Ladakh remains tense as both Indian and Chinese armies deployed over 50,000 troops each along the LAC following an escalation of the standoff that began in early May.The sources said the commanders would exclusively deliberate on matters relating to human resource management in the Army on Monday while they will carry out an in-depth discussion on Wednesday on various agenda points highlighted by the top Army Commanders.There will be a discussion on issues flagged by the Commander-in-Chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command, which is India’s only tri-services command.Besides reviewing the security challenges facing the nation, the Army commanders will attempt to finalise various reform measures recommended by separate internal committees in utilisation of limited resources while at the same time focusing on enhancing operational capability of the 1.3-million strong force, the sources have said.Some of the proposals to be on the table at the conference include discontinuing or at least bringing down the scale of the Army Day and Territorial Army Day parades, cutting down on various ceremonial practices and reducing the number of officers’ mess within individual peace stations, the sources added.Similarly, the top Army brass would also examine a proposal to bring down the number of guards at official residences of senior officials and another one on reducing the number of CSD canteens if several such facilities are operating within one station, they said.Another proposal on the table for discussion would be to asking various units to cut costs on celebrating Raising Day and Battle Honour Day.The sources said the last day’s agenda of the conference would include a briefing by the Director-General of Border Roads on the various infrastructure development projects being undertaken by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and allied formations.They said “automation initiatives” to optimise utilisation of manpower at various levels of the Army would also be discussed.“The conference will end with the presentation of sports trophy and flight safety trophy, followed by the closing address by the Chief of Army Staff,” said a source.

25-10-2020||New Delhi||Army Chief Gen MM Naravane scheduled to visit Nepal from Nov 4-6 with an aim to reset ties||Army Chief Gen MM Naravane's three-day crucial visit to Nepal beginning November 4 is expected to have a significant diplomatic overtone with India looking at resetting relations with the Himalayan nation after the ties came under severe strain following a bitter border row, officials said on Sunday.The Chief of Army Staff is scheduled to hold extensive talks with the top civilian and military brass of Nepal including his counterpart General Purna Chandra Thapa on a range of key issues such as further boosting the management of the nearly 1,800 km-long border between the two countries."The Chief of Army Staff is scheduled to visit Nepal from November 4 to 6 with an aim to strengthen overall ties including in areas of defence and security," a highly-placed government source told PTI.In continuation of an age-old tradition that started in 1950, Gen Naravane will be conferred with the honorary rank of 'General of the Nepal Army' by Nepalese President Bidya Devi Bhandari at an event in Kathmandu. India also confers the honorary rank of 'General of Indian Army' to the Nepal Army Chief.It will be the first high-level visit from India to Kathmandu since the ties between the two neighbours came under strain after the Himalayan nation came up with a new political map in May claiming several areas in Uttarakhand to be part of its territory.India's decision to send the Army Chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region, Earlier this month, Gen Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmarese Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.Nepal is important for India in the context of its overall strategic interests in the region, and leaders of the two countries have often noted the age-old ‘Roti-Beti' relationship.Land-locked Nepal relies heavily on India for the transportation of goods and services. Nepal's access to the sea is through India, and it imports a predominant proportion of its requirements from and through India.According to official data, Nepal's imports from India in 2017 were worth USD 6.52 billion while its exports to the country were pegged at USD 420.18 million.The figure for China, which was second on the list of countries from which Nepal imported its requirements, was five times lower than that of India.On the security side, India's strategic thinkers are concerned over reports of China grabbing Nepalese territories in a number of locations along the borders between the two countries, though Kathmandu had clarified recently that there were no such encroachments."According to reports, Beijing is fast moving forward and further pushing Nepali boundaries by encroaching more and more landmass. The actual scenario could be worse as the ruling Nepali Communist Party (NCP) is trying to shield the expansionist agenda of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)," said an expert on the condition of anonymity.It is learnt that India is for expanding overall ties with Kathmandu provided its security interests are protected.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.In the midst of the row, Gen Naravane said that there were reasons to believe that Nepal objected to the road at the behest of "someone else", in an apparent reference to a possible role by China in the matter. The comments triggered angry reactions from Nepal.India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.In its reaction after Nepal's lower house of parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Nepalese Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to "reclaim" them from India.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India.Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory---India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.

Nitish Kumar is tired now and he is no longer able to manage Bihar,” Yadav said.The comment drew sharp reactions from leaders of the ruling coalition who termed it “meaningless”.JD(U) state president Basistha Narayan Singh said: “Kumar is more energetic than many youths. He works for 14-15 hours a day, which many youngsters will not be able to do...The tired comment is bereft of any logic.”State minister Sanjay Kumar Jha hit back at Yadav, saying the Chief Minister is at least not a “Class 9 fail like him”.“He is just making meaningless comments,” Jha said.Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey, too, derided the comment, saying that NDA leaders always work with energy for the development of the state and the country.Reacting to a similar comment by Yadav, the Chief Minister recently said: “He says I am tired, let him first answer where was he when coronavirus hit Bihar.”Yadav was missing from the scene as coronavirus struck the state in March. He returned to Patna after nearly two months in mid-May from Delhi. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejashwi-says-nitish-is-tired-jdu-bjp-hit-back-160985

If not then #MarkyourselfsafefromBJP by clicking on this link https://t.co/5iCDMbqCtD pic.twitter.com/h2weiQYqrQ  The site contains messages such as “Are you against the politics of division among people”, “Are you against hatred”, “Will you speak against dictatorship”, “Will you speak against interference into your freedom”.The people are required to click the question(s) of their choice and mark themselves safe.“The BJP is destroying the social fabric by propagating divisive politics, autocracy, inequality and restriction on individual choice. The BJP believes in propagating hatred through violence against marginalised communities, against women,” a Trinamool Congress statement said about the campaign.“People of Bengal strongly oppose these tactics of the BJP and now, more than ever, citizens need to unite against these misdeeds,” the statement added.A senior TMC leader said the campaign would enable a large number of people, who were opposed to BJP’s brand of politics but have not mustered the courage to come out in the open, to make their voices heard now with their confidentiality intact.Earlier, the TMC had launched ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ (Banerjee is widely known as Didi or elder sister) campaign, also a brainchild of Kishore, about a year ago. In it, people with any grievances on any issue could contact the Chief Minister’s office by dialling a helpline number or through WhatsApp and Facebook.

The opposition was targeting the chief minister for not moving out,” Raut said, when asked if Thackeray’s annual Dusshera address on Sunday evening would target the BJP.He said Fadnavis has set a good example by getting admitted to a government hospital, and Thackeray has given directives to ensure he gets the best treatment.The Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson also said the COVID-19 vaccine should be for all citizens and its politicisation was not right.He further said the Shiv Sena has made arrangements to ensure Thackeray’s Dussehra address reaches two crore people in the state.Had there been no COVID-19 outbreak, the Shivaji Park in central Mumbai would have been smaller for the “sea of Shiv Sainiks” who would have come to hear Thackeray’s address, he said.Raut also pointed out that at the Dussehra rally last year, he said the next chief minister of the state would be from the Shiv Sena.Thackeray will deliver his Dussehra speech at the Savarkar auditorium opposite the Shivaji Park in the evening and it will be attended by 50 people, including MLAs, MPs from Mumbai, ministers and the CM’s family members.

25-10-2020||Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh)||A temple where Ravan is worshipped on Dusshera||Even as the rest of India prepares to burn effigies of Ravan as a symbolic victory of good over evil, devotees are quietly lining up outside a nondescript temple in Kanpur.This temple that opens its door for devotees only for one day in a year—Dussehra—is dedicated to the Lankan king Ravan.Devotees come from far and wide to worship Ravan on the day he was slain by Lord Ram.This 150-year-old temple is located in Shivala area and devotees light oil lamps as they offer prayers. The deity is decorated and 'aarti' is performed."Ravan is worshiped as an embodiment of 'Shakti' (power) and 'gyan' (knowledge). Ravan was a staunch devotee of Lord Shiva and is known for his knowledge and power."The temple here is a part of a Shiva temple complex and Ravan is worshipped as a guard of Lord Shiva. People believe that Ravan was also born on Dusshera-the day he was slain," says Pandit K.K. Tiwari, the temple priest.Devotees at the temple claim that when Ravan was dying, Lord Ram had asked his younger brother Laxman to take blessings from the king because his knowledge was unparalleled.

25-10-2020||Bhopal||Ahead of MP bypolls, one more Congress MLA resigns||Madhya Pradesh Congress MLA Rahul Lodhi resigned from the party and his Assembly membership and joined the ruling BJP on Sunday, ahead of the November 3 state bypolls.With this, 26 MLAs have quit the Congress in the state since March this year.“Lodhi has resigned and his resignation was accepted today,” MP Assembly’s Protem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma said.“He gave his resignation on Friday, but I asked him to rethink over it for two days. He called me last night saying he was firm on it and wanted his resignation to be accepted on the auspicious day today,” Sharma said.BJP state spokesman Rajnish Agrawal later said Lodhi has joined his party.Lodhi represented Damoh seat in the state Assembly.There are speculations that one more Congress MLA may also quit the party.By-elections to 28 Assembly seats in the state are scheduled on November 3.Twenty-five of these seats fell vacant after sitting Congress MLAs resigned and joined the BJP, leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led state government.Most of these rebel Congress MLAs were considered close to Jyotiraditya Scindia, who also walked out of the Congress and joined the BJP.Besides, three seats fell vacant due to the death of their sitting MLAs.The BJP at present has 107 MLAs and it needs to win just nine more seats to reach the magic figure of 116 - the simple majority mark in the 230-member house.The Congress’s strength in the House has now been reduced to 87.

25-10-2020||New Delhi||India needs to grow bigger than China, says RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in Dussehra speech||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said on Monday that India will have grow bigger than China in terms of economic and strategic power and scope to neutralise its “demonic” expansionist designs and aspirations.In his traditional Vijayadashami address at Nagpur, which this year was limited to an indoor event attended by 50 swayamsevaks due to COVID-19, Bhagwat also said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is not against any particular religious community.“Some people misled our Muslim brothers claiming that it is aimed at restricting their population. Before the issue could be discussed further, the focus shifted on coronavirus,” Bhagwat said adding that “no Indian citizen is threatened due to CAA” Though he did not mention the Hathras incident, he criticised Opposition parties and “tukde, tukde gang” for “trying to divide and weaken the Indian society by creating social strife”. “There are such powers in the world and their agents in India. They cite the diversity in India as divisions and incite strife,” he said, calling vigilance against “deplorable attempts to disintegrate Bharat’s unity by making false promises and creating hate amongst scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the minorities”. Realisation of all-inclusive Hindutva identity will help to promote harmony, he said.“Members of this conspiratorial gang instigate and promote slogans like ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’ (Bharat will be disintegrated). An unusual blend of political interest, separatist and fundamentalist tendencies, a hatred of Bharat and a quest for global domination is working to dampen Bharatiya unity,” he said.On China, Bhagwat said the only way to counter it is “to become bigger in terms of economic and strategic prowess apart from strengthening internal security systems and diplomatic relations with neighbours”.  “India should quickly resolve all disputes with neighbours like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Many countries are now standing up to China,” he added, citing Taiwan and Vietnam as examples of the Chinese expansion plans.“Rising above China economically, strategically, in securing cooperative ties with our neighbours and at international relations is the only way to neutralise those demonic aspirations,” he said. “The policies proposed by our leaders seem to be charting those very horizons. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar (Bhramadesh)---such neighbouring countries have shared a friendly bond with us and are more or less aligned over issues of values and ethical code with us.”Lauding Indian defence forces, government and the people remained unfazed and responded sharply to China’s boisterous efforts to invade our territories during the pandemic, Bhagwat said whereas India intends to be friendly to all (this is our nature), but “mistaking our benevolence for weakness and attempts to disintegrate or weaken us by sheer brute force is unacceptable”.  Stating that coronavirus has given rise to challenges of unemployment, Bhagwat said many lost jobs and labourers are now returning to cities but jobs may not be there. “The challenge is to create employment opportunities in different places,” he said.Bhagwat said before the pandemic, several issues that were in the public discourse took a backseat. “Article 370 was abrogated, the country accepted the Supreme Court verdict on Ram temple with patience and understanding,” he said.‘Scared to face the truth’Reacting to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s assertion that India needed to be militarily better prepared against China, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the Sangh supremo knew the truth that the communist country had grabbed Indian land but was scared to face it. “Deep inside, Mr Bhagwat knows the truth. He is just scared to face it. The truth is China has taken our land and government of Indian and the RSS have allowed it,” he said earning criticism from union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi for his “lack of understanding”. Rahul Gandhi has been attacking the government on the China issue and demanding restoration of status quo ante on the LAC prior to March 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-needs-to-grow-bigger-than-china-says-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-in-dussehra-speech-160943

25-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt employees can submit multiple bills to avail LTC cash voucher scheme benefit||Central government employees can submit multiple bills of goods and services purchased in their own name to avail the benefit of the LTC (Leave Travel Concession) cash voucher scheme, according to the Finance Ministry.The Expenditure Department, under the Ministry, has issued a set of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) on LTC cash voucher scheme, clarifying that an employee can also avail the scheme utilising the applicable LTC fare without leave encashment.The government on October 12 announced the LTC cash voucher scheme under which central government employees can purchase any goods or services with a GST rate of 12 per cent or above to avail the benefit.Till now, employees got LTC benefits only on travels made or had to forgo the amount.The Ministry said employees can avail the scheme utilising the applicable LTC fare without leave encashment."The expenditure should be in accordance with the ratio as prescribed for LTC fare," it said.To a query on whether the scheme would be applicable if a particular LTC which is meant to be used for the scheme has been partially availed by either self or members of the family, the FAQ said, "This scheme is applicable to the LTC fare left unutilised during the block year (2018-21)." On whether an employee with four family members eligible for LTC can avail the scheme for less than four members, the Ministry said an employee can avail the scheme in partial, that is for the LTC part of the eligible family."Since this is an optional scheme, if the LTC fare of any member of the family has not been utilised for this purpose, those members can avail LTC subject to extent instructions under LTC rules." The FAQ further clarified that multiple bills would be accepted, but purchases should happen within the current financial year ending March."The purchase should carry a GST of 12 per cent and above and payment should have been made through digital mode," it added.It said reimbursement would be based on the production of invoice with details of GST."As far as possible, the claim should be made and settled well before March 1, 2021, to avoid any last-minute rush and resultant lapse".Besides, the invoice which is being submitted for reimbursement under the scheme should be in the name of the employee availing the scheme.

25-10-2020||New Delhi||Maiden seaplane service to take off on October 31 from Sabarmati riverfront: Mandaviya||India's maiden seaplane service is likely to take off from Sabarmati riverfront to the Statue of Unity on October 31 if all goes as per plans, Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said.No-frills carrier SpiceJet is in the process of procuring a seaplane for the venture from the Maldives which is expected to arrive on October 26 for the first regular service on the about 205 km stretch.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier used a seaplane flight from Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad."The first seaplane service in the country is likely to be launched on October 31 from Sabarmati riverfront to Statue of Unity which will be a new beginning for the country...Infrastructure is ready for it on both the sides including the floating jetty," the shipping minister told PTI.The minister said SpiceJet is in the process of procuring a seaplane from the Maldives which is likely to land on October 26.He said benefits will be provided to the air carrier under the government's Udaan scheme."Once launched this will give a major boost to tourism," the minister said and added that this will be one of its kind service with a 19-seater plane that can accommodate 12 passengers.The Gujarat government in July this year had cleared a proposal to enter into a tri-party agreement with Union Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the construction of four water aerodromes under the regional connectivity scheme for seaplane service.A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used by seaplanes, float-planes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off.The water aerodrome was planned at the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, Sardar Sarovar dam at Kevadia in Narmada district, Shetrunji dam at Palitana in Bhavnagar district and Dhaori dam in Mehsana district.Mandaviya had reviewed seaplane projects in India recently.Sabarmati and Sardar Sarovar -- Statue of Unity route are included in the 16 seaplane routes identified in the country and hydrographic surveys of this route had been completed, as per the government.Mandaviya said that post the launch of this service, regular services are planned on various routes including Guwahati, Andaman & Nicobar and Yamuna to Tupper Dam in Uttarakhand.Earlier bullish on the growth prospects for seaplanes in India, SpiceJet's CEO Ajay Singh had said this new mode of transport can boost the country's tourism sector in a big way as they can convert any pond into an airport and can make any river a runway.Seaplanes are typically fixed-wing aircraft with a much fewer number of seats and can take off from, and land on, water. While they have been in use since 19th century, they lagged behind full-fledged aircraft after heavy investments were made in setting up airports in the 20th century but have again been re-emerging on the scene as a niche segment.Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gadkari during his tenure as Shipping Minister has been emphasising on the huge growth potential for seaplanes and has been pitching for manufacturing them within the country.

25-10-2020||New Delhi||India wants end to border tension with China but will not cede an inch of land: Rajnath||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said India wants an end to the border tension with China in eastern Ladakh, but at the same time asserted that Indian soldiers will never allow even an inch of the country to be taken away by anyone.The defence minister made the remarks after performing "Shastra Puja" -- the customary worship of weapons -- at the Sukna-based headquarters of the Indian Army's 33 Corps in Darjeeling district of West Bengal on the occasion of Dussehra.The defence minister was scheduled to perform the puja at Sherathang, a high-altitude border area near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Sikkim, but could not go there due to inclement weather, officials said."India wants an end to the ongoing border tension with China and the restoration of peace. This is our objective. But at times, some nefarious incidents keep happening. I am very confident that our soldiers will never allow even an inch of our land to be taken away by anyone," Singh said after performing the "puja".Chief of Army Staff Gen. MM Naravane and several senior officers of the Army were present on the occasion when the defence minister performed the "puja" at the key military base, which is responsible for guarding the LAC in the Sikkim sector.After performing the puja, Singh inaugurated a new road in Sikkim through a video-conference from Sukna."I can say with confidence and on the basis of concrete information that the courage and deeds of Indian soldiers during whatever has happened at the India-China border in Ladakh recently will be written in golden letters by the historians," the minister said without elaborating.Twenty Indian soldiers laid down their lives while valiantly fighting a group of Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, an incident that had significantly escalated the border tension between the two countries.China is yet to disclose the number of its soldiers killed and injured in the clash, though it has officially admitted to having suffered casualties. According to Indian officials,  China suffered "heavy casualties" in the incident.Indian troops also occupied several strategic heights in the Mukhpari, Rezang La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank of the Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh, after the Chinese military attempted to intimidate them in the area on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row that began on May 5, following a violent clash in eastern Ladakh. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.The defence minister's "Shastra Puja" at the strategically important military base was a message to India's adversaries, a military official said.Singh has been performing "Shastra Puja" during Dussehra for the last several years, including during his tenure as the Union home minister in the previous NDA government.Almost all formations of the Indian Army along the LAC are on a very high level of alert given the border row with China in eastern Ladakh.The defence minister arrived at the Sukna-based headquarters of the 33 Corps on Saturday.In an address to a group of soldiers at the base on Saturday evening, Singh said India always tried to maintain good relations with its neighbours, but situations arose from time to time when its armed forces had to make supreme sacrifices to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.The defence minister also reviewed the combat preparedness of the Army during a high-level meeting at the military base.The Army has significantly bolstered deployment of troops and weaponry along the nearly 3,500-km-long LAC, including in the Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh sectors.

25-10-2020||Nagpur||India should be bigger than China in power and scope: Bhagwat||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said India needs to grow bigger than China in terms of shakti and vypati (power and scope), adding the world knows that country's expansionist designs.Bhagwat was speaking at the RSS's annual Vijayadashami rally, which this time was limited to an indoor event attended by 50 swayamsevaks (volunteers) due to COVID-19 guidelines.Also read: Bhagwat knows China took our land, but scared to face it: RahulBhagwat said India needs to be militarily better prepared against China.Many countries are now standing up to China, he said."China was shocked at India's response to its intrusion. India needs to grow bigger in power and scope than china," he said."China encroached on our borders amid the pandemic," he said, adding the world knows the expansionist nature of that country. He cited Taiwan and Vietnam as examples of the Chinese expansion plans."We intend to be friendly with all. This is our nature. But mistaking our benevolence for weakness and attempts to disintegrate or weaken us by sheer brute force is unacceptable. Our detractors must know this by now," he said.Bhagwat said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is not against any particular religious community, adding "some people misled our Muslim brothers" claiming it was aimed at restricting their population.Before the issue could be discussed further, the focus shifted on coronavirus, he said. "The communal flare in minds of a few people stayed in their minds only. Coronavirus overshadowed all other topics," he added."We need not fear coronavirus, but should be alert and cautious. We cannot stop living. Coronavirus is spreading but fatalities are less. Due to the pandemic, we have started learning the importance of hygiene, cleanliness, environment, family values all over again," he said."Coronavirus has given rise to challenges of unemployment. Many lost jobs and labourers are now returning to cities. But the jobs may not be there. The challenge is to create employment opportunities in different places," he said.Bhagwat said before the pandemic, several issues which were in the public discourse took a backseat."Article 370 was abrogated, the country accepted the Supreme Court verdict on Ram temple with patience and understanding," he said."There was opposition to CAA claiming it was being used to check the Muslim population in the country. In fact, no Indian citizen was threatened due to CAA. Before any step could be taken to resolve the issue, the coronavirus pandemic happened," he saidBhagwat said India is a "Hindu Rashtra" and Hindutva is the essence the country's self-hood.Bhagwat said when the Sangh says Hindustan is "Hindu Rashtra", it does not have any political or power-centred concept in its mind."Hindutva is the essence of this Rashtras Swa(self-hood). We are plainly acknowledging the self-hood of the country as Hindu because all our socio-cultural practices are directed by its principles with their spirit percolating in the personal, familial, professional and social life of each one of us," he said.The RSS chief said the term Hindutva has been "distorted" by appending a ritualistic connotation to it. The Sangh does not use it to refer to this misconception."To us, it is the word expressing our identity along with the continuity of its spirituality based traditions and its entire wealth of value system in the land of Bharat," Bhagwat said."Therefore, the Sangh believes it is the word applicable to all 1.3 billion people who call themselves the sons and daughters of Bharatvarsh, whose everyday life is striving towards an alignment with its moral and ethical code and who are proud of the heritage of their ancestors who successfully traversed the same spiritual landscape since time immemorial," Bhagwat said.He said being oblivious to the true meaning of this term weakens the thread that integrates us with this country and society."It is for this reason that this term is the first target of castigation by those who instigate inter-group conflicts, who are bent on splitting our country and society," he said.By presenting as separate our diversities which are traditionally accepted, respected and are a part of the larger scope of Hindu philosophy, in reality, they try to convert them into a source of alienation or separatism, Bhagwat said."Hindu is not the name of some sect or denomination, it is not a provincial conceptualisation, it is neither a single castes lineage nor the privilege of the speakers of a specific language."There may be some who have an objection in accepting this term. We do not object their using other words if the content in their mind is the same," he said.However, in the interest of the country's integrity and security, the Sangh has over the years humbly assimilated the colloquial and global interpretations of the term Hindu, Bhagwat said.He further said being Hindu does not require giving up one's faith, language, land or any other identity marker. It only mandates an abandonment of the quest for supremacy."One has only to be alert and keep away from the selfish and hateful forces who confuse and instigate people by showing them false dreams of supremacy, encourage radicalism and foster separatism," he said.Dwelling on the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, he said India stood strong in the face of adversity and dealt with the calamity effectively."There are some reasons why we escaped corona debilitation that few countries could not. Our governing and administrative agencies promptly sprung up in action.

This is not true. There is no doubt the alliance is anti-BJP, but it is not anti-national. Leaders of the seven-party alliance (CPI is the latest to join) formalised the grouping at a meeting held at PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s residence in Srinagar, where NC president Farooq Abdullah was unanimously elected chairperson of the group and Mehbooba was chosen its vice-chairperson.People’s Conference president Sajjad Lone, who was named PAGD spokesperson, today said the alliance would publish a white paper on the year gone by and make it public in a month’s time.Abdullah, 84, meanwhile clarified that the group was anti-BJP and not anti-national. “I want to tell you that this is false propaganda by the BJP that the People’s Alliance is anti-national. This is not true. There is no doubt the alliance is anti-BJP, but it is not anti-national,” Abdullah said after the meeting that named CPM’s MY Tarigami as convener and Anantnag MP from the NC Hasnain Masoodi as coordinator.On the promise of the white paper, Lone said it would not be rhetorical.“The white paper will not be rhetorical. It will be based on facts and figures to present the reality to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and around the country. An impression is being created as though all the corruption took place in Jammu and Kashmir,” Lone said.Back in New Delhi, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad dismissed the PAGD’s agenda and said there was no way this coalition would get what it wanted.“Article 370 will not be restored. Revoking it was our commitment and people across India have appreciated it,” Prasad said.PAGD chairperson Abdullah, however, accused the BJP-led Centre of destroying the Constitution of India.“They have attempted to divide the nation, break its federal structure and we saw that on August 5, 2019. They are trying to divide us in the name of religion. Their attempt will not succeed. Ours is not a religious battle, it is a fight for our identity and it is for this goal alone that we are together,” Abdullah said.The PAGD now has seven parties instead of six it had when it first met. The new entrant is CPI and the old ones are the NC, PDP, People’s Conference, Awami National Conference, CPM and JK People’s Movement.JK Congress chief Ghulam Mir has skipped both the formal meetings of the PAGD called in Srinagar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farooq-elected-gupkar-alliance-chairman-mehbooba-his-deputy-160826

Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh dubbed their remarks as “political puffery” with no substance or basis to support the criticism. He said contrary to what these leaders were claiming, there was no comparison between the Hoshiarpur and Hathras cases. He pointed out in the latter instance, the UP Government and the police not only failed to initiate stern action, but also seemingly tried to cover up the matter. This, he said, was in sharp contrast to the “prompt action” taken by the Punjab Police, which immediately arrested the accused and were preparing to file the challan within a week. A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire at a village in Hoshiarpur on Wednesday.Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Ministerwhy are Gandhis mum?Rahul and Priyanka have not said a word on the Hoshiarpur incident. Does this kind of selective outrage suit their party?“Had the BJP government in UP responded as effectively and speedily as we did in Punjab, neither the Congress and the Gandhis, nor scores of NGOs and human rights activists would have been forced to take to streets to fight for the victim,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-selective-outrage-asks-bjp-capt-trashes-charge-as-baseless-160786

He said this in an indirect reference to the ongoing standoff between India and China in Ladakh.US watching LAC: White HouseThe US is closely monitoring the border row between India and China and does not want the situation to escalate, a senior Trump administration official has said.Addressing the paramilitary force’s personnel on the occasion of its 59th raising day here, the Minister said, “I am happy to inform that the ITBP has been given the approval by the Ministry of Home Affairs to establish 47 border posts, besides acquiring special clothing and equipment for high-altitude locations. The work is on to prepare priority border roads for the force.”G Kishan Reddy, MOS (Home)Reddy’s Dig at chinaArmies of some nations thought they were the most powerful... ITBP has broken the myth in past few months. Reddy said while India believed in the philosophy of ‘vasudhaiva kutumbakam’ (world is one family), its culture taught it to worship both ‘shastra and astra’ (sacred scriptures and weapons) at the same time. “This has taught us that the enemy can raise its head anytime, anywhere and we should be fully prepared to face any possibility. The ITBP is an important pillar of that preparedness of the country,” Reddy noted.“The armies of some countries had a myth that they were among the powerful armies of the world, but during the developments in the past few months, the ITBP has broken that myth,” the Minister said, adding that the country and its citizens were proud of the force’s valour and dedication. The ITBP is the designated force to guard the 3,488-km-long Sino-India LAC that runs from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-lac-tension-nod-for-47-itbp-border-outposts-160769

Funding for the project has been received from the World Bank.Sedimentation is the process where loose soil, silt, rock and debris flow in with the water that enters reservoirs and deposit on the bed. The level of sedimentation depends upon the terrain, geology and environmental conditions of the area through which the feeding rivers and tributaries flow. Sedimentation, according to sources, is unavoidable and over a period of time, reduces the storage capacity of the reservoirs. This has detrimental effects on the dam’s intended benefits such are provision of water for drinking and irrigation, flood control and power generation.Large-scale deforestation, unscientific agricultural practices, industrial processes and anthropogenic activities in the catchment areas tend to increase in silt load in rivers and aggravates sedimentation of reservoirs.Citing the example of the Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej in Himachal, an official said over the past about 50 years, the designed capacity of the dam’s reservoir may have reduced by almost 25 per cent due to deposit of silt.Sources said the surveys would be carried out through integrated hydrographic and integrated bathymetric systems that include employment of drones and use of artificial intelligence.What is sedimentation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cwc-to-study-sediment-deposition-in-reservoirs-160705

It also said the AQI is predicted to continue to remain in the “very poor” category, but without further deterioration. “Slow improvement in the current condition is expected by October 26, leading to a middle range of very poor,” it said.SAFAR synergised stubble fire counts stood at 1,292 on Friday and its share in Delhi’s pollution was nine per cent. “The boundary layer wind direction is westerly and wind speed is low. Hence, pollutant transport towards the Delhi region will remain low. The SAFAR model estimate of stubble burning share in PM 2.5 is 9 per cent for today,” it said.The Delhi Government has kick-started its “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” anti-pollution campaign for which it has deployed 2,500 environment marshals at 100 traffic signals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-quality-remains-very-poor-delhi-gasping-160707

The scheme was announced on directions of the Supreme Court, which posted the matter for hearing on November 2. A letter containing the operational guidelines was sent to all banks and NBFCs on Friday.Loan categories...Credit card duesThe government has taken the stand that this is an ex gratia gesture due to the unprecedented and extreme situation.As per the scheme, the borrower’s accounts should not be in the non-performing asset (NPA) category as on February 29. Housing, education, auto, MSME and consumer durable loans and credit card dues are covered.For accounts that were closed between March 1 and August 31, interest would be credited from March 1, 2020, till the date of closure of the account.The government said the rate of interest would be as specified in the loan agreement.

In Uttar Pradesh, the police was not even ready to file a rape case, while the Punjab Police arrested the accused within 36 hours, registered a rape case after the DGP and the Chief Minister worked tirelessly to this end. The Punjab CM has insisted on exemplary punishment. The Punjab State Women’s Commission and the SC Commission have taken cognizance and asked for a report from the SSP,” Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev today said, explaining why Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders did not feel the need to visit Punjab. She accused ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Harsh Vardhan and Prakash Javadekar of politicising the minor’s death in Hoshiarpur with Bihar elections in mind and said, “Stop politicising rape.” Among other reasons Dev cited for why “people felt it was necessary to stand by the family members of the Hathras rape victim, which may not be necessary in Punjab, is that the UP Government left the Hathras victim for over 10 days in a hospital and 11 days without a forensic report which is a must in 24 hours”. Third reason, she said why people may not be going to Punjab, but went to UP was that the Hathras administration geared up to threaten the victim’s family, whereas in Punjab “Chief of the state women’s commission has already met the family”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-politicising-hoshiarpur-rape-case-for-votes-congress-160698
25-10-2020||Aditi Tandon||Remdesivir offers little benefit: WHO||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 24The World Health Organisation has warned drug regulators across the world against ignoring its “robust” evidence on little or no benefit of anti-viral Remdesivir in patients hospitalised with Covid19.The warning came from WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this Thursday granted full approval to Gilead Sciences Inc’s Remdesivir for treating hospitalised Covid patients.The WHO-led largest Solidarity Trials that tested Remdesivir among Covid patients found that the drug neither improved survival nor reduced the duration of stay in the hospital.“We believe our results are very robust. We hope that people who are doing treatment guidelines in other countries as well as regulators across the world will take note of our results in addition to the other evidence... because you need to look at global evidence for a drug before you make decisions,” Swaminathan said.She noted that the FDA appears to have “not considered the WHO solidarity trial results on Remdesivir” before granting its full approval to the drug.The WHO trial, which ran through March 22 to October 4, 2020, and followed 11,266 patients in 405 hospitals across 30 countries in all six WHO regions, found that Remdesivir had “little or no effect on hospitalised Covid19 patients as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay”.It said the study drug did not appreciably reduce initiation of ventilation in those not already ventilated.The FDA, however, while approving anti-viral drug Veklury (Remdesivir) for use in adult and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg, said, “Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care.”Veklury is the first treatment for Covid to receive FDA approval. FDA approvals followed Gilead’s own results of trials on 1062 people that said Remdesivir cut recovery time by five days and reduced risk of death in patients receiving oxygen support.First to get US FDA’s approvalDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for free vaccine throughout country||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remdesivir-offers-little-benefit-who-160699
25-10-2020||Dehradun||Former BJP CM among 5 in race for Uttarakhand Rajya Sabha seat||The Uttarakhand BJP has sent a list of five names to the central leadership to finalise the party’s candidate for the forthcoming election to one Rajya Sabha seat from the state.The list includes the names of former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, BJP’s national office secretary Mahendra Pandey, former MP Balraj Pasi, state BJP vice-president Anil Goyal and senior party leader Naresh Bansal, sources said.The election to the Rajya Sabha seat held by Raj Babbar is scheduled to take place on November 9. Babbar’s term concludes on November 25.Raj Babbar’s termends on Nov 25The last date for filing nominations for the seat is October 27, which means the party may announce its candidate for the seat in a day or two. The victory of the BJP candidate from the seat is a foregone conclusion with the party having 57 out of the Assembly’s 70 seats in its kitty. Bahuguna’s candidature is a strong possibility considering his stature as a former Chief Minister.The desertion by many leaders, including heavyweights like Bahuguna, ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls had harmed the Congress’s prospects. Political observers here feel Bahuguna may be rewarded by the BJP with a nomination to the Upper House. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-bjp-cm-among-5-in-race-for-uttarakhand-rajya-sabha-seat-160700
