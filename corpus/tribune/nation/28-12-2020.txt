The rollout of the vaccine is expected to be a bit slow in the initial phase due to logistics issue and is expected to pick up once things get sorted,” SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told reporters.He noted that the company plans to ramp up the vaccine production to 100 million dosages per month by March next year with the coming up of SII’s third manufacturing facility.Poonawalla said the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could be approved in the UK soon.By next month, the vaccine can also be approved in India, he noted.Poonawalla said India would get the majority of vaccines produced next year with some part of the production also going to other markets as part of COVAX—a global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level.“Some shortage can be expected in the first six months. Things will ease out by August-September as other manufacturers will also start supplies,” he added.He noted that DCGI is examining the vaccine data submitted by various companies in detail and the approvals are expected to come in the next few days.Union Minister Harsh Vardhan, who formally launched the company’s pneumococcal vaccine, said everybody in the country is looking forward to the regulatory approvals for the COVID-19 vaccine in the next few days.“We are all waiting for the approvals to come. We know that SII has developed capacities which can cater to India as well as many other countries through various global associations,” Vardhan said.On the new strain of coronavirus, the minister said the government laboratories had already initiated the genome sequencing work few months ago.“We asked the laboratories what new is coming out in the tests...the country has the capability to fight any virus or disease,” he noted.Besides SII, Bharat Biotech and Pfizer have also applied to DCGI seeking emergency use authorisation for their COVID-19 vaccines early this month.When asked about SII’s progress on its own COVID-19 vaccine, Poonawalla said: “We expect it to launch in January 2022. We have already initiated Phase 1 clinical trials in the UK.” Commenting on the PNEUMOSIL launch, Poonawalla said the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been developed through a collaboration spanning over a decade between SII, PATH and Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.The vaccine will provide effective and long-lasting protection for children against pneumococcal disease.Launching the vaccine, Vardhan said: “It is a significant milestone for the country’s public healthcare which will ensure that children are protected better against pneumococcal disease with an affordable and high-quality vaccine.”He said the vaccine would not only help save lives of children in India but in other countries as well.Poonawalla said around 68,000 children die annually due to the pneumococcal disease in the country and the vaccine would now help in saving the precious lives.“With the best PCV, we hope to bring down the mortality rate significantly while also making our country self-sufficient with a robust public healthcare system,” he noted.SII would supply the vaccine to both the government and the private sector players with different costing structures.Pneumococcal disease is a significant contributor to the under-five mortality rate worldwide. In 2018, WHO recommended the inclusion of PCV in routine childhood immunisation programmes in all countries.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Expert panel recommends granting environment clearance to Central Vista redevelopment project||The environment ministry's expert appraisal committee has recommended granting environment clearance to the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, but directed that its developer should ensure no air pollution is caused during the demolition of existing structures.With the expert panel's recommendations, the project comes a step closer to getting the environment clearance (EC), to be given by the Union Environment Minister.The expert appraisal committee (EAC) took the decision in a meeting held on December 17, the minutes of which were uploaded on the ministry's website on Monday.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is executing the project which includes development/redevelopment of Common Central Secretariat Buildings and Central Conference Centre, along with Prime Minister's Residence, SPG Building and Vice President's Enclave. It has revised the estimated project cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.According to the minutes of the EAC meeting, the CPWD said that it will cover the impact of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report for holistic coverage of overall impacts, which means a new PMO will also come up under the Central Vista redevelopment project.In its earlier proposal, the CPWD had not mentioned the construction of a new PMO. It had written a letter to the expert panel recently, saying that the impact of the proposed PMO will be included in the EIA report.The expert panel said that it has deliberated upon the information provided by the CPWD and found that "the project is now integrated in nature. After detailed deliberation, EAC recommended granting Terms of Reference." While granting Terms of Reference (ToR), the panel asked the developer to provide “detailed demolition plan along with mitigative measures, include details of proposed strategy for management of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and efforts must be made for instant demolition of latest technique in place of extended demolition to avoid air pollution during demolition process.” With the ToR having been granted, the CPWD now has the go-ahead to draw up the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environment Management Plan (EMP) reports and submit it to the environment ministry for final approval.The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.The proposed development/redevelopment is coming up over a total plot area measuring 5,48,776 square metre, the expert panel was told.There will be a total built-up area of 17,21,500 square metre and the area to be demolished is 4,58,820 square metre, the panel noted.Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Vigyan Bhavan, VP Residency, National Museum, Jawahar Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan, Udyog Bhavan, Raksha Bhavan, and INS Hutments are likely to be razed for the new project.While granting the ToR, the expert panel asked CPWD to also carry out, in its EIA report, the assessment of traffic densities and parking capabilities within five km radius from the site."A detailed traffic management and a traffic decongestion plan drawn up through an organization of repute and specializing in Transport Planning shall be submitted with the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). The Plan shall also include the consent of all the concerned implementing agencies,” the committee said.During the meeting, the project developer told the expert panel that as the buildings are situated in a very sensitive area, adequate care and precaution will be taken to reduce noise and dust while ensuring appropriate safety."Buildings will be fully covered from all sides with appropriate staging/barricading and covering using appropriate green cloth or sheets for full building height so as to control and contain the dust/debris within the building premises,” the panel was told.The panel accepted the submission of the developer that the project does not involve diversion of forest land which is why forest clearance was not required.It also noted that the project site is not located within the eco-sensitive zone, hence wildlife clearance is also not required.The proposed comprehensive refurbishment and augmentation of Central Vista will create new facilities for governance and public administration, render the public spaces easier to use and maintain, and will reduce disruptions caused to city traffic, the developer told the panel."The Central Conference Centre will cater to their conferencing needs. These will also be connected by a people mover to the Delhi Metro. Modern and secure residential facilities for the Vice President and the Prime Minister will be equipped with all necessary spaces and infrastructure, including the special protection group. “The plan for comprehensively improving and augmenting Central Vista will strengthen governance infrastructure by building an efficient and sustainable Central Secretariat to house all the Ministries of the Government of India, a Central Conference Centre to cater to all conferencing needs across Ministries, well-equipped and adequate residences for the Vice President and the Prime Minister,” the developer told the panel.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Rahul not on holiday, has gone to meet sick relative: Congress||After the BJP criticised Rahul Gandhi for his visit abroad, the Congress on Monday said he has gone to meet an ailing relative and his grandmother and is not on a holiday.Asked about Rahul Gandhi’s absence from the party’s foundation day function at the AICC headquarters, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala came out in defence of Gandhi, saying he is currently not the party chief and has performed all the duties entrusted to him by the organisation.The former party chief left for Italy on Sunday afternoon, a day ahead of the party’s 136th foundation day, prompting many BJP leaders to take a swipe at him and the Congress.“Rahul Gandhi’s holiday in India has ended and he has gone back to Italy,” Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh had tweeted.Surjewala said the BJP should not have any objection to Gandhi visiting an ailing relative.“Rahul Gandhi has gone out on a short personal visit to meet up with an ailing relative, who is seriously sick. He has not gone out on a holiday. He also meets up with his maternal grandmother this time of the year, every year. I don’t think the BJP should have objections to him visiting an ailing relative,” he told reporters.He said today the issue is not about Rahul Gandhi but of farmers protesting in the cold, and alleged that the prime minister or his ministers do not have time to meet them.“Why don’t the ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the prime minister of the country take care of the farmers? Instead of abusing the opposition, why don’t they pay attention to running the country?“Why doesn’t the prime minister and minister go 20 kilometres and talk to the farmers? Why is the prime minister so arrogant that he is not ready to talk to farmers,” he asked. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-not-on-holiday-has-gone-to-meet-sick-relative-congress-190642

28-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress leader slams Sena over comments on UPA, BMC polls||Senior Maharashtra Congress leader Naseem Khan said on Monday the onus of survival of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government does not lie with his party alone and hit out at ally Shiv Sena over its comments on the UPA leadership and the 2022 BMC polls.He said the Congress will contest all the 227 seats in elections for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), now controlled by the Shiv Sena.AICC in-charge of Maharashtra HK Patil also hit out at the Shiv Sena, saying since it was not part of the UPA, it should not speak about changing the leadership of the coalition.Patil said the Congress central leadership will take the state unit into confidence while deciding whether the party should contest the Mumbai civic polls alone or under the banner of the MVA.“The Shiv Sena cannot decide how the Congress should fight the upcoming local bodies polls,” Khan said.He was referring to chief minister Uddhav Thackerays statement that MVA allies ---the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP---will contest all future polls together. Thackeray is also the Sena president.“The Congress will fight the Mumbai civic elections (alone) and work to get its mayor elected,” the former state minister said.Speaking at a Congress foundation day function, Khan said the Shiv Sena-led coalition government in Maharashtra will last only if the common minimum programme (CMP) chalked by the three parties is adhered to.“One of the points in the CMP is that all the three parties will work to strengthen themselves organisationally and not weaken each other,” Khan said, referring to 18 Congress corporators in Bhiwandi town in Thane district joining the NCP recently.“NCP leaders should have contacted our state leadership before inducting them into the NCP fold. But this did not happen.“The NCP and the Shiv Sena should not induct our people into their fold. If such things happen, the onus of survival of this government is not on the Congress alone.“The Shiv Sena leadership is also equally responsible to ensure that all coalition partners are taken along,” he said.Khan said the Shiv Sena was not a member of the UPA and had no right to speak on how the Congress-led national opposition alliance should function.“What is the locus standi of ‘Saamana’ (Shiv Sena mouthpiece) to comment on the UPA leadership. Sonia Gandhi (Congress president) is and will always remain the UPA chairperson,” he said.“Who has given the right to ‘Saamana’ to speak on change of leadership in the UPA?” the Congress leader asked.He demanded that the state Congress leadership take up theissue with the Shiv Sena and the NCP in the coordination committee of the MVA.Khan said Congress MLAs were not getting funds for development of their constituencies.Patil, speaking at the same function, said “We have given support to the Shiv Sena to form government in the state to keep the BJP away.”“We need to strengthen the party and form a Congress- led government in the state again,” he said.“The party (Shiv Sena), which is not even an ally of the UPA, shouldn’t comment on its leadership. It shouldn’t create confusion.“Sonia Gandhi will remain the UPA chairperson. We will not tolerate any criticism of our leaders,” Patil said, hitting out at the Shiv Sena.Revenue minister and state Congress president Balasaheb Thoratsaid the next mayor of Mumbai will be from the Congress.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||On foundation day of Congress, Sonia urges partymen to unite in fighting dictatorship||On the foundation day of the Congress on Monday, its chief Sonia Gandhi urged the party leaders and workers to unite in fighting dictatorship and protecting the country’s democracy, Constitution and the countrymen.Addressing party workers in a video message on the 136th foundation day of the party, Gandhi said the country is going through difficult times as prevailing before independence.Congratulating the Congress leaders and workers on the completion of 135 years of the party’s formation, she said it has traversed the path from the freedom struggle till now for achieving the values of patriotism, fearlessness, selflessness, selfless service towards humanity, brotherhood and the country’s unity and integrity.Gandhi said the party was launched as part of a “jan andolan” (people’s movement) during the freedom struggle and has seen times when atrocities were committed on its leaders and workers.“But Congressmen have not fallen behind in achieving their goals of getting India’s freedom and in the service of the country, despite taking lathis, going to jail and giving their supreme sacrifices,” she said, adding that the grand old party has helped lay the country’s strong foundations.“Today, once again the circumstances are similar to those existing before independence. The rights of people are being crushed, there is dictatorship everywhere, democratic and constitutional institutions are being finished.“Unemployment is at its peak, farms and fields are being attacked and black laws are being imposed on the country’s ‘annadata’ (food provider). In such circumstances, it is our responsibility to save the country from such dictatorship and fight it. This is true patriotism,” Gandhi said in her video message.Urging the Congressmen to strengthen the party at every level, she said it is the hope of the people of the country.“We will have to unite to save the pride and honour of the tricolour, under which we achieved our nation’s freedom.“We have to win over the hearts of people. We should take a pledge on the Congress’s foundation day to fight to protect the country’s democracy, Constitution and the countrymen for whom we will fight till our last breath,” she said.Gandhi skipped the party’s foundation day function at the AICC headquarters here. Former party chief Rahul Gandhi also skipped the event as he is abroad. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and a number of Congress leaders attended the function. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-foundation-day-of-congress-sonia-urges-partymen-to-unite-in-fighting-dictatorship-190627

Countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Malaysia and Sri Lanka rely on Indian shipments.Wholesale prices of onions have more than halved in the last four weeks, according to data compiled by the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation, a government agency.--- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-lifts-ban-on-onion-exports-as-prices-plunge-190626

He has already travelled to the UAE and Bahrain.This was Jaishankar’s first visit to Qatar after taking over as External Affairs Minister. Hosting over seven lakh Indians, New Delhi had tried to maintain frequent contacts with Qatar.PM Narendra Modi thrice spoke to the Amir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani over telephone in the past few months while Jaishankar and his Cabinet colleagues have been in touch with their Qatari counterparts.Significantly, Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane has just returned from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain – host nearly 90 lakh Indians. South Bock, concerned about their wellbeing during the pandemic, has maintained frequent high level contacts with the leadership.This has not only ensured that the GCC countries pay special attention to Indian expatriates but brought in investment from their deep-pocketed sovereign funds. As a result, Kuwait and UAE did not immediately send back Indians after the Covid struck early this year. The breathing space allowed state governments to arrange for the infrastructure to deal with returning Indians.Jaishankar had last month addressed GCC leaders at their annual political dialogue last month during which he had urged them to allow the return of Indian workers and professionals through travel bubble arrangements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-maintains-hectic-west-asian-diplomacy-190622
28-12-2020||New Delhi||India’s first driverless train evokes pride, excitement among passengers young and old||From pride and excitement to surprise and a little bit of apprehension, several young and old passengers went through a gamut of emotions as they rode the country’s first driverless train on a Delhi Metro corridor on Monday.The first train of this service driven by next-generation technology ran from Janakpuri West station to Botanical Garden station of the 37-km Magenta Line as the DMRC leaped into an elite club of metro networks globally.Inaugurating India’s first-ever driverless train operations on the Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line on Monday morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government unlike its predecessors has taken growing urbanisation as an opportunity and asserted that metro train services will be extended to 25 cities by 2025 from the current 18.Among the first riders was infant Aarav (3) who sounded very excited, as his father told him that “no driver was piloting the train”.“It is being driven by a remote control,” the little boy said, much to his family members and co-passengers delight.And indeed the train is controlled centrally from the Operations Control Centre (OCC). However, a roaming attendant will be present initially but would be gradually withdrawn to move to Unattended Train Operation (UTO) mode.While most of the passengers knew about this new train, many commuters who took the train from various stations on the Magenta Line were actually oblivious to the fact that the train was driverless.Riya Sharma (18) and Gurpreet Kaur (17), Delhi University students and friends who live in Palam area, were excited about their ride.“Yes, we know about this new, driverless train and the PM had flagged it off in the morning. We are feeling very proud as it is not just Delhi Metro’s but India’s first driverless train. Also, I did not feel much of a difference, from a regular metro train,” said Kaur, who is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in commerce.She said the day news came out about it, the driverless train had become a topic of dinner table talk in her family.Sharma, pursuing bachelor’s in English literature, said, “It is my first metro journey since the services were shut due to COVID-19-induced lockdown”.“And I never thought, I will step right into a driverless train. Only after boarding it and seeing the decoration and mediapersons inside did we realise that we had entered a driverless train. Quite exciting. I was afraid a bit, but felt ok, after entering it,” she said.But, it wasn’t just kids and youth who took the first driverless train on a landmark day for Delhi Metro and the country, marking a major technological feat for the country.With the commencement of these new-generation trains, the DMRC entered the select league of “7 per cent of world’s Metro networks” which can operate services without drivers, officials said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday tweeted in Hindi to congratulate people of Delhi.“From today, the first automated driverless train service of Delhi Metro has become operationalized. Today, your ‘Delhi Metro’ has joined a league of select cities in the world. Our Delhi is developing fast,” he tweeted.Shaheen Bagh resident S Z Naiyer, 60, boarded the train from Dashratjpuri station, along with his wife Taiyeba Naiyer.“I am feeling very proud and it’s a great achievement for our country and Delhi Metro. We had taken the metro on Magenta Line from Shaheen Bagh metro station to Dashrathpuri station on December 26 and returning today on the same route in a driverless train. So, it’s like a new era we have entered into, from where we were two days ago,” he told PTI.His wife said she was not feeling afraid but just worried what will happen in case of a medical or other emergency.But not everyone who travelled in the driverless train knew they were part of history in the making.Vinay Rawat, 30, entered the train at Hauz Khas interchange station on way to Botanical Garden station. He sat with a ukelele in his hand and absorbed in his world, listening to music through earphones.When asked if he was aware that this was a driverless train, he exclaimed, “Is it, I had no idea”.“I saw the floral decoration on the coach while boarding, but then I thought, it was for New Year season,” he said.Rawat, a resident of Greater Noida, and an amateur musician, said he is currently looking for a job and travels every weekend to his friend’s place in Saket in south Delhi.“After learning that it is driverless, I am feeling a bit apprehensive, but, I have full confidence in Delhi Metro and they must have taken all the measures needed,” he said.Vipin Kumar, 22, who works for a private bank boarded the first driverless train from Munirka, and said, “It feels like a regular metro ride, but it is exciting to be part of this journey”.Sisters Ayesha Pangali and Ritika Sapkota also boarded the metro for the first time after the lockdown.“We did not know it was a driverless train, we just thought it was a regular one, but after boarding it, we saw the digital display and fellow passengers also told us about it,” Ayesha said.In his address via video-conferencing in the morning, the prime minister said the launch of the driverless train and start of the National Common Mobility Card, also inauguarated by him on Monday, at the Airport Express Line of the Delhi Metro are an attempt to make urban development future ready. This new driverless train becoming a reality is also evidence of new aspirations of the people of India, he said.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Online exam from next year for select govt recruitment: Jitendra Singh||A Common Eligibility Test (CET) will be conducted online across the country from next year to screen and shortlist candidates for recruitment to select central government jobs, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Monday.He said the test will be a major boon for youths seeking government employment.“The National Recruitment Agency (NRA) for conducting Common Eligibility Test has been constituted with the approval of the Union Cabinet,” said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel.The NRA will be a multi-agency body which will conduct the common test to screen and shortlist candidates for Group-B and C (non-technical) posts, he said.“The most significant feature of this reform is that every district in the country will have at least one examination centre which would greatly enhance access to the candidates living in far-flung areas,” Singh told PTI.One of the important objectives of this historic reform is to provide a level-playing field to every candidate so that none of the job aspirants is at disadvantage and has an equal opportunity regardless of his or her background or socio-economic status, he said.“This will also be a huge benefit to women and divyang candidates as well as those who find it financially unaffordable to appear for multiple tests by travelling to multiple centres,” the minister said.Singh said the first Common Eligibility Test to be conducted by the NRA is likely to be scheduled around the second half of 2021.He also pointed out that NRA will be an independent autonomous organisation responsible for shortlisting candidates for certain categories the recruitment for which is carried through Staff Selection Commission (SSC), State Selection Boards (RRBs) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).“However, the existing central recruiting agencies like SSC, RRBs and IBPS would continue to conduct specific recruitments as per their requirements and the Common Eligibility Test will only be the test for preliminary screening of candidates for the jobs,” he added.

28-12-2020||---||New US Act message of hope: Exiled Tibetans||New Delhi, December 28Tibetans in exile have welcomed the US President Donald Trump signing the Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA) into law.“This legislation sends a powerful message of hope and justice to the Tibetans inside Tibet and bolsters US support for the protection of Tibetan people’s religious freedom, human rights, environmental rights and exile Tibetan democracy like never before,” said the ‘Central Tibetan Authority President’ Lobsang Sangay.The move strengthens US policy on Tibet and reaffirms its government’s steadfast support for the Dalai Lama and the CTA, he added.Interestingly, the Bill called upon the US Secretary of State not to authorise any new Chinese consulate till a US Consulate is established in Lhasa. The signing came after days of delay though the US Congress had approved the omnibus spending bill, which had the TPSA attached on December 22.Built on the Tibet Policy Act signed by George Bush, the TPSA makes it official US policy that decisions regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama are exclusively within the authority of the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders and the Tibetan people. “Any interference by Chinese government officials will be met with serious sanctions and be deemed inadmissible into the United States,” said a CTA statement.The bill acknowledges the CTA as the legitimate institution and Sikyong as the President of the CTA. It also strengthened funding for Tibetans inside and outside Tibet, estimated at about $ 25 million including $ 6 million (about Rs. 50 crore) for Tibetan communities in India and Nepal, $ 3 million (about Rs 25 crore) for bodies like CTA, $ 8 million (about Rs 60 crore) for Tibetan communities in China, $ 7.4 million (Rs 50 crore) for reporting on Tibet and Tibetans and $ 1 million (Rs 7.5 crore) for the Office of the US’ Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues.The Tibetans-in-exile have especially appreciated the role played by the Bill’s sponsors—Senators Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin; and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith—for introducing it in the Senate and House, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-us-act-message-of-hope-exiled-tibetans-190604
28-12-2020||Mumbai||When the silver screen went dark: Bollywood counts its losses in year of pandemic||As productions halted, theatres shut their doors and audiences settled down in front of their screens, the Hindi film industry hit pause button in the year that was – resulting in revenue losses of maybe thousands of crores and many thousands of workers forced into unemployment.The coronavirus pandemic scripted a tale of unprecedented challenges for the flourishing industry that came to a screeching halt in 2020. While there are no exact figures, some insiders estimated the losses could be upwards of Rs 1,500 crore to “thousands of crores” and said single screen theatres would have lost anything between Rs 25 to Rs 75 lakh a month.According to trade analyst Amul Mohan, for instance, about 200 Hindi films are made in a year and Bollywood’s yearly box office earnings stand at a little over Rs 3,000 crore.“It has been a different and difficult year. Things have not gone as per plan,” Mohan told PTI.It is a dual edged crisis, of creating content and also exhibiting it with many producers either postponing or moving to OTT platforms. Though theatres in several parts of the country have opened after nine months – they closed in March when India went into lockdown to ward off COVID-19 — people are still fearful of watching a movie in an enclosed space. To compound the problem, there are no new films to lure them in.It spells catastrophe for an industry that supports lakhs of people. About five lakh people, including actors, directors and producers, are registered with the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE). Of these, 2.5 lakh are ‘workers’, including junior artistes, makeup, set designers, carpenters and background dancers, said FWICE president B N Tiwari.According to trade observer Himesh Mankad, the losses could carry over next year.“On a yearly basis, total Hindi films earnings would have been about Rs 3,000 crore but they stand at Rs 500-600 crore only. So we have lost out on making at least Rs 1,700-2,000 crore. It is a notional loss since 2020 films will release in 2021.“(But) there will be interest costs, overhead costs, because of which each film’s budget could go up by Rs 5 crore-15 crore. This can be called added expenditure,” Mankad told PTI.The ripple effect will be felt for a while, he said.“Films will face competition week-by-week and their run will be cut short. Besides, the pandemic is still here so occupancy won’t reach 100 per cent in cinema halls. The fear psychosis will persist till we get a vaccine,” Mankad said.Raj Bansal, senior distributor and exhibitor, echoed his pessimism.The year 2020 was the worst ever, said Bansal, who has been in the distribution business for almost six decades and is director of Entertainment Paradise, a three-screen multiplex in Jaipur.“In Rajasthan, theatres are still closed. They may reopen in January. The situation is likely to improve only when big films are released in theatres as they can bring the audiences in. It’s difficult to put a number to the losses that we have faced. The losses are in huge numbers,” Bansal told PTI.Akshay Rathi, who has cinema houses in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, said 2020 has tested all the players in the entertainment industry.Both Rathi and Bansal said it is the first time in the history of cinema that theatres remained shut for so many months.“Losses go into thousands of crores as there have been overheads on cinemas, cost of interest on films, holding costs, and other things. Each single screen theatre would have lost anything between Rs 25-75 lakh per month because they have electricity and maintenance bills, salaries to pay and a lot of things to look after with no income,” Rathi told PTI.Though theatres have reopened in most places, it is a slow walk to normalcy given the restrictions and lack of film releases.“Things are looking better, vaccines have started in many parts of the world, the fear psychosis has reduced. We all need to ensure that we put mid-sized compelling movies for people to come to theatres. This will lay the ground for big films like ‘Radhe’, ‘Sooryavanshi’, ‘83’ and ‘Jayeshbhai Jordar’,” Rathi said.Producer Bhushan Kumar of T-Series said they began the year on a good note with “Tanhaji” but the pandemic was a big blow.“It resulted in pushing the release of the films for the foreseeable future and halting the shoots of several ongoing projects,” Kumar told PTI.T-Series, he added, had 12 to 15 films slated for release in 2020 but most of them will now arrive at a later date.With theatres closed, the company released some of its films, including Anurag Basu-directed black-comedy “Ludo” and the Bhumi Pednekar starrer “Durgamati”, on OTT platforms.OTT platforms, viewed on TV screens, computers and mobiles, have come as a godsend for filmmakers who were ready with their films but had nowhere to show them.Shoojit Sircar, who was among the first to release his film “Gulabo Sitabo” on a streaming platform, said he is working on his next theatrical release “Sardar Udham Singh”.“But as we all know everything moved on, everything got delayed. We are in the post production stage and I am sure next year we will be able to present the film. We haven’t yet decided about the release (date) yet,” he said.There were also those biggies who held out, waiting for things to improve.Describing 2020 as an extremely challenging year, Reliance Entertainment group CEP Shibasish Sarkar said Akshay Kumar starrer “Sooryavanshi” was supposed to have been released in March and “83”, with Ranveer Singh playing cricketer Kapil Dev, in April. The films were held back but could be released in March or April 2021.“There was no business, theatres were closed in the entire lockdown period...Now 2021 is poised for multiple productions and releases for films, web shows, TV shows and animation,” he added.Things have started looking up with the opening of theatres but Sarkar said he is waiting for the overseas markets to get better.“The entire US and Europe is in shut down mode. So we are waiting for the overseas market to return to normalcy,” he said.In the absence of major new content, cinemas have opened in different parts of the country with distributors offering a mix of old classics and new local releases to bring the audiences back to theatres while adhering to safety protocols.A glimmer at the end of the tunnel is now visible.Film productions halted have resumed with producers adhering to the strict safety guidelines to ensure the safety of the cast and crew. The guidelines include social distancing, masks, PPE kits, face shields and regular temperature checks.T-Series’ Kumar hopes 2021 will be a better year and director Sircar is hopeful that people will get the confidence to return to theatres once there is a vaccine.“Also, we are waiting for that one film that will change the course,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-the-silver-screen-went-dark-bollywood-counts-its-losses-in-year-of-pandemic-190603
28-12-2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka cabinet okays anti-cow slaughter ordinance||The Karnataka cabinet on Monday decided to promulgate an ordinance to give effect to the contentious anti-cow slaughter bill that is yet to be approved by the Legislative Council.Once it comes into effect, there will be a blanket prohibition on slaughter of cows in the state.However, slaughter houses will continue to function and beef consumption will not be prohibited with respect to buffalo meat."The anti-cow slaughter law is not new. We have had it for decades,” said Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister JC Madhuswamy.“Previously, there was a ban on slaughter of cows until the age of 13. We have extended it with an intention that older cows should not be left out.“Since the prohibition does not extend to buffaloes, there is no ban on beef consumption," said Madhuswamy.Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting here, he said the ordinance was likely to be sent to the Governor within a day for his assent.The government is also considering building 'gaushalas' (cow shelters) to ensure that aged cows that are not used for milching do not become a burden on the farmer, he said.The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill - 2020 proposes a maximum of seven years' imprisonment and fine of Rs 5 lakh for the offenders.It seeks a total ban on slaughter of cows in the state and provides for stringent punishment to those who indulge in smuggling, illegal transportation and atrocities on cows.The government had to opt for the ordinance route as the Bill passed by the Legislative Assembly earlier this month in the winter session amid din and stiff opposition from the Congress has not yet been approved by the Legislative Council.The council was adjourned sine die even before the Bill was tabled there for passage.For a Bill to become law, its passage in the Legislative Council, followed by assent by the Governor, is necessary.Noting that objections the Centre had on the then BJP government's anti-cow slaughter Bill of 2010 has been addressed, Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chauhan said the earlier one also prohibited slaughtering of buffaloes.In the present Bill, the prohibition is for slaughtering of buffaloes until the age of 13, he said.In a statement released by his office, he said cow was the root of India’s culture, faith and farmers livelihood.Expressing concern over the decline in the number of cows year after year, he called on everyone to rise above politics to work towards the growth of the state’s cattle assets."Opposing the Bill just for the sake of politics and misleading the public is intolerable," he said.Citing the 2019 cattle census, Chauhan said 2.38 lakh cows were slaughtered every year.Even a day's delay would lead to slaughter of 662 cows, he said."If it continues at this pace, we aren’t far away from a time when cows will only be read about in books.“Stopping illegal transportation and slaughtering is our priority," he said.Despite resistance from the opposition, the then BJP government led by BS Yediyurappa in 2010 had got the controversial Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill passed, that proposed to replace the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964.The Bill had widened the definition of 'cattle' and imposed a blanket ban on cattle slaughter, coupled with stringent penalty clauses for violation.However, the Siddaramaiah headed Congress government that came to power in 2013 withdrew the Bill that was before the President for his assent.After BJP came back to power in the state, several party leaders have been making a pitch to re-enact the anti-cow slaughter law.Chauhan, along with officials, had even travelled to Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to study and gather information on implementation of the laws there, before bringing the 2020 Bill to Assembly earlier this  month.According to sources, BJP, that hurriedly tabled the Bill and ensured its passage in the Assembly in the winter session, did not do so in the council, sensing that the numbers were not in its favour with opposition Congress and JD(S) against it, and may refer it to the joint select committee.

The bench said she is free to do so.The judgment was delivered on December 18 on a habeas corpus petition.The Kotwali Dehat police in Etah district had registered a case in September against the man, Salman alias Karan, under section 366 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with “inducing” or abducting a woman to compel her into marriage.On December 7, Etah’s Chief Judicial Magistrate ordered that Shikha should be handed over to the child welfare committee. The committee then sent her to her parents the next day against her wishes.The high court said the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s order and action of the child welfare committee did not follow legal provisions.Shikha was produced before the high court on its directions.The court said that according to the high school certificate, her date of birth is October 4, 1999 and she is an adult.The matter came up before the high court against the backdrop of a flurry of cases registered by the UP Police under the state’s new ordinance which punishes “forcible” or “fraudulent” religious conversions, including those involving marriages.The Etah case, however, was registered before the new law came into being.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Modi flags off 100th ‘Kisan Rail’, says govt will continue to work to strengthen farmers||Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Monday that his government has undertaken historic reforms in the farm sector to boost agriculture and strengthen farmers.Flagging off the 100th “Kisan Rail” from Sangola in Maharashtra to Shalimar in West Bengal via video-conferencing, Modi said his government’s policies are clear and intentions transparent in reforming the agriculture sector.It will continue to work to strengthen farmers and agri sector with full force and dedication, he said.His remarks came amid continuing protests by a section of farmers against the Centre’s three farm reform laws. Modi did not directly refer to these laws on Monday, but he has often asserted that they are in the interests of farmers and accused opposition parties of misleading them.The ‘Kisan Rail’, a service started by his government, will help small and marginal farmers, who are over 80 per cent of the peasantry, in supplying their produce to far-off markets, the prime minister said, adding that a big demand for its services led to a rise in its frequency.This will also help boost the income of farmers, he added.This is also a testimony to the fact that how keen the farmers are for new possibilities, he said.The government has been working to boost supply chain, cold storage facilities and bringing about value addition to farmers’ produce to help them, he said.The multi-commodity train service will carry vegetables such as cauliflower, capsicum, cabbage, drumstick, chilli and onion as well as fruits like grape, orange, pomegranate, banana and custard apple, according to an official statement.Loading and unloading of perishable commodities will be permitted at all stoppages en route with no bar on the size of consignment, it said, adding that the Centre has extended a 50-per cent subsidy on the transportation of fruits and vegetables.It may be noted that the first Kisan Rail was introduced from Devlali in Maharashtra to Danapur in Bihar on August 7, which was further extended up to Muzaffarpur.Following good response from farmers, its frequency was increased from a weekly service to three days in a week, it said.“Kisan Rail has been a game changer in ensuring fast transportation of agriculture produce across the nation. It provides a seamless supply chain of perishable produce,” it said.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Decided to reduce COVID ICU beds quota in 33 pvt hospitals to 60 pc: AAP govt to HC||The AAP government on Monday told the Delhi High Court that it has decided to reduce to 60 per cent the number of ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals in the national capital as was recommended by a De-escalation Committee.The Delhi government told Justice Subramonium Prasad that the decision was taken on December 27 after a two-member panel, comprising the Director of AIIMS and a Niti Aayog member, endorsed the recommendations of the De-escalation Committee to reduce from 80 to 60 per cent the iCU beds reserved in the 33 private hospitals.The court, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on January 8 after the Delhi government, represented by Additional Solicitor General  (ASG) Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, said that the reservation would be revisited on January 5.The court asked the Delhi government, also represented by advocate Urvi Mohan, to place its decision on record before the next date hearing.It was hearing a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI), represented by advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, which has sought quashing of the Delhi government’s September 12 order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals here. On December 24, the association had opposed the De-escalation Committee’s recommendations and said that in view of the decrease in the per day number of COVID-19 cases, the positivity rate and the large number of vacant ICU beds in government hospitals, the reservation ought to be ended for now.The committee was constituted to assess the current position of hospital admissions and discharges and recommend reduction in the number of beds dedicated for coronavirus patients, if required.The high court too appeared to be in agreement with the association as it had said that it was “inhumane” to keep thousands of ICU beds reserved in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients when the positivity rate of the infection and number of coronavirus cases was going down in the national capital.The high court had also said that in the prevailing situation keeping so many ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients “cannot be sustained” and if in future there was an increase in COVID-19 cases, then the reservations can be brought back.The Delhi government, thereafter, had told the court that a decision would be taken on the recommendations only after it is reviewed by a two-member panel comprising the AIIMS Director and a Niti Aayog member.The two-member panel, on December 27, endorsed the committee’s recommendations saying that “in view of the unfolding situation of the new (UK) strain, we are of the view that we should take abundant precaution and abrupt de-escalation was not advisable at this juncture”.The two-member panel was also of the opinion that the New Year celebrations could result in gatherings “which may trigger a super spreader event” and therefore, the authorities need to be “cautious and vigilant” with regard to de-reservation of COVID ICU beds.The Delhi government, in its December 27 decision, has said that it has gone through AHPI’s objections and saw not a single case where a non-COVID patient was refused admission due to non-availability of ICU beds.It also said that AHPI’s objections were based on speculation that very few beds were available for non-COVID patients.The September 12 order of the Delhi government was earlier stayed by the high court on September 22.However, a division of the high court on November 12 vacated the stay order taking into account the change in circumstances since the time the stay order was passed.

However, police on duty poured water on them and removed them to safety, they said.The four, who came to the Collectorate on Monday being a public grievances day, claimed they had lodged a complaint with the district collector a year ago that Murugammal’s only son had usurped her 12 acres of land and did not take care of them.After the son died a few months ago, they were neglected by his wife also, leaving them on the streets, Murugammal said.They decided to end their lives as no action had been taken on their complaint, she said.Police said further investigation was on.Such immolation bids by petitioners had been witnessed during the grievance day meetings in the collectorate on several occasions in the past. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/immolation-bid-of-97-year-old-woman-three-elderly-daughters-foiled-in-tamil-nadu-190583
28-12-2020||New Delhi||National capital should embody glory of today’s India: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said Delhi being the national capital of the country should reflect the grandeur of 21st-century India and the government is making efforts to modernise the city’s old infrastructure.The prime minister said work is going on to develop the tourist attractions in the national capital.He was speaking after inaugurating the first-ever driverless Metro operations and launching the expansion of the National Common Mobility Card to the Airport Express Line of Delhi Metro via video conference.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was also present at the virtual event.“Delhi is the capital of a big economic and strategic power of more than 130 crore people. Its grandeur should be evident here,” PM Modi said.He said the government has incentivised electric mobility by giving tax rebates in Delhi, adding that the city’s old infrastructure is also being transformed with the help of modern technology.“This thinking is reflected in provision of better living conditions to slum dwellers through regularisation of hundreds of colonies and in turning old government building into environment friendly modern structures,” Modi said.The prime minister stressed that since Delhi is an old tourist destination, work is going on to develop 21st century attractions in the city.As Delhi is becoming a favoured destination of international conferences, international exhibitions and international business tourism, the country’s largest centre is being constructed in Dwarka area of the capital, Modi said.“Similarly, work for the new Parliament building has commenced along with a very big Bharat Vandana Park. This will not only give employment to thousands of people from Delhi but will also change the face of the city,” he added.The driverless trains, which started operating in Delhi on Monday, will be fully automated which will eliminate the possibility of human error, the government has said, adding that after the start of driverless services on the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden), the Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) of Delhi Metro is expected to have driverless operations by mid-2021.The Prime Minister’s Office has said these innovations will herald a new era of travelling comfort and enhanced mobility.The National Common Mobility Card, which will be fully operationalised on the Airport Express Line, will enable anyone carrying a RuPay-Debit Card issued from any part of the country to use it for travelling on the route. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-capital-should-embody-glory-of-todays-india-pm-modi-190581
28-12-2020||New Delhi||We want to make India a superpower: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh||India has the potential to become a superpower and it needs significant achievements in the fields of education, health and industry to make the cut, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday as he mentioned the country's glorious history including major discoveries by ancient scientists like Aryabhata ahead of their western counterparts.In an online address at the convocation of IIM Ranchi, Singh delved into India's rich contribution in the field of scientific research in the classical age of Indian mathematics and astronomy and noted that "Aryabhata confirmed the round shape of the Earth and its rotation on its axis about 1,000 years before famous German astronomer Copernicus did"."We want to make India a superpower. To make the country a superpower, we need even bigger achievements in the fields of education, health and industry, etc. The potential in these areas is within our country. It is not yet fully utilised," Singh said."When we talk about making India a superpower, then we also have to take care of the development potential in all the states of the country," he added.The defence minister said the youth of the country has the ability to face any challenge and can turn them into opportunities with the help of "invention, innovation and ideas".Encouraging students to play a key role in making of a 'New India', Singh said modern education should not deter them from taking inspiration from the country's glorious history, adding it set new standards of knowledge and discovery for centuries in the fields of physics, social science, spiritual knowledge and economics."Modern education should not be a hurdle in taking inspiration from your glorious past. Just like studying science does not mean that you do not believe in God," Singh said.He also mentioned mathematician Ramanujan and added: "He said 'an equation is meaningless to me unless it expresses a thought of God'".Urging students to work towards nation-building, the defence minister cited the contributions of renowned ancient Indian scientists and said "no success is final and no failure is fatal"."India has been a witness to a long tradition of scientists from Aryabhata, Varahamihir, Brahmagupta, Bodhayan, Charak, Sushruta, Nagarjuna to Sawai Jai Singh.," said Singh."Before Isaac Newton, Brahmagupta had confirmed the law of gravitational force. It is a different matter that Western scientists got credit for all these discoveries for some reason," Singh said, adding he is talking about it as he himself was a student of physics.He said ancient Indian scientist Baudhayan discovered the 'Pythagoras theorem' years before Pythagoras did.The defence minister said according to a famous Russian historian, India had mastered plastic surgery before Christ was born and that it was the first country to set up a hospital.Singh also mentioned a specific contribution to astronomy by 12th-century scientist Bhaskaracharya and suggested that he rehearsed one of the theories relating to orbital periods of the planets that was discovered by German scientist Kepler."Secondly, he gave birth to the theory of gravitation about 500 years before Isaac Newton who was born in the 17th century," said Singh.The defence minister said the list of India's achievements in science is very long, at the same time added that the country was not behind in other fields like economics, history, political science and public administration."Today, when we are all working for the creation of New India, it is important for all of us to understand our heritage," he said.Talking about the coronavirus pandemic, Singh said India effectively confronted the crisis despite having limited resources and that the country turned the disaster into an "opportunity" under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Asking students to work hard to achieve their goals, Singh said, "We have to understand that the road to success often passes through the streets of failure. There will be no successful person in the world who has never faced failure." --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-want-to-make-india-a-superpower-defence-minister-rajnath-singh-190576
28-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ stir: Govt sends invite for next round of talks on Dec 30, unions agree||Protesting farmer unions on Monday agreed “in-principle” to a government proposal of holding the next round of talks on the new agricultural laws on December 30, but said the Centre should have spelt out the agenda of the meeting in its invite.Earlier in the day, the government invited 40 protesting farmer unions for the next round of talks on December 30 on all relevant issues to find a “logical solution” to the current impasse over the three new farm laws.Abhimanyu Kohar, a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha—an umbrella body of 40 unions protesting against the contentious legislations—said the farmers have agreed to go for the meeting on the date proposed by the Centre.Also read: Anna Hazare threatens to launch his ‘last protest’ for farmersFarmers ‘porting’ mobile connections in large numbersOver 1,500 telecom towers damaged in PunjabLudhiana women go on hunger strike against farm lawsThe government’s invite followed a proposal made by unions last week to hold the talks on December 29.In a letter to the unions, Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Aggarwal has invited them for holding talks at 2 pm on December 30 at Vigyan Bhavan in the national capital.So far, five rounds of formal talks held between the Centre and 40 protesting farmer unions remained inconclusive.Taking note of the unions’ offer to resume talks, Aggarwal said, “The government is also committed to finding a logical solution on all relevant issues with a clear intention and an open mind.”       The farmers’ acceptance of the proposal came hours after the Centre sent them a letter suggesting December 30 as the date for the dialogue, against December 29 the protesting unions wanted.“In our letter sent to the government on December 26, we had clearly mentioned that repeal of three farm laws and legal guarantee for MSP should be part of the agenda for fresh talks, but despite this, the government in letter today has not mentioned any specific agenda,” Kohar told PTI.“But, we have agreed in-principle to hold talks with the government,” he said.The government’s latest invite followed a proposal made by unions last week to hold the talks on Tuesday, December 29, on agenda, including modalities for the repeal of the three laws enacted in September.Kohar said the government proposing to hold the talks on December 30, instead of agreeing to farmers’ suggestion of December 29, shows the Centre wants to assert its control.More protesters join in at Singhu borderMeanwhile, the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been camping in protest against the new laws since November 28, visibly swelled up on Monday as new protesters joined in over the weekend.Navigating the highway-turned-township became challenging with the pathways being cramped as tractors and trolleys of new protestors occupied more and more space at the protest site.Having already completed one month, the farmers said they were prepared for a long haul, and that essentials such as food and clothing are coming in in sufficient quantities to sustain their agitation.Apprehensive that the new laws will lead to the elimination of the MSP regime and the mandi system, the farmers have been demanding the three legislations be repealed.The government, on the other hand, has been projecting the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector.Several farmers who had gone to their villages after spending a few days at the protest sites have returned with their families.Amrinder Singh from Patiala had gone back home on December 4, and returned on Saturday with his wife and sister. “More people are coming in, and to keep our fight going, each house in every village in Punjab is giving Rs 1,000.”“More people will be coming from Fatehgarh Sahib on January 2 after a religious event there gets over,” he said.          It’s been over a month now that thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, are camping at Delhi borders seeking repeal of the three farm laws. They have threatened to intensify their stir in the coming days if their demands are not fulfilled. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-stir-govt-sends-invite-for-next-round-of-talks-on-dec-30-unions-agree-190575

28-12-2020||New Delhi||SCBA expresses shock over search at Delhi lawyer's premises, assault of another in UP||The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Monday expressed shock and deep concern on ”the arbitrary, illegal and brazen exercise of brute power by the police” against lawyers, including the search conducted at the premises of an advocate representing some of the accused in the north-east Delhi riots cases. The SCBA also condemned the assault on a lawyer in the Etah district, Uttar Pradesh, by the local police.The SCBA expressed "serious concern on the reprehensible conduct of the police in both these cases and calls upon all concerned authorities to take serious punitive action against all concerned for their atrocious conduct which denigrates and violates the mandate of the Rule of law".  Regarding search at advocate Mehmood Pracha'a office premises, the SCBA said that such actions were “intimidatory and designed to abuse the due process by coercing an advocate to succumb to police threats and methods unheard of in legal annals".“Such a search/seizure is in the teeth of the specific provisions of law which recognise the client lawyer relationship and protects all correspondence between the advocate and his client,” SCBA said in a statement.Encroachment on the rights of an advocate by the police violates the rights of the accused to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 21, and the protection against self-incrimination guaranteed under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution of India, jeopardising the rights of the client to a free trial, it said.  “The seizures of confidential information which is protected by lawyer-client privilege, in a search conducted by the very police authorities who are prosecuting the lawyer's clients, will prejudicially affect the rights and guarantees of the accused,” it said.“It is illegal and contravenes all canons of protection available to a client and his lawyers,” said Rohit Pandey, acting secretary of SCBA.The statement further said that advocates are entrusted with confidential and privileged communications by their clients and are protected and privileged.  \“Such privilege is protected under law and is the sine qua non for the effective realization of the right to fair trial, the right to access of justice, right against incriminating oneself which constitute essential rights guaranteed under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India," the statement said.“These sacrosanct protections of confidentiality guaranteed under the constitution and the laws, work as the fundamental bedrock of our justice system,” it said.It further said that the grant of a warrant by the Magistracy to search a lawyer's office in a routine mechanical manner, particularly in respect of a lawyer's communication and correspondences, was antithetical to rule of law and constitutes a disturbing violation of this privilege directly affecting the administration of justice.  “This Association strongly condemns the actions of the Delhi Police in its attempt to seize an advocate's personal computer and other personal digital devices by taking subterfuge under orders of a Court.  “Such an arbitrary exercise to access an Advocate's personal digital devices is a grave and egregious violation of privacy of any citizen and that of a member of the Bar who is engaged to act for his client,” it said.The Association called upon Delhi Police to “immediately forbear, cease and desist from using the information available on the devices so seized.“ Regarding the “brutal assault of a member of our fraternity in Etah in his house when he was with his family” the association said it was “atrocious and unacceptable".    “It is a gross and calculated action on the part of the police in total contravention of law,” it said.Pracha had said that a search was conducted at his office from 12 noon on December 24 till about 3 AM on December 25.Delhi police had alleged that lawyer Pracha forged documents and instigated a man to depose falsely in connection with a case related to the violence in north-east Delhi in February this year.Advocate Pracha has been representing various accused and complainants in the violence in north-east Delhi.Various cases were registered over the north-east Delhi violence, in which at least 53 people were killed and several others were injured.  In the second case, the video of the incident where police broke open the door of a house and dragged a man in advocate's dress assaulting him has gone viral. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scba-expresses-shock-over-search-at-delhi-lawyers-premises-assault-of-another-in-up-190569
28-12-2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka Health Minister hints at police action against untraceable UK returnees||Karnataka Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar on Monday hinted at stringent action against those returnees from the United Kingdom who were untraceable and had switched off their mobile phones.It could even be police action against them, the minister indicated.“I request the UK returnees to cooperate with us as responsible citizens. You have to get tested. If you don't get tested and switch off your phone, then it's a crime in true sense,” Sudhakar told reporters here.Official sources said around 300 people who returned from the UK, where a new strain of coronavirus has emerged recently, were yet to be traced.Responding to queries, Sudhakar said he would hold a meeting with Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai after the cabinet meeting because the UK returnees could not be tracked, have switched off their phones and were not responding to requests through media and social media.To a question whether police cases will be registered, he said: “I am compelled to say that I will discuss with the Home Minister and decide the future course of action.”According to him, till now 1,614 people have been tested. Of them, 26 people have tested positive till Sunday evening. Their samples have been sent to the designated lab in NIMHANS. Later, the report will be sent to the ICMR.The Minister said all 26 people had been admitted to the designated hospitals and none of them is in home isolation.“They are under the supervision of the government and are getting the best treatment. All of them are in good health and none of them is suffering from any serious ailment. They do have mild symptoms,” Sudhakar said.To a question about delay in getting the reports, the minister said test lab reports have to be sent to the ICMR as part of the uniform protocol designed for the entire country.“If different protocols are adopted in different states then it will cause fear among people. To avoid panic, uniform protocol is adopted pan India,” he said.Sudhakar exuded confidence that the reports on 26 people may come by the end of the day.Regarding the opening of schools and PU colleges, Sudhakar said he would discuss it with the state Education Minister.He stressed that there was no need to panic with the emergence of a new strain of coronavirus.“We have not yet confronted the fear so far. Cases are reducing and the fatalities have come down substantially. There are many districts which have not seen a single death for the past many days,” he added.According to him, there were cases coming up in certain localities of Bengaluru.“Even the UK returnees are located in Bengaluru only. So, it will not affect the schools,” the minister explained.Regarding vaccines, Sudhakar said he was expecting it at the earliest. He said the Prime Minister was going to offer the best gift to the people of the country.Speaking about the trial results of Covaxin, he said encouraging results were emerging from the third trial as well.“There are no adverse effects on 95 to 96 per cent people. Their immunity on the people has also gone up,” Sudhakar said.Meanwhile, a report from Mangaluru said, the Dakshina Kannada Health department had made RT-PCR test mandatory for all passengers arriving at the Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) and the New Mangalore Port (NMP).In a release, DK district health and family welfare officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy said a decision to make tests mandatory for all passengers at the MIA and NMP was taken as a precaution against spread of coronavirus variants in the second wave.

28-12-2020||Kolkata||Amartya Sen thanks Mamata for her support||Noted economist Amartya Sen has thanked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for supporting him after he was accused by the Visva Bharati University of illegal land grabbing.Banerjee on Friday wrote to Sen, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 1998, expressing support for him in the controversy. Some “nouveau invaders” were raising baseless allegations, the Bengal Chief Minister said in the letter addressed to Sen whom she called “Amartya da” (meaning elder brother Amartya, an address that denotes familiarity in the Bengali culture).In his reply dated December 27, Sen wrote that he was very happy to receive Banerjee’s wonderfully supportive letter.“I am not only most touched, but also very reassured that despite the busy life you have to lead, you can find time for reassuring people under attack,” Sen wrote to West Bengal CM.Sen, who is 87 years of age and currently Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University, wrote that Banerjee’s strong voice and her “full understanding of what was going on” was a tremendous source of strength for him.In her letter to Sen, Mamata had written that he was being targeted by the authorities of Visva Bharati, a centrally-tun university, for speaking out against the Narendra Modi-led regime in Delhi. “I want to express my solidarity with you in your battles against bigotry of majoritarians in this country, the battles that have made you an enemy of these forces of untruth”, Mamata wrote in the letter.Replying to Mamata, Sen wrote that he deeply appreciated the warmth of her extremely kind letter and would like to convey to her his affection and admiration.Sen wrote “Dear Mamata” at the beginning of the letter while asking if he could call her that (address her by the first name). Sen, a recipient of the country’s highest civilian award “Bharat Ratna”, signed off the letter as “Amartya” (instead of Amartya-da which Mamata would have perhaps preferred).Amartya Sen is the latest among the Bengali icons to be dragged into the bitter fight for the soon to be held state elections, for which the BJP has posed a strong challenge to Mamata Banerjee.Poet Tagore also figured in political wrangling between the state’s ruling TMC and BJP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the poet’s Gujarat connection while speaking virtually on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the foundation day of Vishva Bharati University.Amartya Sen, who was given his name by none other than Tagore himself, was born in Santiniketan where his father, educationist Ashutosh Sen, had built the family’s home, “Pratichi”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amartya-sen-thanks-mamata-for-her-support-190567
28-12-2020||New Delhi||Home Minister Shah unveils Arun Jaitley’s statue on DDCA premises||A controversial build-up notwithstanding, the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) on Monday unveiled the statue of its former president Arun Jaitley at its premises in the memory of the late administrator and political figure.Union Home Minister Amit Shah unveiled Jaitley’s life-size statue, prepared by 96-year-old renowned sculptor Ram Sutar, the man behind the making of the iconic Statue of Unity in Gujarat.Former India cricketer Bishen Singh Bedi had severely criticised the DDCA for choosing to install the statue of an administrator instead of an inspirational cricketer and even demanded that his name be removed from one the stands at the Feroze Shah Kotla ground.BCCI President and former India captain Sourav Ganguly, India opener Shikhar Dhawan, ex-India opener Gautam Gambhir, who is also a BJP MP from Delhi, BCCI vice president Rajeev Shukla and Union Minister Hardeep Puri attended the unveiling ceremony along with a number of DDCA officials.“Arun was like an elder brother to me. He was known for his sportsmanship spirit in political circle. He remained aggressive in his speeches but never lowered the dignity of the Parliament,” Shah said in his tribute to Jaitley, who remained DDCA president for 13 years.“Arun always put his own interest at the back, never sought publicity and rose during the Emergency days when he spent 19 months in jail. His political journey started then. He was multi-talented and fulfilled a range of responsibilities,” Shah added.Ganguly said Jaitley’s contribution was immense in the development of cricket in Delhi, though the DDCA had been in “turmoil” for some time.“When we play and get 100, it gets recognition but a lot of people work behind the scene and help the cricketers. He was a cricketer’s person. that is the role of an administrator,” he said.“I remember a phone call (he) made during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. We had lost the first game and the whole country went berserk but he (Jaitley) said that association supports you and you play well. These small things matter, he was a great human being,” said Ganguly.“This is a remarkably talented state which has produced so many players, Virat Kohli, Ishant Sharma, Rishabh Pant now and many in the past. A settled DDCA is good thing for Indian cricket and hopefully they can do it,” he added.Gambhir said the installation of Jailtley’s statue is a perfect tribute to him.“We won the Ranji trophy during his tenure and the stadium was also built. Honesty, (being) intellectual and absolute transparency are important for any administrator and he had that,” said Gambhir.

They were too feeble to properly stand up. Their condition was worse even than an Aghori tantrik," Patel said.According to Patel, the father of the trio said his children have been in such condition since the death of their mother nearly 10 years ago."They may be like what their father says (that they are mentally ill), but they need treatment urgently," she said.The members of the NGO brought out the trio and got them cleaned and shaved.Patel said they are planning to shift the trio to a place where they can get better food and treatment.Their father, a retired government employee, said his children are well educated."My eldest son Amrish, 42, was a practicing lawyer with BA, LLB degrees, while the younger daughter Meghna (39) is an MA in Psychology. My youngest son wis BA in Economics and also a promising cricket player," he said."My wife started keeping ill in 1986. She died five- six years later, which affected my children deeply, following which they locked themselves up," he said, adding that he would keep the food outside the door everyday."People say some relatives did black magic on them," he said.No police complaint is lodged so far.

As far as the Central Bureau of Investigation is concerned, we had taken a decision that any probe by that agency in Maharashtra cannot be pursued without the permission of the state government."However, the rights of ordering an ED inquiry is with them (the Central government), but using these rights for political purpose was something never seen in Maharashtra," Deshmukh said.He was replying to a query on the ED summoning the wife of Sanjay Raut for questioning.In October this year, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government had revoked the "general consent" given to the CBI to probe cases in the state.The NCP and the Congress are constituents of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Meanwhile, another senior NCP leader Praful Patel told reporters in a separate interaction that several people are now getting notices from the ED."....The reason (behind getting such notices) may be political or may be something else...Whatever it my be the facts will stand out. I don't want to derive any other meaning out of this action."We don't take these things otherwise. Such things happen..action is taken...We follow the procedure," he said when asked whether the Central agencies were being misused to settle political scores.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks direction to Centre, states to double number of judges in HCs, courts||A plea was filed on Monday in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Centre, states and Union Territories to take steps to double the number of judges in high courts and subordinate courts, and implement a judicial charter on disposal of cases in a three-year time period. The total sanctioned posts of judges in the 25 high courts of the country are 1,079 and as per the latest report, 414 of the posts are vacant.The PIL has been filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay and it has made all the high courts, the states, the Union Territories (UTs), the Union Home Ministry and the Law and Justice Ministry as parties. The plea filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey said that there is almost five crore pending cases in the country from trial courts to the apex court, and their delayed disposal violates the citizens' fundamental right to speedy justice."Deliberate and inordinate delay of a trial offends Article 21. Right to speedy justice is a fundamental right of every citizen, which cannot be trampled upon. It is an integral part of right to life and liberty and a procedure is void if it does not provide fair trial and speedy justice," the plea said."A Judicial Charter to guarantee time-bound trial and justice is an important safeguard (i) to prevent undue oppressive incarceration prior to trial (ii) to minimise anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation, and (iii) to limit the possibilities that long delays will impair the ability of an accused to defend him," it said. The PIL, which might come up for hearing after the winter break, said the judicial charter of October 25, 2009, had provided for disposal of all cases, including those pending before a tehsildar and an SDM, within three years and had sought its implementation."It is in the interest of society that the trial concludes within three years and if the accused is guilty, he is duly punished. If the accused is not guilty, an early conclusion of the trial is necessary to relieve him of the ordeal of trial and restore his dignity as soon as possible," it said. The plea, alternatively, urged the top court to direct the Centre and states to implement the recommendations of a Law Commission Report and take other apposite steps in order to break even and dispose of the backlog in a three-year time-frame. It urged the court to pass directions to implement the Judicial Charter in all the courts to decide cases within three years and to break-even and dispose of the backlog by 2023.The cause of action accrued on October 25, 2009, and continues when the Centre promised to reduce pendency of cases from 15 years to three years. But the Centre did nothing to implement the recommendations proposed by the Law Commission of India in its reports, it said. "The Centre and states have deliberately neglected the importance of speedy justice. They have not provided required judicial infrastructure to clear the huge backlog. The number of judges per million populations is less than 20. The figure stood at 19.78 in 2018, 17.48 in 2014 and 14.7 in 2002. These numbers show how the Indian judiciary is suffering due to low manpower," it said. To highlight the delay in deciding cases, the PIL referred to a property dispute which is pending before the consolidation officer of Jaunpur for 35 years and cited that the victim got more than 400 dates but not the justice.

Today it is about three times more with more than seven hundred kilometres. We are trying to expand it to 25 cities with 1,700 kilometre network," he said.Modi also inaugurated India's first-ever driverless train operations on Delhi Metro's Magenta Line along with the fully operational National Common Mobility Card service on the Airport Express Line via video-conferencing.The driverless trains will be fully automated, which will eliminate the possibility of human error, the government has said, adding that after the start of driverless services on the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden), the Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) of Delhi Metro is expected to have driverless operations by mid-2021.The Prime Minister's Office has said that these innovations would herald a new era of travelling comfort and enhanced mobility.The National Common Mobility Card, which will be fully operationalised on the Airport Express Line, will enable anyone carrying a RuPay-Debit Card issued from any part of the country to travel on the route using it.

He also named the students in his complaint, police said.The students, however, denied the allegations, saying they were demanding "Azaadi (freedom)" from a corrupt principal and an anti-student system of the college.On the principal's complaint, police have booked Sumit Tiwari, Shesh Narayan Pandey, Imran Hashmi, Satvik Pandey, Mohit Yadav and Manoj Mishra.They have been booked under sections 124 A (sedition), 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order ), 332 (causing hurt to deter public servant from duty), 342 (wrongfully confinement), 353 (assault on public servant), 427 (causing damage to property), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) and 506 (offence of criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, police said."The students were raising slogans of 'Azaadi' and they wanted to take 'Azaadi' by revolt and by violence. They were raising the slogans, they were trying to burn the nation, and we're creating violence. To protect the motherland is my duty and I have filed the complaint against the students," Pandey told PTI.However, former student union president Abhas Krishna Yadav said the students were raising "Azaadi slogans as they were demanding 'Azaadi' from a corrupt principal and an anti-student system of the college". They were demanding that the student union elections be held, said Abhas Yadav, a student of the Saket Degree College.

Let’s see, what action the Centre takes on my demands. They have sought time for a month, so I have given them time till January-end. If my demands are not met, I will resume my hunger strike protest. This would be my last protest,” the 83-year-old said.On December 14, Hazare wrote a letter to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar warning of a hunger strike if his demands like the implementation of the MS Swaminathan Committee’s recommendations and granting autonomy to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), were not accepted.Senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagade recently met Hazare to explain him the details of the three farm laws introduced by the Centre.Hazare observed a fast on December 8 in support of the Bharat Bandh called by farmer organisations demanding a repeal of the agri laws.Farmers have been protesting at borders of Delhi for over a month against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting tillers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anna-hazare-threatens-to-launch-his-last-protest-for-farmers-190526

28-12-2020||---||PM recalls sacrifices of Sikh Gurus||New Delhi, December 27Amid the farmers’ protest, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today paid tributes to the Sikh Gurus, including the sons of Guru Gobind Singh, saying their sacrifices helped keep the country’s culture safe.Read more:UP to observe dec 27 as Sahibzada DiwasNew Delhi: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's sons would be included in the school curriculum in the state. He said December 27 would be observed as Sahibzada Diwas from next year. Speaking at an event to mark the martyrdom day of the Sahibzade and Mata Gujri, he said, “Every child must be taught about their sacrifice. The schools will organise activities, including debates on the martyrdom of the Sahibzade.” TNSOn his ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio programme, the PM said, “We pay tributes to the brave Char Sahibzade, we remember Mata Gujri, we recall the greatness of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji. We remain indebted to them for their sacrifices and spirit of compassion.”He paid tributes to Sahibzade Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh and Mata Gujri for unmatched courage and determination.The PM said he was blessed with the opportunity to visit Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib to pay obeisance to Guru Teg Bahadur on his martyrdom day.Farm leaders, meanwhile, urged the PM to listen to their “mann ki baat” too. There has been no breakthrough after five rounds of talks between the Centre and the protesting farm unions, which have rejected the government proposal to amend the laws and provide a written assurance on the MSP issue.Security remained tight at the Delhi borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri, where the farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP, have been camping since the last week of November. Protesters clanged plates and other utensils at the sit-in sites during PM Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ monthly radio address following a call by agitating unions.Haryana farmer leaders appealed to the Prime Minister to listen to the "Mann ki Baat" of farmers and voices of other people as well. Renewing his call for “vocal for local”, he said the hurdles created by the Covid pandemic had taught new lessons to the people and made them resilient. “The call for ‘vocal for local’ is reverberating in each and every household… In such a scenario, it is time to ensurethat our products meet global standards… This is the opportune moment to work with the ethos of ‘zero effect, zero defect’,” he said.The outgoing year saw the spirit of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ echo in society, he said. Urging people to prepare a list of items they used and find out those that were manufactured abroad, he said they should substitute them with 'made in India' products. "Let us find out their substitutes made in India and decide that henceforth we shall use products made with the hard work and sweat of the people of India. You make New Year resolutions every year. This time, one has to certainly make a resolution for the country," the PM said.Modi also touched the subject of wildlife conservation. Noting that the population of leopards in India had increased by over 60 per cent between 2014 and 2018, from 7,900 to 12,852, he described this as a big achievement for the year. He said over the past few years, the population of lions and tigers too had increased and so had India's forest cover. Speaking of the feedback he received for his ‘Mann ki Baat’ broadcast on multiple platforms, he said the common factor had been that people had commended the country's capabilities and the collective strength of the countrymen during the pandemic. A novel experiment like 'Janta curfew' became an “inspiration” for the whole world, he said.Millions of people across the country had stayed home on March 22 on the PM’s appeal for a ‘Janta curfew’ to check the spread of coronavirus. Modi also noted that teachers had prepared creative course material in this period of online studies, and asked them to upload these materials on the Diksha portal of the Education Ministry. This would help students who were staying in far-flung areas of the country a lot, he said. (With agency inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-recalls-sacrifices-of-sikh-gurus-190415
