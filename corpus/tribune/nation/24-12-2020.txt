24-12-2020||New Delhi||India, China agreed that next round of military talks should be held soon: MEA||India and China have agreed that the next round of military talks should be held soon for working towards an “early and complete” disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the diplomatic and military talks have helped both sides to enhance understanding of each other’s positions on the issue.Last week, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs.In the virtual meeting, both sides agreed to continue work towards ensuring complete disengagement of troops in all friction points along the LAC in eastern at the “earliest”.“India and China continue to maintain communications through diplomatic and military channels. These discussions have helped both sides to enhance understanding of each other’s positions,” Srivastava said.He was replying to questions on the over seven-month border standoff.“As you are aware, a meeting of the WMCC on India China border affairs took place on December 18 and the two sides have agreed that the ninth round of senior commanders meeting should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards an early and complete disengagement of troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols and fully restore peace and tranquillity,” he said.The eighth and last round of military talks had taken place on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points.Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff.China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials.Army Chief Gen MM Naranave on Wednesday visited various high-altitude forward areas in eastern Ladakh and reviewed India’s overall military preparedness.Asked whether India cancelled all diplomatic events planned with China to celebrate the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, Srivastava said the activities have not yet been launched.“This is the 70th year of establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China. However, the activities that have been agreed upon have not yet been launched,” he said.

Following this, the Army had initiated disciplinary proceedings.Officials in know of the development said the two Army personnel may face court martial proceedings for violating the powers vested under the AFSPA, 1990 and not following the Do’s and Don’ts of Chief of Army Staff as approved by the Supreme Court.The officials said the accused personnel may face serious charges under the law.They also said the role of the three civilians as well as the person who had allegedly led the Army to the youths in Amshipura in Shopian needs to be thoroughly examined by the police.The three civilians killed in Amshipura were Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammed Ibrar, hailing from Rajouri district. Their identities were subsequently confirmed through a DNA test. The bodies were handed over to their families in Baramulla in October.The role and antecedents of these three youths are also being investigated due to lack of clarity on their intent and actions upon coming to Shopian.Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha had visited the families of the three Rajouri youths and expressed condolences. He had also assured the families that the UT government will extend full support to them and ensure that justice is done in the case.He had also conveyed the message of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the government stands with the aggrieved families, and they will be taken care of with all support from the government.                 The officials said the Army has been maintaining high standards of transparency and punishing officials whenever rules are violated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-completes-summary-of-evidence-in-shopian-encounter-court-martial-of-its-2-men-possible-188895

24-12-2020||New Delhi||CISF canines who secured Delhi Metro retire with medals and cake||Eight CISF dogs retired on Thursday after serving the force’s Delhi Metro unit for 10 years, with a senior official describing them as “brave soldiers” who carried out their duties with distinction to ensure commuters’ safety.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) organised a farewell ceremony for its four-legged soldiers at a camp in east Delhi and the canines were decorated with medals for their service.Lilly, Jency, Blacky, Pusty and Lucy (all female Labradors), Rosy and Tweeky (female German Shepherds) and Mini (a female Cocker Spaniel) have “checked and cleared” more than 2,800 unattended or suspected articles and vehicles in the Delhi Metro network that carries as much as 26 lakh passengers during its regular operations across Delhi and its neighbouring cities of Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurgaon.The CISF guards over 250 operational stations of this rapid rail network and has deployed over 12,000 men and women personnel for the task.The force has a team of about 50 canines for securing the network, often called the life line of Delhi-NCR.“We are thankful for their service. They are our brave soldiers who have served with distinction. The farewell is the least we can do for them who safeguarded the passengers and helped us render our duties with efficiency,” CISF Deputy Inspector General (Delhi Metro Security) Jitender Rana told PTI.The DIG, senior Commandant Deepak Agarwal and other officers of the force put medals around the necks of the canines who wore a yellow and black wrap around bearing the CISF insignia.Their handlers were given certificates of appreciation.The retiring dogs were treated to a bowl of pineapple cake each after the ceremony.“Usually, we don’t give them cakes as it is not considered healthy for combat canines but today is a special day,” S Chauhan, in-charge of the canine squad, said.These dogs, a senior officer said, are being handed over to a local NGO which will take care of them for the rest of their lives.People can adopt these dogs but only after completing certain procedures that ensure that these trained dogs do not fall into the wrong hands, the officer said.The CISF and the NGO ascertain and approve the credentials of those who wish to adopt them, he added.“These female soldiers worked in the force for about 10 years and they not only secured the Delhi Metro network but also rendered sniffing and checking duties during special events like the Kumbh Mela that took place in 2018,” the officer said.Police dogs have an active life of about 10 years and post this they are sent for a retired life. The average life of these dogs is about 14-15 years, he added.A number of CISF troops, who were present at the camp for a promotion and rank piping ceremony, were seen taking selfies with the dogs even as some of the handlers turned emotional and hugged their “best friends” after the ceremony.“I have been with my dog for almost the full time she has been in the force. I feel one part of me is gone today,” a CISF handler said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cisf-canines-who-secured-delhi-metro-retire-with-medals-and-cake-188885

The company is now planning to initiate Phase III clinical trials in around 30,000 volunteers upon receiving necessary approvals", Zydus Cadila said in a statement.The Phase-II study of the vaccine, ZyCoV-D, had been conducted in over 1,000 healthy adult volunteers as part of the adaptive Phase-I and II dose escalation, multi-centric, randomised and double-blind placebo controlled study. The vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic, he added.The trial has been reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and reports have been submitted to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) regularly for the update on safety outcome, read the statement.On the development, Zydus Group Chairman Pankaj R Patel said that after establishing safety in Phase-I clinical trial, ZyCoV-D had now completed Phase-II clinical trials and the vaccine had been found to be safe and immunogenic."We are optimistic of Phase-III clinical trial outcomes as well and that we would be able to start the production of the Novel Vaccine on its successful completion," he added.With ZyCoV-D, the company has established the DNA vaccine platform in the country. The platform is also known to show much improved vaccine stability, thus requiring lower cold chain requirements. This makes the vaccine ideal for access in remotest regions of the country, said Zydus Cadila.The platform can be rapidly used to modify the vaccine in a couple of weeks in case the virus mutates to ensure that the vaccine still elicits protection, it added.Shares of Cadila Healthcare, the listed entity of Zydus Group, on Thursday closed at Rs 489.65 per scrip on the BSE, up 3.14 per cent from its previous close.

On earlier occasions it had been kept in abeyance.While the BJP did not react in the House, later party leader Sanjay Waghule critisised the decision. The general body rejected a land proposal for the Bullet train but passed a resolution for the Light Rail Transport for the city, he said.The Maharashtra Government has decided to shift the site of a car shed for Mumbai Metro to Kanjurmarg in eastern Mumbai, but the Union Government has moved the High Court, contending the land in Kanjurmarg belongs to its Salt Department and not the state.The HC recently stayed the land allotment. The previous BJP-led government had chosen Arey Colony area for car shed despite opposition from green activists, a decision the present regime reversed.

He achieved the Guinness world record last month, the report said.His name also features in the ‘India Book’ for being the youngest to identify the top 100 tallest buildings of the world with their respective heights and locations, it said.“I have been a Lego buff since I was a toddler, and my father and I spent a lot of time creating a variety of models — rockets, air planes, buildings and vehicles. I was able to recognise a lot of the air plane tails, and my mother helped me compile them in PowerPoint slides so I could identify them (very quickly),” Gumber told Gulf News.His mother Monisha said her son has always been interested in signs, symbols and logos.“He has an exceptional picture memory and usually never forgets an image once he has seen it. He does have a variety of interests and likes to know about things into detail, just like air planes. Although he loves country flags, we focused on aeroplane tails for the Guinness record because they too are unique,” she said.He took about 1.5 seconds per airline tail, she added.

24-12-2020||Vibha Sharma ||Ladakh’s Tso Kar now a wetland of international importance||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 24India has added Tso Kar Wetland Complex in Ladakh as its 42nd Ramsar site, the  second one in the Union Territory (UT) of Ladakh, according to the government.Environment Minister Prakash  Javadekar shared the information.The Tso Kar Basin is a high-altitude wetland complex, consisting of two principal water bodies--Startsapuk Tso, a freshwater lake of about 438 hectares to the south, and Tso Kar itself, a hypersaline lake of 1,800 hectares to the north, situated in the Changthang region of Ladakh, India. It is called Tso Kar, meaning white lake, because of the white salt efflorescence found on the margins due to the evaporation of highly saline water.The Tso Kar Basin is an A1 category important bird area (IBA), as per Bird Life International and a key staging site in the Central Asian Flyway. The site is also one of the most important breeding areas of the black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) in India. This IBA is also the major breeding area for Great Crested Grebe (Podicepscristatus), Bar-headed Geese (Anserindicus), Ruddy Shelduck (Tadornaferruginea), Brown-headed Gull (Larusbrunnicephalus), Lesser Sand-Plover (Charadriusmongolus) and many other species, a statement issued by the Centre said.The aim of the Ramsar list is “to develop and maintain an international network of wetlands, which are important for the conservation of global biological diversity and for sustaining human life through the maintenance of their ecosystem components, processes and benefits”.The wetlands provide a wide range of important resources and ecosystem services such as food, water, fibre, groundwater recharge, water purification, flood moderation, erosion control and climate regulation. They are, in fact, a major source of water and our main supply of freshwater comes from an array of wetlands, which help soak rainfall and recharge groundwater. The ministry would be working closely with the UT Wetland Authority to ensure wise use of this site.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ladakhs-tso-kar-now-a-wetland-of-international-importance-188831
24-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Govt writes to farmers, says open to talks; farmers call it 'delaying tactic'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 24A day after farmer unions demanded concrete proposals in writing, the Centre on Thursday again invited them for talks, reiterating its readiness for discussion on all issues.However, just like his letter dated December 20, Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal neither mentioned the time nor date of the proposed meeting. Effectively throwing the ball in the court of farmers, he said the meeting with “high-level ministerial panel” will take place in the Vigyan Bhawan at the time and date of their choice.Amid the ongoing to and fro with the Centre, ‘jathebandis’ and farmers’ unions rejected the letter, calling it yet another “delaying tactic” by the government. Leaders said unions will hold a meeting to decide further course on the latest offer, which while repeating what is already there in public domain also talked of a written assurance on the MSP “even though that is not a part of the three laws”. Interestingly, this time the letter was addressed to the 40 unions of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and not just the president of the Krantikari Kisan Union Darshan Pal, the main addressee of Aggarwal’s previous letter. Braving harsh cold, thousands of agitating farmers at the Delhi borders remained steadfast in their demands to repeal the Centre’s three new laws.  The Centre, which too is firm that the laws will not be scrapped, says it is ready to make any amendments ‘jathebandis’ and unions want. The reason why it is not specifying the time and date is because the government wants to accord the “privilege of deciding that on farmers”, BJP leaders say.However, demanding a total repeal of the laws, farmers are accusing the government of “playing games with them”. Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), called today’s letter “as confusing as the previous letter”. “The government was earlier playing meeting-meeting with us and is now playing letter-letter with farmers,” he said.Meanwhile, the Kisan Mazdoor Sangh from Baghpat “extended support to the government” on the three Acts. Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mega outreach to farmers on the birth anniversary of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tomorrow, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said its leaders told him that “the government should not come under any pressure regarding the three laws brought by PM Modi to bring prosperity in their lives ”.

24-12-2020||New Delhi||BKU (Lok Shakti) moves SC challenging farm laws, seeks impleadment in pending matter||Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti) has moved the Supreme Court challenging the three new farm laws, against which various farmer unions are staging protest at several border points of Delhi, and sought impleadment in the matter pending in the apex court.In an application seeking impleadment in the pending petition, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti) has claimed that the new farm laws “promote corporate interest” and are not concerned with the “interest of farmers”.The plea, filed through advocate AP Singh, alleged that these acts are “unconstitutional” and anti-farmer as it would “dismantle the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) system intended to ensure fair prices for farm products”.“The implementation of the acts in its current form will spell disaster for the farming community by opening a parallel market which is unregulated and gives enough place for exploitation of the Indian farmers,” the application said.It claimed that farmers are “very much scared that these acts also lead to corporatisation of the entire agriculture market and the prices can be driven up or down by the corporates”.While hearing the matter related to farmers protest, a bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde had on December 17 said that farmers' agitation should be allowed to continue “without impediment” and the apex court would not interfere with it as the right to protest is a fundamental right.Several farmer unions, including the BKU, have been impleaded as respondents in the matter pending in the top court.Some of the petitions filed in the apex court have sought directions to the authorities to remove farmers protesting at several border points of Delhi, saying commuters are facing hardships due to road blockades and the gatherings might lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.While acknowledging the right to non-violent protest of farmers, the apex court had last week observed that farmers' right to protest should not infringe the fundamental rights of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blockade of the entire city.“We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact, be exercised subject to public order,” the court had said on December 17 while hearing a batch of pleas on the issue.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had Wednesday said the government will continue with reforms in the farm sector as they are still due in many areas.Tomar had reiterated his hope that protesting farmers will soon come forward to resume their dialogue with the Centre to resolve their concerns over the three new laws.The protesting farmer unions had Wednesday asked the government to come up with a new concrete proposal for resumption of talks.

Seized 19.3 lakh foreign cigarettes valued at Rs 2.35 crore. Four arrests so far. Investigation is on," Customs (Preventive) Delhi informed in a tweet on Wednesday.According to the officials, the seized cigarettes were smuggled from countries like China, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia to evade taxes and sell them in Delhi and other major cities."When compared to the Indian brands, consumers prefer to buy foreign brands due to the international quality, catchy labels and nicely packed," an investigator told IANS.Whereas cigarettes produced and packed in India have to adhere to specified health warnings, both in pictorial and text formats, to discourage the smokers.Trade insiders say Punjab alone has an annual legal market of 120 million cigarettes and the grey market accounts for 20-30 per cent.Chandigarh and Panchkula cities have an annual legal market of 20 million and 10 million cigarettes respectively, and the illegal market has a share of 15-20 per cent.While Kashmir has an annual legal market of 300 million cigarettes, the grey market has a share of seven-eight per cent, comparatively less than Punjab's share.Himachal's tourist destinations Shimla and Manali have the annual illegal market of one million cigarettes each. They have a legal market of 10 million and five million cigarettes respectively.Most of the illegal cigarette brands attract the retailers as they are available at a significantly lower price than the legal cigarettes. They are sold in the market at one fifth the price of the legal product, said the investigator.Take the case of an imported brand. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs Rs 20-30 to a retailer, who is selling at a cost of Rs 100. While an Indian brand cost between Rs 250 and Rs 300 with a profit margin of approximately Rs 5.A spokesperson for the Punjab government said 21,446 fines under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act or COTPA were imposed in 2019-20 and the maximum fines were against selling cigarettes without pictorial warning.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-emerges-hub-of-illegal-sale-of-imported-cigarettes-to-j-k-himachal-188814

24-12-2020||Santinekatan||Tagore's vision for Visva-Bharati also essence of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', says Modi||Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's vision is the essence of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' mission of his government for empowerment of India and the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, as he took forward his outreach to premier educational institutions.Addressing a function to mark the centenary celebrations of Visva-Bharati, the country's oldest Central University, he extolled the pivotal role it played in India's freedom movement and in furthering the cause of universal brotherhood.Visva-Bharati was declared a Central University and an Institution of National Importance by an Act of Parliament in 1951."Gurudev's vision for Visva-Bharati is the essence of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Atmanirbhar Bharat is the path to India's development for the development of the world. It's a campaign for India's empowerment and prosperity, and through it, the prosperity of the word," he told the gathering through video-conferencing from New Delhi.He said Tagore and the institution he founded not only strengthened the spirit of nationalism but also promoted inclusiveness that strengthened "vishva bandhutva" (universal brotherhood).The Prime Minister, who addressed the convocations and centenary celebrations of four universities - the Mysore University, Lucknow University, Aligarh Muslim University and Visva-Bharati - within a span of a little over two months, dwelt on the role played by educational institutions in driving the freedom movement.He said from the "Vedas to Vivekananda", Tagore's thoughts reflected the collective thought of India, which was never introverted or exclusive."His vision was that what is best in India the world should benefit from it, and India should learn from the good things they have. Now look at the very name of your university - Visva-Bharati....coordination and cooperation of India with the world," he said.The Prime Minister said Visva-Bharati was the embodiment of the vision and the hard work of the Nobel Laureate and a "venerable source of constant energy to the country".He said today India is spreading Visva-Bharati's message to the world."India is today leading the world in the field of environment protection through the International Solar Alliance and is the only country moving at a rapid pace to achieve the goals of the Paris Accord," he asserted.He recalled the role of the leaders of the Bhakti Movement like Guru Nanak, Kabir and Surdas, who sowed the seeds of the freedom movement long before it started in the 19th and 20th centuries.The Bhakti Movement, he asserted, strengthened India's spiritual evolution and collective consciousness.He said after the long period of the Bhakti Movement arrived, Ramkrishna Paramhansa who discovered Swami Vivekananda was a "blend of Bhakti (devotion), Gyan (knowledge) and Karma (action)"."The Bhakti Movement united us, the Movement for Knowledge gave us intellectual strength and the Movement of Karma, exemplified by the likes of Shivaji, Maharana Pratap, Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki, gave us the spirit and courage to fight for our rights."He said at a time when India was fighting to win freedom from the colonial rule, the need was felt for an ideological movement and to prepare a new generation that could play a major role in rebuilding India."Educational institutes and universities like Visva-Bharati and others gave a new direction to the freedom movement."Praising the institution for its remarkable achievements in varied fields like art and literature, and science and innovation, the Prime Minister urged its students to reach out to the artisans in the region to explore ways to find national and international markets for their produce."That will make them self-reliant. Atmanirbhar Bharat is the initiative for India's prosperity which will aid in global prosperity," he said.Modi also spoke about the inclusive culture that was inherent in India's ethos. It came at a time when West Bengal is witnessing political violence in the run-up to the Assembly election and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has often dubbed his BJP a "party of outsiders".He said Tagore's elder brother Satyendranath Tagore, an ICS officer, was posted in Ahmedabad in Gujarat years before Independence and the Nobel Laureate had penned two of his works there.Satyandranath Tagore's wife Gyanandini Devi, he was told, had popularised the way of wearing sari that would allow women to perform household chores with greater comfort."I want all of you to strengthen this culture," Modi said.He wrapped up his speech with a line of Tagore's poem "Ore grihobashi khol dar khol (you who are indoor, open the door).Modi also began his nearly 30-minute speech with Tagore's poem 'He vidhata, dao, dao, moder gaurav dao (O Lord, give me glory).

24-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers protesting at Delhi borders remain resolute in seeking repeal of new agri laws||Braving harsh cold, thousands of agitating farmers at the Delhi borders on Thursday remained steadfast in their demands to repeal the Centre's three new agri laws.Dense fog reduced visibility to just 100 metres in parts of Delhi on Thursday, affecting traffic movement, the India Meteorological Department said, adding that the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, settled at 4.5 degrees Celsius.Security remained tight at the Delhi borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri as thousands of farmers have been staging their protests at the borders for nearly a month now. This has also led to traffic congestion forcing police to divert vehicular movement.Taking to Twitter on Thursday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed owing to farmers' agitation and suggested them to take alternative roads."The Chilla, Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. People are advised to take alternative route for coming to Delhi via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara, bhopra & Loni borders," it said in a tweet.In another tweet, police said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders are closed."Pl take alternative routes via Lampur, Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Pl avoid Outer Ring Rd, GTK road & NH 44," the traffic police mentioned.On Wednesday, the protesting farmers hardened their position and asked the government not to repeat the proposal of "meaningless" amendments that they have already rejected but come up with a "concrete" offer in writing for the resumption of talks.Reading out a reply to the government's talks offer during a press conference, farmer leaders said they are ready for dialogue with an open mind if they get a concrete proposal, but made it clear they will not accept anything less than a complete repeal of the three agriculture laws and legal guarantee for the Minimum Support Price (MSP).The sixth round of talks on December 9 was cancelled following a deadlock with the farmer unions refusing to budge from their demand for repealing the three laws.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers.

The welfare of people amid COVID-19 and natural disasters was a big task," she said.Asked about her shift of ideology, Matondkar said the word 'secular' has been "lost in translation"."Being secular doesn't mean you have no belief in religion, while being a Hindu doesn't mean you hate other religions. The Shiv Sena is a Hindutvawadi party. Hinduism is a great religion which is all inclusive," she said."My intention is to become a people's leader, like I have been a people-made film star," the actor said, adding that she wants to work for people irrespective of their caste, creed and religion.The MVA government has recommended her name to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for a seat in the Maharashtra Legislative Council.Koshyari is yet to take a call on the 12 names that the government has forwarded for nomination to the Upper House from the governors quota.Matondkar said if her nomination to the Legislative Council under the governor's quota is not accepted, she would continue to work for people in whateverway she can through theShiv Sena's platform."Irrespective of whether or not I become an MLC, I have started working as a Shiv Sainik...I did not join the Shiv Sena for any post. I had not joined the Congress to contest elections.

PtiBriefing the media after the meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “The Commerce Ministry had already spoken of 100 per cent FDI in the DTH sector, but because of the guidelines issued by my Ministry, the FDI was limited to 49 per cent. We have corrected that aberration today.”The minister said, “The licence fee has also been reduced in keeping with the rates in the telecom sector and would be collected quarterly.”A statement from the I&B Ministry said the proposed reduction was intended to align the licence fee regime applicable to the telecom sector and would be prospectively applied.“The difference may also enable DTH service providers to invest for more coverage, leading to increased operations and higher growth and thereby enhanced and regular payment of licence fee by them,” the statement read.Currently, India has 18 crore television sets, out of which six crore operate on DTH. The ministry claimed that the revised guidelines would help in fair degree of stability and bring in new investments.

The results are still to be peer reviewed though.“In phase 1 trial, the vaccine (BBV152) produced high level of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced cell-mediated immune responses,” the latest data show.The researchers are going with the 6 µg formulation for phase 3 efficacy trial after trying the 3 ug formulation in the first two stages.The phase 2 trial of Covaxin was a double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, clinical trial involving 380 healthy children and adults, who received two vaccine formulations — 3 µg and 6 µg. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered four weeks apart.“In a follow-up of the phase 1 trial, the vaccine candidate produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months at day 104 after the second vaccination. Based on these results, we hypothesise that the vaccine can generate antibodies that may persist for six to 12 months,” the research shows.Bharat Biotech is among the three companies to have sought emergency use approval in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/phase-2-trials-covaxin-produces-immunity-no-serious-side-effect-188718

It will benefit more than four crore SC students in the next five years and help them pursue higher education.“It is a consequential and transformatory change which will help uplift students among the poorest SC families,” Union Social Justice Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said.The Cabinet approved investment of Rs 59,048 crore of which Union Government would spend Rs 35,534 crore (60 per cent) and the balance would be spent by the state governments.This replaces the existing “committed liability” system and brings greater involvement of the Centre in the scheme.The PMS-SC allows students to pursue any post-matric course starting from Class XII and onwards with the government meeting the cost of education.It is estimated that 1.36 crore such poorest students, who are currently not continuing their education beyond Class X, will be brought into the higher education system in the next five years.Salient feature of the scheme is that starting from 2021-22, the Central share under it would be released on DBT mode directly into the bank accounts of the students.The amount will be deposited from accounts of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to those of the beneficiaries as “per fixed time schedule”, after ensuring that the state government concerned has released their share.Monitoring mechanism will be further strengthened through conduct of social audits, annual third party evaluation and half-yearly self-audited reports from each institution.A campaign will be launched to enroll students from the poorest households passing Class X in the higher education courses of their choice.The scheme will be run on an online platform with robust cyber security measures that will assure transparency, accountability, efficiency and timely delivery of the assistance without any delays.The states will undertake foolproof verification of the eligibility, caste status, Aadhaar identification and bank account details on the online portal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-new-sc-scholarship-norms-centres-funding-rises-to-60-188717

I have been told that Jaitley was an able politician. It’s Parliament, not a cricket stadium, that needs to remember him for posterity,” he said.Talking with The Tribune, he said he had taken the decision on principles, though with a heavy heart. “I’m overwhelmed with the support I’ve received...

He reiterated the government was ready for talks as per the farmers’ convenience.“I am hopeful that the unions will consider our offer. Whatever they want to add or subtract from the proposal, we are ready to listen,” Tomar said, as the Confederation of NGOs of Rural India presented him “letters in support of the Acts signed by 3,13,363 farmers”.On December 25, the birth anniversary of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, PM Modi will release the next installment of financial benefit under PM-Kisan.
