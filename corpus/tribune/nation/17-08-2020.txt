They want that they should anyhow get their chair back. They have nothing to do with public service or with the promises they had made to people,” Scindia told reporters.He was responding to a query on Nath’s statement that the Congress would bounce back to power after by-elections.“I am confident that people are with the BJP and in the coming by-elections, these people (Congress leaders) will get a strong reply in the court of the common people,” the BJP MP said.He also termed the previous government as “totally corrupt, torturous and bogus”.“I am proud of taking my family traditions forward like my grandmother (Vijayaraje Scindia) and father (Madhavrao Scindia) by holding the flag of the truth,” he said.Scindia said he didn’t assign any importance to statements made against him in the wake of him quitting the Congress.“It is more important for me to reply to questions of people and to my inner voice than answering questions of Nath and other Congress leaders,” Scindia said.“During the erstwhile rule of the Congress, new records of corruption and not fulfilling promises of people were created in only 15 months, which I had never seen even in my 20 years of public life,” he said.Scindia said the COVID-19 situation in the state came under control after Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister again.Later, Scindia visited Ujjain and addressed party workers at a function.He also performed puja of Shahi Mahakal Sawari and visited Gopal Mandir.

Whenever I need, I take medicines from a compounder,” the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament had reportedly said.Expressing displeasure over Raut’s comments, the MARD letter said: “The chief minister lauds doctors as corona warriors, but his party colleague bad mouths the same profession.

17-08-2020||New Delhi||Nadda’s ‘Prince of Incompetence’ barb at Rahul for his swipe at PM CARES Fund||Rahul Gandhi’s “improbity” swipe at the PM CARES Fund on Monday drew a strong counter-attack from BJP president JP Nadda who mocked the Congress leader as “prince of incompetence” and accused him of “spreading fake news”.Nadda did not name Gandhi but the Congress leader was apparently his target.Gandhi had tweeted “PM CARES for Right To Improbity” while tagging a news report that alleged the Prime Minister’s Office had denied an RTI application seeking information on the fund.Hitting back, Nadda tweeted, “This happens when the ‘Prince of Incompetence’ shares articles without even reading them. The RTI was filed to know details of other RTIs and this is maliciously spun by you as an attack on transparency. Well, it’s natural given how your career is only based on spreading fake news.”He said the entire nation has full faith in the prime minister and his initiatives, and this faith was yet again “visible with the massive support” for the PM CARES Fund.“Being the loser you are, you can only crib and spread fake news while the entire nation has joined hands in the fight against COVID-19,” he said in an apparent attack on Gandhi.Keeping up his charge, Nadda alleged, “Your family’s dubious legacy includes appropriating a permanent position in PMNRF (Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund) and then diverting money from PMNRF into your family trusts. You and your mother also took money from the Chinese to hurt our national interest. Can anyone stoop lower?”       He was apparently referring to the claim that foundations run by the Gandhi family had received donations from the Chinese embassy.The Congress has in turn accused the BJP of resorting to diversionary ploys to deflect people’s attention from the government’s alleged failures.Responding to Nadda, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewal said, “Dear Nadda ji. Please don’t be ‘peeved’! Simply ask Modi ji to provide info on nearly Rs 10,000 cr received in PM CARES. Give names of ‘donors’ (including Chinese co’s) and details of expenditure. Get it audited by CAG. ‘Reason and transparency’ is the solution, not ‘rage and irritation’.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naddas-prince-of-incompetence-barb-at-rahul-for-his-swipe-at-pm-cares-fund-127460

Too much building activities go against the idea”, Banerjee said.The CM was answering questions on the violent incidents that took place in the university today when local people allegedly backed by the leaders of the state’s ruling TMC disrupted the university authorities’ attempt to erect a wall around the ground where the annual “Poush Mela” fair was traditionally held.Besides driving away the construction workers, the crowd also ransacked material stockpiled for the work and brought down two entry gates of the university using a payloader machine belonging to the construction company entrusted the work of building the wall.According to an eyewitness, tension has been building up in the area since Saturday when the work for the wall first started.Today, Visva Bharati Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty, accompanied by his colleagues and private security guards, landed up in the ground and asked the contractor to start the work with them standing as guards against any possible disruption.However, soon members of the local business association started gathering at the site in strength and started ransacking the place.Naresh Bauri, TMC MLA from Dubrajpur, was present during the incident. When contacted by this reporter, Bauri said he was opposing the construction of the wall since it would give the central university the appearance of a caged institution.The V-C’s frantic call to the chief minister, chief secretary, home secretary and district superintendent of police – in the wake of the violence – went unanswered.He then called up Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar for help. It took some effort for the Governor also to get the CM on phone. But he did finally manage to speak to her.“Just had word with Chief Minister over Visva Bharati worsening law and order scenario. She has assured that administration will take all steps to restore law and order. Am sure those enjoined with task will rise to the occasion”, Dhankhar tweeted after speaking to the CM.A senior faculty member of the university told this reporter that they were expecting temporary closure of the university to be announced.“Though the university is open from the last two months, no academic activity has been going on and hostels are all empty in view of the situation arising out of the pandemic,” he said.Bidyut Chakraborty, who took over as vice-chancellor of the central university in November 2018, had earlier ordered that “Poush Mela”, a century old carnival that drew hordes of tourists and provided income to local people, would not be held any more.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-opposes-erection-of-controversial-wall-at-visva-bharati-127455

17-08-2020||New Delhi||Legendary classical vocalist Pandit Jasraj dies at 90||Indian classical music doyen Pandit Jasraj died on Monday following a cardiac arrest at his home in New Jersey, his daughter Durga Jasraj said. He was 90.The classical vocalist, who infused life into the most complex ragas and held audiences spellbound with his craft, leaves behind a storied legacy spanning more than eight decades.He is survived by his wife Madura, son Shaarang Dev Pandit and daughter Durga Jasraj, both musicians.“Bapuji is no more,” his daughter Durga told PTI over phone from Mumbai. She was inconsolable and could not speak any more.Pandit Jasraj, who belonged to the Mewati Gharana and was one of India’s greatest music legends, was in the US when the coronavirus-led lockdown happened and decided to stay back in that country.Demonstrating his ability to adapt with the times, his last performance was in April this year. He sang on Hanuman Jayanti for the Sankat Mochan Hanuman temple in Varanasi through Facebook Live.“With profound grief we inform that Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj ji breathed his last this morning at 5.15 EST due to a cardiac arrest at his home in New Jersey, USA,” a statement issued by his family said here.“May Lord Krishna welcome him lovingly through the doors of heaven, where Pandit ji will now sing Om Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya exclusively just for his beloved Lord. We pray that his soul rests in eternal musical peace. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers,” it said.Among those who mourned the death of the world renowned maestro were President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Music legend and unparalleled classical vocalist Pandit Jasraj’s passing makes me sad. Spanning a distinguished career of over 8 decades, Pandit Jasraj, a Padma Vibhushan recipient, enthralled people with soulful renditions. Condolence to his family, friends & music connoisseurs,” the president said on Twitter.The prime minister added that his unfortunate demise “leaves a deep void in the Indian cultural sphere”.“Not only were his renditions outstanding, he also made a mark as an exceptional mentor to several other vocalists.

I suggest everyone do it. I am walking with time and that’s what one should do. I don’t like when people say ‘Woh zamaana achha tha’ (Those were the good times).“I believe the current phase is good. One should not compare it with the past—good or bad. One has to walk with time and only then you will like the current time,” he had told PTI in an interview.The classical music stalwart had also spoken about his eclectic taste in music and fondness for melody queen Lata Mangeshkar.“I listen to western music, African music and also cinema music.

17-08-2020||New Delhi||Whole Shaheen Bagh protest scripted by BJP: AAP||The AAP on Monday claimed the entire Shaheen Bagh protest was “scripted by the BJP” and its leadership dictated each and every move of the agitators for electoral benefits in Delhi polls, drawing a rebuttal from the saffron party.AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj made the claim a day after several members of the minority Muslim community from Shaheen Bagh area, which was the centre of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests here, joined the BJP.                      Bhardwaj alleged the BJP’s campaign for the Delhi election centred around the Shaheen Bagh protests and it was the only party that benefited from the controversy surrounding the agitation.“Delhi Assembly election could have been fought on the issue of education, health, environment or other developmental narratives. But the Delhi BJP chose to fight the election on the issue of Shaheen Bagh,” he told a press conference.                        “The whole Shaheen Bagh protest was scripted by the BJP. The topmost leadership of the BJP scripted each and every step of these protests,” he alleged.“They decided who will speak what, who will attack whom and then who will be doing the counterattack. All these things were pre-planned and well-scripted,” Bharadwaj claimed.He said the key people behind the Shaheen Bagh protest joined the BJP on Sunday in the presence of the senior leadership of the party.“Today the question is: does the BJP want to give a message that the people who used to raise anti-national slogans will now be part of the BJP?” he asked.Bhardwaj claimed that in Delhi, the BJP’s vote percentage rose from 18 to 38 due to the Shaheen Bagh protests and the controversy surrounding it.“Due to this protest, BJP polarised north-east Delhi, won some seats and then engineered a riot,” Bhardwaj charged.His allegations drew a rebuttal from Manoj Tiwari, the chief of Delhi BJP when these protests happened, who said his party does not discriminate on the basis of religion, caste, creed or lineage.“Now the confusion is getting cleared and Muslim brothers and sisters want to walk with the BJP...Stop dividing Arvind Kejriwal ji. The world’s largest party BJP represents all religions and does not discriminate on the basis of religion, caste, creed or lineage,” Tiwari said in a tweet in Hindi.

While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,” a Facebook spokesperson said.The comments came as the ruling BJP and opposition Congress traded barbs over Facebook’s alleged bias.While BJP accused the social media giant of censoring nationalist voices, opposition Congress seized on a Wall Street Journal report that alleged that Facebook’s content policies favour the ruling party. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-policies-without-regard-to-party-affiliation-facebook-127437

CTA deputy speaker Acharya Yeshi Phunsok said in a statement that this was not the first time that a Chinese spy had been sent to snoop on the Dalai Lama.  “The Chinese had come here for trade but were involved in spying over the Dalai Lama and was involved in illegal activities in India. We are already alert about Chinese spies. Whenever we organise a programme, Chinese spies come in the form of media personnel. Although we know about them, we cannot action against them as they have valid visa from the government of India,” he said, but he gave no specific instances of such past attempts at espionage nor offered any evidence to corroborate the claim. “We do not know what damage the arrested spy has done to India and the security of the Dalai Lama. We and the Indian government are already alert on the security of the Dalai Lama. It was good that the Chinese spy has been arrested. We the Tibetans living in exile never trust Chinese nationals. Whenever they come, we thoroughly scrutinise their identities. The Indian government should also not trust the Chinese nationals. I hope the arrest of spy comes as eye opener for Indian government,” he said.The Dalai Lama current has two levels of security---in addition to his personal security, he has a unit of the Himachal Police headed by an officer of the Deputy Superintendent of Police guard him.Kangra Superintendent of Police Vimukt Ranjan said he had no information from Delhi Police about the arrest of a Chinese spy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arrest-of-chinese%C2%A0spy%C2%A0in-delhi-raises-concerns-about-dalai-lamas-security-127431
17-08-2020||New Delhi||Some Delhi hospitals seeing COVID re-emergence in recovered patients||Some hospitals in the national capital have said they are seeing recovered coronavirus patients returning to them with recurrence of the infection.Earlier this month, the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital saw two instances of patients with relapse of coronavirus, almost one-and-a-half months after they were cured of the infection. In both the instances of relapse, the patients had moderate symptoms.Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka had also reported a case where a cancer patient recovered from coronavirus and contracted the disease again after a couple of months. The second time proved fatal for the patient who succumbed to the virus.Last month, the case of a Delhi policeman having a relapse of the novel coronavirus had emerged which had left experts baffled.In the same month, a similar case had surfaced in the national capital after a nurse employed at a civic-run dedicated COVID-19 hospital had tested positive again after recovering from the contagious disease.According to Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the Delhi government-run hospital, unless the virus is cultured or gene sequencing done, it will be difficult to determine whether it is a different strain of the virus that has infected the person the second time.“There can be a relapse. The virus can be isolated from the body particularly from the sputum. We have the evidence that after ninth or tenth day the virus becomes non-infectious and the patients are not tested again,” he said.“However, the virus has been reported to be living in patients who have recovered around 39 to 40 days back,” he added.Dr Chandragouda Dodagoudar, director of medical oncology at Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, shared the case of a 65-year-old patient who had stage 2 lymphoma. The patient first visited the health facility in March and was advised chemotherapy but was very apprehensive due to the coronavirus disease.“The patient delayed the treatment for two and a half months and took alternative medicines and when that medication did not work and she started having pain, she visited the hospital. She had contracted COVID-19 by then and the lymphoma had progressed from Stage 2 to Stage 4. We could not administer chemotherapy while she was undergoing COVID treatment,” he said.The doctor said after the patient recovered from coronavirus, she was administered a slight dose of chemotherapy and became better and was discharged. But after a month, she had a relapse of COVID and ended up in a critical condition and succumbed last month.The senior doctor said the patient did not have any other co-morbidities but called cancer a “co-morbidity”.Sherwal said patients with weak immunity are likely to get re-infection. “It can be there in any of the patients, cancer patients, HIV patients, etc,” he said.He added that immunocompromised patients are at more risk if they do not take precautions like wearing of masks and washing hands frequently.

In the process the DRI sleuths arrested three persons, they informed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dri-busts-mumbai-hyderabad-drug-ring-seizes-250-kg-banned-substances-127426
17-08-2020||Beijing||China says ready to properly address differences with India||China said on Monday that it was ready to work with India to enhance political mutual trust, properly manage their differences and safeguard the long-term development of bilateral ties.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this at a regular briefing when a Western media journalist sought China’s reaction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks that the Indian armed forces have given a befitting reply to those challenging the country’s sovereignty.Modi, in his 74th Independence Day address to the nation from the ramparts of Red Fort, said the armed forces have given a befitting reply to those challenging the country’s sovereignty “from LoC to LAC”, in a veiled reference to Pakistan and China.“From LoC (Line of Control) to LAC (Line of Actual Control), anyone who casts an eye on the sovereignty of the country, the armed forces have responded in the language they understand,” Modi said.Modi’s comments came amid India’s bitter border row with China along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and rise in incidents of ceasefire violations along the LoC with Pakistan in the last few months.Responding to the question, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao said that “we have noted Prime Minister Modi’s speech.”               “We are close neighbours, we are emerging countries with over one billion people. So, the sound development of bilateral ties not only serves the interest of the two peoples but also stability, peace, prosperity of the region and the whole world,” he said.“The right path for the two sides is to respect and support each other as this serves our long-term interests,” Zhao said.“So, China stands ready to work with India to enhance our political mutual trust, properly manage our differences, step-up practical cooperation and safeguard the long-term development of bilateral ties,” the spokesman added. In his speech, Prime Minister Modi also said that “whether it is terrorism or expansionism, India is fighting both with determination.”                Referring to the Galwan Valley clashes in eastern Ladakh in June, the prime minister said respect for India’s sovereignty is supreme and the world has seen in Ladakh what its brave jawans can do to maintain this resolve.“I salute all those brave soldiers from the Red Fort,” Modi said, adding the whole country is united in protecting the sovereignty of the country.Twenty Indian army personnel were killed during the clashes on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-ready-to-properly-address-differences-with-india-127419

New facts are emerging exposing its close ties with the BJP,” said Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera.The issue became a political slugfest and the BJP’s side was given by Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and former Union Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. Prasad counterattacked by seeking details of the UPA government’s ties with Cambridge Analytica, a company alleged to have siphoned personal data from Facebook in a commercial deal. There were unverified reports that then Congress President Rahul Gandhi had met Analytica’s chief to harvest the data for elections.Facebook has denied the allegations. “While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,” said a company spokesperson.India is a major Facebook market and its sister concern WhatsApp’s payments plans are awaiting final clearance from the RBI after having been restricted to a pilot project for over two years. The company has suffered a blow in Brazil where the same app was suspended after an initial run.The Facebook India chief’s post has seen turbulence for the past few years. The last chief, Umang Bedi, left after 18 months with the company, after taking over from Kirthiga Reddy who had held the post for five years that spanned both the UPA and NDA regimes. The company remained headless for a year after Bedi left and Mohan took over.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hate-speech-row-facing-life-threat-top-facebook-executive-in-delhi-files-fir-127405

Condolences to the family of Satyamev Ji,” he said in a tweet.The Uttar Pradesh police have invoked the stringent National Security Act against four persons in connection with the village head’s killing, which had triggered mob violence.Satyamev (42), a Dalit and the head of Basgaon village in the Tarwan area of Azamgarh district, was shot dead last week.In a Facebook post in Hindi, Priyanka Gandhi also hit out at the Uttar Pradesh government over the issue of security of women.“Bulandshahr, Hapur, Lakhimpur Kheri and now Gorakhpur. Such repeated incidents have proven that the Uttar Pradesh government has completely failed in providing security to women,” the Congress general secretary said, referring to reports of crimes against women in these areas.There was no fear of law in the minds of criminals in Uttar Pradesh, she said, adding that as a result, gruesome incidents of crime were taking place against women.The police and administration were neither able to provide security nor take appropriate action, Priyanka Gandhi alleged.“The Uttar Pradesh government should review the law-and-order system and take every step to ensure the safety of women,” she said.The Congress has been alleging that the law-and-order situation is deteriorating in Uttar Pradesh under the BJP rule, a charge denied by the state dispensation.

17-08-2020||New Delhi||JEE (Main), NEET next month as SC declines plea for postponement||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking postponement of JEE (Main) April 2020 and NEET-Undergraduate examinations, which are scheduled to be conducted in September, amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying the precious year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said career of students “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.“Life has to go on. Life has to move ahead. Precious year of students cannot be wasted,” the bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murari, said during the hearing conducted through video conferencing while paving the way for the commencement of the exams as scheduled.Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta told the Apex Court that due precautions and all safeguards would be taken while conducting these examinations.The counsel appearing for the petitioners told the bench that lakhs of students were looking towards the top court for relief and they were only seeking postponement of these exams.The plea, filed by 11 students belonging to 11 states, had sought quashing of the July 3 notices issued by the National Testing Agency (NTA), by which it was decided to conduct the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) April 2020 and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-Undergraduate exams in September.As per the public notices issued by the NTA, JEE (Main) April 2020 is scheduled from September 1 to 6, while NEET-UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.The plea, filed through advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, had referred to COVID-19 pandemic and said authorities be directed to conduct these exams only after normalcy was restored.The plea had also sought a direction to the authorities to increase the number of examination centres.“Conducting the aforesaid examination across India at such perilous time is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death. The best recourse at this stage can be to wait for some more time, let COVID-19 crisis subside and then only conduct these exams, in order to save lives of the students and their parents,” the plea had said.It had claimed that the NTA, which conducts entrance exams for admission in higher educational institutions in India, has decided to conduct JEE (Main) April-2020 through online mode and NEET UG-2020 exams through offline mode at 161 centres across the country.It had alleged that NTA has indefinitely postponed the National Council of Hotel Management Joint Entrance Examination-2020, which was scheduled to be conducted on June 22, in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The plea had also alleged that authorities concerned have ignored the plight of lakhs of students from Bihar, Assam and northeastern states, which are presently reeling under flood, and conducting either online or offline exams in such places may not be possible.

Do not misuse Article 32 like this," a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra told petitioner Anshul Gupta."We are already hearing the matter. Not inclined to entertain this," said the Bench dismissing the PIL.In an affidavit filed in the court, Reliance Jio said spectrum sharing with RComm didn't fasten liability for past dues.The DoT didn't raise any claims against Reliance Jio, which was not a party to AGR case, it said, adding RCom had already submitted bank guarantee towards the dues.Spectrum Sharing Guidelines didn't make any provision for sharing of liabilities, it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agr-case-sc-asks-centre-to-spell-out-stand-on-reliance-jio-sharing-rcomm-spectrum-127385

In that connection, they agreed to undertake necessary measures to timely address problems and obstacles in the course of implementation,” it said.The Nepal-India Oversight Mechanism was set up after Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Nepal in September 2016 to oversee the implementation of bilateral projects and take necessary steps for their completion in time.“India and Nepal have agreed to hold the next meeting of the mechanism on a mutually convenient date to review the progress made in the implementation of the India assisted economic and development cooperation projects,” it added.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.In June, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.In its reaction, after Nepal’s lower house of parliament approved the Bill, India termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India.

The ruling YSRCP was using illegal tactics to protect and preserve its power by intimidating and blackmailing the opponents and dissenting voices. These illegal activities were posing a serious threat to the right to privacy in the state,” Naidu said in the letter.Naidu also wrote that even private individuals were using cutting edge technology and equipment to unlawfully tap phones.“If these nefarious activities were not put to an end, they would proliferate and emerge as a bigger threat to national security and the sovereignty of the country as a whole. If the governments and private persons involved in such illegal activities were not restrained, they would attack and undermine the democratic institutions that were painstakingly built over decades of hard work in the country,” Naidu added.As per the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (Sec 5 (2)) and the Information Technology Act 2000 (Sec 69), phone tapping is to be strictly used only in times of a threat to national security or the country’s sovereignty or to national integration or when friendly relations with foreign countries are under threat.Naidu said systematic attacks were made on the State Election Commission (SEC), Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) and other institutions. Threats were being issued to Opposition leaders, judges, media, social activists and all those who raised a dissenting voice against the ruling party’s excesses, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrababu-naidu-accuses-andhra-pradesh-cm-of-phone-tapping-seeks-pms-intervention-127371

17-08-2020||Washington||Trump has hit the right chord with India, Indian-Americans, say his campaign officials||US President Donald Trump has hit the right chord with India by standing up to China and never intervening in the Kashmir issue, officials of his presidential campaign have asserted.Seeking re-election for a second consecutive term, Trump, 74, is pitted against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, 77, in the November 3 presidential elections.Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US, there was a record drop in unemployment rate of Indian-Americans under the Trump administration, his Indian-American supporters said.Trump elevated India's stature on the world stage, stood up to China in support of India and had never intervened in the Kashmir issue, they claimed."In a nutshell, Trump has hit the right chord with India and Indian-Americans," said Al Mason, the co-chair for the Trump Victory Indian-American Finance Committee and for the recently created Indian Voices for Trump.The Trump campaign's strong pitch that he is the best bet for the community and India-US relationship for the next four years comes on the eve of the Democratic National Convention that would for the first time nominate an Indian-American and an African-American, Senator Kamala Harris, as the party's vice-presidential candidate.Born to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, California senator Harris, 55, if elected, would be second in line of succession after Biden."The choice for Indian-Americans is clear this fall, four more years for Trump/Pence (Vice President Mike Pence)," said Harmeet Kaur Dhillon, an eminent Indian-American lawyer and a senior Republican Party leader from California.Dhillon is also the co-chair for Indian Voices for Trump by the Trump Campaign."President Trump has been a great friend to India, with historic warmth and feeling between the two allies, and that will only continue in the next four years. President Trump is also a friend of religious liberty, very important to the diaspora Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims who came here from India," Dhillon said.Prior to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the unemployment rate among Indian-Americans dropped by nearly 33.33 per cent, a senior official of the Trump administration told PTI.The unemployment rate for Indian-Americans dropped from 4.1 per cent in 2015 to a record low of 2.5 per cent in 2019, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics."Indian-Americans are arguably the group that have most benefited from America's freedoms which include free markets, freedom to pursue happiness and freedom to aspire and strive for the best life possible. Also, personal freedom to practise one's religion,” Mrinalini Kumari, co-chair of the Indian Voices for Trump, said.Employment among Indian-Americans increased from 2.1 million in 2016 to an all-time high of 2.5 million in 2019, according to the latest figures from the Department of Labour.Indian-American members of the Trump campaign attribute this to the economic policies of his administration."The Indian-American community is filled with hard-working achievers who create jobs, technology, and small businesses, all of which have thrived thanks to Trump," Dhillon said."In addition to these economic metrics, the administration's focus on equal opportunity as opposed to quotas has ensured educational and job opportunities for Indian-American students and workers," Dhillon said.Referring to his recent survey in battleground states, Mason said Indian-Americans feel respected and acknowledged for the first time by a US president."No other US President has ever given the respect to an Indian Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) or to India, as much as President Trump has," he said."President Trump has elevated India's stature on the world stage. Of course, credit also goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his smart policy towards the US. The India-US relationship has never been stronger, and the Indian-American community in the US largely credits both Trump and Modi for deepening the ties between the two countries," Mason said.

Its paper ‘National Health Stack: Strategy and Approach’, which is the basis for the mission, has a foreword by Member Health VK Paul who says, “NHS is capable of integrating future IT solutions for a sector poised for rapid, disruptive changes and unforeseen twists. It is now conceivable to aim for digital health records for all citizens by 2022.”The mission proposes national health electronic registries to create a single source for health information and manage master health data of the nation and personal health records to allow “consent-based flow of citizens’ health records to stakeholders who require this information to deliver value added services to users”.Data to be securedFor privacy, direct access will be prohibited, sensitive data will be encrypted.IDs will store data related to medical history, allergies, immunisation status, etc“Personal health record refers to the integrated view of the data related to an individual across various health providers... the record is maintained in a secure and private environment,” government sources say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/digital-health-ids-for-all-citizens-by-2022-127303

17-08-2020||New Delhi||Biden: Will stand by India to counter border threat||US presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said if elected, his administration will stand with India to counter any threat it may face in the region or along its borders.Read also: Biden also backed India’s no-tolerance approach to cross-border terrorism and pledged to rescind the “harmful policy” of placing restrictions on the movement of skilled persons from India by removing caps on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) graduates. He said he would take steps to reform the H-1B visa system, work towards eliminating the country-quota for Green Cards and ensure prompt issuance of religious worker visas from reputed organisations. Biden made the declaration while appearing with his vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris and several aides, including three — Richard Verma, Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken — tipped for weighty positions, in an hour-long webinar on India’s Independence Day.In a three-minute video, he introduced Harris as a “dear friend, smart, tested and prepared,” adding that “it’s your story too”. Harris recalled that she had picked up values from her mother Shyamala, who instilled in her the obligation to do something for society. “That’s how she marched and shouted during the civil rights movement, inspired by Martin Luther King, who was in turn inspired by Gandhi. There she met my father. And the rest is history.” Harris recalled how her mother frequently took her and her sister Maya back to Madras “so that we understood where we came from and wanted to instil in us love for good idly”.Though the focus was on Biden’s brief observations on India’s security imperatives, both he and Harris tried to broaden their appeal to the entire South Asian diaspora. Harris specifically called for South Asians to stand together as they had the common experience of suffering from colonialism and discrimination.During the bulk of the address, Biden, Harris and their aides spoke on more existential issues for the coloured community, including stemming the tide of hate and bigotry, addressing the security needs of their houses of worship, streamlining the processing for religious worker visas and eliminating language barriers for the Indian-American community.But Biden also reminded the Indian-Americans that he had been advocating strong friendship with India since his days as Senator. “Our government will reflect the diversity of the United States, and Indian-American voices will be included in shaping the policies that impact their communities,” he promised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-will-stand-by-india-to-counter-border-threat-127204
