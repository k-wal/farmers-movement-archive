To term the protests political is a big insult to the food-growers of the country. The Modi government should shed arrogance and follow the Raj Dharma,” he said.“It is wrong to say that the farmers’ agitation is limited to Punjab and Haryana. The entire country is affected by these three black agri laws. In Madhya Pradesh, due to decrease in the business volume at the mandis, the tax collection of the board in one year has gone down from Rs 1,200 crore to Rs 220 crore,” Surjewala also said in a tweet in Hindi.Citing a media report, he said 47 mandis and 298 sub-mandis have been closed in Madhya Pradesh alone after the farm laws were enacted.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also took a swipe at the government saying if it was terming the protesters Khalistanis, Maoists and agents of Pakistan and China, then why was it engaging them in talks.“Ministers have described the protesters against the farm laws as Khalistanis; agents of Pakistan and China; Maoists; and, the latest, tukde tukde gang.    “If you exhaust all these categories, it means there are no farmers among the thousands of protesters. If there are no farmers, why is the government talking to them,” he asked on Twitter.Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the government over rising petrol prices, alleging the money earned from the tax on petrol is going in the Central Vista project, on buying a new aircraft for the prime minister and on promotional advertisements. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/terming-farmers-protest-political-insult-to-food-growers-of-the-country-congress-183853
13-12-2020||Mumbai||BJP remained busy trying to topple Maharashtra govt: CM Thackeray||On the eve of the winter session of Maharashtra legislature, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday attacked the BJP for accusing his government of “non-performance”, saying the Opposition party was “so busy” trying to “topple” his government that it failed to notice various welfare measures being undertaken.Addressing a press conference, Thackeray hit out at Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis for his remarks of “an undeclared Emergency” in the state.“If there is an undeclared Emergency in Maharashtra, then is there a declared Emergency in the rest of the country given the manner in which the protesting farmers are being targeted on the outskirts of Delhi?” Thackeray asked.He questioned whether “pouring water on farmers (use of water cannons) in biting cold is a sign of harmony?”                Without taking names, the CM, who also heads Shiv Sena, criticised the attempts to “discredit” the protests by farmers.“The BJP should decide whether protesters have support from Pakistan, China or Maoists. You bring sugar and onions from Pakistan. Now farmers are also coming from Pakistan,” he said sarcastically.Union minister Piyush Goyal on Saturday said the agitation no longer remains a farmers’ movement as it has been “infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements” demanding the release of those put behind bars for “anti-national activities”.This was clearly to derail agriculture reforms brought by the government, he said.Another BJP leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve, who hails from Maharashtra, recently stirred a controversy with his remarks that China and Pakistan were behind the protests being staged by cultivators, inviting sharp reactions from various quarters.“If Fadnavis says the state government taking action against its critics is causing undeclared emergency then labelling farmers who are fighting for their rights as anti-nationals is worse than Emergency,” Thackeray said.He said those who dub ‘annadatas’ (farmers) terrorists are not entitled to be called humans.“The BJP has been so busy trying to destabilise the state government that it had no time to go through the work done by us in the last one year. There is no disillusionment among people about the MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government,” he said.Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, Fadnavis accused the government of imposing an “undeclared Emergency” and criticised the Uddhav Thackeray-led regime for “going after” Republic TV’s Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami and Bollywood actress Kanagana Ranaut.Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said Fadnavis looked “demoralised” while addressing the presser.“The MVA won the recently-held Legislative Council polls held for Graduates and Teachers constituencies, which is a proof that people are satisfied with the government’s performance. In these polls, the BJP even lost the Nagpur Graduates seat which it never lost in the last five decades,” he said.Pawar said the names sent to state Governor B S Koshyari for nomination on 12 Legislative Council seats through the governor’s quota be filled in a specific timeframe.“We agree to the governor’s discretion and powers but there should be a timeframe for filling these seats,” the deputy CM said when asked about the pending approval of the governor. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-remained-busy-trying-to-topple-maharashtra-govt-cm-thackeray-183852
13-12-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear on Dec 16 plea seeking removal of farmers protesting at Delhi borders||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on December 16 a plea seeking a direction to authorities to immediately remove the farmers who are protesting at several border points of Delhi against three new farm laws, saying commuters are facing hardships due to the road blockades and the gatherings might lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.According to the apex court website, a Bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian will hear the plea filed by law student Rishabh Sharma, who has also sought directions to authorities to open the roads at Delhi’s borders, shift the protesters to the allotted place and provide guidelines on social distancing and use of masks at the protest site in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.The petition has claimed that the Delhi Police had, on November 27, allowed the protesters to hold a demonstration peacefully at the Nirankari ground in Burari here, but despite that, they have blocked the borders of the national capital.“Because of the ongoing protest at Delhi’s borders, the roads have been blocked by the protesters and the border points have been closed, which have affected vehicular traffic and people who are travelling to and from Delhi to get medical treatment in reputed government/private hospitals,” the plea, filed through advocate Om Prakash Parihar, said.It referred to the October 7 order of the top court, delivered on a petition against the blockade of a road in the Shaheen Bagh area here by those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which said public spaces cannot be occupied indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be staged at designated places alone.Referring to the COVID-19 guidelines issued by the government, the plea said despite the advisories not to hold large gatherings amid the pandemic, lakhs of farmers have assembled at Delhi’s borders and this might lead to an increase in the number of coronavirus cases.“It is pertinent to note that in view of the prevention of the community spread of the pandemic disease coronavirus (COVID-19), it is very necessary to remove the gatherings and this protest is further blocking the roads for all the emergency/medical services, which are very much required to be supplied within the territory of Delhi in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus.“The petitioner is seeking an urgent direction from this court for immediate removal/dispersal of such mass gathering of protesters at the Delhi borders and shift them to the place already allotted by the Delhi Police in view of an immediate threat of the coronavirus infection and spread,” the plea said.It added that the protesters can continue to protest peacefully after the threat of the coronavirus is over and keeping in view that the number of COVID cases is increasing, it is paramount that the protest be stopped immediately.The plea said due to the ongoing protests, traffic movement has been disrupted at several border points of the national capital as the police have kept key routes connecting Delhi to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh closed in view of the agitation.At least five rounds of formal talks have taken place between the Centre and the representatives of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, but the deadlock has continued with the unions sticking to their main demand for a repeal of the three contentious laws and repeatedly rejecting the government’s offer to make certain changes in the legislations and give written assurances or clarifications on a few issues such as the minimum support price (MSP) and the “mandi” (wholesale market) system. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-on-dec-16-plea-seeking-removal-of-farmers-protesting-at-delhi-borders-183851

Naravane’s visit to the Gulf region comes days after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s trips to Bahrain and the UAE during which he called on top leaders of the two countries.In the last few years, India’s ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE have witnessed a major upswing. Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone.In October, Gen. Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-general-naravane-holds-talks-with-royal-saudi-land-forces-commander-on-defence-cooperation-183849
13-12-2020||New Delhi||Tomar targets Oppn parties over farmers’ stir, says it has become their nature to oppose||As farmers’ protest entered the third week, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday accused Opposition parties of running a propaganda against the new farm laws and asserted that these legislations “may cause difficulty for some in the short term” but will be beneficial to farmers in the long run.Tomar, who is leading negotiations with the 40 protesting farmer unions to break the deadlock, was addressing a delegation of over 100 farmers from Uttarakhand who came to extend their support to the laws.Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary and Uttarakhand Education Minister Arvind Pandey were present in the meeting.Addressing the delegation, Tomar said the government faced opposition when it revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. It also faced opposition when it brought the amended citizenship law as well as over the Ram temple issue.“When the agricultural reforms were brought, there was opposition to this too.... There are some people who just oppose and weaken the country. This has become their nature,” the agriculture minister said.On agricultural sector reforms, the discussion has been going on for last many years, Tomar said.“Unfortunately the previous governments who wanted to reform were not able to it...,” he added.Tomar stressed that for a new India, reforms are necessary.“When reforms are undertaken it will benefit farmers in the long run. But in the short run, some may face difficulty. We know we can achieve no gain without difficulties,” the minister said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn’t bring reform or schemes for the sake of current impact alone but for long-term benefit, Tomar said.“Any good government or good leader is one who does such work that not only ensures the country’s safety for now but also boosts growth in the next hundred years,” the minister said.The prime minister has fulfilled the long-pending demand of farmers, Tomar said.Farmers’ leaders like Sharad Joshi of Shetkari Sangathan, Punjab’s Bhupinder Mann, NCP chief Sharad Pawar have been talking about these issues, he said, adding that agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan too raised this issue.National Farmers Commission, Planning Commission and Niti Aayog also raised these issues but the previous governments did not do, he said.“Manmohan Singh Ji (former Prime Minister) tried many times but could not do. Today when it is implemented, propaganda is being spread,” Tomar said.The delegation of farmers had come from Bajpur, the Assembly Constituency of the Uttarkhand Education Minister. Only half of the 300-odd farmers were able to reach Tomar’s residence and the rest were stuck in traffic.Speaking to PTI, the Uttarakhand Education Minister said farmers in Uttarakhand are in support of the farm laws enacted by the central government.He, however, did not respond to a question about when the state government would notify these laws.“The farmers protesting at borders here are our brothers. But they are misled by some force. We want some early solution,” he said.Asked if the entire state’s farmers are in support of the laws, he said, “Our farmers in Uttarakhand are aware of the benefits of the laws, but the Opposition out there is instigating them. For the first time since Independence, this government has given freedom to farmers.” Further, the minister said paddy farmers of one block in Uttarakhand cannot sell their produce in another block because people associated with mandi and police catch and put them in jail.“This government has given freedom to farmers through these new farm laws. They can now sell their produce wherever they get better price in any corner of the country,” he added.Charanjeet Singh, a farmer with 10-12 acres of land from Bajpur assembly constituency, said, “Farmers protesting at borders are misled. Past governments could not bring reforms, which Modiji has dared to bring in agriculture. There might be some gaps, which can be addressed. It is not right to seek repeal of the laws.”There should be consultation to improve the new laws further, but it should not be scrapped altogether, he said.Asked if he was able to sell this year’s kharif paddy at minimum support price (MSP), he said, “This is an issue in Uttarakhand. Only 10 per cent of our produce is purchased at MSP from us. How much the government can buy? I feel these laws are good as they give freedom to sell outside mandis.”Farmer unions, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for last 18 days seeking repeal of the three farm laws.At least five round of talks between the Centre and 40 farmer unions’ leaders held so far have remained inconclusive. The government has sent a draft proposal along with written assurance of MSP to them for consideration, but farmer unions have rejected it and intensified their protest.

13-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ stir: Kejriwal says will fast on Monday, requests Centre to shun ego and scrap agri laws||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he will observe a day-long fast on Monday in response to a call given by farmers protesting against three new farm laws, and appealed to the BJP-ruled Centre to shun ego and scrap the legislations.Addressing a virtual press briefing on Sunday, the chief minister asked the Centre bring a Bill to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce.Kejriwal said he will hold one-day fast on Monday in response to a call given by the agitating farmers and urged his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteers, supporters as well as the people of the country to join in.“I want to appeal to the central government to put an end to their ego. The governments are formed by the public, the public is not formed by the governments. The three farm laws should be immediately repealed and a Bill should be brought to guarantee MSP to farmers,” he said.The chief minister said the Centre should immediately accept all demands of the farmers who have been protesting on Delhi’s borders for the past two weeks.Kejriwal expressed anguish that some central ministers and BJP leaders were labelling protesting farmers as “traitors and anti-nationals”.“I want to ask them, if so many ex-servicemen, national and international sportspersons, singers and celebrities, lawyers and traders supporting and joining them, are all anti-national,” he questioned.The BJP should not think wrongly that only a few farmers from Punjab and Haryana and only a few people are in this movement.Kejriwal compared the “defaming” of the farmers protest with the Anna Hazare’s movement of which he was a top leader.“I could not help but reminisce the days of Anna Hazare Ji’s movement. The Congress government defamed us as anti-nationals. What Congress did to our movement, the BJP is doing the same to the farmers protest,” he said.The chief minister claimed that even the middle-upper class people were against the farm laws and believed it will lead to price rise.“Until now, hoarding in this country was a crime, but under the Centre’s new farm laws any person can hoard any amount of grains and it is no longer considered a crime.“This also means that there will be high inflation. People can hoard till the time the inflation rate doubles every year. For instance, the prices of wheat grains will double from Rs 20 this year to Rs 40 next year, and then Rs 80, and then Rs 160, and so on,” he added.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

There is not even the courtesy of setting out the dates as to how the files have moved, possibly because we have been directing responsibility to be fixed and costs to be recovered from such persons who are responsible for the delay,” the Bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said in its December 1 order.“We dismiss the special leave petition on the ground of delay, but for wastage of judicial time, consider appropriate to burden the petitioner with costs of Rs 15,000 to be deposited with the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Welfare Fund,” the Bench said.It said the cost be recovered from the officers responsible for the delay in the filing of the appeal in the top court.“Thus, we are once again faced with a matter so as to obtain a certificate of dismissal and such cases we have categorised as ‘certificate cases’, brought before this court only to put a quietus to the matter and not fix the responsibility on the officers who are responsible for the situation,” the bench noted.The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by the state against the October 2018 order of a division bench of the Allahabad High Court.The Division Bench of the high court had dismissed the state’s appeal against the January 2018 order passed by a single-judge bench, which had directed the department concerned to regularise the service of a man. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-imposes-cost-of-rs-15-000-on-uttar-pradesh-government-for-wasting-judicial-time-183836

This is not the first instance. Earlier also such activities have been undertaken by IRCTC to promote government welfare schemes in public interest,” an official statement from IRCTC said.“IRCTC sent out 1.9 crore emails in five days till October 12,” a source in the national transporter said.Officials also said that the move to send out the emails was a conscious choice as part of a communication strategy for public interest.“Which professional company or corporate doesn’t analyse the demographic profile of the audience where the communication is to be delivered to? Why are some surprised if a government organisation is able to do as much or even better than what the corporates do day in and day out? One should be happy that the government of the day is as good in disseminating information in public interest,” said an official.The booklet speaks of the justice given to the 1984 riot victims, FCRA registration granted to Sri Harmandir Sahib, Jallianwala Bagh Memorial, no taxes on langar, the Kartarpur corridor among other things under 13 heads.The booklet was released by Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Hardeep Singh Puri on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti on December 1.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.The Centre’s offer to amend the contentious laws has failed to cut ice with the protesting farmers who have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the legislations. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/irctc-sends-out-nearly-2-crore-emails-in-5-days-highlighting-modis-relationship-with-sikhs-183832

13-12-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Fear of mystery disease keeps people away from buying fruits, vegetables||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, December 13 Fear of the mystery disease in Eluru continues to spread panic and fear in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh with the health authorities failing to pin-point the cause so far.There has been a steep fall in sale of fruit and vegetables for the past week as locals suspect these may be infected and could further spread of the disease that shows symptoms of epilepsy and fainting. The main opposition party Telugu Desam party (TDP) has meanwhile strengthened its tirade against the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) for its alleged “failure” to explain to the people what was happening. The former chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu has asked the government to act responsibly and come out with facts to remove the fears of the people. Symptoms of the mysterious illness include three to five minutes of epileptic fits without repetition, forgetfulness, anxiety, vomiting, headache and back pain. For the past four to five days, leafy vegetables and fruits have seen no buyers and people are just staying away from vendors and vegetable shops and markets out of fear. Since a lot of talk is about spray or water being the culprit behind the Eluru disease, people are not ready to take a chance by eating vegetables and fruits.  Several organisations have taken blood samples and spinal fluids from the patients, besides they have also taken samples of vegetables, rice, fish, meat and soil to ascertain the reason behind the mystery disease. So far, no conclusive results have been announced, though the government feels that the disease could have been caused by chemicals used in spray as insecticide to kill mosquitoes. Dr AVR Mohan, the Superintendent of West Godavari district hospital, said people in Eluru have been advised to wash the vegetables thoroughly with salt water before use. He said about 14 agencies were looking into the samples collected so far. He said the Union Ministry of Health and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi were also trying to find the cause of the disease and to check presence of organochlorine and organophosphates in the blood of the affected people. As of now the blood samples have shown presence of lead and nickel only in two of the 40 urine samples collected, while the National Institute of Nutrition found traces of mercury in rice and pesticides and herbicide residues in excess quantities in vegetables.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fear-of-mystery-disease-keeps-people-away-from-buying-fruits-vegetables-183830

13-12-2020||London||UK PM praises India’s ‘incredible’ solar power strides at climate summit||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the “incredible things” being done by India in the solar energy sector as he warned that the emergency facing the world from climate change was far more destructive than even the coronavirus pandemic.Johnson said this in his address to the Climate Ambition Summit this weekend, co-hosted by the UK to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement.In his speech to the virtual summit, which was earlier addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi among around 70 heads of state and government, the British prime minister reiterated the UK’s pledge to radically cut dependence on fossil fuels.“We’re going ahead with a massive solar programme, even though we can’t hope to emulate the incredible things being done by India, Australia or Morocco for instance,” he said.“Today, we’re putting our foot to the accelerator – in a carbon friendly way of course – with a Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. We want to turn the UK into the Saudi Arabia of wind power generation, enough wind power by 2030 to supply every single one of our homes with electricity… Hydro of course – we’re liberating the awesome potential of hydrogen, whether for homes or all sorts of uses,” he said.The summit, held as a precursor to the UK’s hosting of the United Nations’ COP26 summit in November 2021, included addresses urging the world’s economies to “stop the assault” on the planet and increase their ambition on cutting the greenhouse gases that drive climate change.United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned leaders that the world was heading for a “catastrophic” 3 degrees Celsius of warming, as he urged them to declare a state of climate emergency in their countries until they become carbon neutral.“Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,” said Alok Sharma, the UK’s Business Secretary and President of COP26.“But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough,” he said.Earlier on Saturday, Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would “save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs” as the UK announced an end to support for the fossil fuel sector overseas.Described as a significant move as in the last four years, the UK government supported 21 billion pounds of UK oil and gas exports through trade promotion and export finance. The new policy will be implemented after a short period of consultation and is intended to come into force as soon as possible before COP26 next year.“Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere – against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming,” said Johnson.The UK had recently also announced a new commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68 per cent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.The UK claims this means its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement is now among the highest in the world and commits the country to cutting emissions at one of the fastest rates of any major economy.

13-12-2020||Bhadohi (UP)||Man killed by wife, daughter-in-law for having illicit relation: Police||A 55-year-old man was allegedly killed by his wife and elder daughter-in-law in a village in Bhadohi district of Uttar Pradesh for having an illicit relation with his younger daughter-in-law, police said on Sunday.The incident happened in a village under Koirana police station of the district on late Saturday night when the man's wife and their elder daughter-in-law attacked him and slashed his throat with a knife, said Bhadohi Superintendent of Police Ram Badan Singh.The SP said the man was rushed to a hospital but was declared “brought dead”.The man had four sons, all living in Mumbai as migrant workers, the SP said, adding two of them were married and their wives were living in the village here with their in-laws.The man had developed an illicit relationship with his younger daughter-in-law, and this was vehemently objected to by his wife and elder daughter-in-law, who had sent the younger one to her parents' house.Infuriated over this, some time back, the man had attacked his elder daughter-in-law and damaged her eyes, said police, adding he had also turned her and his wife out of the main house, forcing them to live in another house some 100 meters away in the same street.Around four-five days ago, the man had brought back his younger daughter-in-law from her parents' place to live with him, said police.The man's wife and his elder daughter-in-law last night barged into the man's house and attacked him, following which the younger daughter-in-law fled the house and reached a police station where she told police that her mother-in-law and sister-in-law had attacked her and her father-in-law.As the police reached the man's house, they found him lying in a pool of blood with his neck slit open, said police, adding he was rushed to the district hospital but could not be saved.The SP said a preliminary probe into the matter has revealed that the deceased had illicit relation with his younger daughter-in-law.The police have registered a murder case and informed all four sons of the deceased, said the SP. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-killed-by-wife-daughter-in-law-for-having-illicit-relation-police-183812
13-12-2020||New Delhi||Absolutely no compromise in clinical testing of COVID-19 vaccines: Gagandeep Kang||Seeking to allay apprehension of people over safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, noted clinical scientist Gagandeep Kang said though vaccines for the coronavirus are being developed in a short period of time, there has been absolutely no compromise in their clinical testing.Kang, who is associated with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, a global consortium involved in facilitating vaccine candidates for the novel coronavirus, also said that there should be equitable COVID-19 vaccine access globally and domestically.Known for her inter-disciplinary research on transmission, development and prevention of infections and their sequelae in children in India, Kang is also the first Indian woman to be inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society in London.Though vaccines for the coronavirus are being developed in a “very short period of time”, all clinical phases of testing are being done, she told PTI in an interview.“What has changed is the approach to the testing where all steps that used to happen between phases of clinical trials have been cut out, which means regulators are working much longer and harder than they ever have before,” Kang said.Everybody is talking about things being done very fast but “I think it is very important to know what steps we are cutting out and quite frankly, in all of the testing of vaccines that is being done, there is no aspect of testing that is being removed from the development pathway”, she said.“I think it is very important to understand that there has been absolutely no compromise in clinical testing of COVID-19 vaccines. The only thing that we do not have from these trials, that we might have had otherwise, is the duration of safety follow-up. Generally, we follow up on trials for six months or one year, and generally, we do not find anything extra in the six months or one year,” Kang said.Kang, who was the executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) but resigned in July, said another thing that is different in the development of COVID-19 vaccines is that clinical trials have been made very large to get results faster.To a question on availability of cold chain capacity to store vaccines, she said equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines should be ensured.The case should not be that those who live in big cities, where there is better cold chain capacity, get vaccinated while those in rural areas or small towns do not get it because of lack of storage facilities, Kang said.“My worry with all of it is the question of equity, will we end up with a system where we have freezers in big cities and some classes of people can get vaccines, whereas in rural areas or small towns there is no access to these vaccines as cold chain capacity does not exist,” she said.“Even in the work that we are planning to do with the Lancet Commission, equity is a big part of looking at what services are provided to whom and where, and making sure that where you live and what your socio-economic status is does not determine what kind of services you get,” Kang said.The Lancet, a global health journal, on Friday launched the Lancet Citizens’ Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System, which will work on developing a strategy for implementing universal health coverage (UHC) in India.The journal and the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, Harvard University, together formulated the commission.Speaking about the Lancet commission, Kang said its purpose is to aim for universal health coverage to examine all health concerns, to look at mental and physical health problems and their solutions, to ensure that catastrophic health expenditure does not happen and make sure coverage is accessible and affordable.The commission is being led by four distinguished health and business leaders, including Kang and CMD Biocon Ltd Kiran Mazumdar Shaw.“If we think about Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which have a target of 2030, there is no way we can achieve these goals with the trajectory that we have at the moment. So what we are seeking to do over the next few years is to try and layout a road-map to make sure we are on a better path to achieving the SDGs,” Kang said.She said in India, out of pocket payments for healthcare continue to be highest in the world and it is one of many reasons why many families are driven into poverty. This kind of “catastrophic health expenditure” actually winds up promoting further health inequities in the system, Kang said.“We have a situation where the most vulnerable in our population don’t get services that they want and there is a problem in terms of accountability where the poor are treated as beneficiaries rather than as clients of the system, and there seems to be a lack of trust in the quality of the care that is provided by the healthcare system,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/absolutely-no-compromise-in-clinical-testing-of-covid-19-vaccines-gagandeep-kang-183811
13-12-2020||New Delhi||Average time spent on smartphone up 25% to 6.9 hrs amid pandemic: Vivo-CMR report||Average usage of smartphones by Indians is estimated to have gone up 25 per cent to almost 7 hours a day as people depend on these gadgets for work/study from home and entertainment amid the pandemic, a report said.The study, commissioned by handset maker Vivo and conducted by CMR, said the average time spent on smartphones in a day has been on the rise with average usage growing 11 per cent to 5.5 hours in March 2020 (pre-COVID) from about 4.9 hours on average in 2019.This has grown by another 25 per cent to 6.9 hours April onwards (post-COVID), the report titled 'Smartphones and their impact on human relationships 2020', said.The report noted that since lockdown, Indians have been spending more time on their smartphone for work from home (75 per cent increase), calling (63 per cent rise), and OTT (over the top services like Netflix, Spotify etc) that has seen 59 per cent growth in time spent on smartphones.There has also been a 55 per cent increase in time spent on social media, and 45 per cent rise in time spent gaming on smartphones.Interestingly, the average duration of clicking pictures and taking selfies has increased from 14 minutes to 18 minutes in a day.The study comprised 2,000 respondents aged 15-45 years across top eight cities (four metros, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune) with 70 per cent male and 30 per cent female participants.Speaking to PTI, Vivo India Director Brand Strategy Nipun Marya said the company commissioned a similar study last year as well on smartphones and their impact on human relationships."We all know smartphones are a great tool, especially in a COVID situation where we would have been rendered almost unproductive without smartphones...However, excessive usage of smartphones or anything else, when not used in moderation, that can lead to adverse effects and this is why we did the study," he explained.Marya noted that there has been an organic growth of smartphones from 2019 to 2020 but COVID has certainly accelerated some of the trends that otherwise would have grown much slowly."Overall, smartphones are a great tool but what it is leading to is a lot of addiction. For example, 84 per cent people check their phones within the first 15 minutes of waking up, and 46 per cent respondents said they pick up the phone at least five times in an hour-long conversation meeting with friends," he said.Marya said while consumption may come down from the current levels as the situation eases around the pandemic, some of these changes could be permanent.Seven in every eight respondents said people point out their usage of phones while with them.The report said people are spending more time with their family with a 26 per cent increase being seen in average time spent (from 4.4 hours pre-COVID to 5.5 hours post-COVID) but most respondents also agreed that their smartphone usage has had an impact on the quality of time spent with loved ones.About 74 per cent said they get moody and irritable when they stop using their mobile phone, while 73 per cent said they "feel compelled" to constantly check their smartphone. About 74 per cent respondents agreed that it's important for them to have a life separate from their mobile phones, about 73 per cent agreeing that they would be happier if they spent less time on their smartphones.About 70 per cent agreed that if their usage continues at the current rate or grows, it is likely to impact their mental or physical health.About 74 per cent respondents said periodically switching off mobile phone usage can actually help them spend more time with family, and 70 per cent agreed that their mobile phone usage is adversely impacting their relationships with people, especially near and dear ones."However, there is a clear gap between realising one should switch off their phones and actually turning the device off. As a brand, vivo India aims to sensitise people about the benefits of 'responsible use' of smartphones through the second edition of this study," Marya said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/average-time-spent-on-smartphone-up-25-to-6-9-hrs-amid-pandemic-vivo-cmr-report-183808
13-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt survey finds drastic rise in obesity among kids under 5 years in 20 states||The latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) has found a drastic rise in obesity among children under five years of age in 20 of the 22 states where the study was conducted, with experts attributing it to lack of physical activity and unhealthy food habits.According to the NHFS-5, several states and Union Territories, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Mizoram, Tripura, Lakshadweep, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, have registered several folds increase in the percentage of obesity among children below five years of age in comparison to NFHS-4 conducted between 2015 and 2016.Only Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu registered a drop in the number of overweight children under five years of age, the data showed.About 13.4 per cent of children under the age of five were found to be obese in Ladakh which was highest among the 22 states and Union Territories surveyed, followed by Lakshadweep at 10.5 per cent, Mizoram 10 per cent, Jammu and Kashmir, and Sikkim 9.6 per cent each.Not just children, rise in obesity has even been recorded in adults in the latest survey in comparison to NFHS-4.According to the survey data, 16 states and Union Territories registered a rise in obesity among women while 19 states and UTs recorded an increase in obesity among men.Kerala and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded the highest percentage of obesity among women at 38 per cent. Also, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep recorded the highest percentage of obesity among women at over 40 per cent.Men and women were counted as obese whose body mass index was found to be over or equal to 25.0 kg/m2 while children's obesity was counted in terms of weight-for-height.Healthcare experts have attributed the rise in obesity to unhealthy food choices and lack of physical activities among children and even adults.Sheila Vir, a public health nutrition expert and founder director of Public Health Nutrition and Development Centre, said there is also lack of awareness on what are good food habits.Also, high-fat and high-sugar foods are easily available and so there is higher consumption of it, she said."We have a double burden of undernutrition, malnutrition and overnutrition occurring together. So, I think what to feed a child is what we are going wrong in," Vir said.In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, she also raised concern over the rise in obesity."There might be an increase in obesity among children in view of COVID-19 pandemic as after closure of schools, there was lack of physical activity among children and even in adults in some cases," she said.Dr. Khan Amir Maroof, Professor at Department of Community Medicine, University College of Medical Sciences and GTB Hospital termed the rise in obesity a "very disturbing sign"."Obesity is a manifestation of what is rapidly changing in our environment. Of late, we see trends which increase the risk of developing obesity. Environmental factors, such as availability and consumption of junk foods, poor complementary feeding, lack of outdoor activity, and increased screen time on may be the reason for this trend," he said."For children, we need to flag screen time as it has multi-dimensional effects on children, obesity, being one of them. The focus has been on breastfeeding, but now it's time that complementary feeding is also focused upon," Dr Maroof suggested.About the repercussions of obesity among children, he said non-communicable diseases can develop among obese children earlier than others."There are higher chances for them being bullied in schools, neglected or shamed by peers, which lead to mental health problems among them," he said.Among adults, he said more consumption of ready-to-eat foods, increase in screen time with the 24-hour access to web content, and lack of outdoor spaces seem to be hitting adults with obesity.He suggested that children, with more stress on complementary feeding practices in the community, and reducing screen time, can be the immediate actions."Counselling of breastfeeding mothers of children around 4 months of age should focus on counselling on complementary feeding. We find that all mothers know 'what' to give to the child but 'how much', 'when' and in 'what consistency' need to be explained with respect to complementary feeding. Intervention strategies to reduce screen time are needed," he said.The NFHS results of 17 states and five Union Territories have been released now as phase-one. The phase-two results covering other states will be released next year, the health ministry had said.The present NFHS was conducted on 6.1 lakh sample households, involving household-level interviews to collect information on population, health, family planning and nutrition related indicators. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-survey-finds-drastic-rise-in-obesity-among-kids-under-5-years-in-20-states-183805

13-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: Tomar, Som Prakash hold discussions with Amit Shah||Amidst intensifying protests by farmers on the three central farm laws, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Prakash on Sunday met Home Minister Amit Shah regarding the issue. BJP leaders from Punjab were also present at the meeting where the home minister is also believed to have discussed the “ground situation in Punjab” in the wake of members of the Khalistani separatists desecrating the statue of Mahatma Gandhi during a protest organised by Sikh-American youths in the US and allegations of “Khalistan, Ultra-Left and pro-Left Wing extremist elements hijacking the farmers’ movement” — charges that farmers’ unions and ‘jathebandis’ reject vehemently.The unions at the Singhu border also washed their hands off VM Singh of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, who yesterday said farmers are ready for talks with the Centre.Meanwhile, Union minister from Punjab, Som Prakash, said the government’s “doors are always open to farmers for discussions” and that it offered to amend the laws even though they are correct” in order to resolve the issue.Following the meeting with the home minister, Som Prakash also said that several ‘jathebandis’ had agreed to the government’s offer of amendments in the December 3 meeting. “We told them it is not possible to repeal the acts but they came back again saying the same thing that they want a complete rollback or nothing. It seems they are under some influence....Many leaders told us (ministers) that if the offer (of amendments) had been made earlier something could have been done. However, what will we (leaders) now tell those who have assembled at our call,” he said, adding that it seems the matter is “out of their (leaders) hands and some wrong elements have crept in the movement”.  “We are always ready for talks. They need to drop their ‘zid’ (obstinate/stubborn attitude) and come for discussions for the benefit of farmers, Punjab and the country. The entire government is trying hard to resolve the issue. If the government adopts an adamant attitude that too is wrong but here we have agreed for amendments even though we know that our laws are correct,” he said. Meanwhile, unions, which elaborated their plan for tomorrow and rejected all the allegations of the movement being “hijacked” said they “want talks but demands of  farmer organisations for repeal of three anti-farmer acts and legal guarantee of minimum support price is non-negotiable.“Any attempt to hold parallel negotiations with the government amounts to sabotaging the historic movement,” they said, adding that they are taking due care to guard the movement against outsiders”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-tomar-som-prakash-hold-discussions-with-amit-shah-183798

13-12-2020||Mumbai||PM should clarify on remarks of Danve, Goyal: NCP||The NCP on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clarify on the claims of some Union ministers that the ongoing farmers' protest against the new agri laws has the backing of Pakistan, China and Maoists.NCP spokesman Mahesh Tapase said instead of sympathetically considering demands of the protesting farmers, Union ministers Raosaheb Danve and Piyush Goyal have made "controversial remarks to discredit the agitation"."Danve said the protest has the backing of Pakistan and China, while Goyal has alleged that Maoists are supporting the stir. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clarify if these claims are true," Tapase said in a statement.He said cultivators are demanding that the new farm laws be withdrawn, but the government is unrelenting.Goyal on Saturday said the agitation no longer remains a farmers' movement as it has been "infiltrated by Leftist and Maoist elements" demanding the release of those put behind bars for "anti-national activities".This was clearly to derail agriculture reforms brought by the government, he said.Danve a few days back stirred a controversy with his remarks that China and Pakistan were behind the protests being staged by cultivators, inviting sharp reactions from various quarters.Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-should-clarify-on-remarks-of-danve-goyal-ncp-183789
13-12-2020||New Delhi||RSS economic wing SJM picks holes in Centre’ three farm laws||RSS’ economic wing, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, has warned the Narendra Modi government of “monopolistic” situation in Indian markets “where a single party will not only be able to exploit suppliers and farmers but also consumers” and suggested changes in FDI rules to block the entry of MNCs in retail sector.While stating that it believes the government’s intention in bringing new agricultural acts is “good”, it also proposed amendments in them “to overcome drawbacks in the acts. Plug shortcomings and allay the fears and doubts” and “remunerative MSP to farmers under law”.A resolution passed at its All India convention said the intention of ‘The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020’ is seemingly that farmers get the right price for their produce in the absence of intermediaries.“However, there is a doubt in absence of ‘Mandi Fee’ buyers will be naturally encouraged to buy out of the APMC markets. In such a situation it would be appropriate that when laws are being made and purchases are being allowed outside the APMC markets, minimum support price (MSP) is guaranteed to the farmer and purchases below the MSP are declared illegal. Not only the government, should private parties also be barred to buy at less than MSP.”The resolution further said that “Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation), 2020 Act defines a farmer as a person ‘who engages in the production of farmers’ produce by himself or by a hired labour’.This definition of farmer in the Bill is such that companies will also be included in the definition of farmer. Calling this “inappropriate”, the SJM said “definition of farmer should include only the farmer who engages himself in farming, not companies”.Advocating “judicious dispute resolution mechanism” for farmers engaged in contract farming, the SJM said the ‘Dispute Resolution Mechanism’ proposed by the ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020’, related to contract farming is very complex for the farmers”.  “Already overburdened Sub-Divisional Magistrate has been placed in key role in dispute resolution. Due to this, it would be extremely difficult for the farmers to get justice in the event of a dispute. Establishment of Farmers Courts on the lines of Consumer Courts would be a plausible solution,” it said.Meanwhile, in an hard hitting observation on corporates, another resolution said “Reliance Retail and Big Bazaar will dominate over other players in the multi-brand retail in physical format such as Dmart, Croma etc and local kirana stores transformed into fulfilment centres for Jio Mart”.  It cited Facebook’s investment in Jio Platforms, a company promoted by Reliance Industries Ltd, as an example and wanted such partnerships to be disallowed from operating in India.“More than 38% of India’s retail market will be with Reliance Industries Ltd alone and some recent decisions and developments “would result in monopolistic situation where a single party will not only be able to exploit suppliers and farmers by making purchases at cheaper rates but will also be able to exploit consumers by offering goods at higher prices in the absence of competition in the market,” it said, asking for “change in FDI norms to block entry of MNCs in new retail format”. It urged the government to “examine critically the real impact of such development on the overall employment in the unorganised retail as well as on the consumers at large”. “Sale of medicines through e-commerce should not be permitted keeping in view the law of the land and its likely impact on health safety of the population and  FDI norms should be suitably amended to block the entry of MNCs in multi brand retail trade in India in any format directly or indirectly,” it said. “The government has restricted entry of MNCs in retail trade. FDI policy of the government has not permitted FDI in inventory model of multi-brand retail trade. However, to ensure that the sector makes use of the latest technological developments, it has permitted MNCs to operate in multi-brand retail sector with Market Place Model where they facilitate the local players to sell their products and to the consumers to buy the products online,” according to the resolution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-economic-wing-sjm-picks-holes-in-centre-three-farm-laws-183788

Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there’s a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,” Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday.“I am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,” he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers’ protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns.“As Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India’s recent agricultural reform legislation,” said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to the India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, early this week.According to the letter, “hundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana, who have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more”.“Many of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific region,” the letter further reads.The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were Congressman Jim Costa and Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus.Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

They had earlier sought permission for a protest, which was rejected by police in view of DDMA guidelines (on COVID-19),” the official said.Earlier in a letter to Chadha, police had said they denied permission for the protest in view of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) guidelines that state that all social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and political functions or other gatherings were prohibited up to December 31 throughout Delhi to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.“Moreover, promulgation of Section 144 of the CrPC is already in force in the area of New Delhi district,” the letter to Chadha from the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, New Delhi district, stated.Chadha said they were going to protest against the “biggest scam” by the BJP-led municipal corporations. “But we were arrested from our residences. Does Amit Shah want to bury this corruption using the Delhi Police,” the Rajender Nagar MLA said.The other three legislators who were detained are Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha, Kirari MLA Rituraj Jha and Kondli MLA Kuldeep Kumar, police said.The AAP has been alleging that there was a misappropriation of over Rs 2,400 crore done by BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation with the amount it had taken from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.The allegation has been refuted by the BJP.

13-12-2020|| Guwahati||BJP dumps coalition partner in Assam, picks up new one to rule an autonomous body||The BJP on Sunday virtually dumped one of its coalition partners in Assam, the BPF, and picked up a new ally to gain majority and rule the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), a self-governing body in the Bodo-dominated areas of the state.The Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), which has three ministers in the Sarbananda Sonowal-led coalition government in the state, has emerged as the single-largest party in the just concluded BTC polls, winning 17 seats in the 40-member body.BPF president Hagrama Mohilary said his party repeatedly appealed to the BJP to follow the “coalition” norms and help it to form a “government” in the BTC, but the BJP ignored the pleas.The United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) has won 12 seats, the BJP nine, while the Congress and the Gana Suraksha Party (GSP), headed by Lok Sabha MP Naba Sarania, got one each.Shortly after senior BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah congratulated the UPPL for winning 12 seats and also termed the party an “ally” in his tweet, Chief Minister Sarbanada Sonowal announced that UPPL chief Pramod Boro will be the new Chief Executive Member (CEM) in the BTC.While the BPF and UPPL are considered rivals in the Bodo-dominated areas, there was no pre-poll alliance among other parties as well.“Since we are part of the state government in Dispur, I appeal to the BJP to help the BPF to form the government in the BTC. We have not broken the alliance with the BJP and it should follow the coalition,” Mohilary, who had been the CEM for the past 17 years, told a press conference in Kokrajhar, the headquarters of the BTC.However, the BJP ignored the pleas.Soon, the Union home minister tweeted, “NDA secured a comfortable majority in Assam BTC election. Congratulations to our ally UPPL, CM @sarbanandsonwal, @himantabiswa, @RanjeetkrDass and @BJP4Assam unit”.“I thank people of Assam for their continued faith in PM @narendramodi’s resolve towards a developed North East,” Shah said.Later, at a press conference, Sonowal announced that the BJP, UPPL and GSP have joined hands for the BTC and UPPL chief Pramod Boro will be the new CEM.The BJP and BPF, along with the AGP, fought the 2016 assembly elections together in which BPF got 12 seats, winning all they has contested. Three of its MLAs are still ministers in the Sonowal government.BPF’s lone Rajya Sabha member Biswajit Daimari, before he formally joined the BJP last month, had been supporting the Narendra Modi government on different occasions in the upper house.However, Daimari joined the BJP last month.This is the second time that the BJP broke its ties with a coalition partner in recent times. In 2018, the saffron party pulled the plug on the Mehbooba Mufti led PDP-BJP government in Jammu and Kashmir.The Shiv Sena and Akali Dal themselves have walked out of the NDA in the past one year.

We were convinced and decided to vacate the road. However, this does not mean that our protest is over,” Satish Tomar, a senior IT Cell member of the BKU (Bhanu), told PTI over phone.He said a ‘havan’ was being performed at the Chila border on Sunday by the protesting farmers and further course of action would be clear by evening.At Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida, close to the Chilla border, another group of farmers belonging to the BKU (Lok Shakti) is staging a protest against the new laws. Some of the group members had on Saturday tonsured their heads and had earlier gone semi-naked during their protest.These protestors have gathered at the Noida border and want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana.Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.Government officials said efforts are being made for the next round of talks between representatives of the Centre and the farmers so that the logjam over the new laws could end.

13-12-2020||Jaipur/Chandigarh||Farmers block Jaipur-Delhi highway in Rajasthan’s Alwar||Farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws blocked the Jaipur-Delhi national highway in Shahjahanpur of Rajasthan’s Alwar district on Sunday as police stopped them along the state’s border with Haryana while they were marching towards Delhi.Several farmers’ organisations marched through Behror, Shajahapur and Kotputli regions of the state to reach Jaisinghpur-Khera Border.Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, social activists Aruna Roy and Medha Patkar, and CPI(M) leader Amra Ram also reached Shajahapur along with farmers. However, police did not allow them to proceed forward.“We are squatting on the highway in support of farmers. We are ready to vacate the road if we are allowed to march towards Delhi,” Yadav told reporters, while apologising to the people for the inconvenience caused to them.Kisan Panchayat president Rampal Chaudhary is also continuing with his protest along with the farmers on the Haryana-Rajasthan border highway as police did not allow them to move forward.“Farmers affiliated to different farmer organisations are reaching Shahjahapur border. We want the government to repeal the new farm laws and for this, we want to march towards Delhi,” said Chaudhary.While CPI(M) leader Amra Ram said the Centre should withdraw the three “anti-farmer” laws.“We do not have any intention to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway. Police have stopped us from marching towards Delhi, which has led to jam. We want the Centre to withdraw the anti-farmer laws,” Amra Ram said.Due to blockade, vehicular traffic on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway had to be diverted through Bansur and other routes of Alwar, police said.One-way traffic from Delhi to Jaipur was later opened for traffic but Jaipur-Delhi highway is blocked due to the agitation, they said.Police administration is keeping a vigil on the border areas in view of the agitation.“The police department is all prepared to maintain the law and order and have made all arrangements in view of the farmers’ agitation,” Bhiwadi SP Ram Murti Joshi said.Earlier, farmers from Rajasthan and some other places gathered in large numbers on the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Rewari for their march towards Delhi and sat in protest on side of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway as the Haryana police put up barricades to stop their onward march.Rewari’s Superintendent of Police Abhishek Jorwal told reporters at the site that district authorities had imposed Section 144 of the CrPC banning assembly of five or more people.“We have set up barricades and we will try to stop them here,” he said, adding, besides adequate force of the Haryana police, three companies of paramilitary personnel have been deployed to ensure law and order.The farmers were sitting in protest at Jaisinghpur Kheda area in Rewari along Rajasthan-Haryana border (NH-48). Gurugram is over 70 km from the site while Delhi is nearly 80 km away.A farmer from Rajasthan who was among those who wanted to march to Delhi against the Centre’s new farm laws said they will “force the government to rollback the anti-peasant legislations.”Also read: Normal traffic resumes at Chilla border, farmers say protest still on at Noida borderIndian-American Congressman Ro Khanna seeks peaceful and fair solution to farmers’ issueHomemaker, farmworker and now protester, hundreds of women join farmers' agitationThousands of farmers have been protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a fortnight demanding repeal of the new farm laws.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

13-12-2020||Pune||Madgyal sheep in Maharashtra gets offer of Rs 70 lakh||A Madgyal breed sheep, known for its unique appearance and superior meat quality, has got an offer of a whopping Rs 70 lakh from a buyer in Maharashtra’s Sangli district while its owner has quoted a price of Rs 1.5 crore.The Madgyal breed sheep, inhabitants of Jat tehsil in Sangli, are taller, larger and have a higher growth rate than other breeds. Hence, they are in great demand among breeders.The state’s animal husbandry department is also making extensive efforts to increase the Madgyal breed’s population beyond its origin, an official told PTI.This sheep breed derives its name from the Madgyal village in Jat tehsil of Sangli.Babu Metkari, a shepherd having a flock over 200 sheep in Atpadi tehsil of Sangli, was surprised when a buyer at a fair recently offered to buy one of his Madgyal sheep for Rs 70 lakh, though he did not wish to sell his prized possession.“This sheep’s real name is Sarja but it was re-christened ‘Modi’ after people likened him to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the way he won all elections and became PM of the country. Sarja, too, showed its dominance and ruled every fair and market it was taken,” the proud owner told PTI.Metkari said as Sarja is a “lucky charm” for him and his family, he does not want to sell it.“I refused to sell to the person who offered Rs 70 lakh but when he insisted, I quoted Rs 1.50 crore as I knew no one will shell out that much for the farm animal,” he said.Metkari said he had several sheep of the Madgyal breed but Sarja is far superior in terms of qualities, appearance and ability to reproduce.“We have been into the live-stock rearing business for two to three generations but in the last two years, we gained real profits just because of Sarja. A lamb bred by this sheep is sold between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh,” he claimed.Metkari said in the past two years, he had earned good money because of this sheep.The Madgyal sheep are taller, larger, have a higher growth rate and are considered ideal for meat production.The ruminant animal has a prominent brown ring around the eyes. Its head is convex and it has a typical Roman nose.Its ears are pendulous and leaf-like long and drooping.The Maharashtra Sheep and Goat Development Corporation’s assistant director, Dr Sachin Tekade, said in view of special qualities of the Madgyal breed, its utility, high demand and better adaptability to harsh drought-prone climate, the animal husbandry department has decided to revive the breed.“During a survey in 2003, it was found that there were only 5,319 pure Madgyal sheep available in the breeding tracts of Sangli district,” said Tekade, who has been researching on the Madgyal breed for last several years.“So, an extensive programme was started with an aim to conserve and preserve the then endangered Madgyal sheep breed,” said Tekade, who is also co-author of the paper ‘Performance evaluation of Madgyal sheep in its breeding tract’.Under the programme, initially 500 ewes and 20 rams of pure Madgyal breed were maintained at government-run sheep breeding farms, and the improved progeny from this pure breed was distributed among shepherds in the breeding tracts of Sangli, he said.The characters of Madgyal sheep are very dominating and if it is crossed with a local breed sheep, the newborn lamb has more than 50 per cent features of Madgyal, he said.“Now, the sheep population in Sangli district is more than 1.50 lakh, predominantly comprising the Madgyal breed. A proposal to register Madgyal as a separate breed has been sent to the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources at Karnal in Haryana,” he said.

13-12-2020||Kolkata||Spectacular Geminid meteor shower will enthral skygazers||A spectacular meteor shower will enthral skygazers in the city and elsewhere on the night of December 13 and early hours of December 14.The Geminid meteor shower, which peaks this year on the late night of December 13, is the most intense meteor shower of the year, Director of MP Birla Planetarium and well-known astrophysicist Debiprasad Duari said in a statement on Saturday.He said the Geminid meteor shower can be viewed from every part of India if the sky conditions are favourable.“While it is expected around December 13-14 night, one can probably also see some meteors on early evening hours of December 14,” Duari said.Meteors are bright streaks of dazzling light that one often sees in the night sky and they are often termed as “shooting stars”.In reality, when a rocky object, which could be as small as a speck of dust enters the earth’s atmosphere with a tremendous speed, because of the excitation of the air molecules and friction, a brilliant streak of light is produced, he explained.During a certain period of the year, one gets to see not one but numerous meteors originating from a particular direction of the sky.These are called meteor showers and in general are caused by the earth’s passage through the leftover debris of dust, left behind by different comets as they come near the Sun.In general, comets are mostly made up of ice and dust and when they approach the sun, the ice in them melts leaving behind a trail of dust along its path.As earth, in its yearly journey around sun passes through this dusty region, the dust and rocky substances enters the earth’s atmosphere, sometimes with speed between 30 and 60 km per second, and produce a shower of light streaks, called as meteor shower.Since they seem to come from one direction of the sky, the practice is to identify the constellation from which they seem to be radiating and the meteor shower is named after the constellation.Among the various meteor showers, one of the most spectacular is the Geminid Meteor shower which occurs every year around the second week of December.Moreover, at the peak of the meteor as predicted, in the middle of the night of December 13-14, at around 1-2 am, when the Gemini constellation will be overhead in Kolkata, it would provide an opportunity to observe the “celestial fireworks”, Duari said.This year, as per the predictions, it may be possible to see 150 meteors per hour given the sky is dark and clear.“One should not be alarmed while viewing this ‘heavenly phenomenon’, since these meteors will cause no harm to anything on Earth”, Duari said.

Their movement is being portrayed as a Sikh movement.”Rahul Gandhi, Cong leaderHow many sacrifices will farmers make?Eleven protesting farmers have lost their lives in the last 17 days due to various reasons. How many more sacrifices will the farmers have to make to get the agri laws repealed?“Protests in favour of Indian farmers in the UK were called Pakistan-sponsored.

This is one such idea we are working on,” the functionary said.Asked whether the digital voter identity card would mean that a voter can carry it on his or her mobile phone using an application, the official said once the EC takes a decision, such details will be settled.“It can be on a mobile, website, through e-mail... the idea is to provide faster delivery and easy accessibility. Physical card takes time to print and time to reach the voter,” he explained. In digital mode, the picture of the voter will also be clearer, making the identification easier.Another senior poll panel official said the EC will have to look into the safety aspects before taking a decision.

Ramesh said Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay also figured in his Menon book. “They were colleagues in the Congress Socialist Party,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jairam-ramesh-bags-award-for-menon-biography-183418

This will open up economic opportunities for traders of the region.The move will increase the use of Chabahar port in Iran to step up its trade and economic engagement with Central Asia bypassing Pakistan. Uzbekistan is Central Asia’s most populous nation and has ample reserves of uranium, gold, coal and oil. Some of these natural resources could be evacuated from Chabahar to parts of world not easily accessible to this double landlocked country.“This will open up economic opportunities for the traders and business community of the region. Besides Uzbekistan, other Central Asian countries have also shown interest in using the port. India seeks to cooperate closely with regional countries on this issue,” said a statement issued by the MEA.In an indication of the importance assigned to the first “Trilateral Working Group Meeting”, the co-chairs will be at the Deputy Minister level from Iran and Uzbekistan, and Secretary-level from India.India is involved in the development of the first phase of Shahid Beheshti Port in Chabahar in cooperation with Iran to open up sea-land connectivity between India and Afghanistan. The plan is to push this connectivity into Central Asia and beyond. Aware that this route provides a second access from the sea apart from Karachi, the US has given a waiver from sanctions for the development of this Iranian port.The route, if gets patronised by Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, will render insignificant Pakistan’s blocking of connectivity initiatives in the region, especially from India to Afghanistan and the five Central Asian nations.Major transit point||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-push-connectivity-trilateral-meet-on-chabahar-tomorrow-183435
13-12-2020||---||PM virtually rules out rethink on laws||New Delhi, December 12Even as PM Narendra Modi virtually ruled out a rethink on the three farm laws, maintaining that these were part of an inter-linked chain of reforms aimed at removing the walls that inhibited the growth of different sectors of economy, farmers’ leaders on Saturday announced to step up the protest against the farm laws with all 32 union leaders going on fast at the Singhu border on December 14.“We saw walls dividing the agriculture sector with its associated segments such as agri infrastructure, food processing, storage and cold chains. After these walls are dismantled, the reforms will open up new markets for farmers, give them new options and enable them to benefit from the use of technology. These will lead to more investment and the prime beneficiary will be the farmer who lives off small patches of land,’’ said the PM while delivering the inaugural address at FICCI’s 93rd annual general meeting.“Our economy does not need walls between different sectors but more and more bridges so that they can support each other,” he stressed. Indicating that the government was firm in its reform plans, the PM observed: “The confident do not hesitate. It’s the weak who are insecure and do not give opportunities to those around them... Governments that are decisive remove obstacles,” adding that the government’s policies were conducive to developing the village-based economy.Informing the industrialists about other allied opportunities opening up in villages and in tier II and tier III cities, the PM said: “You should not lose out on the opportunity to invest in villages and small cities. Your investments will open new doors for our brothers and sisters in rural areas and the agriculture sector.”The PM referred to the latest indicators about the economy to assert that the situation had changed for the better because the government had prioritised the saving of lives over trade and commerce.Stepping up protestDushyant: solution soonHaryana Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, who met Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, NS Tomar and Piyush Goyal, said he was hopeful the impasse would end in 24- 48 hrs with a fresh round of talks in a day or two.

Bakhshish Singh (55), a farm labourer from Thakar Sandhu village in Gurdaspur, is busy in the community kitchen, preparing chapatis for fellow villagers who have returned after a hectic day of sloganeering and listening to speeches of farm leaders at the protest venue, a few km away.Bir Kaur, Farm labourer from GurdaspurFight to finishTomorrow, when the farmers see victory in getting the farm laws repealed, we will also be remembered for being part of the struggle.After a short while, he is seen getting a nap, sharing a mattress with Rajinder Singh, a fellow villager in whose field Bakhshish Singh has been working for years. A large number of farm labourers, both men and women, have been doing their bit to keep the “Kisan Andolan” kicking.In fact, a new social order has come into existence here.

Professionally, I have seen the evolution of how the Indian public feels about China and am old enough to remember much more difficult days, especially in my childhood and in my teens,” he said during an interaction session at the FICCI convention.The minister admitted that South Block’s proclaimed proximity with the Trump administration did not result in a trade deal. “There was a fairly serious negotiation between our government and the Trump administration on resolving the outstanding trade issues. The general idea was — let’s deal with the differences before moving forward,” he said.“For a variety of reasons they did not close it. On our side, we were dead serious. We wanted to deal with those issues because we thought there was something much bigger in store for the relationship,” he explained.Jaishankar also said India would remain committed to the concept of the Indo-Pacific though US President-elect Joe Biden had used the term “Asia Pacific” while introducing his nominee for the post of Defence Secretary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-will-rise-to-occasion-meet-chinese-challenge-says-eam-183467
