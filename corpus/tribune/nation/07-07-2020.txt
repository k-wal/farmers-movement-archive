07-07-2020||New Delhi||India’s proactive, graded approach ensured plateaued graph of COVID-19 cases: Harsh Vardhan||India’s pre-emptive, proactive and graded approach ensured a plateaued graph of COVID-19 cases and a significant number of unoccupied beds in the health facilities at any point of time, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday.Vardhan made the remarks during his conversation with Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs, Lena Hallengren, who had called upon him virtually to discuss co-operation in the field of health and medicine, according to a statement issued by the Union Health ministry.Elaborating on the lessons India learned while handling the COVID-19 pandemic, Vardhan said, “India has a recovery rate of more than 61 per cent and a mortality of as low as 2.78 per cent in spite of being a country of 1.35 billion.”Also 2.5 lakh people are being tested every day. From a single lab four months back, the country now has more than 1100 labs to diagnose COVID-19, he said.“India’s pro-active, pre-emptive and graded approach ensured a plateaued graph and significant number of unoccupied beds at any point of time in the three-tiered COVID health infrastructure assembled by the government,” the statement quoting Vardhan said.The minister said India has used the novel coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity because of the “whole of government’ approach adopted at various levels. From January 8, one day after China alerted the world about the pathogen, the government has coordinated among its different branches for point of entry surveillance at the sea, land ports and airports, Vardhan said.It strengthened its community surveillance, issued detailed health and travel advisories, and also evacuated thousands of citizens and foreign nationals.“India now has over 100 PPE manufacturing units manufacturing 5 lakh PPE per day and has also similarly ramped up its production of N95 masks and ventilators.“India has supplied Hydrochloroxyquine to more than 100 countries,” Vardhan told his Swedish counterpart during the interaction.        The two health ministers discussed in detail the status and containment measures for COVID-19 in the two countries, and the future vision for handling it, according to the statement.Hallengren congratulated Vardhan on being elected Chair of WHO Executive Board and praised India for increasing the testing capacity so that more and more people can be diagnosed and treated early, the ministry said.   Vardhan spoke about the decade of vibrant Indo-Swedish partnership which oversaw ten bilateral meetings at the Joint Working Group level.He also mentioned the path-breaking achievements of the Government of India in the recent years:    “The Ayushman Bharat Yojana covers a massive 550 million people, maternal and infant mortality have been reduced, India has made giant strides in its target to eliminate TB by the year 2025, while India’s Digital Health Program promises to integrate IT into the healthcare system,” he said.He further said India has undertaken pioneering research in antibiotic resistance.            “Both the ministers agreed to hold next meeting of Joint Working Group by the fall season and digitally connect with each other till the crisis is over. They directed senior officials in their respective ministries to follow up on the matters discussed in the meeting,” the statement said.

The report blamed the incident on slack safety protocols and total breakdown of the emergency response procedures at the plant.The gas leak in the small hours of May 7 came in the middle the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide shutdown called to stop the spread of the virus. It drew nationwide shock and outrage, and brought back grim memories of the Bhopal Gas Leak disaster of December 1984---considered among the biggest industrial disasters in the world.

India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepal later released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019.India had then sternly asked Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepalese-lawmaker-sacked-for-defying-her-party-decision-to-endorse-countrys-new-map-109834
07-07-2020||New Delhi||8-point protocol for MPs ahead of Parliamentary panel meetings||The MPs attending Parliamentary Standing Committee meetings will have to sit 6-feet apart, and not more than two witnesses from the ministry concerned can appear before the panel at a time.This is part of the eight-point protocol set by the Rajya Sabha secretariat keeping in mind the COVID-19 pandemic, ahead of the meetings of the Standing Committees on Science and Technology and Home Affairs on July 10 and 15, respectively.The meeting of the Standing Committee on Home Affairs was convened by its chairman Anand Sharma on June 3, but it had to be called off as members expressed their inability to attend it in view of the prevailing situation due to the pandemic.As members were facing difficulty in attending the panel meetings due to travel and quarantine restrictions, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who is the chairman of the Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Climate Change, has written to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to allow virtual participation of members in the meeting.The two presiding officers of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha had earlier deliberated on the issue of holding virtual panel meetings. However, they have not given their approval for it due to existing rules that require changes by the Rules Committee of Parliament and a resolution by the House, according to sources.The Rajya Sabha has eight Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees of the House, of which two are chaired by Congress leaders Anand Sharma and Jairam Ramesh.“Respected M Venkaiah Naidu garu, Standing Committee on Science & Technology is scheduled to meet on July 10th. MPs across parties have asked for virtual sitting of Committee to discuss S&T issues related to COVID-19. I hope you will allow. Where there is will, there is skill (sic),” Ramesh said on Twitter.In his letter to the Chairman, Ramesh said the panel will discuss ongoing S&T related issues concerning COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing and future S&T programmes to enhance resilience and capacity to deal with such crises.“Many members of the Committee have expressed their inability to attend this meeting because of travel restrictions, quarantine and other constraints. I am doubtful if we can muster up a quorum.“But every member irrespective of party affiliation has asked for a virtual sitting of the Committee. Surely, this can be arranged - a number of other countries have held even full Parliament sessions in a virtual mode. I once again request you to allow virtual meetings of the Standing Committees,” he said.As per the protocol for meetings of Rajya Sabha Committees, members have to ensure conformity with physical distancing norms. Rajya Sabha Secretariat had discussed the protocol to be followed on May 28, anticipating meetings of some Committees after restrictions on domestic air travel were removed on May 25.Officials discussed the issue again and announced the updated protocol ahead of the two scheduled meetings.“Members of the Committee to be seated at a distance of 6 feet and appropriate arrangements to be made to accommodate the maximum possible participation.“Only two witnesses from the Ministry/Department appearing before the Committee for evidence would be allowed at a time and if more number of witnesses were to be examined, it would be done in turns. There is no restriction on the number of witnesses to be examined by the Committees,” the new protocol said.It also stated that material related to the meetings would be supplied to members as soft copies, and reporters will be accommodated in the well of the Committee Rooms for taking verbatim note of the proceedings of the Committees.While participation of officials related to the Committees will be restricted, the participation of members in the meetings would be ascertained in advance so as to ensure necessary logistics.Hand Sanitisers, disposable masks and gloves for the members, witnesses, officers and staff of the Secretariat will be ensured at the entrance of the Committee Rooms and their attendance will also be taken outside under the new protocols, the sources said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-point-protocol-for-mps-ahead-of-parliamentary-panel-meetings-109830
07-07-2020||New Delhi||Day after monuments reopen post lockdown, footfalls barely touch 100 at most sites||A day after monuments across the country reopened their doors for visitors following a gap of more than three months amid coronavirus-induced lockdown, only a handful of people visited these sites.The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which opened its monuments and museums on July 6, has capped visitor entry at every site from 1,000-2,500 per slot --9 am to 12 pm and 12 pm to 6 pm, officials said. Tickets to visit these places can be booked online. ASI’s top sites which generate the maximum footfall and revenue have been hit hard. According to officials, around 60 visitors bought tickets for Qutub Minar in Delhi which had a capping of 1,500 visitors per slot, on Tuesday. The afternoon slot, which is the most sought-after timing, saw only 28 tickets booked till 4 pm. On normal days, the site gets around 8,000-12,000 visitors per day. At Red Fort, the most popular destination for domestic and foreign tourists in the national capital, the footfall barely reached 100, with just around 51 tickets booked for the afternoon slot. Popular monuments like Jodhpur’s twin forts—Chittorgarh Fort and Kumbhalgarh Fort—recorded a footfall of around 150 each, while the Gwalior Fort in Bhopal, Bellary Fort in Hampi and the Mattancherry Palace Museum in Thrissur saw no visitors in the afternoon slot and a handful in the forenoon slot, officials said.The officials, however, admitted that low footfall was expected at most of these sites given the current mood of the country.In fact, around one-third of the top revenue generating monuments are located in the five states that are worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. These include Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.Monuments like the Taj Mahal in Agra, Ajanta Ellora Caves in Aurangabad and Sun Temple in Konark were not open for the public, while the other top grossers like the Group of Monuments in Mamallapuram (in Tamil Nadu) saw no takers in the afternoon slot with the entire 1,000 tickets remaining unsold. The group of monuments in Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh saw around 350 tickets being sold out of the 1,000 allowed.In Bihar, ASI sites like the Archaeological Site Museum, Nalanda saw around 40 visitors, the Ancient Site of Vikramshila around 20 visitors and the Archaeological Site Museum, Bodhgaya, had very few visitors, officials said. The Cooch Bihar Palace and the Hazarduari Palace in West Bengal saw around 30 visitors each. As many as 3,691 centrally-protected monuments and archaeological sites maintained by the ASI in the country were shut from March 17 in view of the coronavirus crisis.The culture ministry had issued a set of protocols, saying only those monuments which are in non-containment zones will be reopened for public. Entry tickets shall be issued by e-mode and only e-payments will be acceptable at the monument parking and cafeteria.“There will be a cap on the number of visitors in select monuments... The visitors shall follow social distancing. The use of face cover/mask is mandatory. Entrance to have mandatory hand hygiene and thermal scanning provisions. Only asymptomatic persons are allowed. There shall be designated routes for entry and exit and movement within the monument,” according to the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the ministry.At the entrance of every monument/site, all visitors shall share their phone numbers with the person designated for the purpose by the ASI to help in contact tracing if and when required.The ASI can restrict access to vulnerable and interior parts of any monument while visitors shall be asked to stick to the time limits inside the monument, as far as possible, the ministry said.No group photography and food or eatables shall be allowed inside the premises, it said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-after-monuments-reopen-post-lockdown-footfalls-barely-touch-100-at-most-sites-109829
07-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||DRDO updates policy on development of aviation systems after 18 years||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 7Almost two decades after it was last updated, the Policy for Design Development and Production of Military Airsystems and Airborne Stores (DDPMAS) is being revised to keep pace with contemporary technical and commercial advancements in the aviation sector.The policy, brought out by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) sets out the procedure to be followed for design and development, production, modification, licence production and indigenisation of aircraft and aviation systems within the military airworthiness regulatory framework.Rapid advancements in the Indian aviation sector over the past years with significant expansion in the design, development and production activities, increasing accent on self-reliance and indigenisation with ever increasing public and private sector participation necessitated the current policy.First issued in 1975 and then revised in 2002, DDPMAS outlines policy level aspect towards ensuring airworthiness of military aviation systems, defines roles, responsibilities and empowerment of all the stakeholders, lays down procedural aspects towards ensuring military airworthiness certification and describes technical airworthiness requirements and associated acceptable means of compliance based on tailored standards.New chapters on unmanned aerial systems, air launched missiles, research systems, civil certified military airsystems, continuing airworthiness, organisation approvals and exports, have now been added to the policy document.To facilitate the private industry and boot the Make-in-India policy, organisation approvals for design, production and maintenance have been added. Airworthiness coverage to the private industry, even when no expression of interest or supply order from the government exists, has also been addressed.Inputs from various stakeholders regarding the impediments and difficulties in following the DDPMAS have been addressed without compromising the philosophy of airworthiness.While demarcating the requirements for airsystems and airborne stores, the new document also addresses engines, materials, software, identification of parts, test rigs, tools, testers and ground equipment separately.The revised DDPMAS recognises that the future of military aviation will involve joint ventures and consortiums with design houses of foreign origin, which will entail mutual recognition of design and certification methodologies.In order to facilitate international understanding, cooperation and success of the ventures leading to acquiring strategic technologies, the DDPMAS has introduced global parlance and internationally followed terminologies with one-to-one-mapping of equivalent regulatory articles wherever applicable to Indian processes and procedures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-updates-policy-on-development-of-aviation-systems%C2%A0after-18-years-109821
07-07-2020||Hyderabad||After HC nod, Telangana to have a new Secretariat||The Telangana Government has started the demolition of the state Secretariat building that it shared with Andhra Pradesh since the division of the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh in 2014.The move comes a week after the Telangana High Court gave a go-ahead for a new Telangana state Secretariat.The new building will be built at a cost of Rs 400 crore at the same site opposite the famous Hussain Sagar Lake.The move of the government to demolish the old secretariat and build a new one when the building was relatively recent has evoked a sharp reaction from the people, terming it as wasteful expenditure.A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in the high court restraining the government from demolishing the old structure.The court has now cleared the new construction after looking at the plans of the government.To prevent any demonstrations and protests, the government blocked all roads, erected barricades leading to the secretariat and diverted the vehicular traffic.It deployed bulldozers, earthmovers, and other machinery for the demolition work which began in the early hours of Tuesday. The restrictions in the busy area near Hussain Sagar Lake in the heart of the city led to traffic jams at various points.All the 10 blocks spread over 25 acres will be demolished, thereby ending yet another symbol of Hyderabad heritage that will also become history.One of the buildings was constructed in 1888 during the times of seventh Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last ruler of erstwhile Hyderabad state.Known as Saifabad Palace and built-in European architecture, it used to house the office of Nizam’s prime minister till Hyderabad’s accession with the Indian Union in 1948.Subsequently, the palace designated as ‘G’ block (Sarvahitha) served as the office of the chief ministers of undivided Andhra Pradesh up till N.T Rama Rao.His successor M. Channa Reddy built the ‘C’ block and shifted the chief minister’s office and all his successors till undivided Andhra Pradesh’s last chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy functioned from there.The ‘G’ block, one of the last surviving pieces of architecture of Nizam’s administration has since been lying unused and reduced to the dustbin to dump old furniture.When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in June 2014, both states functioned from here.While ‘C’ block was allotted to Telangana, Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) continued to function from his office cum residence at “Pragati Bhavan”.It is said that the chief minister was advised by his astrologers not to go there as the Vaastu of the entire secretariat complex was inauspicious.The chief minister has laid the foundation stone for the new administrative complex at the same location on June 27 last year. But the work was stalled due to a PIL against the construction saying it would add to the unnecessary burden on the state’s exchequer.Now that the court has cleared the construction, the new secretariat is expected to be built in a record one year.The Chief Minister’s Office today released the design of the proposed secretariat building saying it may be approved.The government plans to complete the work by June 2, 2021. Mumbai-based architect Hafeez Contractor has designed the five-lakh square feet complex to be built at a cost of Rs 400 crore.After the Secretariat building, a new Vidhan Sabha building at the Irrum Manzil too may become a reality, much to the disappointment of voices for heritage preservations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-hc-nod-telangana-to-have-a-new-secretariat-109820

07-07-2020||New Delhi||ED files money laundering case against GVK group, MIAL in Mumbai airport scam case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a money laundering case against the GVK group, the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) and others to probe alleged irregularities to the tune of Rs 705 crore in running the Mumbai airport, officials said on Tuesday.The central probe agency has filed an enforcement case information report (equivalent of a police FIR) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after studying a recent CBI FIR filed against the same entities.The ED will probe if genuine funds were laundered to amass personal assets by illegal routing of funds, they said.The CBI case pertains to the alleged siphoning off Rs 705 crore from the funds of the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), a joint venture under public-private partnership (PPP) between the GVK Airport Holdings Limited and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) besides other investors, by showing inflated expenditure, under-reporting of revenues, fudging of records among others.  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked Gunupati, a director in MIAL, his son GV Sanjay Reddy, managing director in MIAL, the companies MIAL, GVK Airport Holdings Limited (a GVK group company) and nine other private companies allegedly used to camouflage the inflated figures through sham deals and unidentified AAI officials, they added.On April 4, 2006, the AAI entered into an agreement with MIAL for the modernisation, upkeep, operation and maintenance of the Mumbai airport.  It is alleged that the promoters of the GVK group in MIAL, in connivance with their executives and unidentified AAI officials, resorted to siphoning off funds using different ways, the CBI had said early this month.  The CBI had also carried out raids in Mumbai and Hyderabad after filing its FIR.

07-07-2020||Ravi S Singh||Left parties pull out all the stops to regain spot in national politics||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 7In the midst of political and social turmoil created by Covid pandemic, the Left parties have pulled out all the stops to regain their spot in national politics by reclaiming its once citadel of West Bengal in the next Assembly elections, due early next year, and putting up a competitive contest in the preceding Bihar poll which is due in October-November, this year.The Achilles' heel, however, for the Left parties-led by CPI(M)  is the difference among them on how much should they wager, just yet, on Congress regarding West Bengal elections in taking out the ruling TMC, and simultaneously overrun the aggressive BJP.Left parties are strategising on ways to expand their footprint in states unitedly which would set them on course to re-establish their presence in national politics at the Centre.Former CPI(M) Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha Mohammad Salim said that the Left's prospects have brightened in West Bengal especially on account of events relating to Covid and the cyclone, Amphan."Both the TMC government in the state and BJP dispensation at the Centre failed to deliver at the time of two crises and have been exposed," said Salim."The Left parties are conspicuous by their socio-welfare activities to provide succour to victims, including migrant labourers.""As many as 19 non-TMC and non-BJP parties, including Left and Congress, are jointly struggling against the state government and Union government," Salim added.A top CPI(M) leader said that Left's joining hands with Congress for the forthcoming Assembly election in West Bengal was certain.CPI chief D Raja, however, has a nuanced take on Congress."Congress will be judged on the basis of how much it accommodates the Left parties in sharing of seats for the Bihar Assembly elections," Raja said, and red-flagged that the Bihar elections would be an indicator of Congress' association with the Left parties for West Bengal poll.The bottom-line, however, is that Left has too much at stake in West Bengal, and absence of Congress will throw up a four-way contest. This would entail split in anti-BJP votes – a prospect at which the BJP leadership will hug itself. The Left spectrum has been an influencer in "secular politics" in the country. In the past, it supported national governments from outside or inside, and acted as "angel guardian" to the dispensation at the Centre.On account of its numerical clout in Parliament, Left bloc would influence governments’ policies which also came in for flak in some quarters.Things changed with ascent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP under him. The Left as well as other opposition parties were pushed to the slippery slope.Left was particularly reduced to fire-fight for relevance, and measured itself in the axiom of survival. It lost its 34 years of political investments in West Bengal – the crucible of Left ideology  – in 2011 to the TMC led Mamata Banerjee which was then considered an upstart.Subsequently, it ceded power to BJP in Tripura, another of its bastion, and also lower its horns to the saffron party in the race to capture opposition space in West Bengal. The BJP won 18 of the total of 42 seats in West-Bengal, second to TMC in the 2019 General Election.The saving grace for Left was their convincing victory in Kerala Assembly elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-pull-out-all-the-stops-to-regain-spot-in-national-politics-109797
07-07-2020||New Delhi||SC extends protection from arrest for Vinod Dua till July 15||The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended protection from arrest till July 15 for senior journalist Vinod Dua who is facing a sedition case in Himachal Pradesh.A Bench led by Justice UU Lalit directed the Himachal Pradesh Police to file a report on the probe into the case against Dua probe in a sealed cover and posted the matter for further hearing on July 15."Whatever we have, we will file it", Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench.The Bench made it clear that it intends to dispose of the case by the next hearing. The top court has made it clear that Dua does not need to answer the supplementary questionnaire.Questions like why did Dua—with 45 years of experience in journalism—relied on another newspaper article for his reportage was not relevant, it said, adding such questions didn't form any empirical evidence in a sedition case."Won't it amount to stay?" Mehta wondered.On behalf of Dua, senior advocate Vikas Singh asserted that Journalists were free to criticise the government."I have freedom of speech and I have a right to criticise the government. Police refused to give us details on the nature of complaint even though the Supreme Court asked for a status report. When they could not do anything, they invoked the Disaster Management Act," Singh submitted.Singh said sedition was not made out as he didn't incite violence and created public disorder.The Supreme Court had on June 14 refused to stay the probe into a sedition case against Dua by Himachal Pradesh Police in Shimla but protected him from arrest.It had asked Dua to join the probe and cooperate with the police in the process through video conferencing or online mode. Police can interrogate Dua at his residence in Delhi after giving him a 24-hour prior notice, it added.The Bench had issued notices to Himachal Pradesh Government and the Centre on Dua's petition seeking quashing of the FIR.Asking the Himachal Pradesh Government to file a status report on probe, the top court posted the matter for further hearing on July 6.Now the report will be filed by July 15, the next date of hearing.Dua had moved the top court after being asked to join the investigation at Kumarsain Police Station in Shimla district on or before June 13 by 10 am sharp.Dua (66) didn't want to go to Shimla because of his old age, medical condition and COVID-19 pandemic which made him vulnerable.Earlier, the Delhi High Court had stayed the summons issued to him in connection with an FIR against him for allegedly spreading fake news on communal violence in Delhi in February through his YouTube show.The Shimla FIR has been registered at the instance of Himachal Pradesh BJP leader Ajay Shyam who filed a criminal complaint against Dua accusing him of instigating violence against the government by allegedly spreading fake news.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-extends-protection-from-arrest-for-vinod-dua-till-july-15-109785

However, the letter carried no serial number or date.Bilhaur Circle Officer Devendra Mishra was among the eight policemen killed in an ambush by the gangster’s henchmen at Bikru village near Kanpur early Friday morning.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Kumar Prabhu said that there was no record of the letter in which Mishra was supposed to have made the serious allegations against Tiwari.            The SSP said records at the offices of CO Bilhaur and SP rural were checked, but no such letter was found.He further said that all office records were thoroughly checked in the confidential section of his own office, including police office and SSP camp office, but there was no entry of any letter.“I also questioned the clerks who deal with the section, but they denied having any information regarding the letter,” SSP asserted.The SSP, however, claimed that the matter is under investigation and efforts are on to probe the charges.The police suspect that Tiwari may have tipped off Dubey that a police team was on its way to arrest him.According to the purported letter circulating on social media, Mishra had written that Dubey was booked on charges of rioting, extortion and criminal intimidation in a case.“Showing sympathy to such a notorious criminal in such a way by the station officer and not taking any action brings the integrity of Vinay Tiwari into question,” it said.It mentioned that it also came to light from other sources that Tiwari used to visit Dubey frequently.Mishra’s alleged letter to the SSP said that if the station officer does not change his style of working, then a serious incident could occur.Meanwhile, the police on Tuesday started house searches in Bikru villages in which they seized several documents related to Dubey, a senior police official said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-record-of-dsp-writing-letter-alleging-links-between-gangster-chaubeypur-station-officer-109782

07-07-2020||Satya Prakash||SC gives Centre a month's time for giving permanent commission to women officers in Army||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 7 The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave one more month to the Centre to implement its February 17, 2020 verdict for permanent commission to women officers in the Army.A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud asked the government to ensure complete compliance with its order even as the Ministry of Defence said the decision making was at the final stage and only the formal order remained to be issued.The top court's orders will be complied with in letter and spirit, the government told the court, which agreed to give one additional month in view of COVID-19 pandemic.The Centre had sought six more months to implement the top court's order for grant of permanent Commission to women officers and make provision for command posts for eligible women officers in the Army.Noting that “the right to equality is a right to rationality,” the Supreme Court had on February 17 paved the way for women in command positions in the Army as it ordered the Government to consider granting permanent commission to all women officers in three months.“An absolute bar on women seeking criteria or command appointments would not comport with the guarantee of equality under Article 14. Implicit in the guarantee of equality is that where the action of the state does differentiate between two classes of persons, it does not differentiate them in an unreasonable or irrational manner. In this sense, even at its bare minimum, the right to equality is a right to rationality,” a Justice Chandrachud-led Bench had said.The Bench, however, had said, “Whether a particular candidate should or should not be granted a criteria or command assignment is a matter for the competent authority to consider having regard to all the exigencies of service, performance and organisational requirements.”Noting that courts were conscious of the limitations, which issues of national security and policy imposed on the judicial evolution of doctrine in matters relating to the Armed forces, the Bench had made it clear that deployment of women officers in combat roles was a matter of policy as held by the Delhi High Court.The top court said permanent commission can be given to women officers in the Army irrespective of their tenure of service. It also directed the Centre to grant permanent commission within three months to all women officers in the Army who opt for it.It had termed as "disturbing" the government's argument of physiological limitations and social norms for denying command posts to women officers and called for a change of mindset on the part of the government to put an end to gender bias in the armed forces. Highlighting the laurels achieved by women officers, the Bench had said, “Their track record of service to the nation is beyond reproach. To cast aspersion on their abilities on the ground of gender is an affront not only to their dignity as women but to the dignity of the members of the Indian Army – men and women – who serve as equal citizens in a common mission.”It had expressed strong displeasure over the Centre not implementing the 2010 Delhi High Court’s order allowing grant of permanent commission to women officers despite there being no stay on it, saying the government showed scant regard in implementing the directions for a decade.Describing the engagement of women officers in the Army as an “evolutionary process” it had said the Centre should have implemented the high court verdict as there was no stay on it.The top court's order was based on the Centre’s policy decision conveyed to it on February 25, 2019 to grant of Permanent Commission to Short Service Commission women officers in all the 10 streams where women had been granted SSC in the Army.“The decision of the Union Government to extend the grant of PC to other corps in the support arms and services recognizes that the physiological features of a woman have no significance to her equal entitlements under the Constitution,” it had said.“Seventy years after the birth of a post-colonial independent state, there is still a need for change in attitudes and mindsets to recognise the commitment to the values of the Constitution," it had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-gives-centre-a-months-time-for-giving-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-in-army-109769
07-07-2020||Washington||US military to stand with India in conflict with China, indicates White House official||The US military "will continue to stand strong” in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else, a top White House official has said, after the Navy deployed two aircraft carriers to the strategic South China Sea to boost its presence in the region."The message is clear. We're not going to stand by and let China or anyone else take the reins in terms of being the most powerful, dominant force, whether it's in that region or over here,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told Fox News on Monday."And the message is clear. Our military might stands strong and will continue to stand strong, whether it's in relationship to a conflict between India and China or anywhere else," Meadows said in response to a question.He was told that India banned Chinese apps because Indian soldiers were killed by Chinese troops last month and asked what's mission of the two aircraft carriers - the Ronald Reagan and the Nimitz - and what's America's mission.The troops of India and China are locked in an eight-week standoff in several areas in eastern Ladakh including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Spring. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.The Chinese military on Monday began withdrawing troops from the Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Spring after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held lengthy talks on Sunday. Doval and Wang are also the special representatives on the India-China boundary talks.The United States has sent two of its aircraft carriers to the South China Sea. “Our mission is to make sure that the world knows that we still have the preeminent fighting force on the face of the globe,” Meadows said.President Donald Trump has invested more in the US military, more in not only the hardware, but the men and women who serve so sacrificially each and every day, he said. “He (Trump) continues to do so,” he added.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter-claims over the area.Meadows also hinted that President Trump might sign an executive order that relates to China, among other issues."I'll give you a couple of hints, all right. So a sneak preview here. We're going to be looking at how we make sure that China is addressed, how we bring manufacturing back from overseas to make sure the American worker is supported,” he said.“We're also going to look at a number of issues as it relates to immigration. We're going to look at a number of issues as it relates to prescription drug prices and we're going to get them done when Congress couldn't get them done,” Meadows said.Appearing on the same Fox News on Monday talk show with host Brian Kilmeade, influential Republican Senator Tom Cotton said that the US aircraft carriers are headed to the South China Sea to thwart off any Chinese misadventure against Taiwan or other countries in the region."That's one of the reasons why we have those aircraft carrier groups in the South China Sea. I mean, look what China did in the southwest. It's essentially invaded India over the last few weeks and killed Indian soldiers,” Cotton said."No country on China's periphery, right now, is safe from Chinese aggression. All those countries want a close relationship with the United States. We ought to have one,” Cotton said.

Armed with semi-automatic weapons, Vikas’s aides reached her house through roofs and shot dead all the policemen, who were standing near the door of her house.” The police have also arrested Rekha Agnihotri, wife of Dubey’s cook, Daya Shankar, who was earlier arrested following a brief encounter on Sunday.Rekha, who also worked as a maid at Vikas’s house, helped shooters zero in on a group of other policemen, who had taken refuge behind a wall opposite Vikas’s house. “When shooters opened fire at policemen, Rekha was cheering them and yelling that none of the policemen should return alive,” said the official.Suresh Verma, the third person arrested on Monday night, was also applauding the shooters.The SSP said, “We have arrested the three from their hideouts and booked them under Section 120B. They would be produced in the court and will be sent to jail later.” According to police, the three were giving information to Dubey and his henchmen when the shootout occurred at the criminal’s residence in Bikru village in Kanpur on July 3.Police said that they were giving all information about the police personnel’s location to Dubey during the encounter.The SSP said that they were part of the gang that laid a trap for the police team which was raiding Bikru village.The gangster and his men attacked the police team and killed eight police personnel. The incident had led to national outrage even as Vikas Dubey remains out of reach of the police.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-more-aides-of-vikas-dubey-arrested-in-up-109757

One must seek medical help when there is shortness of breath, which these people (recovered patients) know, he explained.He also lauded a patient, who after recovering from the infection helped other patients in the hospital."After recovering, this patient from Mangor Hill (a Covid hotspot in Vasco town of Goa) helped other patients by feeding them, putting the bed pan. He was like a nurse. If some patient had a query, he would answer, he said.Gomes said such kind of people could be roped in to work at the Covid care centres set up by the state government.The doctor said many Covid-19 patients who came to the hospital from Mangor Hill area were in a bad health condition."At least 25 per cent of the patients from Mangor Hill have got a second life," he added.

The test costs Rs 1,500 and I was not carrying enough cash. I made my wife stand along with a relative in the queue for the Covid-19 test and went home to bring the money. When I returned, I found that my wife had already given birth to a boy and was admitted to the ward," said Raman.Dr Srikesh Singh, spokesperson of RMLIMS, said the woman and her baby are doing fine.Officiating director of RMLIMS, Prof Nuzhat Hussain, said, "A three-member committee will submit its report on the incident in three days. Till then, the five staff members will remain off duty. The head of obstetrics and gynaecology has been asked to explain why instead of providing emergency care when the woman was in labour pain, she was sent for Covid-19 testing."

07-07-2020||Arun Joshi||Chinese withdrawal — J&K, Ladakh heave sigh of relief||Tribune News ServiceJammu, July 6The beginning of the phased withdrawal of Chinese troops from eastern Ladakh, theatre of a tense standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries, has put an end to the anxieties of people of the twin Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), at least for the time being.J&K and Ladakh had been apprehending a big trouble on the borders when they watched troops moving up the mountainous roads to meet the challenge of checking the aggressive build-up by the Chinese side and the moves to alter the recognised status of the LAC. They were more worried as Pakistan, too, was seeking to aggravate the trouble on the Line of Control (LoC) with the ill-intention to open a two-front situation with the help of Chinese troops.Monday morning, however, was abuzz with news that the troop withdrawal had started. This was confirmed by the Ministry of External Affairs that gave details of the telephonic conversation of NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and disclosed that the two sides “agreed to complete the ongoing disengagement process along the LAC expeditiously”.The reverse movement of the troops from their face-off positions to their sides is seen as a breakthrough achieved by the talks. This has added to their hopes, and all along the Kashmiri leadership had been pleading that the talks alone could deliver a way out of the crisis situation.National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and the PDP leaders had been advocating talks with China to defuse the situation on borders. He had told the Tribune that a “give-and-take approach should be adopted in dealing with China”.Similar sentiments were echoed by other groups.Two natural consequences of today’s forward movement in the maintenance of the bilateral relations between India and China are: one, it has lifted the fear of immediate mishap on the borders. These fears had gone up several notches after the June 15 violent clashes in Galwan Valley.This conciliatory process between Delhi and Beijing has also reduced the potential of Pakistan to create a bigger trouble on the LoC as the psychological advantage that it had been looking for since the days of the standoff in eastern Ladakh is gone for the moment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-withdrawal-%E2%80%94-jk-ladakh-heave-sigh-of-relief-109607

BJP president JP Nadda said, “Rahul skips meetings of all important parliamentary standing committee on defence, but continues to demoralise the nation and question the valour of armed forces.”It’s distraction: CongressTerming the BJP's attack as a "cheap distraction", Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said, “Instead of answering Rahul's questions on Covid, foreign policy, economy and the LAC standoff, the BJP is attacking the questioner."Nadda’s tweets came following reports that Rahul has not attended the committee’s meetings so far.“Rahul does everything that a responsible Opposition leader should not do,” the BJP president said.He added, “Rahul belongs to that glorious dynastic tradition where as far as defence is concerned, committees don’t matter, only commissions do. The Congress has many deserving members who understand parliamentary matters, but one dynasty will never let such leaders grow. Really sad.”Stepping up the attack on the Gandhi-scion, BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said Gandhi chose not to attend 11 meetings of the standing committee on defence held so far.“The dynastic family is only interested in defence matters when commissions are involved,” Rao alleged, demanding an explanation from Rahul as to why he chose to be absent from all meetings of the standing committee on defence.The BJP spokesperson added that Rahul Gandhi also chose to not attend a field visit to Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, which proved to be a very important visit for the committee. “He must apologise to the armed forces,” Rao said. Gandhi has been leading his party’s sharp criticism of the Central Government over a host of issues, including the continuing standoff between Indian and Chinese armies. In turn, the BJP has accused him of lowering the morale of armed forces.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-questions-rahuls-absence-from-defence-panel-meetings-109544

Her tenure was to end next year. Officials at DBT did not comment on the development. It was not immediately clear what triggered the move on Kang’s part, but the timing of her resignation did raise eyebrows. A researcher in the government system said Kang, who was a professor at CMC, Vellore, before coming to THSTI, had been hoping for some time to return to the parent institute where she has her primary lab research set up.

Terming the move a threat to the democracy, the party has urged the Election Commission to revoke the decision.In a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, TMC General Secretary Subrata Bakshi, MP, said the amendments to the Conduct of Election Rules (made public on July 2) had been carried out saying these safeguarded elderly voters from contracting Covid, but this, in fact, would “enhance” that risk. An elderly voter would expose himself multiple times to cast vote through postal ballot, he said.The TMC leader stated the amendment would also enhance the possibility of a voter’s electoral preference getting revealed to others.Urging the Election Commission to revoke the amendment, the TMC said that in future as well the EC should intervene and “bar the Centre from usurping its powers”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-against-postal-ballot-for-voters-aged-above-65-109548
07-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Talks an attempt to avoid Kargil-type deployment||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 6The talks on Sunday evening between India and China’s top officials on border issues have averted what may have turned out to be a costly and back-breaking exercise for both armies to hold on to advantageous positions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The inability of India and Pakistan to make a clean break at Kargil had led to both sides extending deployments on the peaks in this sector to winter months as well with no tactical or strategic advantage accruing from the lonely vigils in virtually immovable conditions.Although this is no justification for Chinese behaviour, the parallel to Kargil remains restricted to the problem of holding ground in extremely high altitude areas. In this particular case, the build-up happened in the full knowledge of forward troops and was mostly restricted to the Chinese side of LAC. The transgressions are at three places, none of which was held or controlled by Indian side.Both Chinese and the Indian read-outs of the conversation between NSA Ajit Doval and State Councilor-cum-Foreign Minister Wang Yi that took place on July 5 put emphasis on a quick return to peace and tranquility. More importantly they seem to be laying equal importance on restoring the status quo.This means that as happened with the Chinese incursion into the Galwan valley in July 1962 – the war took place three months later – Beijing is satisfied into withdrawing on the premise that India does not pose the threat of a quick military thrust into the Valley and across the plains of Aksai Chin.Such a premise essentially involves ensuring that neither side sets up infrastructure close by that can serve as a springboard for offensive operations later on. If China continues to maintain any such indicator of infrastructure that could later pose a threat to India’s road from Daulat Beg Oldi to Shyok, India would have had to inevitably follow suit.The Doval-Wang talks may have averted that possibility. Besides being a costly exercise, which also puts an excessive burden on the human spirit, an eye-ball-to-eye-ball situation in eastern Ladakah could have slowly metastasised into a similar force posture all along the sprawling and demarcated LAC, increasing the chances of another bloody brawl as happened at the Galwan valley on June 15. It is not known whether the restoration of status quo will also mean that India will have to curb its appetite for strengthening approaches to forward posts from the DBO-Shyok road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-an-attempt-to-avoid-kargil-type-deployment-109549

Advocate Reepak Kansal has been fined Rs100 for filing such a petition.Setting aside the Delhi High Court’s order and its comments against National Investigation Agency (NIA), a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said, “It is the courts at Bombay alone having the jurisdiction, which can entertain the application."Since the respondent (Navlakha) has been moved to Bombay, he is at liberty to apply before the competent court in Bombay, it said.The order came on an NIA petition challenging the Delhi HC's order seeking records of judicial proceedings before a special court that ordered Navlakha’s shifting from Delhi to Mumbai. The HC had pulled up the NIA for shifting Navlakha to Mumbai when his plea was pending before it.Navlakha (67), who surrendered before the National Investigation Agency on April 14 following the Supreme Court’s direction, was lodged in Tihar jail in Delhi.

07-07-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Partial pullback at Galwan, Hot Springs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 6Twenty days after the deadly clash between Indian and Chinese troops at the Ladakh’s Galwan valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there is a minor breakthrough. Both sides have started to pull back, almost like the first baby steps, from the flash point — Patrolling Point (PP) 14 — in the Galwan valley.This is the first stage of the proposed disengagement, which has clearly defined the phases for full restoration of “status quo ante” as in April this year. The Army, for now, is maintaining the same number of troops at the LAC, lest the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China spring a military surprise. The Indian side is stopping short of terming it a disengagement as each move can be reversed by the PLA at its will. The mistrust hasn’t gone, as on June 17 some pullback had taken place, but the PLA had soon returned to hold ground at Galwan.A source said a pullback was initiated by both sides on Sunday night at PP-14, the spot of the clash on the night intervening June 15 and 16. Troops have moved back by a kilometre on each side. Some minor pullback is also seen at PP-15 and PP-17A, both in the Hot Springs area, where two-three tents have been removed. There has been little movement at Finger-4 in the north bank of Pangong Tso.Maintaining a specified distance will be the first stage of the disengagement and will be validated in some two weeks if both sides keep their commitment, a source said. Creating a minimum buffer zone of 3 km between the two armies was suggested and agreed upon as the first step of the graded and gradual disengagement by both sides. These decisions were taken at a series of Lt General-level meetings on June 6, June 22 and June 30. The second stage will include pulling back the deployment of thousands of additional troops and war-like stores of either side to a pre-agreed distance from the present eyeball-to-eyeball deployment. At present, missile launchers, long-range artillery guns and tanks are stationed by both sides at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Setting a timeline for pulling these back will be decided at fresh meetings after a two-week validation period for the buffer zone.The next step after pulling back war-like stores will be the restoration of “status quo ante”, which will come after pulling back men, equipment and heavy weapons to the levels of April 2020. This would mean allowing the Indian Army to patrol in the disputed Pangong Tso area.Sources said the pullback at Galwan could have been necessitated due to the heavy flow of water in the narrow valley. This is the time when snow melts in the high-altitude dry plateau. With mountains being tree-less, the flow of snowmelt is unimpeded, bringing rapid current.Step-wise DisengagementFirst stageMaintaining a specified distance (buffer zone of 3 km between two armies) will be part of the first stage.

07-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Doval, Wang agree on speedy withdrawal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 6A conversation between designated Special Representatives of India and China for Border Affairs facilitated Monday’s readjustment of force postures on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at several places in eastern Ladakh.National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councillor-cum-Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke on Sunday evening for close to two hours via video-conferencing during which they agreed on the need for a quick withdrawal in the interest of bilateral ties as well as full restoration of peace and tranquillity by completing the disengagement in a phased and step-wise manner, as per a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement.The Indian side refrained from any blame game and wanted both sides to strictly respect and observe the LAC, desisting from any unilateral action to alter the status quo. “Both sides need to work together by utilising the existing Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (which did not meet for over a year till it was activated last month),” it noted.The Chinese readout, while affirming the need for dialogue and forbearance to sort out difficulties on the LAC, also maintained that right and wrong of what recently happened at the Galwan valley was “very clear”.Wang reportedly told Doval that China would continue “firmly safeguarding territorial sovereignty as well as peace and tranquility in the border areas”, while obliquely commenting on the war phobia generated in the Indian media and calls to crack down on trade ties with China.“We hope India can work with China to guide public opinion in the right direction… avoid amplifying differences and complicating matters,’’ he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doval-wang-agree-on-speedy-withdrawal-109530
07-07-2020||New Delhi||China for border talks with Bhutan, India wary||To India’s discomfiture, China is signalling its desire to hold border talks with Bhutan after objecting to funding of a wildlife sanctuary, which is claimed by Thimphu.Edit: Naked expansionism Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of border talks and sources said Beijing began putting renewed pressure towards the end of last year that Thimphu managed to fob off. The last round of talks was held in 2016 and the next edition was put off after India and China clashed at Doklam.As against its desire to frequently hold talks with China on border dispute, India looks askance at its border talks with Bhutan because of claims over Doklam.China has been putting forward a deal for over 20 years that includes both sides establishing diplomatic ties followed by a comprehensive border settlement. But things took a decisive turn during the 2014 talks in Shaanxi when China proposed a joint field survey of the disputed areas.Soon after, India cut fuel subsidy, leading to skyrocketing of LPG prices in Bhutan. This led to an election loss for the Jigme Thinley government that might have crossed another South Block red line by assuring China that his country wanted border settlement. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-for-border-talks-with-bhutan-india-wary-109532

The ministry said varsities could hold exams in online, offline or blended mode. tnsAmong all states and UTs, Punjab had the lowest positivity rate of 1.92 per cent as of today and was among eight states and UTs with a rate lower than the national average of 6.73 per cent. Others in this bracket are Chandigarh, Puducherry, Assam, Tripura, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Goa.The national disease burden today rose to 6,97,413, surpassing Russia’s 6,81,251. Over the last 24 hours, the country added 24,248 new cases and deaths topped 19,693 after 425 fresh fatalities.Recoveries improved to 60.85 per cent as 4,24,432 patients were cured as against 2,53,287 currently infected. The cumulative tests crossed the one crore milestone. India had tested only 1.30 lakh samples until mid-April. Although national fatality rate of 2.86 per cent is among the positives, a key concern for the government is the rising positivity rate calculated as the proportion of people who test positive against the total samples tested. The WHO has advised nations to ensure this rate does not cross 10 per cent despite ramped up testing. A surging positivity rate signals a growing burden on health systems.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/infection-rate-rises-to-6-7-infra-under-strain-109538

They have been charged under various Sections of the IPC, UAPA and the Arms Act.
