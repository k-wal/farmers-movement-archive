We have demanded that the police administration register an offence against Kangana Ranaut.”    A CIDCO police station officer said, “We have received a letter from the city Shiv Sena.”Meanwhile, in the legal notice, Lonandkar has asked the actor to delete the derogatory and defamatory posts tweeted by her on September 1 and 2 comparing Mumbai to PoK and against the Mumbai police and its commissioner.The notice said the allegations levelled by Ranaut that the city commissioner of police was “intimidating” her and “encouraging social bullying” against her are completely false, frivolous, baseless and unsubstantiated.The commissioner of police, in reply to your (Ranaut) tweet, said that the alleged insulting tweet has not been liked by his handle and that the cyber police have been asked to examine the fabricated screenshot, the notice sent through solicitor Mohan Jayakar said.It is extremely shocking and unfortunate that you have also posted derogatory tweets about Mumbai comparing it with POK, the notice said.The notice has sought Ranaut to delete her tweets and issue a public statement apologising to the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai and the Mumbai police.In the event you fail to comply with this, our client (Lonandkar) will be constrained to adopt appropriate legal proceedings against you, including civil and criminal.“Our client calls upon you to pay a sum of Rs 50 crore which should be deposited with the Mumbai Police Welfare Fund or the Mumbai Police Foundation, the notice said.

They observed the reserve forest from a temporary watch tower and later planted few saplings in the reserve forest region.The 'Rebel' star, as Prabhas is popularly called, took up the initiative under the Green India challenge promoted by Santosh Kumar.The Forest Department will convert a small portion of the reserve forest into an urban forest park while the rest of the forest will be a conservation zone.Khazipally reserve forest is known for its medicinal plants and it is extended in three compartments.The Forest Department is going to fence the entire 1,650 acres and immediately start developing an eco park.A park gate, see-through wall, walking track, view point, gazebo and medicinal plant centre would be constructed in the first phase.Prabhas stated that he was inspired by his friend Santosh Kumar to adopt Khazipally forest area and would donate more, depending on the progress of the work.He requested the Forest Department to develop the reserve forest so that it would create an additional lung space in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) limits.Santosh Kumar had last year adopted Keesara reserved forest region and laid foundation stone for rejuvenation of reserved forest and eco park. He had stated that he would motivate and request his friends to take part in adoption of reserved forests.The MP said very soon many industrialists would come forward to adopt reserve forest blocks.

It said a representation for postponement of the assembly polls was made to the EC on June 30 and no decision had been taken on it till date.The Supreme Court had on August 28 dismissed a PIL seeking to defer the Bihar assembly polls due to COVID19, saying the pandemic can’t be a ground for postponing elections.“How can we ask the Election Commission of India (ECI) to not hold elections? COVID cannot be a valid ground for postponement of elections,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had told petitioner Avinash Thakur.The Election Commission would consider everything, it said, terming the petition “premature” as notification for the assembly polls was yet to be issued. Thakur had sought a direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to postpone the polls due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the ground that the Representation of the People Act provided for deferment of polls in extraordinary situations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-pil-in-sc-seeks-postponement-of-bihar-polls-137785

For August, the average daily departures was around 930, significantly lower than the average daily departures of 2,846 in August 2019, though better than 780 in July 2020,” said Kinjal Shah, Vice-President, Icra.The average number of passengers per flight during August was 98 against the average of 133 passengers per flight in August last year, she said, adding it is expected that the domestic aviation industry operated at a passenger load factor (PLF) of around 63 per cent in the previous month as against 85.1 per cent in August 2019, that too on very low capacity.The PLF for August 2020 has sequentially improved from around 55 per cent in July this year despite the increase in capacity deployment by around 19 per cent, she added.While the scheduled international operations are yet to start, the Civil Aviation Ministry has permitted international operations under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and Air Transport Bubbles (ATB).Under the VBM for the evacuation of Indian citizens from foreign shores, which started from May 7, the international passenger traffic (inbound and outbound) has been 632,741 for the period May 7 to August 31, according to the rating agency.For August, the number of international passenger traffic was 2,16,666, a Y-o-Y decline of 89 per cent, it said.As for aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices, following the pandemic outbreak, crude oil prices declined materially – reached a low of around USD 19 per barrel in April, thereby leading to a decline in ATF prices.However, the crude oil prices have increased gradually since then, and currently range around USD 44 per barrel, Icra said.Consequently, ATF prices increased sequentially by 24.1 per cent in July and by 4.2 per cent in August. However, it declined sequentially by 3.4 per cent in September, which is also lower by 32.3 per cent on a Y-o-Y basis.“The prolonged shutdown of manufacturing activities in several countries and the subsequent impact of the outbreak on the global economic activity will keep the crude oil prices and thus the ATF prices low,” she added.

07-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana scraps VROs to clean up revenue system||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, September 7 Telangana has scrapped the Village Revenue Officer (VRO) system with an aim to introduce transparency and make the revenue setup corruption-free.The Telangana Vidhan Sabha in its opening day of the Monsoon Session indicated that it will table ‘Revenue Bill 2020’ that will deal with all land records, making the Revenue Department people-friendly. All the VROs have been asked to submit their records to the office of their respective District Collectors.The new Bill is expected to be passed without any obstacles as the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has a brute majority of 103 MLAs in a House of 119. Once passed, the legislation will replace 139 redundant and irrelevant rules and legislations.Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar issued an order that stated all the registration work under the Registration and Stamps Department had been suspended till the new system was put in place. This means that there will be no new registration of properties in the state till the ‘Revenue Bill 2020’ is passed in the Vidhan Sabha.The Revenue Bill 2020 will make legal the use of block-chain technology that will automatically update land records and mutations immediately. A pilot project for the same was being run by the Revenue Department in coordination with the Information Technology and Electronics Department in the Shamshabad area on the outskirts of Hyderabad since 2018. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) has said that the VROs have proved to be worse than the old patwari system and this needed to be replaced. Earlier, the Telangana Assembly unanimously adopted a condolence motion after recalling the services of former President Pranab Mukherjee.The Chief Minister moved a condolence motion that read “this house places on record its deep sense of sorrow at the demise of Pranab Mukherjee, former President of India, and conveys sympathy to the members of the bereaved family”. “Pranab is the epitome of discipline and hard work. Born in a village in West Bengal he used to swim across a stream to reach his school. He was a man of all seasons and held different ministries with ease and rendered yeoman service to the nation,” said the Chief Minister. “He played a key role in achieving common ground in the coalition governments and was an excellent troubleshooter. He might have differed with others on issues but never personally criticised anyone. Even if he does, he used to apologise,” he added. The media was barred from entering the House as were the customary guests. Unlike in the past, there were no handshakes or the typically Hyderabadi hugs among the members of the House. Each one had to go through SOPs prescribed for Covid-19 testing, ensuring sanitisation, maintaining physical distancing and a face mask.Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy had announced that only those who go through the exercise will be permitted to enter the House. The House is also likely to discuss the Union Government’s lackadaisical approach to the GST compensation to states and release of pending funds. KCR has already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and get the state it’s due in the GST. The state Assembly will also pass a unanimous resolution later seeking Bharat Ratna to be conferred posthumously on former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, whose birth centenary celebrations are being organised in the state throughout the year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-scraps-vros-to-clean-up-revenue-system-137762
07-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||Criticised for being restrictive on environmental clearances, but we understood need for balance: Manmohan||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 7Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday said the UPA regime which he led was criticised as being too restrictive on environment clearances, adding that as PM he believed that balance between economy and ecology was critical.Singh was speaking at a virtual event held here to present the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize to British broadcaster David Attenborough known for his work on the natural world.After presenting the award at a video event attended by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Singh said the world did not need the COVID pandemic to know that it was in such a bad shape.“It doesn’t need an epidemic to tell us that we are not in good shape. Climate change, the assault on the oceans, the pollution of the atmosphere, the junk floating about in space, the reduction of forest cover, the extinction of life in rivers, the reduction of natural habitat for any life other than humans – all this is evident to anyone who has eyes to see,” Singh said praising Attenborough as a legend.Singh acknowledged the acute dilemma the world faces and advocated balance.“Millions of us live in abject poverty. Millions around the world do not have access to enough food, clean water and surroundings, a minimum acceptable standard of living. In the name of development, nature bears the brunt, with its long-term crippling effects on that very quality of life we are trying to improve. But like Sir David, I believe that it is possible for us to respect boundaries, to be aware always of the costs of economic development, and to refrain from excesses, from ignorant or wilful actions that ultimately rebound on us,” he said.Singh said in India during the time that he was Prime Minister, UPA regime was conscious of its duty to accelerate economic development and raise the standard of living of our people, especially those in poverty.“At the same time, we were very selective in allowing projects that impacted the wilderness or the habitat of wild life. Indeed, we were criticised by industrialists and those who thought we were being too restrictive. But I believe that if a proper balance is not firmly held, the results are deleterious and self-defeating,” said the former PM.He added that India at the time was also an active voice in international forums and discussions on issues concerning the environment.“I like to think we made positive contributions to the protection of the planet,” he said noting that the  veracity of Sir David’s concerns are evident to anyone who looks at the state of the planet today.“How acute the situation is cannot be clearer than from the pandemic that has gripped the earth, coincidently almost exactly one century after the great influenza epidemic. To some, this is nature’s way of telling humankind to loosen its tightening grip on the resources of the earth, to be less exploitative, to respect the needs of the natural world, especially the animal kingdom, more and slow down the pace of environmental,” Singh added.Attenborough in his acceptance speech dwelt on the dangers the planet faces and said it was time for people to transform from being nationalists to being internationalists to save the planet.Earlier in her opening remarks, Sonia Gandhi recalled the environment protection laws enacted during the time of late Indira Gandhi and said that bulk of India’s ecological preservation ecosystem was created by late Indira Gandhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/criticised-for-being-restrictive-on-environmental-clearances-but-we-understood-need-for-balance-manmohan-137761

On the surface the Sputnik V trial seemed smaller with that of AstraZeneca. But AstraZeneca initially ran its trial with a one-shot model. It tested the two-shot model only on 10 people whereas the Sputnik V trial exceeded that number by four times, he reasoned.The RDIF CEO denied Russia had stolen the vaccine and claimed Gamaleya Center had modified an existing platform developed in 2015 for Ebola fever, which went through all phases of clinical trials and was successfully used in Africa in 2017.A familiar face in India, Dimitriev said its competitors were working on technologies such as mRNA that are yet to be proven for safety and efficacy.

Erring was alerted by an appeal posted on the Facebook by one of the five missing youth’s brother.On Sunday, Kiren Rijiju, union of minister of state for youth welfare and sports, who is also a Lok Sabha member from Arunachal Pradesh, said in a tweet that Indian Army had passed on a message regarding the missing youths to PLA through the hotline. Response from PLA was awaited, Rijiju wrote.Picking up of the youths by the PLA has been causing a lot of consternation in Arunachal Pradesh. The missing boys belong to the Tagin tribe. The All Tagin Students’ Union (ATSU), while condemning the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) for “abducting the “teenagers”, today accused the authorities of not paying attention to one of the most strategically important places in the country.“Sacrifices and other assistance to the Indian Army by the Tagins during the 1962 war have never been acknowledged by the government and still today Tagin people live under the fear of Chinese aggression,” said the ATSU in a statement.All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union (AAPSU), an organisation that claims to represent the interest of indigenous people, held an emergency meeting and said the Nacho incident reflected “the failure of the central as well as the state governments in protecting life and ensuring security of our people inhabiting the border areas”.Earlier today, an Arunachal Pradesh government spokesperson said they were closely monitoring the case. District Administration has been directed to assist all concerned agencies to trace the missing boys, the spokesperson added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-questions-nationality-of-missing-arunachal-youths-137746

I explained to Rajput that he has already been prescribed medicines by doctors who are treating him,” Chakraborty said in her complaint.“He (Rajput), however, disagreed with me and insisted that he would only take the medicine his sister was prescribing,” she said.On the same day, Rajput asked Chakraborty to leave the house as his sister Meetu Singh was coming to stay with him for a few days, according to the complaint.“It has now come to light that Rajput on June 8 told his sister Priyanka that he would not be able to obtain the said medicines without a prescription. His sister Priyanka subsequently on the same day sent him a prescription signed by one Dr Tarun Kumar, working with the Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi,” the complaint said.“Prima facie, the prescription appeared to be fabricated. The medicines prescribed by the doctor are prohibited from being prescribed electronically without consultation with the patient,” Chakraborty said in the complaint.“Rajput died just a few days after he obtained the prescription, wherein he was unlawfully prescribed psychotropic substances at the behest of his sister Priyanka and the doctor Tarun Kumar,” she said.Rajput, 34, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 following which the Mumbai Police had lodged an Accidental Death Report (ADR).On July 25, Rajput’s father KK Singh lodged a complaint with Patna police against Rhea Chakraborty, her parents Indrajit and Sandhya Chakraborty, her brother Showik Chakraborty, the late actor’s former manager Shruti Modi and his house manager Samuel Miranda.He accused them of cheating and abetting his son’s suicide. He also claimed that the accused persons had siphoned off Rs 15 crore from his son’s bank accounts.Based on this allegation, the Enforcement Directorate is probing money laundering charges.The FIR lodged by Patna police was later transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is probing drugs angle in the case.

In fact, August saw 27 LPA days. The normal number of low pressure areas in the four month season is 13 to 14 (with 13.5 being the average) and number of LPA days 55.So far as Punjab and Haryana are concerned, they were deficit but had now made up for the shortfall, according to Mohapatra.The seasonal rains are expected to begin the retreat process around September 15 with some signs appearing in Western Rajasthan but a fresh LPA around September 17 will bring more rains to Central and Southern parts of India in the last two weeks the month.“LPA is the key during monsoon days to determine rains, especially in Central and adjoining areas that is reason why August recorded excess and July less rains,” explains Mohapatra.Meanwhile according to Secretary, Earth Sciences, good rain should help Indian economy and agriculture.  With major cities experiencing more rains and incidents of urban floods, the IMD has also planning to extend warning systems installed in Mumbai and Chennai to more parts.This year the Monsoon set over Indian mainland on June 1 and covered the entire country two weeks in advance on June 26 in “one go or spell with no hiatus”. Currently, 33 of the 36 subdivisions in the country are either normal or excess due to favourable ENSO conditions offsetting the negative effect of IOD.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-rain-7-pc-excess-so-far-more-expected-in-last-two-weeks-of-september-137734

This is betrayal of the people of the state,” he said.BJP leader Ram Kadam recently asked the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government to provide police protection to Kangana since “she wanted to expose the Bollywood drug nexus”.Responding to Kadam’s tweet, the actor said she feared Mumbai Police more than the “movie mafia”, and would prefer security either from Himachal Pradesh or the Centre.Ranaut is in the eye of the storm over her recent remarks on Mumbai and its police. “Why is Mumbai feeling like Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir?” Ranaut had tweeted, inviting criticism from various quarters.She would require security from Haryana or Himachal Pradesh Police and would not accept protection from the Mumbai Police to expose an alleged “drug mafia in Bollywood”, the award-winning actor had said.Speaking in the legislative assembly on the condolence motion, Thackeray, without taking any names, said, “Some people have gratitude towards the city where they live and earn their livelihood, but some don’t.”The comments came when he was paying tributes to Anil Rathod, a former Shiv Sena MLA and minister who died recently.“Anil bhaiyya came from Rajasthan and made Maharashtra his home. He was a hardcore Shiv sainik,” Thackeray said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-cm-thackeray-takes-jibe-at-kangana-over-mumbai-remarks-137726

One Malaviya character is running riot with filth. We are a party of maryada purushottam not of Ravan or Dushasan,” he wrote, accusing Malviya of running the campaign using fake tweets.Swamy, however, did not specify the exact contours of the campaign.The BJP IT cell is also under pressure over the “dislike campaign” against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though party leaders blame the Congress and say only two per cent of the “dislikes” on PM’s videos on its channel are from India.“The international dislike campaign is being run by Congress which is using many Turkey-based handles and recently-created bots to tweet against the exams issue. They don’t have any real followers nor do they follow many real people,” party leaders say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-it-cell-gone-rogue-sack-amit-malviya-subramanian-swamy-137725

Besides tracking humans, they are also trained to storm into rooms and vehicles, neutralise and restrain intruders and armed persons, detect explosives and narcotics and assist in search and rescue operations.More recently, the ITBP raised a new unit of assault dogs that have been trained to work in a pack of four to pin down an adversary. This means that all four dogs in the pack will go after a single adversary who is considered to be a threat.The ITBP, which claims this to be the first unit of its kind in the world, plans to train a total of 30 such dogs of the Belgian Malinois and the German Shepherd breeds and deploy them in highly sensitive areas.“Such animals are placed on a rehabilitation register and given a sheltered appointment where they can also be used for training dog handlers and veterinary staff,” said the officer.“Our K-9s are highly valuable assets who have rendered Yeoman’s service, especially during anti-naxal and anti-terrorist operations. It becomes the responsibility of the force to care for them in the twilight of their life,” he added.According to the ITBP sources, there are at present 30 “retired” dogs on its rolls living in various units, where they are groomed and exercised regularly and provided vet care. These dogs are entitled to 70 per cent of the ration scale of active duty K-9s.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-setting-up-retirement-home-for-its-k-9-veterans-137724

However, these candidates would have to appear and qualify the exams either in 2020 or in 2021, the MCI clarified in a public notice.This exemption is a one-time measure for candidates in view of COVID-19 Pandemic and it is incumbent upon them to qualify NEET-UG in 2020-21.“If a candidate failed to clear the test, his/her decision to continue his Foreign Medical Courses thereafter shall be at his own risk, as he shall not be entitled to appear for the MCI Screening Test or FMGE exam and thereby would not be entitled to grant of provisional/Permanent Registration by the State Medical Councils,” said Dr RK Vats, secretary-general, Board of Governors in Suppression of MCI.In February 2018, the MCI had made it mandatory to pass NEET to obtain an eligibility certificate to pursue MBBS course in foreign medical colleges.

Many aspiring students who wish to go abroad for MBBS want the authorities to grant them an eligibility certificate without the prerequisite NEET qualification. Students have knocked the door of High Courts to seek the exemption from NEET this time for their medical course in foreign countries as they were unable to take admission in foreign countries due to the delay in conducting of the NEET.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mci-allows-one-time-neet-exemption-for-those-wanting-to-pursue-mbbs-abroad-137718
07-09-2020||New Delhi||India initiates probe against alleged dumping of Vitamin C from China||India has initiated a probe into the alleged dumping of Vitamin C, used by pharmaceutical firms for the production of medicines, from China following complaint by a domestic manufacturer.Bajaj Healthcare Ltd has filed the application before the commerce ministry’s investigation arm DGTR, seeking initiation of the probe.The company alleged that the domestic industry is impacted due to the dumping of Vitamin C from China PR and has requested for the imposition of anti-dumping duty on the imports, according to the notification of Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR).On the basis of prima facie evidence submitted by the applicants, “the authority, hereby, initiates an investigation,” it said.In the probe, the directorate will determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged dumping in respect of the product from China.If DGTR will find that there is dumping and it is impacting the domestic manufacturer, it will recommend the amount of anti-dumping duty, which if levied, would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.While the DGTR recommends the duty, the finance ministry imposes the same.The period of investigation is April 2019-March 2020. It would also look into the data of April 2016-19 period.In international trade parlance, dumping happens when a country or a firm exports an item at a price lower than the price of that product in its domestic market.Dumping impacts the price of that product in the importing country, hitting margins and profits of the manufacturing firms.According to global trade norms, a country is allowed to impose tariffs on such dumped products to provide a level-playing field to domestic manufacturers. The duty is imposed only after a thorough investigation by a quasi-judicial body, such as DGTR, in India.The imposition of anti-dumping duty is permissible under the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime. India and China are members of this Geneva-based organisation, which deals with global trade norms.The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters.

Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an immunity passport or risk-free certificate that would enable individuals to travel or return to work assuming they are protected against re-infection. But no study has currently evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans,” says the WHO.While most studies have shown that people who have recovered from COVID have antibodies to the virus, some people have very low levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood suggesting that cellular immunity may also be critical for recovery. Health Ministry here is reviewing evidence on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-debate-covid-reinfection-after%C2%A0bengaluru-mumbai-see-first-cases-137699

07-09-2020||Ravi S Singh||Bad blood within JD(U)-led NDA alliance in Bihar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 7Bad blood within the JD(U)-led ruling NDA in Bihar refuses to be washed away.This comes at a time when Election Commission is said to be taking rounds of final reviews internally before announcing the schedule for Assembly elections in Bihar, which will be held in October-November.The JD(U), on Sunday, put the responsibility of carrying aboard the Chirag Paswan-headed LJP in the alliance for the coming Assembly elections in Bihar squarely at the door-steps of the BJP.“We have nothing to do with the LJP in the past, present or future. We are in alliance with the BJP,” said JD(U) national spokesperson KC Tyagi.“It is for the BJP to decide how it will deal with the LJP and adjust it in the alliance. The BJP leadership, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, have made it clear that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will lead the alliance in the election,” Tyagi said.The JD(U), the BJP and the LJP are running alliance government in the state. Former Bihar chief minister and president of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) Jitan Ram Manjhi has recently joined the NDA by breaking away from the RJD-led “Mahagathbandhan”.JD(U)’s show of indifference towards the LJP comes amidst the growing estrangement between Chirag Paswan and Nitish Kumar.Paswan, who is reportedly getting traction from the youth in the state, has been critical of Kumar with regard to his style of governance. His political emergence from the shadows of his father and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has been noted in wide-ranging quarters.Prime Minister Narendra Modi once drew the attention of the BJP MPs on the discipline and preparedness with which Chirag Paswan raises issues and conducts himself in the Lok Sabha.JD(U) has publicly aired its indifference to the LJP at a time when the parties concerned are internally assessing on the number of assembly seats they would pitch for a share in the alliance.Many see JD(U)’s expression of indifference towards the LJP as a tactical message to the BJP leadership that it will not compromise on its share of seats. The BJP will have to accommodate LJP if it insists on keeping it in the alliance.Sources say that the JD(U) has internally identified 140 assembly seats out of the total 343 in the state. However, indications are that it will have to settle down with about 110 to 115.The JD(U)’s calculation is that the BJP would pitch for 110 seats but would settle with 100 to 105 seats.It remains to be seen how the LJP and HAM would be adjusted.With the LJP setting eyes on higher political goals, the negotiation for seat adjustment would require intervention a deft touch on the part of BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bad-blood-within-jdu-led-nda-alliance-in-bihar-137675

So they might have gone there, it's a very normal thing." He said they were yet to hear back from the Chinese. The PLA could not immediately be contacted for comment.Separately, a Tibetan member of an Indian special forces unit who died days ago in a mine blast near the site of a border flare-up with Chinese troops in the western Himalayas was cremated on Monday.His death has provided a rare glimpse into a little-known group of elite, high-altitude warriors drawn mainly from Tibetan refugees living in India.

07-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||NEP-2020 prepared after widespread consultation with over 2 lakh stakeholders: Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 7Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the new National Education Policy had been prepared after widespread consultations and was a major attempt to take education out of the “one size fits all” approach followed till now.Addressing the inaugural session of the Governors’ Conference on the National Education Policy, the Prime Minister while elaborating on various aspects of the NEP 2020 said the education policy should have limited interference from the government and its policy and have participation from students, guardians, teachers and education experts.The Prime Minister said concerns regarding implementation were being addressed in a “transparent manner” in the states.“This is not the government’s education policy but the country’s education policy. Just like the External Affairs policy is of the country and not the government and the Defence policy is also of the country and not a particular government,” the Prime Minister said.Notably, concerns are being voiced from several quarters, including the states and political parties, especially regarding “saffronisation” of the education policy.The Prime Minister, while exhorting participants to organise seminars and meetings in respective states on the NEP 2020, said the draft had been prepared after consultations and suggestions from more than two lakh stakeholders, including students, guardians, teachers and experts.“It is after such a wide consultation that we have arrived at the NEP, which is also the reason it has received so much support and acceptability,” the Prime Minister said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the new policy aimed at not just about bringing changes in the education system but also give a direction and give shape to India’s vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, building a strong economy and make India a global destination for education by bringing in top institutions of the World.“It focuses on knowledge and skill, learning and critical thinking. It is an attempt to take education out of the ‘one size fits all’ approach and build a foundation with an introduction to language and culture without any ‘dabav, abhav and prabhav’,” he said.President Ram Nath Kovind also addressed the inaugural session of the Governors’ Conference on National Education Policy.Exhorting states to build on research and quality education, President Kovind said the success of the NEP 2020 depended upon the participation of states. “Education comes under concurrent list,” he said, asking states to resolve existing issues such as filling in vacancies in respective states and help make India a knowledge hub.The Conference titled “Role of NEP-2020 in Transforming Higher Education” is being organised by the Ministry of Education.The NEP-2020 is the first education policy of the 21st century which was announced after 34 years of the previous National Policy on Education, 1986. Various webinars, virtual conferences and conclaves on various aspects of the National Education Policy 2020 are being organised across the country to meet the challenges in its implementation.Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said language would not be forced on any state and that the NEP had received unprecedented support from all states.Directed towards major reforms at both school and higher education levels, the new National Education Policy strives for making India into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society. It envisions an India-centred education system that contributes directly to transforming India into a global superpower.The comprehensive transformation aimed at the NEP will bring about a paradigm shift in the country’s education system and create an enabling and reinvigorated educational ecosystem for a new Atmanirbhar Bharat.The Ministry of Education and University Grants Commission had earlier organised a “Conclave on Transformational Reforms in Higher Education under National Education Policy-2020”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nep-2020-prepared-after-widespread-consultation-with-over-2-lakh-stakeholders-modi-137670
07-09-2020||New Delhi||Fall in GDP alarming; time for bureaucracy to take meaningful action: Rajan||Terming the 23.9 per cent fall in economic growth in June quarter alarming, former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has said bureaucracy should come out of complacency and take meaningful action.           The current crisis requires a more thoughtful and active government, he said, adding “unfortunately, after an initial burst of activity, it seems to have retreated into a shell.”         "The sharp decline in economic growth should alarm us all. The 23.9 per cent contraction in India (and the numbers will probably be worse when we get estimates of the damage in the informal sector) compares with a drop of 12.4 per cent in Italy and 9.5 per cent in the United States, two of the most COVID-19-affected advanced countries," Rajan wrote in a post on his LinkedIn page.   He further said the bureaucracy needs to “be frightened out of their complacency and into meaningful activity. If there is a silver lining in the awful GDP numbers, hopefully, it is that''.     Rajan, currently a professor at the University of Chicago, said the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in India, so discretionary spending, especially on high-contact services like restaurants, and the associated employment, will stay low until the virus is contained.       The eminent economist pointed out that the government's reluctance to do more today seems partly because it wants to conserve resources for a possible future stimulus.           "This strategy is self-defeating," he opined.           Citing an example, Rajan said if one thinks of the economy as a patient, relief is the sustenance the patient needs while on the sickbed and fighting the disease.             "Without relief, households skip meals, pull their children out of school and send them to work or beg, pledge their gold to borrow, let EMIs and rent arrears pile up… Essentially, the patient atrophies, so by the time the disease is contained, the patient has become a shell of herself," he noted.           The former RBI Governor further said now think of economic stimulus as a tonic.           "When the disease is vanquished, it can help the patient get out of her sickbed faster. But if the patient has atrophied, stimulus will have little effect," he said.             Rajan stressed that the recent pick-up in sectors like auto is not evidence of the much-awaited V-shaped recovery.               "It reflects pent-up demand, which will fade as we go down to the true level of demand in the damaged, partially-functioning, economy," he noted.             Rajan pointed out that because of the pre-pandemic growth slowdown and the government's strained fiscal condition, officials believe it cannot spend on both relief and stimulus.           "This mindset is too pessimistic, but the government will have to expand the resource envelope in every way possible and spend as cleverly as possible," he said adding it also has to take every action that can move the economy forward without additional spending.         "All this requires a more thoughtful and active government. Unfortunately, after an initial burst of activity, it seems to have retreated into a shell," the former RBI Governor added.           Noting that India needs strong growth, not just to satisfy the aspirations of country's youth but to keep its unfriendly neighbours at bay, Rajan said temporary half-baked “reforms”, such as the recent suspension of labour protection laws in a number of states, will do little to enthuse industry or workers, and give reforms a bad name.     He also suggested that reforms can be a form of stimulus, and even if not carried out immediately, a timeline to undertake them can boost current investor sentiment.           "The world will recover earlier than India, so exports can be a way for India to grow," he said.  The government in May announced nearly Rs 21 lakh crore stimulus package to help the nation tide over the economic crisis induced by the coronavirus and subsequent lockdown.         India's economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdowns weighed on the already-declining consumer demand and investment.       The GDP contraction in the world's fifth-largest economy is compared with 3.1 per cent growth in the preceding March quarter and 5.2 per cent expansion in the same period a year back.This is the sharpest contraction since quarterly figures started getting published in 1996 and worse than what was expected by most analysts.        The Indian economy was in a troubled state when the pandemic hit the world. Before the crisis hit India, the economy was already decelerating, real GDP growth had moderated from 7 per cent in 2017-18 to 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 and 4.2 per cent in 2019-20. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fall-in-gdp-alarming-time-for-bureaucracy-to-take-meaningful-action-rajan-137669

Many members have got their tests done privately, allow them in if their reports are negative," Pawar told the legislature staff.According to Vidhan Bhavan sources, as many as 2,115 samples for coronavirus tests were collected from legislators, ministers, bureaucrats, legislature staff members and journalists over the weekend.So far, 58 samples have tested positive, the sources said.Meanwhile, some opposition MLAs staged a protest on the stairs of the Vidhan Bhavan building, demanding to scrap of the regional reservation for medical admissions.State officials have put in place a slew of measures to ensure members of the legislature do not contract COVID-19 and House proceedings go on without any hindrance.Compulsory antigen tests for legislators, distribution of COVID-19 kits and a new seating arrangement to ensure physical distancing among members are some of the measures undertaken for the two-day session, Vidhan Bhavan officials earlier said.The shortest-ever monsoon session in the history of the Maharashtra legislature is taking place in the backdrop of a raging COVID-19 pandemic which has already infected more than nine lakh people in the state.The brief session will take up supplementary demands and certain bills, among other legislature work.

"GOI will launch an intensive drive to identify Severely Acute Malnourished (SAM) children and ensure adequate nutrition & care; this will have a long term impact on the health of the child & go a long way in improving India's nutrition indices," Irani's post on Twitter read.Besides, the Central government is also developing Bharatiya Poshan Krishi Kosh - a repository of an indigenous crop of every region, every district of India. "We also aim to form a database of indigenous recipes of every corner of the country," she informed further.The government is celebrating September as a "nutrition month". In the latest offering of "Mann Ki Baat", PM Modi declared September as the "nutrition month". He stressed the need for adequate nutrition for mother and child. He also called for people's participation. He had informed several activities, including quizzes and competitions, which would be hosted on the MyGov portal.The malnutrition in children is a mammoth health issue the country is facing right now. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 4, 2015-16, every second child in India suffers from at least one form of nutrition failure. It might be stunting, under-weight, or wasting, according to the survey conducted in 2015-16. These figures translate to about 77 million undernourished children in India.The NFHS survey outlined that India has 38.4 per cent stunted, 35.8 per cent underweight, 21 per cent wasted, and 7.5 per cent severely wasted children aged less than five years. In the last decade, severe acute malnutrition has increased from 6.4 per cent (NFHS-3, 2005-06) to 7.5 per cent (NFHS -4, 2015-16) in India.While the malnutrition in children already reigned a major health issue, it exacerbated during the lockdown. A study published in July had estimated that the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus-led pandemic could contribute to food shocks, which in turn, increase the chances of malnutrition, said the study published in the journal Global Health Science on July 16.The study attempted to estimate children who can suffer from a small food shock and fall to the threshold of the malnourished category. It also provided estimates in several scenarios from bodyweight shock of 0.5-5 per cent.The study accounted that 5 million children are at risk of falling in the wasting category of malnourishment, while an additional 2 million children are at risk of being pushed into the severe wasting category, the study pointed out.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-to-launch-nutrition-drive-for-severely-acute-malnourished-children-137665

He was admitted to the TMU's corona ward on September 4 after having tested positive for COVID.The hospital staff said that he was under a 'lot of stress and even had arguments with the hospital staff'.Moradabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary said, "Prima facie it seems to be a case of suicide but we are waiting for the autopsy report." The policeman was a native of Badaun, but was living in Moradabad's Hanuman Nagar. His family lives in Subhash Nagar area of Bareilly.Earlier, two patients, one of them a woman, had committed suicide in a similar manner after testing positive for COVID."It is worrying that suicide cases of Covid-19 positive patients are being reported from TMU. We are scanning the CCTV footage. A separate magisterial inquiry has been ordered to probe this matter," the SSP said.The university has been served a notice under section 149 of CrPC to ensure prevention of cognizable offence in future and ensure proper monitoring.Nodal officer of Covid-19 care centre in Moradabad, Dr V. K. Singh, said, "The head constable, who was admitted to the COVID facility here on September 4, was suffering from stress. He had even indulged in scuffles and arguments with the hospital staff and was given counselling by doctors. However, it is unfortunate that he decided to end his life despite the best efforts being made by the hospital staff." "As a precautionary measure, windows will now have iron grills for better security of the patients. So far, over 2,600 COVID positive patients from Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal, Rampur and Amroha districts have been treated at the L-3 COVID centre of TMU.

07-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Metro resumes services with strict safety measures after 169-day Covid hiatus||The Delhi Metro resumed services with curtailed operations on the Yellow Line on Monday after being closed for over five months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as both the DMRC and the commuters trod with caution amid the new normal in the rapid transport system.The trains will operate in batches of four-hour each from 7-11 am and 4-8 pm, officials said.The services resumed at 7 am with strict safety and social distancing measures in place. The first trains left from Samaypur Badli station to HUDA City Centre station and simultaneously from HUDA City Centre to Samaypur Badli, a senior official of DMRC said."We are on our way. It's been 169 days since we've seen you! Travel responsibly and commute if it's only necessary. #MetroBackOnTrack," the DMRC tweeted and posted a video clip of the first train leaving HUDA City Centre. No stations on the Yellow Line were closed as none is in proximity to any containment zone, the official said.As the day began, some riders wearing protective masks were seen entering the premises of key stations like Kashmere Gate and Hauz Khas on the Yellow Line, which connects Samyapur Badli in Delhi to HUDA City Centre in Gurugram."A few happy faces from our first journey after more than 5 months. #MetroBackOnTrack," the DMRC said in another tweet and posted pictures of some commuters wearing masks inside train coaches.On the station premises, passengers were permitted to enter the concourse only after temperature checks with thermal guns and sanitisation of hands.Hundreds of Delhi Metro ground staff and Central Industrial Security Force personnel wore face shields, masks and gloves as preventive measures against the pathogen.The Home Ministry had recently issued guidelines allowing metro services in the country to resume operations in a graded manner, following which the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had said it would be done in three stages from September 7-12.Under stage one, Yellow Line or Line 2 and Rapid Metro were made operational with restricted service hours, a DMRC official said.Metro services in the National Capital Region were closed since March 22 due to the pandemic.The DMRC has appealed to people to use the rapid transport only if urgently needed.Wearing of masks inside train coaches and station premises is mandatory, and those found violating the guidelines would be fined.The metro services resumed a day after Delhi registered 3,256 new coronavirus cases, the highest single-day spike in 72 days, taking the tally to over 1.91 lakh.Commuters are returning to the Delhi Metro stations and coaches after a huge gap of 169 days, with COVID-19 completely changing the paradigm of operations.Use of Aarogya Setu App by commuters is advisable, the DMRC has said.In keeping with the new normal, the Delhi Metro has taken a slew of measures to ensure least physical contact for riders, like automated thermal screening-cum-sanitiser dispenser and lift-calling system driven by a foot pedal at several stations.Inside coaches, commuters are to sit on alternate seats and maintain prescribed distance even while standing. Stickers have been put up on alternate seats and on platforms so that riders adhere to social-distancing norms.Special posters have been put up inside coaches and on station premises to raise awareness, besides regular announcements on safety norms.The DMRC had also appealed to commuters on Sunday to "talk less inside trains to prevent the possibility of short-range aerosol transmission".Officials of the urban transporter had earlier cautioned that "trains may not stop at some of the stations" if social-distancing norms were not adhered to."This is a new normal and an evolving scenario, so we will anyway be assessing the situation as we go along," an official said.The DMRC has 10 lines spanning 242 stations, including the Rapid Metro in Gurugram."Today and tomorrow, only the Yellow Line (49-km span with 37 stations -- 20 underground and 17 elevated ones) will remain operational for a period of four hours each (7 am to 11 am) and (4 pm to 8 pm)," the DMRC said."Trains will be available with a headway (frequency) varying from 2'44" to 5'28" (at different stretches) with 57 trains performing around 462 trips. The same will be further extended in a graded manner from September 9-12 along with other lines," it said on Sunday.Over a period of next five days, rest of the lines will also be made operational with all safety measures, officials said.In lifts, only three people at maximum can ride at a time. The stoppage duration of trains at a station has been increased from 10-15 seconds to 20-25 seconds, and at interchange facilities, from 35-40 seconds to 55-60 seconds."Commuters showing COVID-like symptoms will not be allowed to travel and they will be directed to the nearest health care facility," the official said.Inside stations, entries to which have been heavily curtailed, the CISF staff performed "contactless frisking" and red lines drawn at a gap of 1 ft near automated fare collection gates and on the concourse.Only smart card users were allowed to travel, which can be recharged digitally without any human interface, the official said, adding tokens were not to be issued as per the plan.Recharge or purchase of smart cards at ticket vending machines or customer care centre will be through cashless mode only, the official said.On regular days, the average daily ridership of the Delhi Metro is over 26 lakh.
