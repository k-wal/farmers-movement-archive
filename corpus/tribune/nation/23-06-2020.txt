23-06-2020||New Delhi||CBI books Videocon group chairman for 'corruption' in financing oil and gas assets in Mozambique||The CBI on Tuesday booked Videocon Group Chairman Venugopal Dhoot for alleged corruption in the financing of their oil and gas assets in Mozambique in connivance with unidentified officials of a State Bank of India-led consortium, officials said.The agency has registered the FIR after a preliminary enquiry on a complaint from the Oil Ministry.Dhoot did not offer any comment on the development.The enquiry findings show that in 2008, Videocon Hydrocarbons Holding Limited (VHHL), a subsidiary of the Videocon Industries Limited (VIL), acquired 10 per cent “participating interest” in Oil and Gas Block in Rovuma Area 1 block, Mozambique, from the US-based Anadarko.The Mozambique asset was later acquired by ONGC Videsh Limited and Oil India Limited in January 2014, for $2,519 million, they said.In April 2012, a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India, and comprising of ICICI bank and IDBI bank, sanctioned Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC) facility of $2,773.60 million to VHHL for appraisal and development of their overseas oil and gas assets in Mozambique, Brazil and Indonesia and other funding requirements in relation to refinancing the existing facility.The SBLC facility of $1,103 million was refinanced which included an outstanding of $400 million to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), London.“The first charge on VIL's oil and gas asset was a part of SCB's security,” the FIR said.About 10 months later, VIL told the consortium that SCB loan has increased to $530 million, requesting to pay it and take over charge of oil and gas assets.The consortium allegedly approved the increased amount without any verification or inquiry, the agency said.After the payment, the consortium should have taken the charge on the gas and oil assets of VIL and the loan account of SCB should have been closed by VHH, it said.Neither the consortium created the charge on oil and gas assets nor did VHHL close the loan account with SCB, it alleged.Videocon did not inform the consortium that it was continuing to avail loan from the SCB and the lenders also did not ask for NOC from SCB about the closure, it said.The consortium never took charge of Mozambique assets and the charge of Indonesia and Brazil was taken over in November 2013 only from SCB, it said.ONGC Videsh and Oil India needed ‘no objections’ from lending banks before making payments for Mozambique assets then in November 2013 VIL asked the consortium to pay outstanding of SCB London from the sale proceeds, it said.The consortium did not object that it had already paid the outstanding of SCB in February 2013, the agency alleged.The consortium agreed to clear the outstanding dues towards the SCB, subject to a cap of $650 million but instead ended up paying $704.45 million to SCB, London, from sale proceeds in connivance with bank officers, it alleged.The agency found that VIL diverted funds of SCB, London, only spending $374 million, $554.82 million and $25.25 million on its assets in Mozambique, Indonesia and Brazil respectively as against the facility of $1616 million availed by VHHL, it said.“The facts and circumstance prima facie show that unknown officers of lender banks led by SBI in conspiracy with Venugopal Dhoot, CMD of Videocon Industries Limited allowed VHHL, to continue to the avail the facility from SCB, London, with dishonest intention by not creating a charge on Mozambique asset and thereby cause wrongful gain to Videocon and wrongful loss to Indian PSU banks,” it alleged.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||PIL filed in SC on CA examination||A petition has been filed before the Supreme Court seeking more centres and a stay on the ‘opt-out’ scheme for about 4.67 lakh CA aspirants for examination to be conducted between July 29 and August 16 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The petition, which is scheduled to come up for hearing in the coming days, claimed that the notification issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on June 15 violates the fundamental rights of the students.The PIL, filed by Alakh Alok Srivastava on behalf of ‘India Wide Parents Association’, said that ICAI announced it will conduct the May 2020 cycle Chartered Accountants examination between July 29 to August 16.                   “Now it has notified a highly discriminatory and arbitrary ‘opt-out’ option...,” adding the ICAI has notified that for the students who choose this option, their attempt (May 2020) will be treated as cancelled or not counted.“The ‘opt-out’ option discriminates between those underprivileged group of CA students/ aspirants, who are living in remote areas of the country or living in the containment zones and thus are slated to lose one precious ‘examination attempt’ by choosing ‘opt-out’ option amidst ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to that privileged group of students/ aspirants, who are living in big cities/ green zones and thus they have no problem in appearing in the said examination,” it said.Students who choose opt-out will be deprived of the May 2020 attempt, as compared to other group of students who go in for ‘opt-in’ option.“Hence, the petitioner is praying this court to forthwith quash and set aside the aforesaid Important Announcement dated June 15,” it said.It further sought an increase in the number of examination centres so as to ensure that at least one examination centre is kept in every district of India.It said that there are about 4.67 lakh aspirants, who are scheduled to appear in the examinations, at about 259 examination centres in India and five centres overseas.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||India develops vehicle-mounted ULV sprayer for locust control||The government on Tuesday said the country had developed an indigenous vehicle-mounted ultra-low volume (ULV) sprayer for locust control, and approvals for its commercial launch are underway.Currently, the sole supplier of vehicle-mounted sprayers is the UK-based Micron Sprayers. The country in February placed an order for import of 60 such sprayers.Locust is a crop-threatening migratory pest that has entered the country through the India-Pakistan border. The control operations are in full swing to stop this menace.“The other approvals required for commercial launch are underway. This is a major breakthrough as this will end the dependence of importing very important equipment of locust control,” the agriculture ministry said in a statement.The Ministry got a prototype of the sprayer developed through an Indian manufacturer. Already, its trials had been conducted successfully in Ajmer and Bikaner districts of Rajasthan, it said.“Meanwhile, the government has expedited the supply of imported sprayers for locust control. So far, only 15 sprayers have been received. The supply of the rest of 45 units would be completed within a month’s time,” it added.Laying emphasis on the need of exploring aerial spray for locust control, the Ministry said the ground control vehicles with sprayers used for locust control could spray up to a height of 25 to 30 feet only. The tractor-mounted sprayers also have a limitation in reaching inaccessible areas and tall trees.For effective control of locust swarms, the government has also issued a standard operating procedure (SoP) for aerial spraying of insecticides by drones, airplanes and helicopters.Five drone service providers have started work at Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Nagore and Phalodi (Jodhpur) district of Rajasthan with the deployment of 12 drones till date in a phased manner.“The experience of use of drones has been more than satisfactory in inaccessible areas and for effective control over tall trees. The deployment of drones has added another dimension in the capabilities of Locust Circle offices to ensure effective control over desert locust,” the Ministry said.The UN body Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has appreciated India to be the first country in the world that is using a drone for locust control, it added.

CCTV cameras installed in the area are being scanned to identify them. No action has been taken yet in this matter,” a police official said.The police also said the poster was later found removed, but could not tell who took it down.According to officials of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which maintains signages in the area, their field staff did not find the board defaced when they visited there.This is not the first time the right-wing outfit has blackened the road signs in the national capital.In May 2015, signboards of roads named after Muslim rulers Akbar and Feroz Shah were defaced, and posters of the right-wing group Shiv Sena Hindustan were pasted on them.Last year, the Babar Road signboard in Bengali Market area in Delhi was blackened by the Hindu Sena workers, demanding that the name of the road be changed.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||ITBP scales up LAC presence amid COVID-19 precautions||The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has begun deployment of 40 fresh companies across various locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in view of the ongoing standoff and violent clashes between the armies of the two countries, officials said on Tuesday.The border guarding force is also moving its mechanised column assets like SUVs, all-terrain vehicles, snow scooters and trucks to forward locations in the midst of the projected increase in the number of troops at border units and fresh directives to undertake “additional” patrols.They said all these units, with an operational strength of about 4,000 mountain-warfare trained troops, are being withdrawn from internal security duties from various parts of the country.About 40 ITBP companies are being withdrawn and are being mobilised to various locations along the LAC in various sectors including Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, official sources said.They said the frontier formations of the force have been asked to prepare quarantine facilities for these new units as they are coming from the mainland and their exposure to the coronavirus pandemic cannot be ignored.These troops, during their two weeks quarantine, will also have the opportunity to prepare and acclimatise for high-altitude deployment along LAC that is marked by freezing temperatures and thin oxygen levels, they said.A “good number” of officers who command companies and battalions are also being posted at the two newly operationalised commands of the force—western headquartered at Chandigarh and eastern at Guwahati, they said.An Inspector General (IG) was given the charge of the command in Chandigarh recently while the one at Guwahati is being looked after by an IG based in Delhi.The commands are supposed to be headed by Additional Director General (ADG) rank officers but the nearly-90,000 personnel strong force, at present, has none.It is understood that the force has sought the Union Home Ministry’s intervention in filling up vacant posts at the senior level.Sources said while 15 ITBP companies were recently withdrawn from various locations of the country including Jammu, the rest are being pulled out from Delhi, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh and few other locations.Apart from these 40, it is expected that 20 more such units could be withdrawn over a period of time so that an “optimum” presence of the force is maintained across 180 border posts and over 50 ‘staging camps’ or temporary bases along the 3,488 km LAC that stretches from Karakoram Pass in Ladakh to Jachep La in Arunachal Pradesh.ITBP Director General (DG) SS Deswal also reviewed the deployment of the force in the Ladakh area after he visited the north-west frontier based in Leh along with senior army commanders on Saturday.The sources said the DG reviewed the COVID-19 quarantine and mountain acclimatisation facilities available with the force in this area and directed that freshly recruited and young troops in the age group of 35-40 years should be sent to those locations that have harsh climatic conditions and are witnessing standoffs like the Galwan valley and Pangong Tso areas.Deswal had told PTI last month that the force has delayed the annual battalion changeover plans in view of the coronavirus outbreak and for two battalions of the force deployed in “extremely hard areas” the decision was to be taken after July.However, officials said, this changeover may further be delayed as the units guarding the border posts and present along with the army troops in view of the present standoff and clashes with Chinese troops, have been asked to undertake more short-range and long-range patrols.The ITBP will keep doing its job and in view of the ongoing tension especially after the violent clashes that led to 20 army troops laying down their lives in the line of duty, the force will assist the army as directed, the sources said.The force was raised in the aftermath of the 1962 Chinese aggression and about 35 of its 60 battalions are deployed for border guarding along the LAC and its posts are located between 9,000 feet-18,700 feet in the western, middle and eastern sectors of this front.

The activities of the two officials caught red-handed and expelled on May 31 was one example in that regard,” said an MEA statement.While their officials indulged in actions that are not in conformity with their status in the High Commission, Pakistan has in parallel engaged in a sustained campaign to intimidate Indian High Commission officials in Islamabad from carrying on their legitimate diplomatic functions.“The recent abduction at gunpoint of two Indian officials and their ‘severe ill-treatment’ underlines the extent to which Pakistan has gone in that direction. These officials, who returned to India on June 22, have provided graphic details of the barbaric treatment that they experienced at the hands of Pakistani agencies,” said the MEA.It felt that the behaviour of Pakistan and its officials was not in conformity with the Vienna Convention and the bilateral agreements on the treatment of diplomatic and consular officials. On the contrary, it is an intrinsic element of a larger policy of supporting cross-border violence and terrorism, the MEA added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-accuses-pakistan-of-espionage-activities-asks-to-cut-diplomatic-staff-by-half-103213
23-06-2020||Patna||RJD suffers split in Bihar Upper House, Raghuvansh quits top party post||In a huge setback for the RJD in the election year, five of its MLCs Tuesday resigned from the party, forced a split in its legislature group in the Bihar legislative council, and joined the ruling JD (U) headed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.The development came on a day when former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, one of the founding members of the RJD and a staunch supporter of its jailed supremo Lalu Prasad, stepped down as national vice-president in protest against the proposed induction of one of his rivals.The five MLCs SM Qamar Alam, Sanjay Prasad, Radha Charan Seth, Ranvijay Kumar Singh and Dilip Rai met Vidhan Parishad Acting Chairman Awadhesh Narain Singh in his chamber and personally handed over their resignation letters, officials of the Upper House of the bicameral legislature said.They also requested Singh that they be recognised as a separate group and allowed to merge with the JD (U).The JD (U)s chief whip in the Upper House Reena Yadav arrived with the party’s letter of consent and the Acting Chairman gave his prompt approval.The development, which blindsided the RJD, reduced the party’s strength in the 75-member Vidhan Parishad to just three.Sources in the ruling NDA were hopeful that Rabri Devi, the wife of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and a national vice-president herself, may lose her position as the leader of the opposition in the House.Under the rules, the main opposition party must have at least 10 per cent of the total seats in the House for its leader to qualify for the post of the Leader of the Opposition, a Cabinet minister rank position.Meanwhile, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who has stood with the party through thick and thin, shot off a letter announcing his resignation from the post expressing strong displeasure over the state of affairs in the RJD.Singh, who is currently admitted to AIIMS, Patna, undergoing treatment for COVID-19, made it clear that he was not quitting the party but added he was extremely unhappy over the type of people the RJD was planning to induct.  Sources close to the RJD veteran, a former Union minister, confirmed that his displeasure stemmed from reports that Rama Singh, a mafia don-turned-politician to whom he lost his Vaishali Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, may join the party.Rama Singh has severed his ties with Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP, which had fielded him in the 2014 poll but refused to grant him a ticket five years later.JD (U) national general secretary and leader in the Lok Sabha Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh held out an olive branch to Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, saying the RJD has never respected those who have built the organisation.“It is beholden to the interests of just one family. If he wishes to join us, he is welcome.Raghuvansh Prasad Singh is known to be not on the best of terms with Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu Prasad's heir apparent, Tejashwi is the leader of the opposition in the state assembly and the RJD has already declared him the party's chief ministerial candidate for the state elections likely in October-November.Ever since the RJD was mauled in the Lok Sabha polls last year, when it drew a blank, the veteran leader has been making a strong pitch for wooing Nitish Kumar back into the Grand Alliance and taking advantage of the frequent differences that have plagued the relations between the JD (U) and the BJP.His suggestions have, however, invariably been dismissed by Tejashwi Yadav, leaving the rebuffed veteran licking his wounds.The developments come days ahead of elections to nine seats of the Bihar Vidhan Parishad from the Vidhan Sabha quota where MLAs vote to elect MLCs. The RJD, which has 80 MLAs, has decided to field three candidates.The party is yet to announce their names and, in the light of the mayhem, it faces the challenge of keeping its flock together.Meanwhile, the turmoil in the RJD provided its sulking ally, the Hindustani Awam Morcha of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi with a chance to hit back at the domineering partner.“The RJD is suffering the consequences of ignoring its loyal grassroots level workers to win over those with deep pockets or muscle power. It must mend its ways and start treating its own people besides alliance partners with respect,” HAM spokesman Danish Rizwan said."Otherwise a day may come when the RJD will become isolated, with only the members of Lalu Prasads family by its side.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rjd-suffers-split-in-bihar-upper-house-raghuvansh-quits-top-party-post-103208
23-06-2020||New Delhi||India considering establishing 'bilateral bubbles' with US, UK, France and Germany for air travel||India is considering establishing "individual bilateral bubbles" with the US, the UK, Germany and France allowing airlines of each country in the pact to operate international passenger flights, said the Aviation Ministry on Tuesday.The ministry's statement has come after the US Department of Transportation announced on Monday that it has barred Air India from operating chartered flights between India and the United States from July 22 without its prior approval, in an apparent retaliation for the Indian government not allowing American carriers to operate between the two countries.The Aviation Ministry said, "As we contemplate further opening up in response to demands, we are looking at the prospect of establishing individual bilateral bubbles, India-US, India-France, India-Germany, India-UK. These are all destinations where demand for travel has not diminished. Final decisions pursuant to negotiations are expected to be taken soon.""We have received requests from authorities in several countries including the US, France, Germany among others requesting that their air carriers be allowed to participate in the transportation of passengers along the line being conducted by Air India under Vande Bharat Mission. These requests are being examined," it added.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 25 due to the coronavirus pandemic.Air India started international chartered flights under Vande Bharat Mission from May 6 to help people stranded amid the pandemic reach their destinations.The US Department of Transport (DOT) said on Monday it appears that Air India may be using its passenger repatriation charters as a way of circumventing Government of India-imposed prohibition of all scheduled international services.   "We are taking this action (of allowing only those Air India flights from July 22 that have DOT's approval) because Government of India has impaired the operating rights of US carriers and has engaged in discriminatory and restrictive practices with respect to US carrier services to and from India," the DOT said.The Aviation Ministry said on Tuesday that it had one round of negotiations with the representatives of the DOT and US Embassy on June 15 about letting American carriers operate flights."They were invited to submit precise proposals in this respect.  A communication has now been received on 19 June, 2020 detailing these requests," the ministry said.Air India has been operating chartered flights on Indo-US routes since May 18 where tickets on both the legs are sold.While tickets on the India-US leg are sold through Air India's website to the public, the seats on the US-India leg have to be purchased after contacting the Indian Embassy in the US. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said on June 20 that the government will start thinking on resumption scheduled international passenger flights in mid-July, when it expects the domestic air traffic to reach 50-55 per cent of the levels before the coronavirus.After nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak, the government resumed scheduled domestic passenger flights from May 25 but in a curtailed manner and by placing lower and upper limits on airfares depending upon the flight duration.Moreover, Puri had said on June 20 that during phase 3 and phase 4 of the Vande Bharat mission, private domestic airlines have been approved to operate 750 international flights to repatriate people stranded amid the coronavirus pandemic. Phase 3 of Vande Bharat Mission began on June 10. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-considering-establishing-bilateral-bubbles-with-us-uk-france-and-germany-for-air-travel-103202

Many injuries resurface due to this torture. There was formation of pus and swelling in my eyes and brain."I have blurred vision in the right eye and I can't see at all from the left one," she had said, apparently referring to her imprisonment in the 2008 Malegaon blast case in which she is an accused.

23-06-2020||---||Elgar case transfer: Bombay HC seeks response of NIA, Centre and Maharashtra||Mumbai, June 23The Bombay High Court on Tuesday sought responses from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Central and Maharashtra governments on a petition filed by two accused challenging transfer of the Elgar Parishad case probe from the Pune police to the NIA.A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and Abhay Ahuja directed the Union government, the NIA and the state government to file their affidavits, and posted the petition for further hearing on July 14.The petition was filed by human rights lawyer Surendra Gadling and activist Sudhir Dhawale who are lodged in Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai.In their petition filed last week through advocate S B Talekar, Gadling and Dhawale had alleged that the transfer of the probe was done by the Central government, after the BJP lost power in Maharashtra and that the decision was “politically motivated”.“The transfer order is arbitrary, discriminatory, unjust and violative of the fundamental rights of the accused persons in the case,” the petition said.“The then BJP-led state government with Hindutva agency used the incident of violence at Koregaon Bhima in Pune in December 2017- January 2018 to target influential Dalit thinkers by showing theElgarParishadmeeting as part of a Maoist movement,” the petition said.It added that “political expediency” cannot be a ground to invoke powers of the NIA Act and transfer probe.The petition further claimed that the NIA Act, 2008, does not permit transfer of a case after completion of investigation and commencement of trial, particularly when there are no compelling circumstances necessitating such a transfer.The case, in which several other rights activists have been arrested and accused of having Moist links, was transferred from the Pune police to the NIA on January 24 this year.Gadling and Dhawale were arrested in June 2018 and are currently lodged at the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai.Apart from Gadling and Dhawale, the other arrested accused include Rona Wilson, Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Shoma Sen, Vernon Gonsalves, Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira and Sudha Bharadwaj.They have been accused of having Maoist links and were booked under the stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).According to prosecution, inflammatory speeches and provocative statements made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017 triggered caste violence at Koregaon Bhima the next day.Police suspect that the conclave was backed by Maoists.

Huge crowds throng the festival venues during the 10-day festival and the immersion of the idols in the sea on the last day brings lakhs of people onto the roads where social distancing is impossible, the Chief Minister had pointed out.The state government has announced that it would not allow public immersion of idols in Mumbai’s beaches and public places.BrihanMumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav president Samanvay Samiti Naresh Dahibhavkar had earlier urged people to install the paper images of Ganesh instead of idols of the Lord during the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/corona-shrinks-mumbais-famed-gigantic-ganesh-idols-103197

Our relations with our once friendly neighbours lie in tatters. Our time tested relationship with our traditional allies has been interrupted,” he said.Gandhi suggested that India should build a good relationship with the United States and other countries and must also maintain its ties with its old friends.“China has brazenly occupied our territory. The PM has destroyed our position and betrayed our Army by accepting their position that they occupied no Indian land.“The Chinese can’t be permitted to get away with this unacceptable usurpation of our land,” he said, adding that everything needs to be done to ensure that sacrifice of our martyrs is not in vain.

It had also issued an advisory to all Chief Ministers on March 24 to this effect.About 1.75 crore transactions were done directly into the bank accounts of the workers through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). Apart from cash benefits ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 6,000 per worker during the lockdown, some of the states have also provided food and ration to their workers.The Ministry acted as the nodal authority during the lockdown to coordinate with all state governments and State Welfare Boards in the matter of the welfare of the construction workers, including timely cash transfers to them.The Building and Other Construction Workers Act was enacted to regulate the employment and conditions of service of these workers and to provide for their safety, health and welfare measures.Under the Cess Act, the state governments through their State Welfare Boards are mandated to frame and implement welfare schemes for construction workers. The fund comprises the cess at the rate of one per cent of construction costs which is levied and collected by the state governments and remitted to the Welfare Fund.In the March 24 advisory, the states were asked to frame a scheme under the Acts for transfer of adequate funds in the bank accounts of construction workers through DBT mode. The amount to be granted to the construction workers was to be decided by the respective state governments necessary for their subsistence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/labour-ministry-to-launch-a-drive-to-enable-unregistered-construction-workers-avail-welfare-schemes-103195
23-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi violence: HC grants bail to pregnant JNU student Safoora Zargar||The Delhi High Court Tuesday granted bail to Safoora Zargar, the pregnant Jamia university student who was arrested under anti-terror law UAPA in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta did not oppose the court’s decision on humanitarian grounds.At the outset, Mehta, representing Delhi Police, submitted that Zargar can be released on regular bail on humanitarian grounds and the decision has not been taken on merits of the case and should not be made a precedent.Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, released Zargar, who is 23-weeks pregnant, on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 and surety of the like amount.The court said she shall not indulge in any activity for which she is being investigated and shall not hamper or interfere with the on-going investigation or influence the witnesses.It also said that in case Zargar needs to travel, she has to seek permission from the trial court and will remain in touch with the investigating officer of the case over mobile phone once in 15 days.Mehta, who was briefed by advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, said the order which is based on concession shall not be cited or treated as a precedent in any other case. “Without in any manner conceding to the factual assertions and legal submissions made by the petitioner and without in any manner diluting the contents and submissions made in the reply filed thereto and without making it a precedent either in on-going investigations or any other investigation, purely on humanitarian ground, the prosecution agrees if the petitioner is released on regular bail,” said the statement read out in the court by Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi.Mehta also urged the court to impose certain bail conditions on the accused woman.Advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, representing Zargar, said she has no difficulty with the statement made by the Solicitor General.The court made it clear that the order is not passed on merits and it should not be treated as precedent.On Monday, Mehta had sought a day’s time to take instructions on the issue.Delhi Police, in its status report, opposed Zargar’s bail plea saying a clear and cogent case has been made out against her as such she is not entitled to bail in view of grave and serious offences, which have been "meticulously and surreptitiously planned and executed by her".The police said there is strong, cogent, reliable and sufficient material available proving the direct involvement of Zargar, M Phil student of Jamia Millia Islamia University.The police said she has been lodged in a separate cell and chances of her contracting coronavirus from any other person do not arise.Further, it maintained that there is no exception carved out for a pregnant inmate who is accused of such heinous a crime to be released on bail merely because of pregnancy.The police said that 39 deliveries have taken place in Delhi prisons in the last 10 years.Jamia Coordination Committee member Zargar, who was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police on April 10, had challenged in the high court the June 4 order of the trial court denying her bail in the case.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and scores injured.The report, filed through DCP of special cell, said statements of witnesses and co-accused clearly implicate Zargar as being a leading co-conspirator in commissioning of serious offence of causing large-scale disruption and riots, not only in Delhi but also in other parts of the country.“The present case pertains to grave offence against the society and nation. The investigation is at a very crucial juncture, and therefore, considering the sensitivity and the broad nefarious conspectus of present case, it would not be in the interest of justice as well as in public interest to grant bail to the accused at the present stage,” it said.The report said the motive and the idea behind this conspiracy was ‘to go to any extent possible’, be it a small scuffle with the police during blockage or instigation of riots between two communities or to advocate and “execute a secessionist movement in the country by propagating an armed rebellion against the lawfully constituted government of the day”.It was decided that the “anti-government feeling of Muslims” will be used at an appropriate time to destabilise the government, the police claimed.The protests were carried out during the visit of US President Donald Trump to India “to attract international media attention to propogate a narrative that the Government of the day was anti-Muslim”, the report said. “This sinister and nefarious conspiracy was designed in various levels according to which the facade of a civil disobedience or protest was to be maintained to buckle the government to agree to the illegitimate demands of the accused,” it said.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Jaishankar stresses on need to follow ethos of international relations in presence of Chinese FM at RIC meet||In an address at a virtual conference of the Russia-India-China trilateral, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday underlined the need for recognising legitimate interest of partners in a multilateral set-up and following ethos of international relations.His comments in presence of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi came in the midst of an escalating border row between India and China following killing of 20 Indian soldiers in the Galwan Valley clash.Last week, India termed the killing of Indian soldiers a “premeditated and planned action” by the Chinese troops.“This special meeting reiterates our belief in the time-tested principles of international relations. But the challenge today is not just one of concepts and norms, but equally of their practice,” Jaishankar said.“The leading voices of the world must be exemplars in every way. Respecting international law, recognising the legitimate interests of partners, supporting multilateralism and promoting common good are the only way of building a durable world order,” he added.The external affairs minister’s comments are seen as an indirect message to China which has been adopting an aggressive posturing along its land boundary with India besides increasing its activities in the Indian Ocean region.In his initial remarks, Jaishankar also said that India did not get its due recognition in the global order post World War II and that the historical injustice remained “uncorrected” for the last 75 years.“When the victors met to fashion the ensuing global order, the political circumstances of that era did not give India due recognition. This historical injustice has stood uncorrected for the last 75 years, even as the world has changed,” he said.Therefore, he said, it was important for the world to realise both the contribution that India made and the need to rectify the past.The external affairs minister also spoke about the need for reforming the United Nations so that it can represent the current reality of the globe.“But beyond history, international affairs must also come to terms with contemporary reality. The United Nations began with 50 members; today it has 193. Surely, its decision making cannot continue to be in denial of this fact,” he said.“We, the RIC countries, have been active participants in shaping the global agenda. It is India’s hope that we will also now converge on the value of reformed multilateralism,” Jaishankar added.India was initially reluctant to join the Russia-India-China trilateral foreign ministers’ meeting following the Galwan Valley clashes but agreed to participate in it following a request from Moscow, the host of the conference. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-stresses-on-need-to-follow-ethos-of-international-relations-in-presence-of-chinese-fm-at-ric-meet-103184

23-06-2020||Haridwar/New Delhi||Ramdev's Patanjali claims to have COVID-19 tablets, 'Coronil'; 100% recovery in 7 days||Yoga guru Ramdev's herbal medicine company Patanjali Ayurved on Tuesday claimed to have discovered a cure for coronavirus but no medical authority could immediately vouch for the claim of 'Coronil and Swasari' medicine curing the highly contagious disease within seven days.The firm claimed that the two Ayurved-based medicines have shown 100 per cent favourable results during clinical trials on COVID-19 infected patients except those on a life support system.The medicines have been developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar and privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur following all protocols with clinically controlled trial-based evidence, Ramdev told PTI in a telephonic interaction with PTI."Patanjali first conducted a clinical case study and conducted clinical control trials following all protocols of drug discovery," he said.Sidestepping questions on the drug being approved by government agencies such as ICMR, Ramdev said clinical controlled study of these medicines was done in several cities including Delhi, Ahmedabad and Meerut and the RCT (Randomized Clinical Trial) controlled with placebo were conducted at Jaipur-based National Institute of Medical Sciences & Research."This was done after getting approval from Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) and all other required formalities," he said."We have followed all the parameters set up by modern science for such clinical trials."Both the Ministry of Ayush and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have reportedly refused to comment on the claim citing lack of knowledge of the issue.A government notification bars companies from advertising a cure without government approval.Ramdev claimed that his ayurvedic drugs have shown 100 per cent favourable results during the clinical trial.At a launch press conference in Haridwar, he said, "The whole country and the world was waiting for the medicine or vaccine for coronavirus. We are proud to announce that the first ayurvedic, clinically controlled trial based evidence and research-based medicine has been prepared by the combined efforts of Patanjali Research Centre and National Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS)".Also read: Centre tells Patanjali to stop advertising COVID-19 therapy, prove claims scientifically first"We conducted a clinical case study and clinical controlled trial, and found 69 per cent patients recovered in 3 days and 100 patients recovered in 7 days," he added.According to him, this medicine is useful for prevention from COVID-19 and also for treatment.He claimed that no infected patient lost his life during the trial.Ramdev also claimed that during the trial other complications of patients were also cured and their critical parameters were normalised."Even parameters as hsCRP and IL-6 levels were also controlled during the trials," he added.The test has been done on all kinds of patients except those who are highly infected and are on life support systems as ventilators."Trials on the infected people who are on a Ventilation support system are still due," he said adding that the trial has been conducted only on a normal infected person and persons with medium infections.Ramdev further claimed, "severely infected patients, which are on a life support system, can also be cured by this medicine but trials for such cases are due in the second stage."Patanjali had started to work on corona medicines in December 2019.The Corona kit, priced at Rs 545, would be available pan India within a week. The kit will have medicines for 30 days.This is not an immunity booster but a coronavirus cure, Ramdev said.Manufactured by Haridwar-based Divya Pharmacy and Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, the medicine is the result of a research partnership between Patanjali Research Institute and the Jaipur based National Institute of Medical Sciences.Ramdev said the medicines can be ordered online through a mobile app from next Monday.The COVID-19 therapy suggested by Patanjali is applicable for adults ranging between 15-80 years of age whereas children are advised to take half the dosage prescribed for adults.Patanjali's anti-COVID tablet, Divya Coronil Tablet consists of Giloy, Tulsi and Ashwagandha and is prescribed to be taken thrice a day with hot water 30 minutes after breakfast, lunch and dinner.Medical experts, however, were not convinced by the claims made by Yoga guru Ramdev's Patanjali.Dr Ravi Shekhar Jha, Head of the department and senior consultant, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Hospital, Faridabad, said physiologically it is quite impossible that there is any medicine which can finish the viral load from the body in 5-7 days."These claims can be very harmful because people, instead of taking actual medical help, may start rushing to these kinds of claims which have no proven clinical trial," he told PTI.Instead of taking actual medical help, opting for a "desi nuskha" kind of a thing is just going to result in loss of precious time in curing the disease, Jha said.Noted city-based lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said only a proper clinical trial can prove the efficacy of the medicine.Haridwar-based Patanjali group has an estimated turnover of around Rs 10,500 crore. It had acquired debt-ridden Ruchi Soya in a corporate insolvency resolution process for around Rs 4,350 crore after competing with Adani Group.Patanjali Ayurved had reported a turnover of Rs 8,329 crore in FY 2018-19. However, the group's turnover was higher than Patanjali Ayurved consists of its FMCG business and ayurvedic medicines.Business like biscuits, noodles, dairy products, solar panel and its apparel segment Paridhan etc are not part of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.The group is also known for venturing in uncharted areas as it had in August 2018 launched a messaging app 'Kimbho', which could not take up well and is now defunct.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt takes first step towards squeezing Chinese imports||The Government has taken the first step towards squeezing Chinese imports by making it compulsory for all sellers to declare the ‘Country of Origin’ while registering their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM)—a Special Purpose Vehicle under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.The Government has left it unstated what it proposes to do next. Indications are that the selection process may quietly filter out products from China or those with high local content from the country in case there are price-competitive alternatives available. The Government has also asked sellers to state the local content percentage for all items.The portal has enabled a ‘Make in India’ filter to enable buyers to choose products that meet the minimum 50 per cent local content criteria. In case of bids, buyers can now reserve any bid for Class I Local suppliers (with local context more than 50 per cent).For those bids below Rs. 200 crore, only Class I and Class II Local Suppliers (local content more than 50 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively) are eligible to bid, with Class I suppliers getting purchase preference.Sellers who had already uploaded their products before the introduction of this new feature on GeM, have been asked to update the ‘Country of Origin’. Their products shall be removed from GeM if they fail to comply with the instructions, said an official news release.The Government says GeM has facilitated the entry of small local sellers in public procurement while implementing ‘Make in India’ and MSE Purchase Preference Policies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-takes-first-step-towards-squeezing-chinese-imports-103167
23-06-2020||New Delhi||Nadda will not dare to ask PM Modi to explain 2,264 Chinese incursions since 2015: Chidambaram||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday hit back at BJP chief JP Nadda for raising the issue of 600 Chinese incursions under the UPA rule, saying the saffron party chief will not dare to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain the “2,264 Chinese incursions since 2015”.In a series of tweets, Chidambaram said BJP president Nadda asked ex-prime minister Manmohan Singh to explain the 600 Chinese incursions into India between 2010 and 2013.“Yes, there were incursions but no Indian territory was occupied by China and no lives of Indian soldiers were lost in violent clashes.”            “Will J P Nadda please ask the present PM to explain the 2,264 Chinese incursions since 2015? I bet he will not dare to ask that question,” the former home minister said.Did BJP maintain party to party relations with the Communist Party of China during 2004-14? Answer is yes, if you have any doubt ask Mr Nitin GadkariChidambaram’s attack came following Nadda’s remarks on Monday criticising Manmohan Singh after the former PM took aim at his successor over his handling of the ongoing stand-off with China.Nadda had said Singh and his party should stop “insulting our forces” repeatedly and questioning their valour.“One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrendered hundreds of square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!” Nadda had tweeted.To attack the government, Chidambaram also cited a media report on Tuesday which  quoted official sources as saying that the Commander-level talks are aimed at “restoration of status quo ante”.“It (the report) also says that ‘China has moved up to Finger 4 and has undertaken a major build up between Finger 4 and Finger 8’,” Chidambaram said on Twitter.“All these are in Ladakh. Do these not point to Chinese incursions into and occupation of Indian territory?” he asked. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-will-not-dare-to-ask-pm-modi-to-explain-2-264-chinese-incursions-since-2015-chidambaram-103166
23-06-2020||Kolkata||Bengaluru man kills wife, flies to Kolkata, kills mother-in-law and commits suicide||A 42-year-old man on Monday allegedly shot himself after killing his mother-in-law at her flat here after flying down from Bengaluru where he had killed his wife, a Kolkata police officer said.In his suicide note, Amit Agarwal had claimed that he killed his wife Shilpi in Bengaluru before flying down to the city on Monday evening, the officer said."Agarwal was fighting a legal battle for divorce from his wife Shilpi, who was residing in Bengaluru. After learning from the suicide note, we contacted the Bengaluru Police and the DCP Whitefield, they recovered the dead body of Shilpi from a flat there," he said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Whitefield, M N Anucheth said police in Bengaluru received a message from the Kolkata Police regarding Agarwal and his suicide note.Based on inputs, a police team reached Shilpi's apartment. When she did not open the door, the lock was broken, police in Bengaluru said."The dead body of the Shilpi was found lying on the floor of the kitchen next to a cupboard," Anucheth said.He added that prima facie it looked like she was murdered but it is subject to official confirmation by post-mortem.The case has been taken up by the Mahadevpura police station, Anucheth said.The Kolkata police officer said that Agarwal killed his mother-in-law Lalita Dhandhania, around 60 years old, following an altercation."Agarwal went to his in-laws' flat around 5.30 pm and started an argument with his father-in-law Subhas Dhandhania and mother-in-law. During the conversation he got agitated and suddenly fired at Lalita at a very close range," the IPS officer said.Subhas ran out of the flat and alerted neighbours and informed the Phoolbagan Police Station, he added."When police entered the room, they found Agarwal lying in a pool of blood... and recovered the firearm, which was lying on the floor," the officer said.The matter is being probed and legal action is being taken, he said.

23-06-2020||Beijing||Armies of China, India agree to take steps to cool down situation: Chinese official||Top Chinese and Indian military commanders have arrived at a consensus on the “outstanding issues” and agreed to take necessary measures to “cool down” the situation at their borders, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday.On Monday, Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the 14 Corps, held a nearly 11-hour meeting with Commander of the Tibet Military District Maj Gen Liu Lin in an attempt to lower the temperature between the two sides.The talks were held in the midst of escalating tension between the two countries following the violent clashes in Galwan Valley last week that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead, significantly escalating the already volatile situation in the region.Asked for the details at what transpired at the meeting of the top commanders held at the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the two sides expressed the wish to control the situation through dialogue and consultation.“On June 22, the Chinese and Indian border troops held the 2nd commander-level meeting at the border areas This is also the first commander level meeting since the Galwan Valley clash happened on June 15,” he said.“This meeting showed that the two sides wish to control and alleviate the situation through dialogue and consultation.“During the meeting and based on the consensus reached at the first commanders level meeting (on June 6), the two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the outstanding issues and agreed to take necessary measures to cool down the situation,” Zhao said. The two sides agreed to continue with the dialogue and jointly work for the peace and tranquillity of the border areas, he said.To a question that Indian Army has stated that two sides have agreed to disengage the troops and whether he can confirm it, Zhao said “the specific measures are under discussion by the border troops of the two sides on the ground, I have no further information to release on this”. When asked about the Chinese casualties, he said “China and India are in dialogue and talks with each other to resolve this issue through diplomatic and military channels”.“As for what you saw in the media, for example some people alleged that casualties on the Chinese amounted to 40. I can tell you for sure this is fake news”, he said.This is the first time China has commented on the casualties. The spokesman, however did not elaborate.Ever since the clash on June 15 at the Galwan Valley between the Indian and Chinese troops, Beijing has consistently declined to reveal the details of the casualties on its side, while the official media editorials have said that China too suffered casualties.The Indian and Chinese armies are engaged in the standoff in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh. A sizeable number of Chinese Army personnel even transgressed into the Indian side of the de-facto border in several areas including Pangong Tso.The Indian Army has been fiercely objecting to the transgressions, and demanded their immediate withdrawal for restoration of peace and tranquillity in the area. Both sides held a series of talks in the last few days to resolve the border row.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Will decide by Wednesday whether to do away with remaining Classes 10, 12 exams, CBSE tells SC||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it will decide by Wednesday evening whether the remaining examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 should be done away given the situation created by COVID-19 pandemic.The process of deciding on the issue was at an advance stage and it would be finalised by Wednesday evening, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing CBSE, told a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar.“We understand the anxiety of students...By tomorrow evening it will be finalised and we can inform the court a day after tomorrow,” Mehta said requesting the Bench to adjourn the hearing till then.The Bench—which also included Justice Dinesh Maheshwari and Justice Sanjiv Khanna—posted the matter for hearing to June 25.Worried about community spread of COVID-19, four parents of Class 12 students have moved the Supreme Court against the Central Board of Secondary Education’s decision to hold examinations of remaining papers between July 1 and 15.Petitioners’ counsel Rishi Malhotra wanted the court to take up the matter as soon as possible.While hearing another petition relating to students under the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Bench said it can follow the CBSE’s decision with certain changes.The Supreme Court had on June 17 asked CBSE to consider doing away with the remaining examinations for Class 10 and Class 12 given COVID-19 pandemic.It had asked CBSE to inform it by June 23 if marks could be allotted to students for the remaining papers based on internal assessment.CBSE counsel had said the Board was in the process of deciding on the issue.Petitioners Col. Amit Bathla, Poonam Singla, Charu Singh and Sunitha—whose children happen to be Class 12 students—have challenged the May 18 CBSE notification that announced a fresh schedule for holding examinations.They have urged the top court to direct CBSE to declare this year’s Class 12 results “on the basis of examination already conducted and to calculate it on an average basis with the internal assessment marks of the remaining subject.”Highlighting the rise in COVID-19 cases in India, the petitioners said the pandemic would be at its peak in India and it would not be safe for students to assemble at examination centres in large numbers.They sought to emphasize that Delhi University has cancelled its first year and second-year undergraduate examinations due to COVID-19. Even IITs have cancelled their examinations, including those of final year students, on account of the pandemic, they submitted. Some states have also cancelled all University examinations, they added.“Ensuring proper cleanliness and safety standards as prescribed by the concerned Government in COVID-19 situation in those 15,000 exam centres spreading over length and breadth of the country including rural sectors would not only be risking health and life of children but also would be an exercise in futility and an eyewash,” the petition read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-decide-by-wednesday-whether-to-do-away-with-remaining-classes-10-12-exams-cbse-tells-sc-103154
23-06-2020||New Delhi||Covid: Indian pilgrims will not travel to Saudi Arabia for haj, says Naqvi||The government has decided that Muslims from India will not travel to Saudi Arabia for Haj, Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Tuesday.The decision comes after Saudi Arabia said on Monday it will bar arrivals from abroad to attend the haj due to the coronavirus, allowing only a limited number of Saudi citizens and residents to make the pilgrimage with social distancing measures enforced.The announcement means this will be the first year in modern times that Muslims from around the world have not been allowed to make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which all Muslims aim to perform at least once in a lifetime.Also read: Saudi Arabia: Hajj will see at most ‘thousands’ due to virus"This decision is taken to ensure Hajj is performed in a safe manner from a public health perspective while observing all preventative measures and the necessary social distancing protocols to protect human beings from the risks associated with this pandemic and in accordance with the teachings of Islam in preserving the lives of human beings," the ministry that oversees pilgrimages said in a statement.The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia has exceeded 160,000, with 1,307 deaths, following a rise in new infections over the past two weeks.Some 2.5 million pilgrims typically visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long haj. Official data show Saudi Arabia earns around $12 billion a year from the haj and the lesser, year-round pilgrimage known as umrah.The kingdom halted international passenger flights in March and asked Muslims in March to put haj plans on hold until further notice. International arrivals for umrah pilgrimages have also been suspended until further notice.Earlier this month, Malaysia and Indonesia both barred their citizens from travelling to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage, citing fears of the coronavirus. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-indian-pilgrims-will-not-travel-to-saudi-arabia-for-haj-says-naqvi-103151
23-06-2020||Washington||Bolton says State Department defended India on Iranian oil import but Trump was not ‘sympathetic’||Former US national security advisor John Bolton has slammed the State Department for defending India’s position on import of oil from Iran, while claiming at the same time that President Donald Trump had “not been sympathetic” to New Delhi’s case.In his tell-all book “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir” that hit the stands on Tuesday, there is a sporadic mention of India in the context of President Trump asking countries to bring down the import of Iranian oil to zero and the crisis with Pakistan following the Pulwama terror attack.The US last year had asked India and other countries to completely end their imports of Iranian oil by November 4 or be subject to US sanctions, a decision that comes about a year after America quit the Iran nuclear deal and imposed toughest ever sanctions on the resource-rich Persian Gulf nation.Iran is India’s third-largest oil supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Iran supplied 18.4 million tonnes of crude oil between April 2017 and January 2018 (first 10 months of fiscal 2017-18).“In a phone call with (Secretary of State) Mike Pompeo, Trump had not been sympathetic to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, ‘He’ll be okay.’ I recall a similar conversation reflecting Trump’s indifference to notifying allies about waiver decisions,” 71-year-old Bolton wrote in his book, which the Trump administration tried to stall.The Department of Justice had sought a temporary restraining order blocking the release of the book, expressing concerns that classified information could be exposed. However, a federal judge ruled on Saturday that Bolton can move forward in publishing the book.“Considering one foreign leader’s trip to Washington, which also raised the ending of a waiver, Trump had a ready suggestion: ‘Do it before he gets here, and then I’ll say I didn’t know anything about it,’ and ‘Do it early in the week. I don’t want to be anywhere near it’,” Bolton wrote.Bolton also said that he did not like State Department officials defending India’s position on the Iranian oil import.“One of the worst cases involved India, which, like the others, was buying Iranian oil at prices well below the global market because Iran was so desperate to make sales. India complained it would be disadvantaged not only because of having to find new suppliers, but also because the new sources would insist on prevailing market prices!” he wrote.“India’s making this argument was understandable, but it was incomprehensible that US bureaucrats echoed it sympathetically,” Bolton, known for his walrus moustache, added.The White House has dismissed the contents of the book and said it reveals a lot of classified information.While Trump in a series of tweets have slammed Bolton and said that he was fired, Pompeo described him as a traitor.In a series of interviews to the US media and also in the book, Bolton said that Trump is unfit to be the president and that he will not vote for his former boss in the November presidential elections.In an apparent reference to the Indo-Pak tension after the Pulwama attack, Bolton wrote that the crisis was defused after hours of phone calls.Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed on February 14 last year in a suicide bombing by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one. But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it. No one else cared at the time, but the point was clear to me: this was what happened when people didn’t take nuclear proliferation from the likes of Iran and North Korea seriously,” Bolton said in the book.In a chapter on Afghanistan, he mentioned that Trump during a meeting on negotiations with the Taliban wanted to talk to Prime Minister Modi to discuss Kashmir. However, the former national security advisor did not mention the context of the conversation.“Then, switching to Kashmir, ‘I want to call Modi on Monday’, he (Trump) said. ‘We have tremendous power […] because of trade’,” Bolton wrote. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bolton-says-state-department-defended-india-on-iranian-oil-import-but-trump-was-not-sympathetic-103150

She first wished to join the Air Force after seeing the IAF personnel helping people during the Kedarnath tragedy."And, now her dream has come true, the proud father said.He said after getting inspired by the bravery of IAF personnel, his daughter collected information from bookstalls on how she could get into the defence force and started preparations in that direction.She was determined and got success in the sixth attempt, he said.But, it has not been an easy journey for her and her father, who has been selling tea for the past 25 years in Neemuch, located around 400 km from Bhopal."One can understand my financial condition. At times, I faced problems in depositing her school or college fee. I had to borrow money from others on many occasions to deposit the fee. Sometimes I had to pretend to be out of town to delay fees deposition," said Suresh Gangwal, who has studied till Class 10.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan congratulated Aanchal Gangwal for making the state proud and extended best wishes to her.Anchal, daughter of Suresh Gangwal, who runs a tea shop in Neemuch, will now fly the fighter plane in the Air Force. Daughter Anchal, who made Madhya Pradesh proud, will now fly in the heights of the infinite sky to protect the pride and honour of the country.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Border, economic crises due to govt’s wrong policies: Sonia at CWC||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said the Border and economic crisis are both due to wrong policies of the BJP government, and urged the Government to announce a financial stimulus at the earliest.Addressing a virtual Congress Working Committee meet today Sonia Gandhi also questioned the government for raising fuel prices at a time of economic slowdown due to the pandemic.Endorsing Gandhi former PM Manmohan Singh said the pandemic was not being handled with the efforts required to handle it.“India has been hit by a terrible economic crisis, a pandemic of huge proportions and, now, by a full-blown crisis on the borders with China. Much of each crisis is attributable to the mismanagement of the BJP-led NDA Govt and the wrong policies pursued by it,” Gandhi said.She said the need of hour is a massive fiscal stimulus, putting money directly in the hands of the poor, protecting and nurturing the MSMEs and stimulating demand.The Congress chief accused the government of announcing a hollow financial package with fiscal component less than 1 per cent of GDP and then “adding insult to injury by mercilessly raising petrol and diesel prices for 17 consecutive days, at a time when world prices of crude have fallen.”On the pandemic front Gandhi noted that despitethe assurances of the Prime Minister, the pandemic continued to rage.“The Centre has passed the buck to the state governments, but given them zero extra finances,” she said ruing that people have been left to protect themselves as best as possible.“The mis-management of the pandemic will be recorded as one of the most disastrous failures of the Modi government. And now we have a full-blown crisis on the LAC with China. The future is yet to unfold but we hope that mature diplomacy and decisive leadership will inform the government’s actions in protecting our territorial integrity,” she said.Manmohan Singh in his brief remarks said the“pandemic is not being tackled with the courage and magnitude and effort needed to tackle the crisis.Another instance is the crisis on the border, which if not tackled firmly, can lead to a serious situation.”The meeting is currently underway with former finance minister P Chidambaram briefing members on the economic situation and former Defence Minister AK Antony on the LAC issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/border-economic-crises-due-to-govts-wrong-policies-sonia-at-cwc-103144

23-06-2020||Arun JoshiJammu||Army chief reaches Ladakh to assess LAC situation||Army chief Gen MM Naravane reached Leh on Tuesday on his two-day visit to Ladakh to assess the ground situation close to the LAC between Indian and Chinese troops that the world sees as a new flashpoint in the region between two nuclear-powered nations, especially after a violent clash at Galwan Valley on June 15.The brutal clash in Galwan Valley surrounded by the barren mountains and jagged peaks had left 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, dead. The incident for which India and China blamed each other took place at the LAC after a gap of more than four decades.Also read: China dismisses questions on its casualties in Galwan Valley clashThis is Gen Naravane’s first visit to Ladakh in recent weeks, especially after the stand-off began in the first week of May.Gen Naravane’s visit comes at a time when the Indian and Chinese troops have strengthened their positions along the LAC amidst the two rounds of talks at the military commander level. The talks seek reversal of the hostilities on the border that intensified after the June 15 clashes in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.The army chief, sources said, would take a micro and macro look at the situation and seek real-time information and strategies to be adopted to deal with the situation at the LAC. He would also focus on the strategies that would make China retreat its troops to the positions that they held before April this year.The face-offs had started in first week of May and they escalated to a bloody clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. That incident put back the progress of the military commander-level talks held on June 6. That position was sought to be retrieved in the June 22 talks in which, sources said, a forward movement seemed to have been achieved, though the details are quite hazy at the moment.“The army chief’s visit should be seen as a move to boost the morale of the troops and also share the resolve of the country to stand by them,” sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-reaches-ladakh-to-assess-lac-situation-103127

There will be no immediate impact because international air travel is still restricted.The curb was a key election promise by Trump and its announcement will carry his party through the November Presidential and Senate elections, which the Republicans are currently trailing. Democrats are also forecast to retain their majority in the House of Representatives as well unless Trump manages to turn around the situation.The order exempts 85,000 visas of all categories out of an estimated 5.5 lakh given annually, but these will be given to companies that offer high salaries. They will also have to submit higher filing fees of $20,000 and spouses will not get work permits.H-1B visas issued under the old lottery system will continue to be honoured. Of the 13 lakh such visa workers in the US, over 8 lakh direct beneficiaries are estimated to be Indians. Their kin and spouses also tend to take up jobs with or without the requisite visas.   Trump has exempted physicians and other healthcare professionals doing Covid-related work, investors under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Programme and spouse of a US citizen. In the Green Card category, exemptions continue for certain Afghan and Iraqi citizens working for the US.Without these curbs, the US argued, it faced a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistently high unemployment.In case, Joe Biden wins the Presidential polls in November, he may ease the curbs, but the high filing fees and spouse curbs are likely to persist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trump-freezes-h-1b-visas-but-to-honour-old-lottery-system-103108

Organisers have said the money meant for Dahi Handi will be used for Covid-19 treatment.Four days after placing a ban on this year’s Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra at Puri, the Supreme Court on Monday allowed it in a restricted manner after the Centre, Odisha Government and the temple management assured that social distancing norms and other Covid-19 protocols shall be followed.The Puri Rath Yatra festival — which attracts a large number of Indian and foreign devotees and tourists — is scheduled to commence on June 23. An estimated one million people took part in the Rath Yatra that goes on for 20 days.While allowing a restricted Rath Yatra, a three-judge Bench, headed by CJI SA Bobde, made it clear no public participation will be allowed.The order came on applications files by several individuals and organisations, including Pattajoshi Mohapatra — the Hereditary Chief Servitor of Lord Jagannatha Temple, Puri — seeking recall of the June 18 order.“Indeed, if it is possible to ensure that there is no public attendance, we see no reason why the Rath Yatra cannot be conducted safely along its usual route from temple to temple,” the top court said.While modifying its June 18 order that had put a blanket ban on this year’s Rath Yatra in view of the pandemic, the Bench issued an elaborate 11-point order to be followed for the Rath Yatra.It ordered that all entry points to Puri — airports, railway stations, bus stands, etc. — shall be closed during the Rath Yatra.The Odisha Government shall impose a curfew in Puri beginning 8 pm Monday on all days and during all the time when Rath Yatra chariots are taken in procession. It may also impose curfew in Puri on such other days and during such time as deemed necessary. No one to come out of their houses, places of residence, hotels, lodging houses, etc, it said.

Russia had hinted at some delay due to Covid. In October 2018, India had signed a $5 billion deal to buy five units of S-400 systems. ptiThis second conversation between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart within a week is expected to pave the way for a more substantial meeting in Beijing between Indian Ambassador Vikram Misri and Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui later in the week. The effort will be to leverage the lowering of tensions to seek a pre-May 5 status quo in several sectors on the LAC as well as agree on not raising permanent structures in overlapping areas, said sources. The tenor of the talks will be undergirded by conversations currently on in Moscow between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Sergei Shoigu, a trusted Putin aide.Sources said Singh’s visit was announced after several chips had fallen in place including the first telephonic conversation between Jaishankar and Wang a day after 20 Indians and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died in a scuffle in the Galwan valley on June 15. That Singh reached Moscow two days before the Victory Parade commemorating World War II suggests intense conversations with trusted Putin aides, they said. In contrast to Donald Trump’s repeated offers to insert the US in cooling down tensions after castigating China, the Russian approach has been discreet. The Kremlin has let it be known that it is confident that both countries will be able to sort out their differences. Russian Ambassador in India Nikolai Kudashev has been regularly briefed on the situation by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. Russian interest has been leavened with India clearing orders worth Rs 5,000 crore for more MiG and Sukhoi fighter jets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ric-meet-to-set-tone-for-lowering-lac-tensions-102917

The two sides met at Moldo on the Chinese side of the designated meeting point at Chushul-Moldo, 200 km south-east of Leh.The meeting, that started at 11.30 am, concluded past 10 pm, according to officials in New Delhi.Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, was tasked with conveying to China to restore status quo as it prevailed on May 4, the day before the first clash between troops on May 5. India has cited how China had violated all agreements, protocols and the laid-down drills related to maintaining ‘peace and tranquillity’ along the LAC and for the conduct of soldiers.New Delhi’s military officials have asked the PLA to demolish all structures that it has built in disputed areas along the LAC, especially the ‘Finger 4’ area north of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial-melt lake.Status quo ante would mean pulling back troops and tanks, amassed by both sides in the past weeks and permitting each other’s patrols to pass through the disputed areas.In New Delhi, the apex leadership of the Indian Army carried out a comprehensive review of India’s security preparedness along the LAC in Ladakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/generals-meet-for-10-hrs-no-outcome-rajnath-in-russia-102939
