Sophia foiled the possible explosion by detecting a 7 kg IED on the under-construction road between Bega Salewara to Samudpani near Pandaripani village in Bakarkatta are in Rajnandgaon district.The Malinois breed dog was on a search and combing operation with the troops of 40th Battalion of the ITBP when she alerted her colleagues about the IED. The IED was later destroyed by the ITBP on the spot, the paramilitary force said.The Malinois is one of four types of Belgian shepherd dogs registered in Belgium and France as the Chien de Berger Belge. The Malinois shares a common foundation with the Belgian Sheepdog and the Belgian Tervuren.The Malinois was bred basically around the city of Malines from where the name is derived. The dog is used by the paramilitary forces and other state police forces in detecting bombs and IEDs.According to sources, had the IED not been detected early in the morning, the rebels would have triggered it later in the day, inflicting heavy casualties on paramilitary personnel and equipment.

27-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||On Saturday, SAD became third major NDA member to quit BJP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 27On Saturday, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) became the third major NDA member to quit the Bharatiya Janata Party-led grouping after the Shiv Sena in 2019 and the N Chandrababu Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 2018 a few months before the Lok Sabha’ elections.Voicing anger over the three farm Bills cleared the Parliament, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, former union minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet, also, in a way, attacked the Prime Minister claiming that the NDA was no longer the alliance “envisioned” by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Hasrimrat Badal tweeted: “If pain & protests of 3 cr punjabis fail to melt the rigid stance of GoI (Government of India), it's no longer the NDA envisioned by Vajpayee ji & Badal sahab. An alliance that turns a deaf ear to its oldest ally & a blind eye to pleas of those who feed the nation is no longer in the interest of Pb (sic).”If Pain & Protests of 3 cr punjabis fail to melt the rigid stance of GoI, it's no longer the #NDA envisioned by Vajpayee ji & Badal sahab. An alliance that turns a deaf ear to its oldest ally & a blind eye to pleas of those who feed the nation is no longer in the interest of Pb. https://t.co/OqU6at00JxWhile the separation may have made no difference to either the health or the safety of the BJP-led NDA enjoying a brute majority in the Lok Sabha, the fact is the saffron party’s relationship with two of its oldest supporters — the Shiv Sena and the SAD — has ended.The two allies have decided to chart a separate course to save their individual political identity and core voters. Basically, the NDA is down to JD-U, LJP, HAM (S) in Bihar (there are murmurs of RLSP doing a ‘ghar wapsi’), JJP in Haryana, AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, Apna Dal in UP and some other minor parties like Ram Das Athawale-led RPI in Maharashtra and those in the Northeast etc.However, as leaders point that the BJP is never the one to end any relationship, they also claim that TDP leader N Chandrababu Naidu, after faring poorly in Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, “openly admitted regret over his decision”.“(Bihar CM) Nitish Kumar (of the JD-U) has returned is currently running the Bihar government with us. The AIADMK joined the NDA in 2019 and while the Shiv Sena may have parted ways in Maharashtra it stands with NDA in the Lok Sabha. The HAM(S) is back and RLSP is also on the way (in Bihar). The JJP is with NDA in Haryana. In all NDA is an alliance of around 25 parties,” they say.As far as the PDP is concerned, they add that it was the BJP which pulled out because of “genuine concerns” in erstwhile state Jammu and Kashmir.Meanwhile, speculations are rife following a meeting between former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis (BJP) and Sanjay Raut (SS), though Raut insists “there can be ideological differences but we are not enemies” and Fadnavis claims the meeting was regarding an interview for Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana and nothing more. Too early in the day, but some political observers believe it will not be surprising if the Akalis also touch base with the NDA “before or after Assembly polls in 2022 to strengthen national forces”.“The fact is the BJP is the main pillar of the NDA and any party joining, or leaving it, is well aware of that. They join the NDA when they want to draw from the pan-India appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with support base in every state, they leave when they find their individual strength weakening. There is no state, including Punjab where the BJP’s organisational strength is not as strong, that does not have a Modi support-base,” say BJP leaders.Regarding perceptions, this is what Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik has to say: “They (Akali Dal) left us, we did not leave them. Why did they not leave earlier? Why were they giving favourable statements on the Ordinances? The BJP has always taken them along on issues concerning Punjab.”Timeline of parties breaking, forming alliance with the NDA||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-saturday-sad-became-third-major-nda-member-to-quit-bjp-147465

Why can’t we attract more tourists from other states and countries? Tourism industry is best in terms of employment and revenue,” he tweeted with the hashtag #AgainstLiquorBanChallenge.“BJP and Congress will (n)ever want to lose illegal income earned through #Liquorban in this state. They will always want people to pay double and drink with fear of arrest,” he added.He said the ban must be lifted if it cannot be implemented properly, adding “let the people decide good and bad”.“It is time to think big. Time has changed. Today liquor is part of social gathering. It has nothing to do with criminality. But in Gujarat people who drink and people who do robbery both are considered criminals. This should come to an end,” he further said.Vaghela has also previously spoken against prohibition in the state, and in a release on Sunday claimed “during my CM tenure in the year 1996-97, I wanted to remove the liquor ban policy, but the coalition government has some limitations”.Then Congress president Sitaram Kesri was against the move to repeal prohibition and so the plan did not go ahead, Vaghela said.He claimed the ban on liquor would go “within 100 days” if he forms a government in the state.

Naidu indicated that the party had selected hard-working talented leaders who have proved their mettle and passion for working for the people of Andhra Pradesh,” a statement issued by TDP read.In addition to the presidents, Naidu has also appointed 13 observers to supervise affairs in two districts each. The statement read that this was a major change in the party functioning after the 2019 debacle and could win only 23 out of 175 seats in the assembly polls.There is growing tension between the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the TDP over various issues, with scrapping of Amaravati Capital Region, perceived as the state’s capital by the TDP as a major issue. Farmers have been agitating under the umbrella of the TDP seeking restoration of the capital project. Besides, the YSRCP has scrapped most important decisions taken by the TDP government.The rejig of the TDP is primarily aimed at keeping a close watch on governance of chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy and to counter the government on actions that aim at undoing the decisions of the TDP, besides making the party strong for the next assembly elections over three years away.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naidu-rejigs-tdp-to-act-as-better-watchdog-147456
27-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Jaswant Singh: Rathore from deserts who set out to defend Pokhran||“We are going to come down on those guys like a ton of bricks,” US President Bill Clinton had thundered soon after the US establishment had got over the shock of not getting a whiff about India’s five nuclear tests in three days at a site 1,200 km away from major Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) facilities.A month after those tests and Clinton’s dire admonition, Jaswant Singh bravely landed in Washington to engage the US President’s college-mate and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in the first of 14 meetings over the next 30 months in 10 locations on three continents. It finally turned out to be the most intense and prolonged set of Indo-US exchanges ever at a level higher than that of ambassadors.The jury is still out whether those exchanges in Rome, London, Frankfurt, Moscow, etc., turned around US policy. As per Talbott, they didn’t. The sanctions were lifted not because it was a mistake to impose them but because by then they had passed the point of diminishing returns.But as his most trenchant critic A G Noorani conceded, that serial dialogue, conducted with not a single paper, file or folder in Jaswant’s hand, lifted Indo-US relations out of the trap of cyclical ebbs and flows. He deployed elements of conciliation and contest to catch the deep and constant undercurrents, enabling the duo to set the foundational basis which then matured into the specifics that we see today.Jaswant, however, was more than the man of the desert who set out to defend his government’s policies for conducting nuclear tests not more than 100 km from where he was born.He was the man who intimately knew the story of the cold war through protagonists from both sides of the fence. For, his life-long friends were the famous communist power couple Romesh and Raj Thapar. A person who took a liking for him was P N Haksar, the man who shaped the Indian foreign policy’s sunshine years of the 70s. It is little wonder that he never hid his admiration for Nehru that was also gained from years of deep scholarship.Apart from the nuclear tests, there were other tumultuous episodes in his stint as Foreign Minister in the Vajpayee government. The seven sleepless nights during the hijack of the Indian Airlines plane, the double crossing when he bravely landed in Kandahar—because “somebody had to go”. And at the end, “there was relief because so much accumulated pain and agony had burst open like a long throbbing carbuncle”.Fortified by spirited interactions with the framers of India’s security and strategic environment such as K Subrahmanyam, Maj Gen Rajinder Singh Sparrow and Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh, Jaswant was as much at home in discussions of disarmament as he was on regional issues with Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Though this Rathore from the deserts is best remembered for telling the world not to negotiate with him on nuclear issues “as if with a gun to my temple”, his interactions and experiences straddled a range of other issues.But in the end, Jaswant Singh walked the path mentioned in the Kasidah of Haji Abdu El-Yezdi which he so loved: “Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause; The noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made laws.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaswant-singh-rathore-from-deserts-who-set-out-to-defend-pokhran-147455

Its scale is humongous,” a senior military official told PTI on the condition of anonymity.To deal with any Chinese misadventure, India has deployed over three additional Army divisions in eastern Ladakh where the temperature fluctuates between minus five to minus 25 degrees Celsius from October to January.The sources said India imported winter clothing and gear from a couple of countries in Europe and they had already been supplied to the troops in eastern Ladakh.Almost all transport aircraft and helicopters of the Indian Air Force, including C-130J Super Hercules and C-17 Globemaster, were used to transport thousands of tonnes of food, fuel and other equipment to the region.The Indian Army has decided to maintain its current strength of troops in all key areas in eastern Ladakh in the winter months as there was no sign of early resolution of the border row with China.The Indian Air Force (IAF) has also decided to remain on high alert in the forward air bases along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The Indian and Chinese armies held the sixth round of Corps Commander talks on September 21 in the backdrop of deteriorating situation in the Chushul sector following three incidents of shots being fired in the air by the Chinese military since the intervening night of August 29 and 30.Following the incidents, India had occupied at least 20 strategic heights around southern and northern banks of Pangong lake.In the talks, the two sides agreed not to escalate the situation by announcing a series of measures. However, there was no breakthrough on the disengagement process.The sources said a series of talks will be required for the disengagement process to begin with.The situation in eastern Ladakh escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side acknowledged suffering casualties, but it is yet to divulge the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.The situation further deteriorated following at least three attempts by the soldiers of the PLA to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area in the last three weeks where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.As the tensions escalated further, the foreign ministers of the two countries held talks on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet in Moscow on September 10 where they reached a five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh.The agreement was the basis for the sixth round of Corps Commander-level talks on Monday which was also attended for the first time by a joint secretary from the MEA.The agreement aimed at ending the tense standoff included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||President Kovind gives assent to 3 contentious farm Bills||President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave assent to three contentious farm Bills passed in Parliament last week that have triggered farmers’ protest especially in Punjab and Haryana.These three farm bills are: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020.A gazette notification has been issued in this regard.Parliament last week cleared the bills that are aimed at liberalising the agriculture sector and allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere they want at a better price.The Opposition is, however, criticising the manner in which these bills were passed in Parliament. They had alleged that the bills were passed “unconstitutionally” in a “complete disregard” of Parliamentary norms.They had requested the President to return the bills, and only give his assent after they have been passed after following proper rules and procedures.Even NDA’s oldest ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday parted ways on the issue of these farm bills as farmers in Punjab and Haryana intensified protest. Also read: Farm bills can have disastrous implications for national economy: Sukhbir BadalCapt Amarinder terms Presidential assent to farm Bills as unfortunate, distressingFarmers continue rail blockade in AmritsarThe government has asserted that these bills will allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere they want at a better price.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 aims to permit the sale of agricultural produce outside the mandis regulated by the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) constituted by different state legislations.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 provides for contract farming.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 aims to deregulate the production, supply, distribution of food items like cereals, pulses, potatoes and onion.Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the passage of two of the three bills by Parliament last week had termed the laws as a “watershed moment” in the history of Indian agriculture that will empower crores of farmers.The prime minister in his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast on Sunday said that a large number of peasants have benefited since fruits and vegetables were brought out of the APMC Act in some states a few years ago and asserted that grain-producing farmers will now have the same freedom.Protests by farmers against the laws continued on Sunday, with peasants in Punjab squatting on the Amritsar-Delhi railway track. Farmers, under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, have been staging a sit-in on the rail track in Punjab since last Wednesday.Farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big companies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-kovind-gives-assent-to-3-contentious-farm-bills-147445

Smaller fossils from Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous period were earlier found in the region. We might even find fossilised dinosaur eggs during further excavation,” Singh told PTI on Sunday.“I and my team have been working in the region for the last 12 years but we never found such prominent fossils before,” he said.Several fossils were earlier found in Maharajpur, Tarpahad, Garmi Pahad and Barharwa areas in Sahibganj and Sonajhari in neighbouring Pakur district.“There are chances of finding more fossils in this region,” Singh added.

In the early days of the pandemic, as the kits were imported, the price tended to be high. But now, supplies of testing kits have stabilised and domestic production of these kits has commenced, the statement said.He said his ministry has written to the states and Union territories to engage private laboratories at mutually agreeable lower rates. He said he has spoken personally to several state health ministers regarding reduction in prices of testing in their respective states.On a question related to ‘Atma-nirbhar Bharat Yojana’, the minister spoke of India’s two-pronged strategy of incentivising production and creation of common infrastructure for high-quality medicines and medical devices to make the country self-reliant. He said the government is ensuring that there is import substitution in this sector.Vardhan said in the last few months since the outbreak of the pandemic, India had made rapid strides in the “manufacturing of ventilators, PPEs, testing kits and many medical devices”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmrs-2nd-sero-survey-shows-indians-far-from-achieving-herd-immunity-against-covid-19-vardhan-147442
27-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Post SAD breakup, BJP senses open space for growth in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 27A story doing rounds is that when Akali leader Harsimrat  Kaur Badal submitted her resignation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi (from his council of ministers) to protest against the three agri-legislations, “he just took it and signed it” .Without getting into debate over its authenticity, basically what the BJP wants to convey is that if Harsimrat Kaur was hoping that she will be asked to stay back or that the PM will relent with an assurance on re-think/consultations on the contentious legislations, it did not happen. In any case, the very next day the President accepted the resignation and gave the charge of her ministry to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, “as advised by the PM”.  “These reforms are not about one state but the entire nation, including those who really need them, the 85 per cent small and marginal in the country. We stood by them (Akalis) even when it meant sacrificing aspirations of our cadres (in Punjab). The local leadership had been demanding it (separation) for long, but the BJP never walks out on allies with whom we have long associations, it is not our ‘sanskaar’,” says a leader who did not wish to be named. This more or less also explain feelings of majority of BJP leaders in Punjab who believe that after playing second fiddle for years, with Akalis out of the way there is an opportunity for the saffron party to come on its own. As Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik puts it “sky is the limit now. You will see how fast the BJP grows in Punjab”. “Because we were limited to 23 seats, our political space also remained limited. We just had 20 per cent of the political space. The Prime Minister always tells us to create opportunities out of challenges. Whenever faced with a challenge, the BJP has always emerged a winner. It is a new opportunity for us, we will reach out each and every one and spread the right message on the agriculture reforms,” says Malik.Regarding the possibility of negative perceptions due to the fallout, Malik says, “The Ordinances were not passed yesterday, rather Akalis are on the record saying they are pro-farmers, etc. They resigned because of political compulsions, the Congress was misleading farmers and they got caught in its misinformation campaign.” The feelings that Akalis let the BJP down is evident from what senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said when asked about Harsimrat Kaur’s resignation from the Cabinet. “She (Harsimrat) was a part of the Cabinet where the decisions were taken. She only asked if it was legally possible and as the Law Minister I clarified. She has been a distinguished minister in the Cabinet and I would like to remember her like that,” said Prasad.However, while the majority is looking forward to increasing the BJP’s base and contesting all the 117 seats, a section has some reservations. “The break-up may be good for the party but it is not good for the country. Politically we (BJP) may be able to do well but due to this alliance we were able to control the language, anti-national sentiments etc...The alliance was also a symbol of Hindu-Sikh unity, now it will be free for all in the sensitive border state.”Besides the BJP has to a long way to go given its lack of organisational strength. “Of the 43 office bearers (in the state unit), 27 belong to the 23 Assemblies we contest,” they say. Though with next Assembly elections still a few months away (2022) the BJP has the time to sync its aspirations by building leadership representing dominant Sikh community and farmers. The elevation of Punjab leader Tarun Chugh as the national general secretary and appointment of former IPS Iqbal Singh Lalpura as national spokesperson are also being seen as steps towards building the leadership in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-sad-breakup-bjp-senses-open-space-for-growth-in-punjab-147441

When it falls on its own, we will see,” said Fadnavis, who is the leader of Opposition in the state Assembly.“My meeting with Raut had no political connotations. He asked me for an interview to ‘Saamana’, to which I agreed. But I had put my conditions- like the interview should be unedited and I should get to put my own camera during the interview. So, we met to discuss its nitty-gritties,” he said.Meanwhile, Raut, who also spoke to reporters here separately, said he and Fadnavis were not enemies and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was aware of the meeting which was pre-planned to discuss the interview schedule.However, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam criticised Raut, alleging that he was in a hurry to grab headlines.“When that happens, political careers end. This is not my ill-wish for Raut but a reality,” the former Mumbai Congress chief told PTI.Nirupam, who has been sulking since his removal from the post of Mumbai Congress chief ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year, said if the party is serious about opposing the new farm bills passed by Parliament, it should first ask the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra to spell out its stand.The Congress and the NCP say they would not allow the implementation of the new laws in Maharashtra while Chief Minister Thackeray hadn’t uttered a word on it, he said.“The Shiv Sena supported the farm bills in the Lok Sabha while it staged a walkout from the Rajya Sabha when other opposition parties were demanding a vote on it,” Nirupam said, adding that farmers in Maharashtra are confused (over the state government’s stand).

Another major outcome will be the joining of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) by Denmark,” the MEA said in a statement.The summit is being hosted by India.Denmark is a key country in Northern Europe with whom India’s bilateral trade ties witnessed a significant expansion in the last few years.“The virtual bilateral summit will give an opportunity to the two leaders to comprehensively review the broad framework of the bilateral relationship in the context of the time-tested friendly ties between the two countries and give broad political direction for a strengthened and deepened collaborative partnership on key issues of mutual interest,” the MEA said.According to official figures, bilateral trade in goods and services between India and Denmark grew by 30.49 per cent between 2016 and 2019 as the trade volume rose from USD 2.82 billion to USD 3.68 billion.Around 200 Danish companies have invested in India in sectors such as shipping, renewable energy, environment, agriculture and food processing.Several major Danish companies have built new manufacturing factories under the ‘Make in India’ scheme.The MEA said around 25 Indian companies are operating in Denmark in IT, renewable energy and engineering sectors.Nearly 5,000 Indian professionals are working in major Danish companies, while 20 Indian IT companies are operating in Denmark for decades, according to official data.Major Danish companies such as Grundfos, Danfoss, Vestas, LM Wind, Novozymes, Rockwool, Haldor Topsoe, etc. have set up factories and manufacturing facilities in India under the ‘Make in India’ scheme.India and Denmark are cooperating in fighting climate change by exporting wind turbines.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||From Orange spl to Keenu spl, railways considers linking Kisan Trains to seasonal fruits, vegetables||The Railways is considering linking its Kisan Trains with seasonal fruits and vegetables to benefit small farmers, senior ministry officials said Sunday, even as a political storm rages over the new farm Bills that promise one nation one market.First off the mark could be an Orange Special Kisan Train between Nagpur and Delhi and a Keenu Special from Punjab to West Bengal and Odisha during December and January, the officials said.The Kisan Rail services were launched last month and have so far carried around 4,100 tonne of goods from farmers to markets across the country.The officials said they are still finalising details, but added that they have received feedback from zonal railways about the viability of running dedicated trains linking them with seasonal produce.“The Orange and Keenu special trains are likely to be the first ones to take off,” a senior official told PTI. “We want to ensure that these trains are beneficial to small scale farmers who are not able to book the entire train,” he said. “They can book as little as they want and still avail these services.”Data available with the PTI show that the smallest consignment carried by Kisan Rail was a 3-kg pomegranate packet from Nasik to Muzaffarpur, and around 17 dozen eggs from Manmad to Khandwa on August 14.Farmer in some states are protesting against three proposed legislations: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.They have been alleging that once passed, these Bills would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system and leave the farming community at the “mercy” of big corporates.The Shiromani Akali Dal, the oldest BJP ally, has quit the NDA over the bills, while Opposition have been vehemently demanding their withdrawal.The government has, however, said the MSP regime would stay and called these bills as historic reforms. It has said the bills would allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country, fetching them better remunerative prices.The Railways officials said the three Kisan Rails in operation—between Devlali-Danapur, Anantpur-Delhi and Yashwantpur-Nizamuddin—are running on 85 per cent capacity.Besides the Orange Special and the Keenu Special, on the anvil are also: Mango Special (Andhra Pradesh to Delhi between April to June), Onion Special (Nashik to Delhi, during March and December), Banana Special (Jalgaon to Delhi, during March and December); and Chiku Special (Surat, Valsad, Navsari to Delhi) between April-November.Officials said the farther the goods are sent, the cheaper the cost of ferrying them.Within a distance of 0-500 km, the Railways services are expensive, but they are at par with the roadways for over 1,000 km distance, they said, adding that for over 2,000 km, the Railways is cheaper than the roadways by at least Rs 1,000 per tonne.These Kisan Trains will be part of the zero-based time table that will be in effect soon, so even if regular services begin post-COVID-19, these trains will have dedicated routes and paths to operate on.The government and the Railways are committed to rapidly increase the farm incomes, said the official quoted above. “Ensuring that farmers are able to sell their produce across the country to get best possible remuneration for the produce is one of the important ways to do so.” Kisan Rails represent one such determined freight marketing effort of Railways and it is expanding fast, he said.“Earlier, farmers preferred to use trucks, now they have started using the Railways,” he said, adding zonal teams are coordinating with the Ministry of Agriculture and actively pursuing local authorities to encourage farmers to use the national transporter.“They can bring us as little as they want and as much as they want of their produce and we will ferry them to their chosen destination,” said the official. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/from-orange-spl-to-keenu-spl-railways-considers-linking-kisan-trains-to-seasonal-fruits-vegetables-147433

27-09-2020||Patna||RJD to provide 10 lakh govt jobs if voted to power: Tejashwi Yadav||Seeking to lure voters in poll-bound Bihar, opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Sunday promised to provide 10 lakh permanent government jobs if voted to power.The populistic announcement was made at a press conference here by Tejashwi Yadav, the party’s chief ministerial candidate, who is faced with the uphill task of holding his own against the formidable ruling NDA in the absence of his father and RJD boss Lalu Prasad.“It is not just a vaada (empty promise). We will do what we have promised with mazboot iraada (firm resolve). If the RJD is able to form its government, filling up of 10 lakh posts — all permanent, government jobs will be sanctioned in the very first cabinet meeting,” said the former deputy chief minister.Assembly elections will be held in three phases in Bihar on October 28, November 3 and 7. The results will be announced on November 10.In a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Yadav said: “We are not like those who achieve power with a promise of two crore jobs every year and leave Bihar bankrupt after 15 years of rule.”Yadav, who has been the leader of the opposition in the outgoing assembly since the abrupt exit of Nitish Kumar from the Grand Alliance robbed him of the deputy chief minister’s post and his party of power, accused the Chief Minister of inaction despite “lakhs of posts lying vacant in health, education and police departments”.“Bihar is the most densely populated state in the country and about 60 per cent of its population is said to be young and of employable age. Still, there are so many vacant posts of doctors, paramedics, teachers and police personnel and Nitish Kumar did nothing to fill up these,” the 31-year-old RJD leader alleged.He said his party intended to fill up the vacancies as well as increase the number of sanctioned ones since the state is plagued by an acute shortage of doctors, teachers and policemen.“I would like to ask Nitish Kumar how does he go around boasting about improved law and order when Bihar has only 77 police personnel for every one lakh people and, as per the NCRB, reports a rape or a murder every four to five years,” the RJD leader charged.Yadav further made it clear that these “10 lakh sthaayi sarkaari naukriyan” will be in addition to the jobs generated after growth in sectors such as agro-based industries and tourism.“We have made this announcement after due consultation with economic experts. It is an attainable goal. We will come out with a blueprint shortly,” he added.The RJD heads the Grand Alliance, comprising old ally Congress and new ones like the Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP and Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Besides it tends to take along the Left parties which have had some following in the state sharply divided along caste lines.Nonetheless, the coalition has been plagued by frequent squabbles and rebellions. It lost former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha to the NDA a month ago.Kushwaha, too, has been striking a note of dissent of late, stressing that he would remain with the Grand Alliance only if the chief ministerial candidate is changed since he saw Tejashwi as “no match to” Nitish Kumar, the incumbent for the past 15 years.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||AAI plans to upgrade runways at seven airports by March 2022||The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is planning to upgrade runways at seven airports across the country by March 2022, senior officials said on Sunday.These seven airports are at Jammu (J&K), Kolhapur (Maharashtra), Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Barapani (Meghalaya), Kadapa (Andhra Pradesh), Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) and Tuticorin (Tamil Nadu), the AAI officials told PTI.The officials said the runway at the Jammu airport is undergoing expansion from the current length of 2,042 metre to 2,438 metre and it is planned to be completed by March next year.The extension of the runway of the Kolhapur airport from 1,370 metre to 2,300 metre has begun and is planned to be completed by December this year, the officials mentioned.They said the runways at the Jabalpur airport and the Tuticorin airport are expected to be upgraded by December 2021 and March 2022, respectively.Officials explained that the runway of an airport is designed for a particular type of aircraft, depending on traffic demand and other factors.“As the traffic increases, the airline operators want to operate bigger aircraft from the airport. At that time, the runway has to be upgraded to make it suitable for that purpose,” said an official.The runway at the Barapani airport will be “extended and strengthened” by December this year, the officials stated, adding that the Kadapa airport’s runway is also being “extended and strengthened” and the work will be done by March 2021.They said the runway at the Tirupati airport will be extended from the current length of 2,286 metre to 3,810 metre by December 2021.“In total, the runways of these seven airports will be upgraded by March 2022,” said an official. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aai-plans-to-upgrade-runways-at-seven-airports-by-march-2022-147422
27-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt provided over 60,000 oximeters to COVID-19 patients in city: Official data||The Delhi government has so far provided 60,042 oximeters to home quarantined COVID-19 patients in the city to help them check their oxygen levels, according to official figures.The Arvind Kejriwal government had in June announced to provide oximeters to the COVID-19 patients in home isolation with no symptoms or mild symptoms of the disease and facing breathing problems due to low oxygen levels."It was started with a view to be able to provide treatment and shift any such patients to hospital for medical care. Thousands of oximeters distributed by the government have saved many lives of patients in home isolation," a senior government official said.According to the latest government figures, a total of 60,042 oximeters have been distributed among COVID-19 patients spread across 11 districts. Most of the oximeters were provided to patients in West (7,504), Central (7,050), South West(6,953), North West (6,656) and East (5,925) districts.Oximeters are devices used to measure oxygen level in blood. With a drop in blood oxygen level, patients feel problem in breathing and need to be admitted to hospitals if their oxygen saturation drops to 90 per cent or below (normal is 95-100 per cent)."As per need, each day around 40 to over 100 COVID-19 patients are provided with oximeters in each district. Since home isolation patients are in touch with district medical officers, these devices help provide interventions like oxygen concentrators or hospital shifting of patients, if needed," the official said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier termed pulse oximeters as ''suraksha kavach'' (protective shield) for COVID-19 patients and credited the device with minimising deaths of patients under home isolation in Delhi.The government has also started providing oximeters to COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and recuperating at home, as problems like breathlessness persist in some despite being having tested negative for the infection, the official said.According to official records, 41 novel coronavirus patients died at home isolation in Delhi since the first week of May.

27-09-2020||Kabul||Facing Islamic State, last embattled Sikhs, Hindus leave Afghanistan||Afghanistan’s dwindling community of Sikhs and Hindus is shrinking to its lowest levels. With growing threats from the local Islamic State affiliate, many are choosing to leave the country of their birth to escape the insecurity and a once-thriving community of as many as 2,50,000 members now counts fewer than 700.The community’s numbers have been declining for years because of deep-rooted discrimination in the majority Muslim country. But, without what they say is adequate protection from the government, the attacks by the Islamic State group may complete the exodus.“We are no longer able to stay here,” said a member of the tiny community, who asked to be identified only by his last name, Hamdard, out of fear he may be targeted for speaking out.          Hamdard said seven relatives of his, including his sister, nephews, and son-in-law were killed by Islamic State gunmen in an attack on the community’s temple in March, which killed 25 Sikhs.Hamdard said that fleeing his homeland is as difficult as leaving a mother behind. Still, he joined a group of Sikhs and Hindus who left Afghanistan last month for India, from where they will eventually move on to a third country.Although Sikhism and Hinduism are two distinct religions with their own holy books and temples, in Afghanistan the communities are interwoven, having been driven into a kinship by their tiny size, and they both gather under one roof or a single temple to worship, each following their own faith.The community has suffered widespread discrimination in the conservative Muslim country, with each government “threatening us their own way,” said Hamdard, whose home was seized by warlords after the US invasion in 2001, forcing him to live in one of two Sikh temples in the Afghan capital of Kabul.Under Taliban rule in the late 1990s, Sikhs and Hindus were asked to identify themselves by wearing yellow armbands, but after a global outcry, the rule was not enforced.Also driving the exodus is the inability to reclaim Sikh homes, businesses and houses of worship that were illegally seized years ago.Hindu temples in Kabul’s old city were destroyed during brutal fighting between rival warlords from 1992-96. The fighting drove out scores of Hindu and Sikh Afghans.Aside from the March attack by IS gunmen, a 2018 Islamic State suicide attack in the city of Jalalabad killed 19 people, most of them Sikhs, including a longtime leader who had nominated himself for the Afghan parliament.“Suffering big fatalities for a small community is not tolerable,” said Charan Singh Khalsa, a leader of the Sikh community living abroad, who declined to say where he was living out of fear for his safety.He left Afghanistan after his brother was kidnapped and killed in an attack by gunmen in Kabul two years ago.He said the last three years have been the worst period for all Afghans, but especially so for Sikhs and Hindus.Community leaders have slammed recent governments for failing to step up security in the face of the IS threat.Afghanistan’s government in 2010 decided to dedicate a chair in the national assembly to religious minorities, and there have since been two Sikh representatives.But Khalsa called these posts “symbolic”. He criticised the government for taking too long to grant political representation powers to the community and for failing to “provide security to our places of worship.”                A senior Sikh community leader told The Associated Press that the group is in negotiations with the government over its security needs and the repairing of the temple after it was destroyed in March’s attack. The community leader spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the negotiations with the media.At a press conference last month, President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said that members of the Afghan Sikh and Hindu community will return once peace is restored.   The president’s office did not respond to a request for comment from the AP, but other Afghan officials have pledged to assist the community.“We will use all our facilities to provide security to the people,” Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said, without elaborating.       “We are committed and responsible for their (Sikhs and Hindus) mental and personal security.” It is not clear what kind of security measures are being discussed, nor when they might be seen on the ground.Until then, the community’s flight is accelerating, with large numbers of Sikhs and Hindus continuing a recent trend of seeking asylum in India.In August, a group of 176 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus went to India on special visas. They were the second batch since March, with the first 11 members arriving in India in July.Khalsa said that a group of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus in Canada and European countries has volunteered to sponsor the exodus of those remaining in Kabul who cannot afford air tickets and temporary accommodation in a transit country.Several Canadian legislators have asked the country’s immigration ministry for a special programme for Afghan Sikh and Hindu refugees, requesting that they be brought to safety in Canada amid the increasing security threat.For Afghan Sikhs, the thought of being uprooted is painful, despite the circumstances.“It’s hard to leave our birthplace but we have no other option,” said Hamdard. “Afghanistan does not want us anymore.” — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facing-islamic-state-last-embattled-sikhs-hindus-leave-afghanistan-147403

27-09-2020||Mumbai||Kshitij Ravi Prasad remanded in NCB custody till Oct 3||A Mumbai court on Sunday remanded Kshitij Ravi Prasad, who was earlier hired as an executive producer by a firm of filmmaker Karan Johar, in the NCB’s custody till October 3 following his arrest in a drugs case linked to Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.Prasad had joined Dharmatic Entertainment (sister concern of Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions) in November 2019 as one of the executive producers on a contract basis for a project, which eventually did not materialise, Johar said in a statement on Friday.Prasad was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday after questioning.His name cropped up during the NCB’s wider probe into the alleged Bollywood-drugs nexus.He was produced before a magistrate court here via video conferencing which remanded him in the probe agency’s custody till October 3 for further investigation.The NCB on Saturday recorded statements of actors Deepika Padukone, Shraddha Kapoor and Sara Ali Khan in the drugs probe linked to Rajput's death and an alleged Bollywood-drugs nexus.The probe agency told the court on Sunday that Prasad in his statement said that he had procured drugs from another accused Karamjeet Singh Anand and his associates.The probe agency further said the investigation into the case revealed that the accused was a part of conspiracy for drug procurement with other accused persons. He was connected with other accused linked to Rajput’s death case, it said.The investigation into this case is in preliminary stage as revelations made by Prasad are to be verified, the NCB further said.It also said Prasad was indirectly connected with accused Anuj Keshwani, from whom commercial quantity of a contraband was seized. Therefore, it was necessary to interrogate in deep as to whom the accused was delivering the contraband in Bollywood, it added.Prasad’s lawyer Satish Maneshinde, however, told the court that the accused was “harassed and blackmailed” to give a statement.He was also subjected to third degree and ill treatment, the lawyer alleged.Maneshinde then requested the court to record Prasad’s statement, which it allowed.Prasad told the court that during a raid at his house the NCB did not find anything, except a stale and dry cigarette butt, which they “believed to be a ganja joint”, a note shared by his lawyer said.Prasad said his two friends, picked up by the agency, were asked to give a statement against him.He also claimed that the NCB official, while recording his statement, inserted “patently false claims” despite his protest.Prasad told the court that his statement was not recorded as per his narration and language. He claimed to have “unwillingly signed the statement after nearly 50 hours of interrogation, humiliation and torment”, the note said.After hearing both the sides, the magistrate said that detailed custodial interrogation of Prasad was “justifiable” to get the truth out.On Friday, the NCB had also questioned Anubhav Chopra, who earlier worked with Dharma Productions, in connection with the alleged drug-nexus in the Hindi film industry.However, according to Dharma Productions owner Karan Johar, he doesn’t know any of them personally.Johar in a statement on Friday said Prasad had joined Dharmatic Entertainment, sister concern of Dharma Productions, in November 2019 as one of the executive producers on a contract basis for a project, which eventually did not materialise.The filmmaker said Chopra was briefly associated with his banner as an assistant director and worked only on two projects.

27-09-2020||Tiruchirappalli (TN) September 27||Statue of reformist leader Periyar found smeared with saffron dye||A statue of reformist leader E V Ramasamy Periyar here was found smeared with saffron dye on Sunday by unidentified miscreants, drawing strong responses from political leaders in Tamil Nadu.A slipper was also found near the statue at Samathuvapuram colony in Inamkulathur here early this morning, police said, adding a case has been registered for defacing and vandalising the statue.Tamil Nadu Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam condemned the vandalism and assured that stringent legal action would be taken against those involved.Political leaders, including DMK chief M K Stalin slammed the incident, the second such one in the state in recent months, after a statue of the rational leader was found daubed in saffron paint in Coimbatore.Locals blocked traffic for some time on the Dindigul highway, protesting against the vandalism and dispersed after police assured them that action would be taken.Panneerselvam lashed out at the incident, and hailed the leader’s struggle for ensuring social justice.“Stringent legal action will be taken against those anti-social elements involved in the incident,” he said in a tweet.Stalin slammed the defacing of the statue of the Dravidian stalwart and said people will “boycott” such persons.Periyar was not the leader of just a movement---Dravidar Kazhagam—but that of Tamils, he said.“When are they going to realise that people will further boycott them if they repeatedly do the same mistake,” he said in a Facebook post without naming anyone.There have been repeated instances of Periyar statues being vandalised or desecrated in the recent past in the state.“Periyar is not the leader of just a movement. He is the leader of the Tamil race. Those who do such things thinking they are insulting him are insulting themselves,” he said and strongly condemned the incident.PMK leader S Ramadoss hit out at the defacing of the statue and demanded “strong action” against those involved.MDMK founder and Rajya Sabha MP Vaiko, AMMK leader and independent MLA T T V Dhinakaran and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, MP, also criticised the latest episode of targeting Periyar’s statue and demanded that such elements be dealt with strictly.E V Ramasamy, fondly addressed by supporters and followers in the reverential term ‘Periyar’, led a popular self-respect movement in the state based on rationalist principles and is the founder of DMK’s parent organisation, Dravidar Kazhagam.

In the sops announced on Tuesday, the government also decided to offer jobs in the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation to heirs of those who lost lives during the Maratha quota protests.It said action will be taken on proposals in this regard within a month of their submission.The Maratha community members will get benefits announced by the state government till the Supreme Court vacates the stay on quota, an official statement said.The state government on Monday filed an application before the larger bench of the Supreme Court, seeking to vacate the apex court's stay on implementing the quota.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||Travellers from Dubai, UK contributed maximum COVID-19 importations into India: IIT study||Travellers from Dubai and the UK were primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India, according to an analytical study done by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Mandi.According to the research, which has been published in the Journal of Travel Medicine, COVID-19 got induced into Indian states mainly due to international travels.The study has also found that infected cases from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh played less role in spreading the disease outside their communities. Whereas infected people in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka played a significant role in the local transmission, and some of them caused interstate transfer too."We tracked the spread of COVID-19 and its diffusion from the global to national level and identified a few super spreaders who played a central role in the transmission of the disease in India. The COVID-19 spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local," Sarita Azad, Assistant Professor, IIT Mandi, told PTI."The research team has used the travel history of infected patients from January to April as the primary data source and a social network was created depicting the spread in the early phase of the pandemic. The research found that the maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (144) and the UK ( 64),” she added.Azad explained that statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India."Dubai's eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India."Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14," she said."The modularity class of states such as Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh was low. Hence, it is likely that infected cases from these states played less of a role in spreading the disease outside their communities. Whereas states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka played a significant role in the local transmission, and some of them caused interstate transfer too," she added.Azad, who conducted the analytical study, along with her student Sushma Devi, said, "When a pandemic like COVID-19 subsides, a good research work serves as a record for the future. In this work, we have used real time data and demonstrated how the disease got diffused from the global to national level from January 30 to April 6. This will be an important contribution to understanding the disease transmission in India during the early phase of the pandemic." India's COVID-19 caseload neared 60 lakh with 88,600 fresh infections being reported on Sunday, while the number of people having recuperated from the disease crossed 49 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 82.46 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry.The total coronavirus cases mounted to 59,92,532, while the death toll climbed to 94,503 with 1,124 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, data updated at 8 am showed.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||Jaswant Singh: A soft-spoken former Army officer, astute politician||A soft-spoken man, former BJP leader Jaswant Singh was one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party and a leading light of the party when Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishan Advani helmed it through the tumultuous period of Indian politics. And with his demise, another party stalwart of that era has passed into eternity.Also read: Former Union minister Jaswant Singh dies at 82Given that he had retired as a Major-rank officer from the Indian Army, it was no surprise that he was very punctual in his meetings with different people.The veteran politician passed away at the age of 82 early Sunday morning at the Army Research and Referral Hospital in Delhi following a cardiac arrest.Even though he was from an Army background, he not only handled the portfolios of defence, but also finance and external affairs in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments. He was one of the key Ministers who were at the forefront when Vajpayee's government was in power at the Centre at different points in time.Jaswant Singh, who hailed from Rajasthan, first served as the Union Finance Minister in the shortlived Vajpayee government in 1996. He became the External Affairs Minister in the next Vajpayee-led government (1998-2002). Later, he was again given the charge of finance in 2002. The veteran leader was also Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission at one point in time.The BJP leader was made the Defence Minister following the resignation of George Fernandes after the latter's name cropped up in a defence scam.An astute politician, Jaswant Singh hogged media limelight the world over when he was tasked to hold talks with the Taliban for the release of passengers of an Indian Airlines flight hijacked in December 1999. He even escorted three terrorists, accused of various crimes that included the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, to Afghanistan to swap instead of the safe release of 190 passengers.After the 1998 nuclear tests by India, Jaswant Singh was deputed by then Prime Minister Vajpayee to engage the US in strategic talks.After the BJP party lost power at the Centre in 2004 to the United Progressive Alliance, Jaswant Singh served as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha from 2004 to 2009.The veteran leader stirred a controversy after the BJP suffered its second successive defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections by circulating a note to demand a thorough discussion on the poll debacle.He again faced a backlash in 2009 from certain quarters after a book authored by him on Pakistan leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah, entitled 'Jinnah: India-Partition-Independence' was released. He had written sympathetically about the founder of Pakistan. Later, the BJP leader was marginalised within the party and subsequently expelled.He was reinducted into the party later on but parted ways in 2014. Jaswant Singh even contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as an Independent from Barmer in Rajasthan after failing to get a BJP ticket but lost to the party nominee Colonel Sona Ram.Soon after the general elections in 2014, Jaswant Singh slipped in the bathroom of his residence on August 7 that year and suffered a serious head injury.Condoling the death of the veteran leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he served the nation diligently -- first as a soldier and later during his long association with politics."During Atalji's government, he handled crucial portfolios and left a strong mark in the worlds of finance, defence, and external affairs. Saddened by his demise," the Prime Minister said in his message."True to his nature, Jaswantji fought his illness with immense courage for the last six years," Modi said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that Jaswant Singh would be remembered for his intellectual capabilities and a stellar record in service to the nation. "He also played a key role in strengthening the BJP in Rajasthan. Condolences to his family and supporters in this sad hour. Om Shanti," the Minister said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaswant-singh-a-soft-spoken-former-army-officer-astute-politician-147372
27-09-2020||New Delhi||Fitness industry gets stab at revival as people trickle back into gyms||Trainer Ravi Shukla rushed to his gym as soon as news came in last fortnight that gymnasiums and yoga institutes could open, pulled out a chair and sat alone amid the treadmills, cross trainers and weights, a broad smile creasing his face.The smile has broadened since with people slowly trickling back into gyms, giving the fitness industry a stab at revival after six months of shutters down as COVID-19 spread and people stayed confined to their homes.Business has been hit and may take a while to get back to normal but at least a beginning has been made, say industry insiders.Though gyms in several states, including Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Bihar, continue to be closed, Delhi and Haryana are among the places where they have been allowed to open, albeit with a host of safeguards in place.The six months since March, when India went into lockdown to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus, took its toll on thousands of people who depend on the fitness industry for their livelihoods.Shukla, a Delhi-based strength and conditioning coach, was one of those who faced severe hardship during the long months that saw the industry face crippling losses and layoffs.The “emotional and financial stress” led to depression, and he was almost at the end of the tether when the Delhi Disaster Management Authority announced that gyms outside containment zones could open."I rushed to my gym and sat quietly in the middle of the equipment and machines, smiling ear to ear. That is the first thing I did when I got to know about the government's order allowing gyms to reopen," Shukla, manager and coach at Anytime Fitness in west Delhi's Patel Nagar, told PTI.He was alone, happy and relieved."Being back in the gym worked like medicine for me. Before the pandemic, I would spend nearly 12-15 hours a day there—barring Saturday or Sunday. I have started getting calls from my clients and they are also excited about joining back. Hopefully, life will be back to normal soon," the 32-year-old said.Anytime Fitness, a franchise with over 80 gyms across the country, including 45 in the Delhi-NCR region, opened its gyms in the capital last week after taking time to sanitise their premises. Government-instructed protocols, including availability of sanitisers, spaced out equipment and thermal screening of both staff and members, are in place."To maintain social distancing, members are asked to book a slot. After every slot, deep sanitation is done. They are asked to carry their own water bottle, yoga mats, towels and extra pair of shoes. We have also placed QR codes at entry/exit points, which notes timing of people coming to the gym and is also a health declaration form," said Chirag Khurana, senior manager, marketing, Anytime fitness India.      Karan Chopra, who owns the Iron Club Gym in Rohini, said the onus is on managements and clients to take preventive measures seriously."We can only remain safe if we keep in mind basic hygiene and practise the same. We are following all guidelines set by the government -- all symptomatic individuals should stay home, the Arogya Setu App and face masks are mandatory, pregnant women and members above the age of 60 are not allowed and all group activities are restricted," said Chopra.The many precautions being taken appear to be working for some establishments, who opened about a week-10 days ago.Anytime Fitness says their numbers are going up each day.“We are very happy with the footfalls so far. On the very first day of opening, we had 80 people showing up… the count is only increasing. We allow only 40 people in one slot. People are sceptical to begin with but when they come and see the gym is following all protocols they get confidence,” said Ravi.Iron Gym's experience has been a little different.“People are still nervous about heading out and that is the reason we are witnessing fewer people coming to gyms. We allow 10-12 people in a given slot, but so far we have seen only six-eight people showing up,” Chopra said.Many gyms have also taken the initiative to create zones, add separators and step up sanitisation processes.Grand Slam Fitness, a premium fitness company supplying products to ensure social distancing and safety, has witnessed a spike in demand for equipment such as ‘isolators' -- essentially 'separators' that ensure safety for users on parallel machines as they isolate each equipment.  "We are witnessing tremendous demand for the recently launched 'isolator'. It works like an individual workout pod, and is made with transparent acrylic that is extremely easy to maintain and clean," said Prateek Sood, director, Grand Slam Fitness.  The company, he added, is planning to introduce more creative products to ensure a smooth transition for all businesses in health and fitness infrastructure.  The decision to reopen gyms is a sign of normalcy and while some are tentative about stepping into one, most people agree that fitness is the need of the hour, particularly after sedentary months of staying at home.A 26-year-old schoolteacher said she had just got into a gym routine when the lockdown happened. Her weight was up to 96 kg, and she was borderline diabetic."I had just started getting the hang of it after going for some 20-days when the lockdown was imposed."I am definitely rejoining. Of course, the task is tougher because I have gained more weight in these months and then there is this fear of coronavirus too," she said.Even five-star properties, including Crowne Plaza Today, Okhla and Hilton Garden Inn, Saket, offering lucrative staycation packages are positive about increasing the number of footfalls with the availability of a fully functional gym at their disposal."A smart health and wellness offering plays an integral role when a guest books a stay in a hotel, be it business or a leisure trip. It benefits the hotel by improving customer engagement and ultimately helping to retain customer loyalty to ensure repeat business,"  said Ranjan Bannerjee, general manager, Crowne Plaza Today, Okhla.Some gyms, however, are wary and say they will continue with their online sessions for the moment.Goodways Fitness, for instance, a leading fitness studio for women, decided to stay shut following feedback from members."We won't deny that we got into deep financial distress due to the prolonged lockdown. But let's be realistic, despite all the safety protocols put in place, we cannot assure a 100 per cent Covid free ambience to our customers," said Shakti Kashyap, co-founder of Goodways Fitness.According to Gympik, a health and fitness aggregator, 20-25 per cent gyms might shut down.“Until the pandemic is over, the industry needs to plan for its survival… Pivoting the business model to a hybrid model—online and offline—is something that fitness centre owners will have to consider to align with this new & changing landscape," said Amaresh Ojha, founder & CEO, Gympik.India's COVID-19 tally neared 60 lakh with 88,600 fresh infections being reported on Sunday, while the death toll mounted to 94,503 according to the Union Health Ministry.

27-09-2020||Los Angeles||Homemade masks release fibres into air, important to wash them: Scientists||While surgical and N95 masks cut down the amount of aerosolized particles emitted during breathing, talking and coughing, scientists say in the case of homemade cloth face coverings, the fabric which traps the droplets may release a large amount of fibres into the air, underscoring the importance of washing them.The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, noted that the use of masks and other face coverings has emerged as an important tool to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.But while evidence shows that face coverings generally reduce the spread of airborne particles containing the virus, the scientists, including those from the University of California Davis (UC Davis) in the US, noted that there is limited information on how well they compare with each other.They set up experiments to measure the flow of particles from volunteers wearing masks while they performed "expiratory activities" including breathing, talking, coughing and moving their jaw as if chewing gum.According to the scientists, these particles are small enough to float through the air over a considerable distance, but large enough to carry viruses such as the novel coronavirus which causes COVID-19.They also found that a fraction of people are "superemitters" who give off many more particles than average.In the study, 10 volunteers sat in front of a funnel in a laminar flow cabinet which drew air from in front of their faces into a device that measured the size and number of particles they exhaled.One of the volunteers in the study was a superemitter who consistently produced nearly 100 times as many particles as the others when coughing, the scientists said.The volunteers wore either no mask, a medical-grade surgical mask, two types of N95 mask (vented or not), a homemade paper mask or homemade one- or two-layer cloth mask made from a cotton T-shirt.The study found that talking gave off about 10 times more particles than simple breathing without wearing a mask, and forced coughing produced a variable amount of particles.In all the test scenarios, surgical and N95 masks blocked as much as 90 percent of particles, compared to not wearing a mask, the researchers said.Face coverings also reduced airborne particles from the superemitter, the study noted.However, the researchers said, homemade cotton masks actually produced more particles than not wearing a mask.According to the scientists, these appeared to be tiny fibres released from the fabric.Since the cotton masks produced particles themselves, they said it's difficult to tell if they also blocked exhaled particles, but added that they seemed to at least reduce the number of larger particles.While masks are effective in reducing the spread of airborne particles, the scientists said it is also important to regularly wash cloth masks.

It undertook extensive search in the area and located the craft carrying 12 crew members who had abandoned the vessel as it was sinking due to flooding, it said.The Coast Guard ship rescued all the 12 crew under challenging circumstances owing to night hours, floating dangerous debris and unfavourable weather conditions, it said.“They were brought to Okha and are safe,” the statement said.The area where the incident took place is being monitored by the Coast Guard Ship C-161 so that it can combat any probable oil pollution incident that might result from leakage of fuel from the sunken dhow, it added.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||Rakul Preet Singh moves Delhi High Court seeking ban on media reporting in Rhea Chakraborty drug case||Actress Rakul Preet Singh on Saturday approached the Delhi High Court seeking an interim direction to the Centre, Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association to ensure that the media does not broadcast any programme or publish any article connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.The actress sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation and files an appropriate report before the competent court.The application, filed under a pending petition, is likely to come up for hearing next week.The high court had on September 17 sought the Centre's reply on Singh's petition to stop media reports from connecting her with the Chakraborty drug case and had said that the leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".In the application, she said she was in Hyderabad for a film shoot and on the evening of September 23, she was shocked to see media reports that NCB has summoned her to appear before it in Mumbai the next morning in connection with the drug case.However, she had not received any summons either on her Hyderabad address or Mumbai address and remained in Hyderabad.The plea claimed that the media started running fake news to the effect that the actress who was in Hyderabad had supposedly reached Mumbai on September 23 evening for the NCB investigation.It said she received the summons on the morning of September 24 through WhatsApp after which she appeared before the NCB the next day to assist in the investigation and gave her written statement as to the facts in her knowledge.The application claimed that the media continued to maliciously broadcast and publish fake news against her.On September 17, the high court had also asked all the authorities to treat her petition as a representation and take a decision on it expeditiously before the next date of hearing on October 15.It had also expressed the hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".The actress claimed that on September 19, she gave a written request for a personal hearing to each of the respondents but except the News Broadcasters Association (NBA), none of them has replied.She said the Association said her representation will be considered virtually on September 24 but it was not taken up after which she has filed a fresh application in the court.The actress, in her petition, has claimed that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner".

27-09-2020||New York||WHO chief hails Modi's assurance of India's vaccine production prowess to help nations fight COVID-19||World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's assurance that India will use its vaccine production capacity in helping nations fight COVID-19, saying the pandemic can be defeated only by mobilising resources for common good.In his address to the 75th session of the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Modi said that “as the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today. India's vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.”He said that even during these very difficult times of the raging pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries.“Thank you for your commitment to solidarity, Prime Minister @narendramodi. Only together, by mobilising our forces and resources jointly for the common good, can we end the #COVID-19 pandemic,” WHO Director-General Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.Modi told the 193-member UN General Assembly that in India and the neighbourhood, “we are moving ahead with phase 3 clinical trials in India.”Modi further assured that India will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of the vaccines.He, however, questioned the response of the United Nations in combating the pandemic that has so far infected over 32 million people in the world and will soon reach the grim milestone of a million deaths.“Over the last 8 to 9 months, the whole world has been battling the pandemic of the Coronavirus. Where is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?” Modi said.Melissa Fleming, Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications at the United Nations, said Modi's assurance is a “welcome news” because UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had told the General Assembly in his address last week that “vaccinationalism" is not only unfair but self-defeating.With the COVID-19 pandemic soon reaching the grim milestone of a million deaths, Guterres had chided those countries who are making “side deals" to have a COVID-19 vaccine exclusively for their own populations.“Such ‘vaccinationalism' is not only unfair, it is self-defeating. None of us is safe, until all of us are safe. Likewise, economies cannot run with a runaway pandemic,” Guterres had said.

27-09-2020||Jodhpur/New Delhi||Former Union minister Jaswant Singh cremated in Jodhpur||Former Union minister Jaswant Singh was cremated at his farm house in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur on Sunday evening.Singh, one of the founding members of the BJP and a close associate of ex-prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, died here on Sunday following a long spell of illness. He was 82.His son Manvendra Singh lit the funeral pyre amid chanting of Vedic mantras.     Singh’s family members and relatives were present during the cremation at the farm house located near a civil airport.President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union ministers and other top leaders cutting across the political spectrum paid rich tributes to Singh.Singh, a former Army officer, had a fall at his home in August 2014 and was admitted to the Army Research and Referral Hospital. He was in a coma for a long spell and had been in and out of the hospital since then. He was admitted again in June this year. "It is with profound grief that we inform about the sad demise of Hon'ble Major Jaswant Singh (Retd), former Cabinet Minister at 0655 hours on 27 September 2020. He was admitted on 25 Jun 2020 and being treated for sepsis with Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome and effects of Severe Head Injury old (Optd) had a Cardiac arrest this morning," the hospital said in a statement. Also read: Jaswant Singh: A soft-spoken former Army officer, astute politicianDespite the best efforts of specialists to resuscitate him, he could not be revived and passed away, it added. His funeral will take place later today at Jodhpur in Rajasthan, family sources said.Reacting to Singh's death, the President said the demise of the "veteran soldier, outstanding parliamentarian, exceptional leader and intellectual" was distressing. "He combined many difficult roles with ease and equanimity. My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends," he said.Modi said that Singh served India diligently and will be remembered for his unique perspective on matters of politics and society.The prime minister later spoke to Singh's son Manvendra to convey his condolences. True to his nature, Jaswant Singh fought his illness with immense courage for the last six years, Modi said. Condoling his death, Modi said, "Jaswant Singh Ji served our nation diligently, first as a soldier and later during his long association with politics. During Atal Ji's Government, he handled crucial portfolios and left a strong mark in the worlds of finance, defence and external affairs".In his eclectic career, Singh donned many hats -- army officer, author, Union minister, but his handling of the Kandahar hijack crisis as the then external affairs minister in 1999 was one that looms large.Singh, considered close to Vajpayee and veteran leader L K Advani, was one of India's rare politicians to have held the portfolios of defence, external affairs, finance and the post of the deputy chairman of the planning commission, in BJP governments under Vajpayee.Born on January 3, 1938, in village Jasol in Barmer district, Singh served the Indian Army in the 1950s and 60s. He resigned his commission to pursue a political career and had a distinguished tenure in Parliament being a member of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha multiple times. Singh had been associated with the BJP since its foundation in 1980. He was twice expelled from the party. In 2009, the BJP expelled him after his book 'Jinnah - India, Partition, Independence' was published.He came back into the party fold 10 months later but faced a second expulsion in 2014 when he defied party orders and contested from Barmer as an Independent after being denied a ticket.Though there were several highs and a few lows in his career in politics, his role and decision-making in the Kandahar hijacking have been the subject of much debate and dissection.In a book, Singh, while talking about the IC 814 flight that was hijacked from Kathmandu to Kandahar in Afghanistan on Christmas eve in 1999 with 161 passengers and crew on board, said it was "most demanding and emotionally a most draining period" of his life.Singh had accompanied the three released terrorists, including Jaish-e-Mohammed head Masood Azhar, on a flight to Kandahar for a hostage swap deal with the hijackers.Singh had recounted in his book how the hijacking had taken place about an hour after he had become a proud grandfather to a baby girl, and that it was a tough decision to agree to swap the terrorists. He said he was opposed to any compromise to start with but slowly began to change as time passed.Singh, who had close ties across the political spectrum, was known to be a scholarly gentleman in political circles but was never one to hold back his views.Expressing his anguish over Singh's demise, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he served the nation in several capacities and distinguished himself as an effective minister and parliamentarian."Jaswant Singh ji would be remembered for his intellectual capabilities and stellar record in service to the nation. He also played a key role in strengthening the BJP in Rajasthan," he said. Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, DMK chief MK Stalin, Jairam Ramesh, P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor, among others, condoled his demise.Former Union minister Omar Abdullah tweeted, "Jaswant Singh sahib was my senior minister when I was Minister of State External Affairs. He was supportive without being interfering, was always available for advice & never made me feel like my work didn't matter."  "He was the perfect boss & mentor," he said. Between 2004 and 2009, Singh was Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha.He was also a prolific writer and authored several books in Hindi and English. He also contributed widely to Indian and foreign magazines, newspapers and journals on international affairs, security and development issues.

The elections will be held in three phases in Bihar on October 28, November 3 and November 7. The results will be announced on November 10.Kumar, who had emerged victorious in the 2015 poll, had announced the Rs 2.7-lakh-crore ‘Saat Nischay’ scheme just days ahead of the elections. Electricity, sewage connection, toilets, piped drinking water and metallic roads were some of the components of the scheme. Back then, his party JD(U) and the BJP were rivals, and the announcement was made to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Rs 1.25 lakh crore special package for Bihar.The Grand Alliance, which then comprised the JD(U), the RJD and the Congress, registered a landslide victory, proving that the “sushasan” (good governance) plank worked well for Kumar. Buoyed by its success, Kumar, who had earned the moniker of ‘sushasan babu’ subsequent to the 2015 elections, on Friday unveiled phase-II of ‘saat nischay’, and urged people to vote him back to power.The JD(U) chief said a separate skill and entrepreneurship department would be set up in the state to “hone technical knowledge of youth” and brighten their job prospects, and all Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and polytechnic colleges would be brought under its purview.Kumar further said that his government, if given another opportunity, would provide up to Rs 10 lakh assistance to women for starting a venture, much like it had been doing for the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe youths.“For the elderly population, many of them victims of neglect by their families, the government would set up old age homes and ensure they lead their lives with respect,” the JD(U) chief explained. — PTITejashwi, Tej Pratap flout covid norms, booked  RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav, Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) leader Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, have been booked in poll-bound Bihar for taking out rallies here to protest the contentious farm Bills without permission and violating the Covid-19 protocol.

Her mentors along the way: Bimal Jalan, Amartya Sen, Manmohan Singh and Paul Samuelson. She was among the young turks of economic liberalisation, who along with her husband, positioned themselves against the status quoits crowd of the licence-quota-permit-raj early on in her career.Though the Central governments of the Congress persuasion absorbed the homilies that came from the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), an institution she built herself, her home state Punjab saw fit to requisition her services only in 2005 when Capt Amarinder Singh was the Chief Minister.It is also a tribute to her mite in building up the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) that when she stepped down as the chairman on August 11 she was unanimously made its first chairman-emeritus, never mind that this may not have been to the current regime’s liking.As was the case with her husband, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, there was just no doubt where they stood in the politics of economic development. . With the advent of the BJP government, Isher Judge focused on the ICRIER, encouraging her wards to keep pushing the boundaries of economic thought.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gentler-proponent-of-laissez-faire-147217

He urged the top court to direct the Centre to “make appropriate modification or interpretation of sections or provisions of the IPC dealing with sexual assault to include transgender, transsexuals, kinnar and eunuchs in the definitions accordingly”.Kansal also wanted an anti-discrimination law that penalised discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender and implementation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights by India as it was a signatory to it.“In spite of declaring transgender people to be a ‘third gender’ by this court, there is no provision or section in the IPC which may protect the third gender from the sexual assault by male or female or another transgender,” Kansal submitted in his PIL, referring to a 2014 verdict of the top court on rights of transgenders.The top court had granted “recognition to the transgenders as ‘persons’ falling under the ambit of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution”, still they do not have equal protection of law in relation to sexual offenses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-protect-transgenders-from-sexual-offences-147220

Nor was there a firm commitment to resolving the issues of the Tamil community, almost a decade after the end of the civil war. On the port project, the joint statement merely resolved to work towards the “early realisation of infrastructure and connectivity projects” through bilateral agreements and MoUs.In response to PM Modi’s call on the Sri Lankan Government to address the aspirations of the Tamil people, Rajapaksa eschewed any commitment on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. “Sri Lanka will work towards realising the expectations of all ethnic groups, including Tamils,” he responded. PM Modi announced that a delegation of Buddhist pilgrims from Sri Lanka will be aboard the inaugural international flight to the sacred city of Kushinagar, which has recently been announced as an international airport. The two leaders also agreed to facilitate tourism by enhancing connectivity and by early establishment of an air bubble. They also resolved to strengthen cooperation between the armed forces through personal visits, maritime security cooperation and support to Sri Lanka in the spheres of defence and security.Recognising that BIMSTEC was an important platform for regional cooperation linking South Asia with South East Asia, both leaders agreed to work together to ensure a successful BIMSTEC Summit to be hosted under the Chairmanship of Sri Lanka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/11-point-agenda-but-sri-lanka-wont-commit-on-colombo-port-147180
