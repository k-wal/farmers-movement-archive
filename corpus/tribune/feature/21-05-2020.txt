Now I feel like I'm treated like a third-class citizen," said Lois, 42, who refused to give her surname because she is not out at work.Missing piece of puzzleSame-sex marriage became legal in Taiwan on May 24 last year, a week after its parliament passed a bill offering similar protections of marriage to heterosexuals.But gay people could only marry foreigners from a country where same-sex marriage is also legal, and adopt children biologically related to at least one of them.Lois's partner, who is from China where gay marriage is not recognised, had to give up her job in 2017 and become a student so she could stay on the island and raise their three-year-old son.Because they are not legally married, Lois's partner cannot get a spouse visa, and they have been apart since she and the couple's son returned to China on holiday before Taiwan closed to visitors to control the spread of the coronavirus."Under the law, my son and I are strangers. I want us — my wife, my son — to be recognised as a family," Lois told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Taipei.Long seen as a beacon of liberalism in Asia, Taiwan became the first place in the region to allow gay marriage, although the move faced stiff opposition and divided the self-ruled island.More than 3,500 gay couples have married since last year, official figures show. About 1,000 more could not due to restrictions on foreigners, LGBT+ groups estimate.A petition this month calling for full recognition has been signed by more than 10,000 people, said the organiser, the Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights, a charity."Many people have had to resort to using student or travel visas to stay here. It's causing a lot of anxieties and uncertainties," said Chien Chih-chieh, its secretary-general."It's the final missing piece of the puzzle that we need to achieve marriage equality," she added.President Tsai Ing-wen, who won January's election by a landslide and was sworn in for a second term on Wednesday, said society had become more diverse and open since passing the law."One year has passed, the values we want to protect still exist and at the same time, we have let more people embrace happiness together," Tsai wrote on her official Facebook page."There are still a lot of measures that need to be adjusted after the law was approved," she added, without specifying.Her office did not reply to a request seeking comment on calls to allow all international gay marriages.Gains, setbacks in AsiaElsewhere in Asia, progress towards gay marriage has been slow.A court in the Philippines rejected a same-sex marriage petition last year and Hong Kong has upheld a ban on civil partnerships, although gay couples have made small gains in public housing and spousal visa rights.Thailand drafted a bill that would recognise same-sex couples as civil partners, but progress since has stalled.Japanese gay couples meanwhile sued the government over the right to marriage last year."We understand changes in society take time," said Jennifer Lu, a representative for the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association in Asia.She said the law passed in Taiwan was a breakthrough as it shows gay marriage does not contradicts "Asian values".Taiwanese publisher Lai Kai-li is optimistic that same-sex unions will be accepted more widely in Taiwan and other parts of Asia.Her partner of six years is Malaysian and has been on a student visa in Taiwan since 2016, the same year they held a symbolic "wedding" under Chinese traditions to celebrate with families."We are hoping to settle down and have a family," said the 37-year-old. "I'm confident it's a matter of time, the law will accept us." — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/features/happily-ever-after-eludes-taiwan-a-year-after-asias-first-gay-marriages-87914
21-05-2020||By Brenda Goh (Reuters)||Relief, and fear, at ground zero of the coronavirus||Wuhan, May 21Back in March when I was in Wuhan as it opened up after over two months in lockdown, I often went past the Minyi vegetable market. Blocked by 2-metre-high yellow barricades, it was a constant reminder of how the city's life had come to a crashing halt during the pandemic.Last week, the barricades were gone and the locksmith and egg shops that fronted it were open as Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, celebrated emerging from the worst of the pandemic. The street was filled with hawkers selling turnips and fresh pork.Traffic jams have returned in the city of 11 million and there is mass dancing in its open-air plazas by the Yangtze River. The hotel where I stayed, which used to spray me from head to toe with disinfectant before entering, has done away with the practice.Restaurants have resumed allowing patrons to dine in and the city has launched an ambitious plan to test all its residents for the virus.But amid the relief that the worst was over, it was in the snaking queues of people lining up before hazmat-suit clad medical workers that I encountered a lingering fear.Wuhan officially kicked off a campaign on May 14 to look for asymptomatic carriers — infected people who show no outward sign of illness — after confirming its first cluster of COVID-19 infections in early May for the first time since it was released from the lockdown. In the largest such exercise in the world, over 2 million people have been tested since it started and 71 have been found to be virus carriers.Some people fretted that the clustering and long queues at test sites could expose them to the virus again.In March, many neighbourhood community workers, perhaps overcome with relief and exhaustion after the virus battle, were generally friendly and open to talking about what life had been like.This time, community organisers dressed in bright red vests were reluctant to talk to journalists and told us to leave a test site where a packed queue of migrant workers stood in line to get tested.Wuhan city officials did not respond when asked why reporters were being told to leave the sites.Despite the return of some public life and commerce, many Wuhan residents spoke of a continued fear of a second wave of the virus, saying they were going out less than before."You can say that there are two types of people now in Wuhan," said one resident, who, like others, declined to be named on a topic that remains sensitive."The first are no longer that worried and some even go out without wearing masks. Others, like me, remain careful. We only want to meet in open-air areas and we ask if it might return."China has confirmed 82,967 cases of COVID-19 and 4,634 deaths, with about 80 percent of them in Wuhan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/features/relief-and-fear-at-ground-zero-of-the-coronavirus-87912
