12-02-2021||---||Woman among 4 booked||Jalandhar, February 11Three days after people protested outside an immigration company’s office at PPR Mall, the cops registered a case against the company owners at division number 7 police station.Nearly 100 youngsters and their family members on Monday had alleged that A2Z Destinations Solutions Pvt Ltd company owners duped them on the pretext of sending them abroad. An FIR was registered against four people, including a woman. The accused have been identified as Inderjit Singh, Palwinder Singh, Simranjit Kaur and Harjot Singh.SHO police division number 7 said the accused have been booked under Sections 420 of the IPC and Section 13 of the Punjab Travel Professions Regulation (PTPR) Act.As the accused owners of the firm are absconding, the police are reportedly tracing their whereabouts by tracking their mobile locations and call details.The owners of the immigration firm committed fraud with people from various districts, including Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana and Phagwara among others.The fraud came to light after the youth aspiring to go abroad informed the police that the company had promised to provide them visas for Malaysia, Singapore, Qatar, Dubai and even England.While the immigration firm has been lying shut for the past few weeks, the protesters, demanding arrest of the owner, said after taking the money (in lakhs), the company neither prepared their documents, nor returned the money, but issued fake visas. The agents demanded them to pay up to Rs50,000 to Rs2 lakh as the token money before applying for visas and it varied depending upon the country they applied for.Mandeep Singh, one of the victims who had come from Kapurthala, said he was approached by the company during the lockdown and subsequently, he paid the expenses for his documents, but after receiving the money, they only made fake promises and didn’t tell him about the status of his documents.The case is being probed under the supervision of ACP Model Town Harinder Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/woman-among-4-booked-211254

12-02-2021||Deepkamal Kaur||Scheme introduced for students loses steam||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, February 11Glaring problems, which Dalit students have been facing every year due to delay in the disbursal of the SC Post-Matric Scholarship by the governments, have led to a drastic fall in the number of applicants.Despite repeated extension in the last date to apply for the scholarship, only 18,803 Dalit students from Jalandhar district applied this year. This particular number is too small for Jalandhar, which is considered a Dalit hub with a population of five to six lakh voters. Last year, 22,179 beneficiaries enrolled for the scheme in the district and this year the number has dropped by 3,376 applicants.The actual number of college students who availed the scheme this year stands at 10,903 and the remaining 7,900 applicants were from Class XI, XII, ITIs and nursing institutes. Maximum applicants (7,702) were from Jalandhar-1 tehsil. There has been a very poor response from Shahkot sub-division from where only 33 students applied for the scholarship. Phillaur sub-division, which has a maximum number of Dalit students, has a low turnout of just 360 beneficiaries.Officials of the District Welfare Department said earlier, the last date to apply for the scheme was February 5, which had been extended to February 15. He said they were expecting a few more applications in the next few days.Balwinder Kumar, a BSP leader and a Dalit student said, “Going by the population of Dalits in the district, the number of applicants under the SC Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme is too low. The governments and colleges have made the entire process very tedious. Only a student who is pushy is able to get enrolled under it. Students are made to feel as if they are beggars and are belittled almost every day.”He said, “Either the SC students are arranging their own fee by taking loans or are opting for part-time courses rather than taking admission in mainstream courses.”While the Congress leaders had been alleging that the Centre’s policies had led to erosion of the scheme, the Akalis blamed the BJP and the Congress.SAD legislator Pawan Tinu, who had been repeatedly raking up the issue, said, “The Centre as well as the Punjab Government has led to exploitation of Dalit students. Needy students have been facing trouble and humiliation right from getting admission to appearing in exams and getting degrees. The scheme, which was meant to uplift them, has led to the loss of morale and is creating hindrances in studies.”He said, “An amount of Rs309 crore, which the Centre had released to Punjab in March 2020, is yet to be disbursed to colleges. The institutes had withheld degrees of around 50,000 students (some of them for three years) as the government was not releasing grants to them. In such a scenario, a dip in the number of applicants is very much expected.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/scheme-introduced-for-students-loses-steam-211257
