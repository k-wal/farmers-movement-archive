The incident occurred around 9.30 pm when the victim was going towards Basti Danishmandan area. He received injuries on his head and left hand.The victim was reportedly taking all posters in a cart when two bike-borne youths stopped near him and asked him the way to Kot Sadiq. “These youths went away and returned after a while. They again came to me and asked as to whose posters I was taking. When I told them that these were MLA Rinku’s posters, they took out their belts and started beating me up. They also brought bricks and attacked me on my head due which I suffered a grievous injury. As people heard my screams, they came out and the two assailants run away,” said Rahul.Rinku’s supporters alleged that the political rivals in his constituency were perhaps getting jittery due to his popularity and were resorting to such violent acts to incite him. Rinku said, “The youth who was injured is from my team hired for the purpose of pasting posters and banners. We have got a complaint registered against him.”The SHO, Division Number 5, said, “We have received a complaint and the MLR copy this evening. An ASI had gone to the Civil Hospital to record the statement of the victim. We will file an FIR on the basis of the statement and other proofs that we gather. We will also try to recover CCTV footage of the incident if possible to identify the miscreants.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/youth-pasting-posters-of-mla-rinku-attacked-363144
21-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Rana Gurjeet Singh campaigns for his 'Independent' son against Cong's official candidate||Jalandhar, January 20Two days after three MLAs and an ex-MLA demanded expulsion of minister Rana Gurjeet Singh from the Congress, he took on Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Cheema holding a rally in his native Bussewal village and addressing it in favour of his son Rana Inder Partap Singh.Rana’s son has announced to contest from Sultanpur Lodhi as Independent candidate against party candidate Cheema, over which the latter has been lodging complaint with the party against Rana for creating indiscipline. Rana did not just dare to hold a rally against Cheema but even challenged him in his hometown.“I will quit politics if my son loses the battle”, he announced. He even said that Cheema would have surely become jittery after seeing the strength and the response of the rally in his own village. Cheema, however, has alleged that Rana had brought in 40 cars from his own Kapurthala constituency and showed them as voters of Sultanpur Lodhi.The war of words that has ensued between the two has made the atmosphere in Sultanpur constituency very tense. Rana has been claiming that he is not committing any indiscipline. “I am just supporting my son. When he will win, we will add this seat in the Congress kitty,” he is telling at all rallies. Meanwhile, Cheema fumes: “When I have got the Congress ticket, how and why should the minister from the same party support an Independent candidate against me. This is gross indiscipline and I hope that the party high command will act soon.”Rana, on the other hand, has said: “If party president Sonia Gandhi will ask me to withdraw from supporting my son, I will follow her direction. For me, party is still supreme. I have only been supporting my son as the people of Sultanpur Lodhi have been feeling much suppressed under Cheema owing to the registration of false cases.”Cheema has termed Rana’s claims as false and been alleging that he is playing in the hands of the rival parties, including the SAD, BJP and the Punjab Lok Congress.                                     #RanaGurjeetSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/rana-campaigns-for-his-independent-son-against-congs-official-candidate-363145

The Congress Central Election Committee meeting is due on January 22 and I am hopeful that the party will take a decision in my favour.”Kaypee is seeking a review of either Adampur or Jalandhar West seat, which have gone to Sukhwinder Kotli and sitting MLA Sushil Rinku, respectively.Kaypee, who has earlier served as PPCC president and Jalandhar MP, was also the minister in 2007-12 term of the Congress. He had contested from Adampur Assembly seat in 2017 but got defeated from Akali leader Pawan Tinu by nearly 8,000 votes. He had contested from Hoshiarpur Parliamentary seat in 2014 but lost to BJP’s Vijay Sampla by 13,582 votes.In 2012, his wife Suman Kaypee had contested from Jalandhar West Assembly seat but lost to BJP’s Bhagat Chunni Lal by nearly 12,000 votes. Kaypee had earlier won from Jalandhar South (named so before delimitation) three times in 1985, 1992 and 2002. He had lost in 2007 and 1997.His detractors have said that since Kaypee has faced a hat-trick of defeats, he had no right to claim a ticket. “He and his family have got ticket 10 times. It is time that they let others too put their hat in the ring,” said a senior party leader.                                     #MohinderKaypee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/kaypee-holds-meetings-in-cantt-area-says-will-wait-for-review-363153

21-01-2022||Avneet Kaur||Adampur: 5 years on, flyover incomplete||A slow pace of construction work of a flyover on Jalandhar-Hoshiarpur road, a dysfunctional bus stand, an inefficient waste management syatem, traffic snarl-ups, etc., are some of the major problems plaguing the constituency. Residents here rue that they have been reaching out to the authorities concerned, but to no avail.Past trendThe constituency has been a SAD stronghold since 2007. Sitting MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu won the seat in 2012 and 2017, while Sarbjit Singh Makkar won it in 2007. The Congress last won from here in 2002, when Kanwaljit Singh Lally became the MLA.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1, 66,370Male -86,448Female - 79,919Third gender - 3Locals’ key demands“The never-ending construction of the flyover has become a pain. Ever since the project was initiated in December 2016, the life of people living in and around the site have been crippled. We are forced to commute on a dilapidated road from the main Adampur market. The chaos on the road has hit the local trade hard, but who cares?” says Harbans Kaur, a resident.Joginder Singh, another resident, says the bus stand has been lying dysfunctional ever since it was constructed in 2017. He adds the infrastructure is going to waste; the premises are being used by private taxi drivers, while the buses pick passengers from the roads. “We don’t understand why this bus stand was built, when the government has no plans to open it to the public. It’s a sheer waste of public funds. Why the incumbent MLA hasn’t taken up the matter and got it operational in all these years?” he says.“The inefficient garbage collection system has made it hard to move around the city, with the foul smell emanating from the piles of waste. The situation gets worse during rains, as garbage along with sewage and rainwater enters our houses”, says Rakesh Aggarwal, who runs a sweets shop in Adampur market.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/5-years-on-flyover-incomplete-363036
