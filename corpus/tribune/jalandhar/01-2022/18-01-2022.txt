18-01-2022||With the Congress choosing not to project any CM face for the forthcoming Assembly poll in the state||Charanjit Channi, Navjot Sidhu, Sunil Jakhar are Cong's poster boys||The hoardings with three big faces of the party and slogan ‘Navin soch-Nawan Punjab’ and a one-liner ‘Punjab di chardi kala, Congress mange sarbat da bhala’ (Positive attitude of Punjab, Congress seeks blessings for everyone) are being installed in various cities of Punjab. Surprisingly, the pictures of the senior AICC leaders or even Punjab in-charge Harish Chaudhary are not seen in the backdrop. Instead caricatures of common Punjabis, people from different religions, age and sections, including a farmer have been put up.Since the party does not want to annoy anyone at this crucial stage and take everyone along, Harish Chaudhary has been stressing that the Vidhan Sabha elections would be fought collectively with CM Channi as the Dalit face, Sidhu as the Jat face and Jakhar as the Hindu face. Sidhu had been objecting to Channi’s hoardings put up across the state. But today Punjab minister Rana Gurjeet Singh said putting up such hoardings implied raising a question mark on the working of the ‘tried and tested CM’ Charanjit Singh Channi. He said such an attempt would be suicidal to the party.The party leaders are learnt to have finalised the format of more new hoardings, which would focus on issues related to power tariff reduction, cut in fuel prices, starting new bus routes, offering free bus service to Kartarpur Sahib, making Punjabi compulsory in school education till Class X and introducing 6th Pay Commission for government employees, the recently taken decisions on which it is banking for the coming elections.                                     #CharanjitChanni,                                     #NavjotSidhu,                                     #SunilJakhar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/channi-sidhu-jakhar-are-congs-poster-boys-362279

18-01-2022||Avneet Kaur||How fair it is to block roads for every single demand, ask Jalandhar city's harassed commuters||Jalandhar, January 17There seems to be no end to commuters’ woes in the city. It was for the second time in the last three days that city residents witnessed a major traffic jam on the national highway near Rama Mandi.As members of several Dalit organisations blocked the Jalandhar-Amritsar national highway near Rama Mandi here today for nearly an hour, a large number of commuters were left helpless, waiting for the protesters to end their demonstration.Though the protesters gave a call to block the highway from 10 am to 4 pm, the police managed to stop them till 1pm and they were protesting on the service lane. However, at 1 pm, the protestors squatted on the main highway stretch, blocking vehicular traffic. They kept protesting for nearly 30-40 minutes, which, meanwhile, resulted in a traffic jam up to four to 5 km on either side of the highway.Notably, the Dalit organisations blocked the highway against the scheduling of Punjab Assembly elections on February 14. The members said the birth anniversary of Guru Ravidas falls on February 16 and to mark the occasion, lakhs of devotees visit the Guru Ravidas Janma Asthan in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Thus, they won’t be able to participate in the voting and were demanding rescheduling of the poll date.When asked why they decided to block the highway for the demand, one of the protesters said a number of demand letters were submitted to the DC and even CM Channi and politicians of other parties have written to the Election Commission, but nothing was happening. So they were left with no other option.“We understand such protests render inconvenience to commuters, but it was about our voting rights. Lakhs of people from Doaba region are going to Banaras, their bookings are done, and they’ll be returning on February 16. It was important for us that the polling dates are rescheduled, so we can cast our votes. Even commuters were supporting our demand,” Jatin, a protester, said.Similarly on Saturday, agitated over the repeated postponement of the written exam for Army recruitment, hundreds of youths from the district blocked the highway showing their resentment against the Central Government. Even then, a massive traffic jam was witnessed and commuters were stranded for several hours.Meanwhile, an FIR against protesting organisations under Sections 283 (obstruction of public way) and 188 (violating government’s orders) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. “We tried to pacify the protesters but they ultimately switched to the highway from the service lane. It was after EC’s decision to change the poll date was announced, the protestors called off their protest,” said SHO Rama Mandi, Jatinder Singh.“We totally understand the demands of the protestors, but they should also understand that blocking roads does not serve any purpose, it simply harasses the common public. It was the first day of the week, many had their important meetings scheduled, some people were visiting to see their ailing parents, and others have some functions to attend, but it was all ruined as we were stuck in traffic,” said Vimal Pratap, a commuter. “The police, administration and even the government have failed to stop these protests. They simply allow everyone to block the highway anytime.From farmers protests to teachers’ protests, and then that police recruitment scam and after that Army recruitment protest, what’s going on here, why the government doesn’t designate a protest site in the city, till when we have to suffer like this,” said Sakshi Talwar, a youngster.Election date rescheduledNSCA welcomes EC’s decision||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/how-fair-it-is-to-block-roads-for-every-single-demand-ask-citys-harassed-commuters-362282
