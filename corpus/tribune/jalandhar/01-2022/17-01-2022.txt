The hospital does not have a chest specialist, cardiologist, oncologist, nephrologist, ENT and urologist.Senior Medical Officer Dr Lehmber Ram said he has written to the authorities concerned to provide these specialists at the hospital. Most of the patients visiting the Civil Hospital were being referred to private hospitals in Jalandhar, Kapurthala or Ludhiana.Dr Ram said the Health Department was taking all preventive measures to control the pandemic. The SMO told that around 6,000 patients were being examined and treated monthly at the Civil Hospital. He said the hospital urgently needs apheresis machine, which separates blood cells.Dr Ram said a new CT Scan Machine was being installed at Phagwara Civil Hospital on the basis of public-private partnership and the patient would need to pay only Rs800 as compared to Rs2,000 being charged by private centres.Several politicians, including MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, former minister Joginder Singh Maan, Union Minister for State Som Parkash and Former Union Minister Vijay Sampla visited the hospital from time to time, but the issue related to shortage of doctors could not be addressed.Needs apheresis machine urgentlyThe SMO said around 6,000 patients were being examined and treated monthly at the Civil Hospital.

Those in race for the ticket, include Saffron party’s local veteran former minister Tikshan Sood, Punjab BJP Mahila Morcha vice-president and former councillor Neeti Talwar, state BJP sports cell convenor Dr Raman Ghai and district BJP president and former councillor Nipun Sharma.Tikshan Sood is considered most ardent contender for the BJP ticket as he has won thrice in a row from the Hoshiarpur Assembly seat, which has traditionally been a Congress bastion. After this, Tikshan’s had to taste defeat in in 2012 and 2017 Assembly elections.Tikshan is considered close to Union Minister of State Som Prakash. It is also believed that if Tikshan sees some problem in getting ticket, then he can forward the name of his right hand man and former Hoshiarpur Mayor Shiv Sood.Another contender in the race is Punjab BJP Mahila Morcha vice-president and former councillor Neeti Talwar. The Talwar family has been associated with the party since 1998. Talwars also have Vijay Sampla, president, National Commission for Scheduled Castes, as their political godfather and access to Union Minister Rajnath Singh.On the other hand, Dr Raman Ghai, considered close to BJP’s former Rajya Sabha member and national vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna, is also in the fray for the ticket.

17-01-2022||No point deferring Assembly elections||Open House:  Do you think the EC should revisit its decision to conduct elections as scheduled?||It does not make sense for the ECI to defer the schedule announced for state elections solely on the basis of ongoing outbreak of Covid variant. The future of the pandemic is unpredictable. In view of the elections, a democratic set up cannot be put on hold indefinitely. Moreover, the ECI has banned the rallies to prevent gatherings which are a major cause of the virus spread. Experimenting virtual modes of campaigning during elections is need of the hour and they can prove to be beneficial for both the candidates and the electorate. The political parties and candidates can be allocated suitable slots on the All India Radio and Doordarshan to campaign for their election agenda. Home-to-home canvassing while complying with Covid norms strictly is another option available to candidates and which is more real than huge gatherings. The print, electronic and social media are other effective options which can be meticulously utilised for election campaigns. In a nutshell, elections can be safely held even under the present scenario of Covid pandemic while avoiding physical modes of campaigning.Jagdish ChanderSpeed-up vaccination drive for all votersAfter discussions with the state administrators, the Election Commission of India announced the dates of Assembly Elections and will certainly go ahead for conducting the Assembly polls. As Covid is at its peak, the Election Commission of India will direct the poll staff to implement all safety measures as directed by the guideline manuals of the Health Department to safeguard the poll staff from Covid. As vaccination is at its peak, the second dose has also been administered to the masses. Now, precaution dose (Booster) has also been started to vaccinate those above 60 years of age. In my opinion, Election Commission of India should certainly conduct the Assembly elections in Feb–March 2022.Rajat Kumar MohindruGuidelines can be violatedAmid the fierce third wave of Covid-19, Assembly elections have been announced in five states. UP and Punjab are two crucial states, where intense campaigning is anticipated by the political parties to be in power. Under the fear of contagion, though some reforms have been undertaken by ECI to avoid huge processions by asserting virtual filing/ withdrawing nominations, promoting canvassing primarily through digital means and imposing restrictions on physical rallies to curtail big election gatherings, still it would an uphill task to maintain Covid protocol near the poll dates. There is every likelihood of reckless violations of the guidelines and the situation turning beyond control, the results of which obviously will be appalling. During the first wave of Covid, lockdowns/curfew were imposed to enforce social distancing and people were strictly warned to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing mask, hand-washing and save themselves from catching infection. All businesses and industrial establishments were ordered to operate under strict compliance of SOPs, while the schools/ colleges had to adopt online coaching to contain the contagion. Consequent upon such stringent protocols, the nation’s GDP came under unimaginative stress and our economy underwent heavy contraction during 2020-21. Learning from past experiences, we must be extra cautious while taking policy decisions. The current wave of is spreading very fast, besides, the cases of new variant have been appearing in large number everywhere. If the Covid guidelines are not adhered to seriously during the election campaign, it is apprehended that numerous lives will be subjected to grave risk, thereby putting the nation to a bigger threat. Under the prevailing conditions, our prime objective should be to save lives from the deadly monster while the elections can wait. According to the constitutional provisions too, legislative elections can be preponed or postponed for valid reasons. Undoubtedly, it is the prime duty of the ECI to hold timely elections in a free and fair manner, yet the ongoing scenario warrants to revisit scheduled poll dates. The government has already put a restraint on some events and activities in national interest and deferring elections by ECI till the deadly Corona wave subsides will be a cautious step in right earnest.Nirmaljit Singh Chatrathec should take note of omicron outbreakThe Election Commission should take a suo motu cognisance of the Omicron outbreak which has put our life out of gear once again. Even the WHO is also of this opinion that there is no point in lowering the guard. The need of the hour is to be proactive instead of throwing the caution to the wind and invite trouble for one and all. So in these testing times, the Election Commission of India should have been more watchful and careful. Instead of holding elections upright and putting our life into danger zone, it should postpone the electoral process till the situation gets normal and environs become conducive for people to come out and exercise their franchise. There should be no hurry to celebrate elections when the new variant of Covid-19 Omicron has laid its fangs bare scaring all of us to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour which we have started ignoring at our own peril. As an adage goes, ‘a stitch in time saves nine’, so it is the high time when the EC should swing into quick action and reverse the decision pertaining to holding the elections in the five states for the welfare of all and sundry. Hope wisdom will dawn in each and every nook, corner and crevice of the EC’S office and a healthy and timely decision will be taken.Simranjeet Singh SainiDefer elections, ensure safetyDespite the Allahabad High Court suggestions not to conduct elections in five Assembly states, including Punjab, in the wake of an unprecedented surge in coronavirus infection and death rates, the announcement of election schedule by the EC has drawn mixed reactions. Politicians across the spectrum have welcomed it saying that timely elections sustain and strengthen democracy. To the utter annoyance of some parties, the EC has put certain restrictions on the political activities such as frantic electioneering and campaigning till January 15. It has also issued fresh instructions to the state government to improve the existing fragile healthcare facilities and ensure a strict implementation of the mandatory Covid protocols of face masking, physical and social distancing, and personal hygiene. But the rational public minds have expressed deep dissatisfaction over the move because a majority of people as well as the concerned government departments are never serious about the health guidelines. Moreover, they fear that the EC might lift restrictions after the stipulated date. Though it is increasing manpower and polling stations and getting all officials vaccinated, political rallies and public meetings often become super-spreader events. Medical experts believe that Omicron is at least three to five times more transmissible than the Delta variant. In the larger interest of the public health and safety, it is imperative to defer the upcoming elections and focus on containment measures. After all, human life is more important than unseemly politicking to grab political power.Harinder Kaurdecision to holdpoll unwarrantedAt a time when the threat of fast-transmissible Omicron variant is looming large with the prediction of reaching its peak in mid-February, the decision of the Election Commission of India to hold Assembly elections in five states, including Punjab, in February and March is unwarranted and unjustified. No doubt, it has directed states regarding Covid preparedness in hospitals, banned physical rallies and roadshows, restricted door-to door canvassing, allowed parties to campaign through newspapers, TV and social media and digital and virtual modes, and asked the government to ensure strict implementation of precautionary protocols and punish the wilful violators. However, it has been seen that neither the general public nor the authorities are serious about checking the spread of the virus. People are frequently thronging markets and attending religious and social functions places. Despite claims to the contrary, the healthcare infrastructure is still ill-equipped. As elections are the lifeline of politicians, they are flexing their muscles to capture power in the state. But prudence demands that the safety of human lives should not be sacrificed at the altar of political ambitions. Even courts have expressed concern over conducting elections amid explosive growth in daily positive cases and fatalities. Keeping in mind that the UP gram panchayat polls and West Bengal elections caused innumerable deaths, the EC should reconsider its decision and put off the voting schedule till the corona infection subsides and the situation becomes conducive for elections.D S KangECI won’t changepoll datesWith the new surge of the cases of Covid-19 cases in Punjab and other states, the elections in these five states should be withheld. Already in the last year during elections in Bengal and other states, the huge rallies resulted in a phenomenal rise in the number of cases and very large number of deaths. The government and the Election Commission have not learnt anything from the previous experience. Again the elections in five states will see huge rallies and functions in all these states. Neither the leaders nor the public will care about the new infectious cases. Their only aim will be to indulge in vote bank politics and win elections. The public should be aware of such risks and dangers. They should wear masks keep social distancing so that the infection abates and doesn’t surge again. I don’t think that the election commission will stop polling though it has asked parties to canvass online or on TV and not hold rallies but politicians are opposing it.Dr JS WadhwaGo ahead withassembly pollsElections are imperative. The only thing which people should keep in mind is to follow all norms strictly while voting. Voters should maintain social distancing and wear masks at the polling stations. By doing this, elections will be conducted smoothly without any threat of Covid and new government will be welcomed by the people of Punjab.Shailja ThakurVoters need toact sensiblyCovid cases have been on a rise and assembly polls are approaching too. In such a situation, it is the foremost duty of the administration to conduct elections safely. There is no need to extend the date of polls which is scheduled to be taken place on February 14. Covid will stay forever and we have to live with this, therefore things should not be put on hold. The voters should become sensible and should wear mask while go to vote. Voting is an essential part of our constitution and this should be conducted on time as it was supposed to happen in previous years. Hence, no need to panic and follow the norms with equanimity and with a smile.Saahil HansLet elections be held as per scheduleElection time is rolling and all eligible voters are ready to vote for their favourite parties. But, there has been a little bit of roadblock owing to the Covid-19 spread and changing of the election dates. I feel that the dates should not be changed and the elections should go as planned. If the people follow all safety precautions and cooperate, then we can have smooth elections. The elections should be held as per the schedule.Sanidhya BhaskarQUESTIONUse of liquor, ration and money to ‘purchase votes’ is not something new in India.

However, it is not yet clear that in whose account the Garhshankar seat will go in the BJP-PLC alliance.After declaration of Amarpreet Singh Lali as Congress candidate, a large number of workers gathered at the residence of Congress leader Nimisha Mehta late last evening.

She alleged that Ambika Soni and Krishna Allavaru supported their flatterers. Sunil Jakhar has lost his support base. After this, Nimisha Mehta joined the BJP late on Sunday evening.

The joint front federations and organisations, which attended the convention, passed a resolution that the Congress government in the state would face boycott by them during the upcoming Assembly polls for non-fulfillment of their various demands. The front also announced to boycott the BJP.The front expressed angst against the ruling dispensation for its failure to regularise contractual employees, non-implementation of the Minimum Wage Act for daily wagers, and pay commission for pensioners and employees, suspension of employees’ allowances and ACPs, non-release of allowances of employees’ probation period and non-implementation of the old pension scheme and inability to provide jobs to unemployed.The front said they would boycott the BJP in the upcoming elections since the Centre was privatising government establishments and implementing pro-corporate policies.Addressing the gathering on the occasion, joint front leaders Satish Rana, Germanjit Singh and Ranjit Singh Ranwan among others said rather than fulfilling demands of pensioners, government employees and daily wagers in the past five years, the Congress had been indulging in delaying tactics.Due to this reason, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal would be opposed in Jalandhar and Patiala, respectively, with a black flag protest on January 26, they said.Similarly, a flag march would be held against the Finance Minister in his constituency on February 1, they added.The Opposition leaders had also failed to come up with a concrete plan to raise issues of employees, pensioners and daily wagers, they said. Nor had they strongly opposed the government for its inability to do so, they added. Hence, delegations of the front would also reach out to key Opposition leaders to pose these questions to them, they said.On January 21, these questions would be posed to the Aam Aadmi Party in Sangrur, on January 22 to the Bahujan Samaj Party in Jalandhar, on January 23 to the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha in Ludhiana and on January 24 to the Shiromani Akali Dal at Lambi, they added.Joint front members also declared their support to the two-day strike by central trade unions on February 23 and 24 against the policies of the Central Government.Hardeep Todarpur, Parduman Gautam, Teerath Bassi and Gurkamal Singh were present among others leaders during the convention.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/joint-front-federations-to-boycott-congress-bjp-in-assembly-elections-361895

The organisations said the poll date would be spoilsport for series of events planned in accordance with jayanti.Dalit organisations have demanded that the Assembly elections be held either before February 10 or after February 18.Jassi Talhan, president, Guru Ravidas Tiger Force said, “All Dalit organisations, including Ravidassia and Valmiki communities and Kabirpanthis, among others will block the national highway tomorrow to protest against the EC’s decision to hold elections on February 14.” “Doaba has a predominant Dalit population, whose sensitivities have totally been ignored while announcing the election date. Over 20 lakh people from the state head to Shiri Guru Ravidas Janma Asthan at Kashi every year during jayanti. The train from Jalandhar leaves on February 13 and devotees return on January 18. With Dalit groups preoccupied with celebrations, how will we exercise our right to vote? The elections must be held either before February 10 or after February 18,” Talhan added.“To apprise the government about our solid stand against poll date, we have consolidated dharna at one place. We appeal to everyone to come and join us against this attempt to deny us our right to vote,” Talhan said.Chief Minister Charnajit Singh Channi had recently written to the EC to postpone poll date, Talhan added. The issue had also been taken up by Delhi MP Hans Raj Hans, Union Minister Som Parkash and Capt Amarinder Singh, Talhan said.Balwinder Singh Bugga, district president, Ambedkar Sena Punjab, said, “A week ago various prominent Dalit organisations had given a demand letter to the Jalandhr DC seeking postponement of elections. But, no one took it seriously. Lakhs of people from Doaba itself are going to Banaras. They will not be able to vote. The train from Jalandhar will leave Dera Sachkhand Ballan on February 13.”Meanwhile, at a meeting of various Dalit groups held here today, a decision was taken to hold dharna at one place. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Dera Sahkhand Ballan, Shri Guru Ravidas Sadhu Sampraday Society, Guru Ravidas Tiger Force and the Ambedkar Sena Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee. Pendu Mazdoor Union Punjab has also extended support to dharna.Kashmir Singh Ghushore of Pendu Mazdoor Union said, “We will extend our support to dharna. Dalits will be playing a key role in the electoral process. A clash between two important events will play spoilsport for the jayanti.”Subhash Sharma, the BJP state general secretary, and Jasvir Singh Garhi, the BSP state president, have also sought postponement of the Punjab Assembly elections from the Election Commission.Kainth writes to ECIn his letter to Sushil Chandra, Chief Election Commissioner, Election Commission of India, Paramjit Singh Kainth, president, National Schedule Caste Alliance, has written, “The Scheduled Castes community in Punjab is almost 33 per cent of the state’s population. Majority of them are followers of Guru Ravidass Ji. The birth anniversary of Shri Guru Ravidass falls on February 16. To participate in celebrations on this auspicious day, guru’s followers embark on a journey to Varanasi, the birthplace of the saint. This pilgrimage usually begins on February 10 every year.
