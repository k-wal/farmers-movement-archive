20-01-2022||Avneet Kaur||Jalandhar: No place for the poor in this 'smart city'||Jalandhar, January 19The Raen Baseras (shelter homes) constructed in various parts of the city for the homeless have failed to serve any purpose as the poor and homeless are spending their nights in the open.A visit to two of the shelter homes situated near Railway Station and Lyallpur Khalsa College revealed that there are multiple issues being faced by the visitors, but the authorities concerned are least bothered.Real problem, but no solutionThere’s a board displayed on the main wall of the shelter homes, which mentions the presence of a first-aid kit, blankets, geysers, beds etc, but in reality, the situation was completely opposite. Those staying there were found shivering due to bone-chilling cold and forget about geysers, there were no proper mattresses on the folding beds. Besides, the toilets were also found to be in a filthy condition.I have tried to avail entry to the shelter home many times, but they don’t let me in because I don’t have identity proof. I have never been to school, I don’t know who my parents are, even if I visit Suvidha Centre, they’ll throw me out realising I am a beggar. —Birju (32), A beggarRamesh, who runs a grocery shop near Raen Basera at Damoria underbridge, informed this correspondent that despite cold weather only five to six homeless people are taking shelter here even though there was a capacity for 30 to 35 persons.He said most of the time this Raen Basera remains closed during day time and opens only after 8pm. “There is only one caretaker here at present. He opens and closes the hall as per his wish. We haven’t seen any cleaning staff or any other official visiting here. The condition inside is horrible. Only the poor who have nowhere to go can live here, otherwise you just can’t bear the stink that emulates from the washrooms,” he added.Notably, when this correspondent visited during day time, the Damoria underbridge Raen Basera was found closed. Even a separate hall for women, which too was locked, looked like it hadn’t been opened since ages. Despite repeated attempts to reach out to the concerned official, whose contact number was displayed on the board there, he was unavailable for comments.Meanwhile, the situation was similar at a shelter home near Lyallpur Khalsa College. It was also found to be occupied by fewer homeless than its actual capacity. Lying on the bed is also a compromise for visitors as mattresses and blankets were reeked of filth. Besides, the blankets were those of mild winters, and had no warmth. The water tank kept on the rooftop for washrooms was also leaking.We’ll chalk out guidelines: MC CommissionerWhen the issue of identity cards was discussed with MC Commissioner Karnesh Sharma, he said identity proof orders were passed to ensure that no anti-social elements were given shelter, but we do allow the real poor people without cards to rest inside. Meanwhile, understanding the problem is genuine, he said the MC would chalk out guidelines to find a middle path and allow entry to all. He also said a strict action would be taken against the officials who have failed to upkeep the maintenance.                                     #SmartCity||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/no-place-for-the-poor-in-this-smart-city-362838

20-01-2022||---||Everyone will fall in line: Congress leader Rajiv Shukla||Jalandhar, January 19Asserting that any kind of rebellion-like attitude being seen among the party leaders at some seats after the release of first list of 86 candidates would get quelled shortly, Congress leader Rajiv Shukla today said there was nothing for the party to worry about.Shukla along with minister Pargat Singh, and party leaders Tajinder Bittu and Balraj Thakur today addressed the media and released a kisan booklet Aamdani na hui dugni, dard sau guna (Income did not get doubled, pain multiplied 100 times). He said: “The Narendra Modi government and the BJP have attacked the farmers in whose hands the fortune of the nation lies and the Punjabis will pay them back in the same coin.”Asked about senior party leaders going into rebellious mode seeking ticket either for themselves or for their kin, Shukla said this was nothing unusual this time. “It happens every time and in all parties. All this noise will eventually get settled. Everyone will fall in line,” he maintained.Over the issue of recovery of Rs 8 crore cash from the residence of CM Charanjit S Channi’s relative by the ED, Shukla said: “ED is just a tool in the hands of the BJP ahead of the poll. They tried intimidating leaders in West Bengal too. There has been no follow-up of the raids ever since. Now they have forgotten to conclude those recoveries and take any further action in those cases.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/everyone-will-fall-in-line-congress-leader-rajiv-shukla-362841
20-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Mohinder Singh Kaypee threatens to contest against Pargat Singh from Jalandhar Cantt||Jalandhar, January 19Upset over not having got ticket from the reserved seats of Adampur or Jalandhar West, ex-Congress minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee has threatened the party leaders that he would contest as an Independent from Jalandhar Cantonment general seat if they do not review the ticket distribution.A prominent Dalit face, Kaypee is reportedly annoyed with minister Pargat Singh, which makes him take this decision. Kaypee has alleged that Pargat had made ex-BSP leader Sukhwinder Singh Kotli join the party during a rally of Punjab CM Charanjit Channi in his Cantt constituency and supported his candidature from Adampur.Kaypee is reportedly of the view that Pargat has conspired against him and made him go out of contest. He has said that he would definitely enter the fray and it could be Jalandhar Cantonment against sitting party MLA Pargat Singh.As many as 35 sarpanches of the Cantt villages, too, had reportedly met Kaypee at his place in Model Town, which is a part of Jalandhar Cantonment constituency. They said they would openly support him even if he would contest as a rebel. Kaypee has been maintaining that several villages of Cantt constituency have been a part of his Jalandhar South constituency that he represented prior to the delimitation of the Assembly areas. Even his father Darshan S Kaypee had contested from this seat.Reacting on the development, Pargat said: “I have talked to Kaypee twice since the list of candidates came. I got to know that he is angry with me and I have tried to clarify that I have nothing against him. I was never a part of the screening committee. I practically have no power to get his ticket cancelled. I am trying his best to get him pacified and I believe that he will agree to what I have said.”Some Congress insiders have said that it was a part of the strategy of Kaypee to rake up the matter and threaten the minister so as to put pressure on the high command for a review of the ticket list and to adjust him from some seat. District Congress president Balraj Thakur has said he was busy in another programme of the party and could not mediate between the two leaders. “There could be some confusion on the matter. We will sort it out soon,” he said.                                     #MohinderSinghKaypee                                     #PargatSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/kaypee-threatens-to-contest-against-pargat-from-cantt-362843
