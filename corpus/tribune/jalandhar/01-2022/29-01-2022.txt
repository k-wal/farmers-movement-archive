However, due to intense friction within the Congress, 2022 Assembly elections have made it a hotbed of political action coupled with some unpleasant tussles.

From 2002 onwards, the Kapurthala Assembly constituency has remained with the family of the state's richest Congress MLA and current Cabinet minister Rana Gurjeet Singh. He currently serves his third term on the seat, which he has won thrice in 2002, 2012 and 2017. Rana's wife Rana Rajbans Kaur won from the seat in 2007 and sister-in-law Sukhjinder Kaur (Sukhi Rana) clinched the 2004 bypoll.

Brar said if voted to power, his first priority would be to get this dump removed.People from across the city who visit the area to attend the cremation of their loved ones detest the site of the dump. “The place is frequented by hundreds of people on a daily basis. Your area MLA has done nothing to improve the situation for five years. Give me a chance and I will get all clearances for an alternate garbage dumping site,” Brar told his supporters and area residents who had gathered to listen to him.He also shared copies of his poll manifesto with them. “I will get security cameras installed throughout my constituency. Public parking will be constructed next to the Model Town market. Proper management will be provided to the civil dispensary next to the Mayor’s house in Model Town market. With the help of new technology, the treatment plant next to Jalandhar Heights will be renovated to make it odourless,” he listed out his vision for urban areas of the constituency.For the rural areas, his list of promises included, “A new stadium with AstroTurf will be built in Sansarpur. One JCB machine, two trolleys and two tractors will be arranged for block samiti, resulting in all the garbage being transported to the dump every third day. Treatment plants will be installed in every village, enabling them to use water for irrigation.”He gave a separate plan for the cantonment area too. “Cantt will be made a tehsil. House registries will be opened in Cantt. A facility to pay electricity bills in Cantt will be introduced. A petrol pump will be installed here. The sewerage system in Bhoor Mandi will be replaced. A new football academy will be established in Bhoor Mandi and Topkhana (including a full-sized ground near the PAP) where kids will be given a proper diet and coaching staff.”His rival Pargat Singh has already opened his office in PPR Mall a few days ago.

29-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Jalandhar: Not a fair deal, say Mahila Cong members||Jalandhar, January 28Members of the women wing of the Congress are annoyed with the party. Not just the district women chiefs, but also Punjab Mahila Congress president Balvir Rani Sodhi. None of the 12 women office-bearers, including Sodhi, who had sought ticket from the party to contest the forthcoming elections, have managed to get one. They all gathered at her place in Phagwara on Friday to vent out their ire.The Mahila Congress office-bearers were so angry that they even decided to hold a protest on the Phagwara highway against their own party but Sodhi said this in any case would not help them at this stage and also damage the prospects of the party. They all have been using social media to express their reactions over the ticket denial.Sodhi said: “It has been an unfair deal with us. Only 11 women candidates have been picked from among the total candidates announced so far. None of these include anyone from within the Mahila Congress. We are the ones who at a short notice are told to gather members and reach all protest sites, perform effigy burning and ensure a good crowd at rallies. But our work never gets recognised and this time it has been a completely raw deal.”She further added: “The youth wing of the party surely gets adjusted. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu, Phillaur candidate Vikramjit Chaudhary, Garhshankar candidate Amarpreet Lally and Ropar canddiate Brinder Dhillon are all ex-youth Congress presidents. If youth are adjusted so well, why can’t the members of the women wing get the same treatment?”She quoted examples of some “winnable” women candidates including Jasleen Sethi from Jalandhar Central, Gursharan Randhawa from Samana, Satwinder Bitti from Sahnewal, Daman Bajwa from Sunam and sitting MLA Satkar Kaur from Ferozepur Rural.Jasleen Sethi, Jalandhar councillor and district president of the Mahila Congress who had been claiming ticket from Jalandhar Central, too, has shown regret. “We have ignored our occupations and household works for years to reach the level of the district president. We all reached this place so that the party could recognise our efforts and give us ticket. If not all, the party should have picked at least a few more deserving candidates,” she said.Perpreet Brar, another woman activist from Jalandhar, also has gone on social media to share: “When I sought ticket first in 2017, I was ignored. I felt that there must be something lacking in me. I worked with more dedication but to see this day again.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/jalandhar-not-a-fair-deal-say-mahila-cong-members-365210

This measure comes on the back of fresh assessment by poll managers of the party this week about approach and progress of its election campaigns.Wary of 2017 poll outcomeIn effect, the diktat forbids senior leaders and activists from outside who take part in the election campaigns from taking the centre stage in any manner. The directive expressly is to leaders from outside the state concerned to avoid making statements or views to media.A source in the AAP said the measure is to dispel any impression among voters that leaders from outside in the poll-bound state were trying to influence the elections.The view in AAP circles is that the party had to pay the price in the last Assembly elections in Punjab, even though it was in a good position, owing to this factor.The party had fallen short to rectify the impression among people of the state that the party was not in sync with local issues.The wide-ranging view in the AAP is that the opponents in Punjab were successful in creating distrust among the populace about the intentions of the party, which it could not counter.Hence, the party took a corrective measure by declaring Bhagwant Singh Mann as the chief ministerial face. Sources say the AAP in all probability will activate its supporters-residents in Delhi to canvass with their relatives and friends in Punjab to vote for the party.Meanwhile in Jalandhar, promising an honest government, the AAP supremo today said there had been no justice in sacrilege or drugs cases in Punjab so far as “everyone” is involved in protecting the culprits.Targeting CM Charanjit Channi and SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, Kejriwal while addressing a gathering at the townhall in Adampur termed the recent FIR against the Akali leader a sham and asked people whether those facing charges of sand mining and drugs could protect the state. “People should rather opt for the AAP’s ‘kattar imandaar sarkar’ (fiercely honest government),” he said.Earlier, addressing a meeting at Phillaur, Kejriwal said: “Have any of those committing sacrilege incidents been punished? Why? Because the perpetrators and masterminds are all together. Had those behind the Bargari incident been punished, no one would have dared to commit sacrilege at Darbar Sahib. If the AAP government comes to power, it will ensure strict punishment to culprits so that there is no repeat of such incidents.”Kejriwal took a pointed dig at Majithia and Channi, alleging: “Drugs are being sold openly as governments side with those behind it. They enact a drama. Channi is boasting about an FIR having been lodged. The FIR is part of the drama. Did you catch him? They are all in this together.” “If our government comes to power, this entire network of suppliers will be busted,” he claimed.                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #PunjabAAP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kejriwals-diktat-only-locals-to-lead-campaign-365055
