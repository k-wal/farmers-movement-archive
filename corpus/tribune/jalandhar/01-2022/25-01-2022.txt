The court has also called the status report from the Kapurthala City Police Station on the complaint lodged on November 9 last.The complaint has been lodged under Section 156 (3) of the CrPC for calling the report on the status of the complaint filed by the complainant and for directions to the SHO, PS City, Kapurthala, to register FIR under Section 354A, IPC, and other relevant provisions in accordance with law.Manju Rana, who is also former presiding chairman of Permanent Lok Adalat, has said that on the day of Dasehra, she along with other party members were serving water to public. At that time, Rana Gurjeet Singh, who had also come to attend Dasehra stopped his car near her and called her through her team members. When she received the message, she went near the car of the minister and offered him a glass of water. She has alleged that Rana Gurjeet Singh refused to accept water and instead passed remarks to her with allegedly a bad intention and said ‘Madam, tuhade palle ki hai’.Manju Rana had alleged: “The minister said this with an intention of outraging her modesty. The act of accused of speaking/uttering these words in a manner totally disrespectful towards a women and retired judicial woman officer in the presence of others members and public was cruel. The minister is liable to be condemned and he is liable to by punished after registration of a criminal case. I got totally perplexed and shamed in presence of public and party members because of the remarks and actions amounting to criminal assault as he also raised his hands to support his remarks in the public. The accused by his action of spoken words and assault violated the modesty of the complainant and the feminine decency that the complainant like every woman possesses. It has nothing to do with her age and the guilty intention of the accused plays a vital role in determining the offence and the accused deliberately ridiculed the complainant. Accordingly the complainant submitted a written complaint against the accused before SHO PS Sadar, Kapurthala, on November 9.”The retired judge said even though the SHO promised to look into the complaint and investigate after registration of formal FIR and a short preliminary inquiry as to the nature of offences disclosed by the complainant, but he did not take any action. “Feeling aggrieved on the failure of the SHO to register the formal FIR, the complainant wrote email to the Punjab Mahila Commission, Punjab and Haryana High Court, SSP, Kapurthala, and other officials. A copy of email was sent to the SSP under Section 154 (3) CrPC on November 12,” said Rana’s lawyers.The counsels appealed before the court that a status report from the SHO, PS City, Kapurthala, regarding the action taken on the complaint of the complainant be sought and in case no FIR is registered, then the SHO may please be directed to register formal FIR for the cognizable offences, or in the alternative the complaint be treated as a formal complaint and the inquiry for taking congnisance of offence may be held by the court and the accused may be summoned, tried and punished in accordance with law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/aap-candidate-knocks-court-door-to-get-justice-364190
25-01-2022||Avneet Kaur||No cakewalk for hat-trick hopeful Pargat Singh this time||Jalandhar, January 24It is not going to be a cakewalk for Congress candidate and sitting MLA Pargat Singh to make a hat-trick from Jalandhar Cantonment constituency as many promises made in the 2017 manifesto still remain unfulfilled.Jalandhar Cantt: A Congress strongholdThe voters in the constituency say MLA Pargat promised that good governance would be his priority and several development works will begin once he was elected to power, but even after five years nothing has been done.“The Congress miserably failed to keep its core promises even that of smartphones and after more than four years, they had put the entire blame on former CM Captain Amarinder Singh,” said Gurbachan Singh, a resident of Jamsher village. He said most of the villages in the constituency were crying for attention, at some places garbage dumps have become an eye sore while at other places poor road infrastructure, clogged sewer etc are troubling residents.“I and my entire family and even a large number of residents of the village voted for Pargat thinking he’s an honest man, but now we have realised all politicians are the same. They pamper us during election time, but forget us later,” Singh added while pointing out the heaps of garbage in the area and poor roads.Gurleen Kaur, a +2 passed out, who had applied for a Canada visa, said: “There are no jobs here. Every time the politicians make huge promises of jobs, but the reality is that most of the jobs remain only on paper. It’s better if one settles abroad if he/she is looking for a better future,” she said.Meanwhile, a visit to various villages of the constituency, including Pholriwal, Sofi Pind, Khursropur, Dheena, Jamsher, and a few wards of Jalandhar Sadar Bazaar showed Pargat’s promises against good governance and development are yet to be achieved. Besides, there was no adequate infrastructure at many schools and hospitals in the villages and waste management remains a major issue for the residents.Jagbir Brar, the SAD-BSP candidate from the constituency, said: “Despite the fact that constituency is known for its rich contribution to sports as it has produced over 300 hockey players, including 14 Olympians, the youth in the villages are deprived of sports facilities, including stadiums and other infrastructure”.Further taking a dig at Pargat, Brar said the sports minister failed to visit the area in the last four years, and now with elections on mind, he has recently laid the foundation stones of several projects without bothering about the modalities.Meanwhile, Pargat Singh said he has full confidence in the voters of the constituency, who with their mandate will make him winner for the third time in a row. He said a lot of work has been done and the majority of the promises have been fulfilled, but due to Covid and then his ministerial responsibilities, a few of the projects were delayed, which will be completed once the Congress government is formed again.                                     #PargatSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/no-cakewalk-for-hat-trick-hopeful-pargat-this-time-364192

Leave aside internal streets, even the main roads in this Assembly segment, including Kapurthala Road, are in a dilapidated condition.The roads dug up to lay the storm drain have not been repaired, causing inconvenience to the residents. To add to the woes, the recent spell of rain left the entire area flooded. “At least two persons have died in accidents in the past one week on the 120-ft road. Isn’t it shameful?” asked Narinder Singh of Model House.Meanwhile, residents of the Basti Sheikh area said potable water had become a luxury for them as the breaking of the pipelines or overflowing sewer was a common sight. “The population of the area has increased manifold in the past two decades but the sewer lines that are still being used are only 12 to 18 inch in diameter, which should ideally have been 36 inch now. No one is paying any attention to such issues,” said Darshan Lal, a local.On the contrary, the major project accomplished here is the setting up of Dr BR Ambedkar Government College in Buta Mandi at a cost of Rs 11.46 crore.

If the match is won, the applause belongs to the captain. If it is lost, the abuse is also hurled at him. Bhagwant Mann, state aap chiefFrom ‘Ik mauka Kejriwal nu’ in the previous polls, the AAP was seeking vote on ‘Ik mauka Kejriwal te Mann nu’ slogan, he said, asking people to give a chance to them.“This time, it’s a contest of pairs. On the one hand, there is Kejriwal and Mann, on the other it’s Sidhu and Channi. Kejriwal and I are like brothers. Houses where brothers live peacefully are blessed, but those where they fight are destroyed. Sidhu and Channi keep saying different things. They claim theirs is a ‘double engine’, ours too is, but it is on one track. The Congress has four to five engines running on different tracks,” he said.Asked about the recent seizure by the ED, Mann said Rs 10 crore was a huge amount to be found at the house of a CM’s relative. “The money must have been given for some wrongdoing. Channi should explain where the money was meant to be used.”On the issue of illegal mining, Mann said former CM Capt Amarinder Singh had expressed helplessness at taking action at a number of Congress MLAs involved. —                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #IllegalMining||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhagwant-mann-charanjit-channi-cant-handle-kin-how-will-he-control-punjab-364086
