Therefore, the measures taken could be that there is a close check on the parties and a team of people could keep a close eye on the parties which will prevent them from doing anything illegal.Sanidhya BhaskarQUESTIONWith depleting water table, isn’t it a travesty that issues such as environment and water conservation are not being raised by various candidates in the elections this time? What should be done to wake them up from their slumber to address such important issues?Suggestions in not more than 200 words can be sent to jalandhardesk@tribunemail.com by Thursday (January 27)Pick leaders without any bias, prejudiceIt is the moral and social duty of a voter not to get carried away if he/she is lured with money, ration and liquor. Our character should be so strong that we can see through the prism clearly and when moon is promised to the masses. As an adage goes, there are no free lunches. One has to pay the price sooner or later for his or her actions. So I strongly believe, the public has be quite active and proactive and weigh the options wisely before casting the franchise instead to getting deviated for peanuts and then there won’t be any room for pointing fingers towards others. But yes, it is certainly agreeable that the watchdogs and sentinels of democracy assigned with the task to carry out free and fair elections should keep their eyes and ears open and spring into action when the enshrined principles are disobeyed. I think awareness campaigns through social media platforms are the best measure to motivate the people not to fall prey to any kind of dirty tricks. At the same time, the DCs must act with deterrence and bring into book the guilty that spoil the festival of elections for their vested interests. We all should take responsibility to make these elections free from corrupt practices. Let us all take a pledge to elect our representatives on the basis of their previous performances without any bias and prejudice for the welfare of all and sundry.SIMRANJEET SINGH SAINIilliterate, greedy voters easy preyIn a representative, multi-party democracy, people’s participation in the electoral process, their interaction with the government and public opinion play a crucial role in its success. It is unfortunate that Indian politics has been characterised by the culture of freebies since Independence. In the absence of true empowerment, politicians have taken upon themselves the unwarranted responsibility of satisfying the immediate needs of the people. This has depoliticised the electorate which now largely depends on the ruling dispensation or the Opposition for this and helps the shrewd leaders to consolidate their vote bank. Come elections, parties and their leaders start planning their strategies to woo the electorate. Apart from announcing multiple catchy and hyper sops, they arrange pilgrimages and tours. Frequently defying the Model Code of Conduct, they manage to distribute liquor and other intoxicants, ration and different mobile or immobile articles of daily use much before the polling day. Many innocent, illiterate and greedy voters fall easy prey to this political jugglery, least realising that it violates the sanctity of the election process. It stultifies the overall governance of the state and makes a mockery of the world’s largest democracy. Until and unless parties stop fielding tainted candidates or people are fully educated and become or are made aware of the importance and right use of their franchise, tight security and intense police patrolling are imperative to check the ongoing unlawful electioneering activities in the state.Simran & Tajpreet S KangIn democracy each vote plays important roleIllegal practices to fetch votes cannot be ruled out in the coming Punjab Assembly elections 2022, as these illegal practices are not new in the system. Allegations vice-versa were framed on each other by the political leaders but these illegal practices cannot be proved. To woo the voters the candidates go to such an extent in adopting illegal practices which cannot be defined as they set aside all the benchmarks and proofs. In democracy every vote plays important role. As the Election Commission should call a meeting district wise by the returning officer, representatives from various political parties be invited and guidelines be issued to refrain from illegal practices, specify the sensitive points where security forces be deployed round the clock to keep strict vigil on the distribution of liquor, money. Similarly, through checking of the vehicles be also carried out. Until and unless the masses do not expose the illegal practices to my opinion it will be very difficult for the Election Commission to curb the menace of illegal practices during the election process. The purchase of votes cannot be proved as these are the under the table deals with the voters to vote in favour of particular political party, candidate. The Election Commission, the police, and administration can only curb the menace of illegal practices during election period and above all the voters.RAJAT KUMAR MOHINDRUMonitor poll expenses and other violationsElections to the Punjab Assembly are held and governments formed at regular intervals, but the overarching problems continue to haunt the state perpetually. Over the years, people have been abortively hoping for the addressal of socio-economic issues such as poverty, unemployment, corruption, inflation, shrinking incomes, drugs, health, education, farm distress and so on. The reason is that neither our elections are free and fair nor the elected representatives are responsive and accountable. Ahead of elections, both the ruling and opposition political parties adopt all kinds of electoral malpractices to influence voters. They either focus on caste, religion and defections to raise public sentiments or make liberal promises of a large number of freebies to various sections of society, keeping in mind their vote base and choice. During the silence period when the Model Code of Conduct comes into force, they freely distribute liquor, drugs, ration and money to purchase votes and resort to intimidation, impersonation and violence at the time of voting, courtesy administrative apathy, indifference or failure to check them. As a result, the gullible voters lose their right to choose the correct candidates. Rich and tainted politicians seriously impact the democratic functioning of the government and encourage corruption and criminalisation in politics. The need of the hour is to choose educated, honest and dedicated leaders who can guide the destiny of the state. The Punjab Election Commission should find out the source of all funding and take appropriate action in case of any irregularity. The administration should efficiently and effectively monitor poll expenses and other violations to ensure smooth conduct of the upcoming Assembly elections.DS KangElectoral system in dire need of reformsWith the Assembly elections scheduled on February 20, political parties are stepping out to approach electorates for votes. As usual, various kind of sops are being doled out by them in the form of fresh jobs, loan waiver, free power, cash subsidies etc to allure the voters. Besides this, heinous activities such as distributing money, liquor and ration for purchasing votes is also common near the poll dates. Such offers tantamount to lateral way of corrupting electorates to fetch votes. On the other hand, dharnas and protests near elections have become the order of the day to press for demands by the trade unions. It is quite ironical that even after 75 years of Independence; freebies culture is not out but has criminalised the electoral process rather than improvements. Earnestly, it requires drastic changes. To begin with, the EC is required to rein in the politicians from indulging in hate speeches and communal outbursts that spread ill-will in society and vitiate public order. The incidents of money and liquor for votes are dealt with iron hands. Any candidate indulging in these nefarious activities be charged with criminal offence and permanently debarred from contesting elections besides imprisonment. To initiate much needed reforms, ongoing Covid environment has proved a blessing in disguise, whereby the practice of huge processions and big physical rallies is done away as precautionary measures to prevent contagion. The extensive use of print and electronic media is being encouraged besides open house debates among the contestants at TV channels and social networking sites are an excellent alternative to express concerns on issues of larger public interest. Instead of false and ludicrous promises, election manifestos of the parties ought to be mandated to make only workable and credible declarations. Here-in-after, the role of media playing as the watchdog of public interest becomes vital to promote awareness on the real issues and deter politicians from befooling people. Intensive police patrolling and raids by the flying squads/ election observers to check the exchange of money and liquor for votes be invigorated. In all, dubious and illegal means affecting our democratic values and creating a horrendous road block in providing meaningful governance must be nipped instantaneously. Anybody violating the code of conduct rules be exposed and subjected to exemplary punitive action. Our electoral system is in dire need of such reforms to put a break on malpractices.Nirmaljit Singh ChatrathUnderstand valueof right to votePunjab Assembly elections are coming and every party is in the struggle to form its own government. Many promises are being made to the people; all parties are claiming to solve their problems. Few parties are trying to buy the vote of the people by offering them money which is against the Constitution. It is vital that people understand the importance of their vote. Every single vote is valuable. People should vote according to their understanding after assessing the work of party representatives. It is imperative that whosoever party is elected should be capable of taking the state forward.Shailja ThakurExercise franchise in the right spiritProviding liquor to voters is the cheapest and all-weather freebie to ensure a ‘gentleman’s vote’, whether in the zila parishad or state Assembly elections. Sewing or knitting machines used to entice women voters earlier, but now standards are different. Mobiles, laptops, gas cylinders are the minimum in some constituencies. It is not at all illegal. The state government leads in offering such sops. The Election Commission is either powerless or looks the other way. Witness the promises made, the concessions announced, the loans written off or the roads that had been crying for repair all these years, given a new look overnight. Right now, it is difficult to suggest ways and means of checking this practice. Presently, in our system there is no true leader, no team, no vision, only loud lectures. Their only aim is to seize or retain power, if not by hook, then by crook. It all now depends on the voter. If he/she accepts these freebies to please the benefactor but exercise their franchise in the right spirit, he /she will not elect the right candidate, because there aren’t any in the fray. But it will change the way future elections are held and perhaps more suitable candidates fielded.MOHAN SINGHVoters need to be well-educatedAs elections are approaching Punjab, use of liquor, ration and money to purchase votes would be commonly practiced by politicians. To keep a check on such illegal practices, voters need to be enlightened and well-educated. Secondly, the EC should increase vigilance to catch hold of such illegal practices and take stern action against politicians found guilty of it. Thirdly, political parties should be warned in advance of dire consequences if they or their leaders indulge in any sort of such illegal practices. Last but not the least; vigilance should be increased throughout the state by all authorities concerned to take immediate action on politicians indulging in such illegal practices.SANJAY CHAWLAMoral awakening needed among votersIt is an admitted fact that political parties woo the electorates with liquor, ration, money, household benefits and even drugs. The problem has become a menace during elections and has assumed alarming proportions. It demonstrates how the people place more faith on money, liquor, ration etc. than the policies and programmes of the candidates contesting the elections. The Election Commission exercises full discretionary and disciplinary powers during the election period. It is its foremost duty to ensure that electoral offences, malpractices and corrupt practices such as impersonation, bribing and inducement of voters, threat and intimidation to the voters are prevented by all means. In case of violation appropriate measures should be taken to check the use of liquor, ration and money to conduct free, fair and peaceful elections in Punjab in particular and in other four states in general. The EC should strictly ensure the observance of the Model Code of Conduct by all parties including the ruling party in the state and the contesting candidates in the discharge of its constitutional duties for conducting a hassle-free election. For that a deterrent environment is indispensable to keep a tab on the vicious culture of cash, liquor and ration distribution in elections. The EC should allow its flying squad to check all these sordid dealings. Its observers, surveillance teams and enforcement agencies should raid the dens of malpractices to set an example before the prospective purchasers of votes. Its enforcement agencies should be made proactive to prevent the contesting candidates from alluring the electorates with cash and kind. However, the EC alone cannot solve this knotty problem. People should be made aware that accepting money, ration or liquor to vote or not to vote for a candidate is punishable with prison terms, fines or both. There should be moral and ethical awakening among the voters. In democracy public is the most powerful entity. If it doesn’t vote in favour of criminals, dishonest and corrupt politicians who wish to purchase their votes with liquor, money, ration and muscle power the menace of malpractices during elections will automatically disappear.Tarsem S Bumrah||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/open-house-what-measures-should-be-taken-to-check-use-of-liquor-ration-and-money-to-purchase-votes-363985

Both parties have recently entered into an alliance for the forthcoming Assembly election.Channi earlier was the SAD district chief and used to run the media office of Akali Dal in the election days in Chandigarh. He had been seeking ticket from Cantonment seat in 2017 Assembly poll from the SAD, but the party chose ex-MLA Sarabjeet Makkar. Since Channi was already at loggerheads with Makkar, he chose to quit the party over the decision of SAD chief Sukhbir Badal.This made Channi stand politically apart from his brother, who stayed intact with the BJP. They, however, have maintained very good relations ever since.Channi stayed away from active politics for a few years and concentrated on his businesses but he then joined SAD (Taksali), which merged with other Akali Dal breakaway factions to form SAD (Sanyukt). Recently, when the SAD (Sanyukt) allied with the BJP and Punjab Lok Congress of ex-CM Capt Amarinder Singh, the turn of events brought the two brothers as a part of the same alliance once again.Channi and Amri laugh: “The fate wants the two of us to stick together socially as well as politically. It all happened by chance. Even earlier, we have never let different political stands affect our bonding.” Channi smiled: “Since the alliance is yet to allocate seats among themselves, both of us have claimed stake on Jalandhar Cantonment seat from our respective parties. Here again we have no differences. If my brother gets the ticket from the BJP, I will be more than happy and will withdraw my claim from my party.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/brothers-vie-for-jalandhar-cantt-ticket-from-alliance-partners-363969
24-01-2022||Aparna Banerji||Meet farmers looking for change||Jalandhar, January 23It began just as a protest for their rights, free from any political aspirations, for thousands of farmers from Punjab who, riding in their tractors, reached Delhi borders in November 2020 against the three farm laws.However, many of the farmers from Doaba now find themselves in the midst of hectic political activities ahead of the 2022 election as they have been chosen as candidates for the newly formed political outfit — the Sanyukta Samaj Morcha.While the SSM along with Gurnam Singh Charuni’s Sanyukta Sangharsh Party (SSP) has so far jointly announced eight candidates in Doaba, The Tribune talked to some prominent farmers who have been fielded as candidates by the SSM...Jaswinder Singh Sangha (56)As early as December 28, the Jalandhar Potato Growers’ Association led by Sangha had pledged its support to the SSM. When Sangha was declared a candidate from the pivotal Jalandhar Cantt seat on Saturday, it also meant the tacit support of the 7,000-strong members of the Potato Growers’ Association, which has been firmly backing the Kisan Andolan and the SSM. It is that rare occasion when an influential farmer of Doaba is contesting from a political platform made by farmers and not from a traditional political outfit. Having revolutionised potato farming and industry, Sangha has been very vocal over the years about successive potato gluts and the huge chasm between the consumer and farmers which makes middlemen eke out obscene profits. The candidate of the SSM, he says in part, will address these issues. Jaswinder Singh Sangha said, “The real issues of the voter never take the centre-stage in elections. Our food, water and air are our foremost needs. They guarantee happiness above other electoral issues. But they are never given prominence. With SSM, we would be talking about farmers’ getting their due and consumers no more being duped with hefty prices. Our issues are guaranteed MSP, water, food security. The eventual aim of the morcha is to ensure that the farming sector is so economically viable and self-sustaining that it provides widespread employment and stopping the exodus of youth.” Sangha has been fielded from Jalandhar Cantt where he will be contesting against Congress’s Pargat Singh, SAD’s Jagbir Brar.Rakesh Kumar (44)On November 27, 2020, when tractors from Doaba crossed the Singhu border, Rakesh’s tractors were also among the many making it to Delhi borders in protest. Born in Kolkata, Kumar returned to his village Sarmastpur on the Jalandhar-Pathankot highway to pursue farming in his ancestral land. Having been active as a member of the Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee to raise the issue of sugarcane farmers since 2015-16, Rakesh has settled back in his village many years along with his family. In 2003, he was his village’s sarpanch, in 2008 a block samiti member and is going to contest his maiden election from Kartarpur from the SSM this year. He has 18 acres and sows crops on 65 acres. He says with the SSM, farmers’ benefit is maximum. Rakesh says, “What does a farmer need. Basic education, health, guaranteed price, the freedom to get proper dividend for his produce. But farmers have been sidelined and ignored by ruling dispensations. I sow wheat, rice and sugarcane on my land. I dream of a future where farmers get proper price for their produce and are financially independent enough to make their own by product for their produce rather than a third party coming and raking in profits. Political parties promise better offers for kids wanting to move out. We want them to stay back and strengthen the system.”Mandeep Singh Samra (45)President of the Bharti Kisan Union Rajewal, Mandeep Singh Samra had been active during a series of agitations staged both in Doaba and Delhi (Kisan Andolan) in protest against the three farm laws. Going from village to village to mobilise union cadres, he now finds himself undertaking the same exercise, but this time to seek votes. Traversing villages along with his union members, he says, “Do partiyan to akk chukke haan. Lokan nu hun badal chaida hai (We have become fed up with the two parties. People need change now).” Samra says the constant exodus of youth from the state to foreign countries is very disappointing for farmers. “There is an increase in corruption. Poor people are not given a patient hearing under the current dispensation. That in turn makes going abroad seem like a safer option. Punjab needs a political unit which makes the state seem safer than the option of going abroad once again. People need a political party which speaks for them and provides them respite from corruption and drugs.”10 in fray so far                                     #GurnamSinghCharuni                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/meet-farmers-looking-for-change-363968
