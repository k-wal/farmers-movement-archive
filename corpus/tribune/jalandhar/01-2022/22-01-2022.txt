Gopakumar on January 14, whose verdict enabled Franco to walk out free.Incidentally, soon after the verdict came, the former Kottayam SP Harisankar, who oversaw the probe, said he was supremely confident that the verdict would be against the accused."This was the least expected as the witnesses did a very clean job. An appeal should be filed," said Harisankar, then.The trial in the case extended over 105 days with 39 witnesses being examined and 122 documents produced before the court. While serving as Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, he was accused of raping a nun, who belonged to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation.During his visits between 2014 and 2016 to Kerala, he was accused of raping the 43-year old nun on 13 occasions. Later, he was removed from the charge of the Jalandhar diocese.A complaint was filed against him in June 2018 in Kerala and Mulakkal was arrested on September 21, 2018 on rape charges.He secured bail on October 16, 2018.The charge sheet names 83 witnesses, including the Cardinal of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Mar George Alencherry, three bishops, 11 priests and 22 nuns.Of the 83 witnesses, 39 were called and they were heard.Franco had approached the Kerala High Court and also the Supreme Court to quash the FIR against him, but both the courts refused to do so and the trial began.--IANS                                     #BishopFrancoMulakkal                                     #KeralaNunRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-nun-rape-case-prosecution-to-appeal-acquittal-of-mulakkal-363532

Before 2008, it was known as the Lohian constituency. Traditionally, Shahkot had been a stronghold of the Akalis. Since 1977 it was won by the Shiromani Akali Dal candidates eight times —1977, 1980, 1985, 1997, 2002, 2007 (as Lohian consituency) and after delimitation as Shahkot in 2012 and 2017. The seat was won by SAD leader Ajit Singh Kohar consecutively for five times in 1997, 2007 and 2002 and after delimitation as Shahkot in 2012 and 2017. The Congress won only twice here in 1992 and after delimitation in 2018 bypoll. It is a rural constituency with many of its areas falling near Sutlej. Farming is the backbone of Shahkot's agrarian economy and majority of its vote bank comprises farmers. Here are the main candidates from the seat:Hardev S Ladi SherowaliaParty: CongressAge: 54 yearsQualification: MatriculateBackground: He is the nephew of Congress stalwart Darbara Singh. Having won the Shahkot constituency with a huge margin in the 2018 Shahkot bypolls, he was the first Congress leader in a long time to have broken the SAD spell from the seat after defeating Naib Kohar. The seat fell vacant following the death of Akali Dal legislator Ajit Singh Kohar, Naib’s father. Ladi’s name was announced amid an illegal mining row but the gamble paid off with him winning with a huge margin. Having pursued his education from Malsian, Ladi was formerly a director in a co-operative bank. Having formally joined the Congress in 2001, he remained state secretary of the party. He had lost from Shahkot in 2017 and will be contesting from the seat for the third time in the 2022 elections.Priorities: 1. Push to health infra2.

The demise of his grandfather came as a turning point in his life as his active foray into politics began only after February 4, 2018 - the day of the death of Kohar senior. While Bachitar's father Naib Kohar unsuccessfully contested from the seat in 2018, the Akali Dal has now entrusted him with the job of contesting the seat in the 2022 polls. Starting off as the halka in-charge, Shahkot, and senior vice-president of the Youth Akali Dal in 2019, his political suitability will be tested for the first time in the elections.Priorities: 1.

Chaudhary called them all at his place and asked them to support Beri, whose candidature has already been announced by the party. Chaudhary urged both to leave their grudges and offer support to Beri so that he could fight the contest well.Other Congress leaders who were showing resentment in favour of Raja —Paramjit Bal, Tirlok Sran, Sonu Sharma, Somnath Chugitti and councillors Manmohan Raju and Gurwinder Banti Neelkanth — too were called in and assured their support to Beri.Insiders said even as a group photograph was clicked and circulated. However, Sethi did not seem to have pacified still and was perhaps still nursing grudges against the party. She had taken to FB few days back and had put a video to show that she was angry with the party for repeating all candidates and giving no chance to new faces. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/mp-attempts-to-pacify-sulking-jagdish-raja-jasleen-sethi-363395

As expected, Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) relied on ex-Akali minister Sarwan Singh Phillaur (top) to contest from Phillaur reserved constituency. The party has also given Sultanpur Lodhi seat to an Akali leader. Candidate Jugrajpal Singh Shahi has been Youth Akali Dal leader in the area for seven years. Likewise, Manjit Singh Dasuya, who has been announced from Urmar, too has served with SAD and Aam Aadmi Party earlier.Now 74-year-old, Sarwan S Phillaur had first become MLA at the age of 29. He has represented Phillaur five times in 1977-85, 1997 and 2007. His sixth tenure as MLA was from Kartarpur in 2012. He did not get ticket in 2017 from the Congress, which he had then joined. Phillaur certainly is a strong face for the alliance from the seat.Jugrajpal Singh Shahi (C) has been the Secretary of Mandi Board in Sultanpur Lodhi. He hails from Nurpur village of Kapurthala and joined the SAD (Sanyukt) just three days ago. Since the main ally BJP does not have any base in the area, there remains a question mark as to how much dent he will be able to cause to the main contestants in the area.Manjit Singh Dasuya (bottom), who has been picked from Urmar, is a US-based NRI. He owns a marriage palace in the town and his sons run the businesses, including those of hotels in the US.

From the Jalandhar West, Mahinder Pal Bhagat has been given the ticket. Bhagat is son of former MLA Bhagat Chunni Lal who won the seat in 2012. Like the Jalandhar Central constituency, these three seats represent the urban core of the Jalandhar district.Notably, the BJP has declared candidates from these very seats first due to a sustained presence of the same leaders and due to the party enjoying a greater popularity among the urban Hindu vote bank. From the Jalandhar West, Bhagat will fight against the Congress’s Sushil Rinku and the AAP candidate Sheetal Angural who quite the BJP just days ago.From the Jalandhar North, the BJP has fielded KD Bhandari who is among its tallest leaders in the district.
