A complacent attitude was often seen during rush hours with visitors trying to avoid passing through metal detectors and hence entry of a person inside the compound with arms or explosives hidden inside jackets cannot be ruled out. The court complex has more than 1,000 visitors, other than judicial officials, court staff and lawyers, entering daily from the two gates.The judicial officials expressed concern as a meeting was held under the chairmanship of District and Sessions Judge Rupinderjit Chahal. Amit Kumar Garg, CJM and Sushma Devi, ACJM and Om Parkash Sharma, president, Bar Association, were also present.

The police officers who were present in the meeting assured to take necessary steps for everyone‚Äôs security.Three judicial officials, including the CJM, ACJM and Additional Civil Judge Senior Division, were asked to coordinate with the police officials regarding the security. Lawyers, too, expressed their concern about safety measures that need to be adopted.Mandeep Sachdev, senior lawyer and former DBA president, said: ‚ÄúOnly four cops are deployed at the commonly used gate. Only one of them is armed and there is no plan in place in the event of any eventuality like the way it happened today.
