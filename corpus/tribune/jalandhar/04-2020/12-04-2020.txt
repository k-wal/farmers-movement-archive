However, the district administration is providing essential things to households.Notably, after hearing about community transmission cases in the state, the curfew in Punjab has been extended till May 1. One of the councillors said: “So far, I was getting help from the NGOs and others for my ward residents, but now that the cases in Jalandhar have spiked, it is becoming difficult for the NGOs to extend help.”“At this point of time, people will avoid coming in contact with others. Also, when langars are organised, it is seen that people come in groups which is not advisable at all. So, at some areas, there may be a little problem in the coming days,” an industrialist said.The district administration on Friday ensured the supply of 98,933 litre milk and 6,493 quintal vegetables and fruits to residents on their doorstep.The teams of Milkfed, Mandi Board office and Food and Civil Supplies Departments under the supervision of Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma have been ensuring the supply of these essential commodities in every area of the district.As per the details, the teams of Milkfed delivered around 98,933 litre milk to people of the district, besides 857kg cheese; 9,103-kg curd; 5,976-litre lassi and 286-kg kheer through authorised dealers of Verka in every locality.Similarly, 6,493 quintal vegetables and fruits were supplied in the district by the staff led by District Mandi Officer Davinder Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/spike-in-covid-cases-may-affect-distribution-work-70087

I start my day with exercise in the morning. I have set a challenge of trying my hand at 21-cooking recipes for 21 days, including making chocolate cake, gobi parantha and grilled vegetables. Besides, I have been learning how to tie a turban and enjoying various video-conferencing apps to connect with family and friends with whom face-to-face conversation is not possible,” he said.The SC lawyer said besides working from home and managing his official work, he feels that this is the time for everyone to try something interesting which they normally don’t do. “People should take up a digital detoxification challenge and test themselves if they can spend a few hours on their own without watching the television and cell phone. I have been practising this and it is very exciting,” he added.“I have also been developing a habit of reading. I have been keeping a check if any elderly is living alone in my locality and is in need of any kind of help,” he said, adding that people must help each other during this tough time.On being asked about his normal routine, the father of a five-years-old said he was most often occupied with his legal and political life. He used to visit his family in Jalandhar once in two or three weeks. However, now when he has got time to be with family, he is playing with his daughter and learning about doll houses and Barbie dolls, he added.Urging people to stay positive, Shergill said, “Tough time doesn’t last but tough people do. Therefore, one must stay positive. We should remember that Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a 6-foot concrete cell with only a straw mat to sleep on, and still came out positive. So, we have to stay indoors and come out Covid negative.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/this-young-sc-lawyer-religiously-following-3ps-to-beat-curfew-blues-70070

12-04-2020||Ajay Joshi||Residents dump, burn garbage in open||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, April 11With the suspension of door-to-door garbage picking service in most of the residential colonies of the city, residents are forced to either dump their garbage in the open or burn it near their houses.For the past two weeks, cleanliness parameters have reportedly been compromised in the city. Residents are at the receiving end due to garbage piling up in their homes.Residents said after the imposition of curfew, more waste was being generated by households and in the absence of any garbage-lifting mechanism, they were forced to throw garbage on vacant plots.Kamlesh Kumar, a resident of Anand Nagar who recently highlighted the issue, said: “Eight days on, waste collection workers are not collecting garbage from houses.”“We have to take the garbage in polythene bags due to unavailability of workers and dispose the same on our own as dustbins are already full,” he said.Another resident Manjot Kaur, a housewife, said: “On the insistence of MC workers, we started segregating dry and wet waste. However, not only foul smell has started emanating from wet waste but insects have also made it their breeding spot.”On discontinuation of service, a sanitary worker in Janta Colony said: “With the ban on movement and closed entry points in some colonies, we have stopped visiting a few areas.”Meanwhile, a MC Health and Sanitation Department official, Sri Krishan, claimed garbage collection was being running smoothly in almost 70-80 per cent households and sanitation workers were not off-duty. However, he also assured that garbage collectors would be sent to remaining affected areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/residents-dump-burn-garbage-in-open-70066

12-04-2020||Jalandhar||Now, residents take to theekri pehra in Jalandhar||With the coronavirus spreading its tentacles in old city areas, residents, especially youngsters, of various colonies have decided to guard their lanes on their own and have set up a system akin to theekri pehra.As 10 coronavirus positive cases have emerged from the old city areas so far, residents have become extra vigilant. About 10 to 12 young volunteers guard the entry and exit points of their colonies and they do not allow anyone to recklessly move in the day. They have even put up ropes and have been asking every passer-by about the purpose of going in and out. They only allow to move in emergency situation.Such barricading has been put up in various colonies, including Preet Nagar, Globe Colony, Shankar Garden and Subhash Nagar. Most of these areas also have a sizable population of migrants because of their proximity to the Focal Point area.“There are several quarters of migrants in our locality who would form groups and sit together the whole day on main roads or move in and out several times even during the curfew. We told them to stay indoors and maintain social distance when they come out,” said Viplove Kataria, who guards the Kali Mata Mandir road near the industrial area.Giving his “duty” along with friend Gulshan Dhand, Kataria, a local businessman, said: “Residents of the Saipur road area and colonies nearby were much worried since the reports of the coronavirus cases started coming up. We took up the matter with the ACP North. He arranged our meeting with the SHO Division No 8. We were given do’s and don’ts on how to control movement. We have been allowing only those persons to move out who want to visit banks. Besides, we check whether they carry bank documents, including passbooks, cheque books or ATM cards. We have been allowing anyone to visit chemist shops only if he or she has urgency. We have been allowing only a limited number of vegetable vendors with curfew passes to the colony.”Commissioner of Police Gurpreet Bhullar said: “On several occasions, we had told residents in urban areas for self-guarding at the micro level. But no one ever adhered to us. This strategy helps us as people become more responsible and begin to think of their own safety.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/now-residents-take-to-theekri-pehra-in-jalandhar-70055
