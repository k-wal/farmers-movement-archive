It becomes meaningless for the government to offer talks and not create a conducive atmosphere for such talks to happen.‚ÄùAppending the letter to the PM, farmers told the Commissioner that ‚Äúcontent of which is self-explanatory‚Äù.‚ÄúYou are aware of the march of farmers from all over India to Delhi and the status thereof. In view of the emergent and urgent situation that has emerged, you are requested to take necessary action and act accordingly, in terms of the submissions made to the Prime Minister of India. We are confident that you will do the needful to facilitate the peaceful and democratic protest of the farmers of India,‚Äù they wrote to the Commissioner of Police.In their letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, farmers ask him to ‚Äúensure¬†that the farmers have a free and safe passage into Delhi without creating a situation where any untoward incident is justified later on, as having been necessitated, which will cause a completely avoidable break away from the very peaceful manner that we have adopted so far.‚Äù‚ÄúAllot a space like Ramlila Maidan where we can gather and also hold talks with the government. Call the all-India/regional platforms of the farmers for sincere discussions with senior ministers of your cabinet on demands to repeal the 3 Farm Acts and the Electricity Bill 2020,‚Äù they added in the letter.The letter is signed by the coordination committee of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which includes Balbir Singh Rajewal, Daljeet Singh Dallewala, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, VM Singh, Raju Shetti, Shivkumar Sharma Kakkaji, Yogendra Yadav.The letter¬†reads: ‚ÄúAs you are aware, determined and resolute farmers are marching towards Delhi in lakhs from different states of India, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and so on, under the leadership of various national and regional platforms of farmers organisations. A Samyukt Kisan Morcha was created in the recent past as a coordination mechanism for this Dilli Chalo program of the farmers.‚Äù‚ÄúThese farmers, including youth, have had to face unprecedented obstacles placed in their way by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments presumably also at the behest of the Central Government, which tried every possible means to stop them ‚Äì regular barricades, sand-laden trucks in multiple layers, barbed wire fences, huge boulders placed across the roads and even trenches on the road, water cannons and tear gas. All of this in the cruel winter in north India. We are still managing to march forward, and thankfully without any untoward incident so far. Thousands of farmers have reached the borders of the capital region of the country, and just like we have been resolutely moving forward, we shall continue to do so today as well,‚Äù it reads further.‚ÄúThe nation, and the Government of India, in particular, have reached a crucial juncture when they have to ensure that farmers should not undergo this, and to ensure that no untoward incident occurs in an unfortunate stand-off between our ‚Äòannadatas‚Äô and the government. It is because our voices were not heard and taken into account when framing the ordinances or passing them as Acts in the Parliament that has brought about this situation.

The hands that feed the nation deserve to be held, not pushed aside, he added, pointing out that his government had allowed the farmers to protest peacefully for the past two months, without any violence or law and order problemsRecalling that he had led MLAs from Punjab to sit on a symbolic dharna last month at an allotted place at Jantar Mantar, the Chief Minister said something similar could be done for the farmers so that they could exercise their democratic right to speak and share their views with the national media.‚ÄúHasn‚Äôt the BJP sat at Ramlila Maidan on protest rallies in the past? Why should the farmers not be allowed to go to their own capital and speak out against the laws if they want to?‚Äù asked the Chief Minister, urging the ML Khattar government in Haryana to allow the agitated farmers to pass through the national highway to take their voice to Delhi peacefully.Pointing out that farmers were not violating any law or indulging in violence, Capt Amarinder said the attempts to stop them were ‚Äúnot good for democracy.‚Äù Actions could lead to counter-reactions, especially from the thousands of youngsters who were among the agitating farmers, he warned, adding that he was surprised at Khattar‚Äôs remarks.The ML Khattar government‚Äôs actions were against the Constitutional spirit, against the farmers‚Äô freedom of speech and in bad taste, said the Chief Minister, adding that ‚Äúeither we have a Constitution in India or we don‚Äôt, and if we do have one then every person has the right and freedom to speech, thought and action‚Äù.Questioning the rationale behind stopping the farmers, who in any case were breaking barricades to move forward, the Chief Minister said, ‚ÄúThe tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic and unconstitutional.
