The MLAs and workers were detained by the Delhi Police in the afternoon and have been incommunicado since then. A video clip showed the police personnel purportedly dragging and putting AAP members in vehicles as they raised slogans against the government. Talking to The Tribune over phone, AAP MLA from Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda Prof Baljinder Kaur said, "We were just holding a peaceful protest in front of PM Modi's residence, but the police personnel "dealt quite strictly with us". "They dragged and pushed us around before putting us in their vehicles. This is sign of degrading democratic fabric of our nation today. We will continue to stand by farmers in their just fight against  the Centre," said Kaur.AAP legislator from Dirba in Sangrur and Leader of Opposition in Assembly Harpal Cheema tweeted: "AAP-Punjab protested outside PM's residence in Delhi and arrested by Delhi police (sic).

27-11-2020||Bathinda||Bhagat Singh’s front and centre in farmers’ protests||A large group of young protesters mill around at Dabwali border wearing T-shirts bearing the image of Bhagat Singh, one of Punjab’s revolutionary icons.Several of the women wear yellow dupattas on their heads. Like the T-Shirts, these dupattas are also a mark of symbolism to invoke Bhagat Singh---they signify the yellow of his turban.The youngsters are part of a larger group of protesters who have come out in solidarity with the ‘Delhi Chalo’ march called to protest three controversial farm laws that the central government passed in September.Several cars bearing Bhagat Singh’s posters dot the protest site, and chants of “Inquilab Zindabad (Long Live Revolution”) rent the air.Bhagat Singh was a leading revolutionary who became among the youngest icons of India’s long struggle for freedom. His memory now serves to fuel another revolution---that of farmers, say the youngsters.Jagsir Singh has come from Sri Ganganagar with his friends. Singh idealises Bhagat Singh, he says, and they’re all using the symbolism to inspire others to join the protest.     “Bhagat Singh inspired youngsters to be part of the struggle for independence, and today, we want to tell our youth: ‘Don’t sit at your houses. It’s time to come out and fight for your rights’. Because it’s now or never,” he says. Gurpreet Singh, a young protester from Bathinda, says:  “Shaheed Bhagat Singh is the first name that comes to mind when we talk about any form of freedom struggle.  No struggle is complete without him”.Their main fear, they say, is that clause that allows contract farming, which they fear will give unreasonable power over their lands to corporates.“If we don’t do something about this now, we’ll lose our lands,” says Jagsir Singh.

27-11-2020||---||Farmers write to PM; request him to let them enter Delhi, protest peacefully||New Delhi, November 27The AIKSCC and the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Delhi Commissioner of Police, requesting him to let farmers enter Delhi and protest peacefully in the capital while upholding their democratic right to protest.The letter addressed to the Prime Minister of India reads: “At least now the Government of India should stop its confrontationist attitude of denying the largest section of our society an opportunity to be heard and sincere dialogue should be initiated. It becomes meaningless for the government to offer talks and not create a conducive atmosphere for such talks to happen.”Appending the letter to the PM, farmers told the Commissioner that “content of which is self-explanatory”.“You are aware of the march of farmers from all over India to Delhi and the status thereof. In view of the emergent and urgent situation that has emerged, you are requested to take necessary action and act accordingly, in terms of the submissions made to the Prime Minister of India. We are confident that you will do the needful to facilitate the peaceful and democratic protest of the farmers of India,” they wrote to the Commissioner of Police.In their letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, farmers ask him to “ensure that the farmers have a free and safe passage into Delhi without creating a situation where any untoward incident is justified later on, as having been necessitated, which will cause a completely avoidable break away from the very peaceful manner that we have adopted so far.”“Allot a space like Ramlila Maidan where we can gather and also hold talks with the government. Call the all-India/regional platforms of the farmers for sincere discussions with senior ministers of your cabinet on demands to repeal the 3 Farm Acts and the Electricity Bill 2020,” they added in the letter.The letter is signed by the coordination committee of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which includes Balbir Singh Rajewal, Daljeet Singh Dallewala, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, VM Singh, Raju Shetti, Shivkumar Sharma Kakkaji, Yogendra Yadav.The letter reads: “As you are aware, determined and resolute farmers are marching towards Delhi in lakhs from different states of India, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and so on, under the leadership of various national and regional platforms of farmers organisations. A Samyukt Kisan Morcha was created in the recent past as a coordination mechanism for this Dilli Chalo program of the farmers.”“These farmers, including youth, have had to face unprecedented obstacles placed in their way by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments presumably also at the behest of the Central Government, which tried every possible means to stop them – regular barricades, sand-laden trucks in multiple layers, barbed wire fences, huge boulders placed across the roads and even trenches on the road, water cannons and tear gas. All of this in the cruel winter in north India. We are still managing to march forward, and thankfully without any untoward incident so far. Thousands of farmers have reached the borders of the capital region of the country, and just like we have been resolutely moving forward, we shall continue to do so today as well,” it reads further.“The nation, and the Government of India, in particular, have reached a crucial juncture when they have to ensure that farmers should not undergo this, and to ensure that no untoward incident occurs in an unfortunate stand-off between our ‘annadatas’ and the government. It is because our voices were not heard and taken into account when framing the ordinances or passing them as Acts in the Parliament that has brought about this situation. The representations given to you multiple times in mounting agitations by farmers and their organisations across India are yet to receive replies from you,” the letter concludes.

The Centre should immediately initiate talks with Kisan Union leaders to defuse the tense situation at the Delhi borders. Why wait till December 3 when the situation is getting out of hand now?” the Chief Minister asked.The Government of India needs to step in immediately to put an end to the atrocities being meted out to the peacefully agitating farmers, who had not created any law and order problem or indulged in any instance of violence over the past three months of their protest over the Farm Laws, he stressed.The voice of farmers cannot be muzzled indefinitely.

The farmer unions from Haryana also served langar and tea to the agitating Punjab farmers.

It is moral duty of political parties to support the farmers”.Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra said, “I fully support the farmers. I wanted to be present in Delhi, when farmers reach there.”In Bassi Pathana, MLA GP Singh was seen mobilising support for the farmers marching towards Delhi. In Zira, MLA Kulbir Zira made efforts.Punjab Youth Congress president Barinder Dhillon, who is camping in Delhi, said the Youth Congress had opened its doors for the farmers coming to the national Capital.PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar said the Congress firmly stood with food growers. He exhorted the party’s rank and file to support the agitating farmers by all means. Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa condemned the violence by the police against the farmers. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said use of water cannons against the farmers marching peacefully towards Delhi was equal to barbarism.
27-11-2020||---||Haryana Govt crackdown against spirit of Constitution: Capt Amarinder Singh||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 26Condemning the use of brutal force by Haryana in a “futile bid” to stop agitating farmers from going to Delhi, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh termed it an assault on their constitutional and democratic right to protest, and urged the Delhi Government to earmark for them a place to sit peacefully to highlight their concerns on the farm laws.‘Hands that feed nation need to be held’Questioning the rationale behind stopping the farmers, the Chief Minister said the tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers was totally undemocratic and unconstitutional. The hands that feed the nation deserve to be held, not pushed aside, he added, pointing out that his government had allowed the farmers to protest peacefully for the past two months, without any violence or law and order problemsRecalling that he had led MLAs from Punjab to sit on a symbolic dharna last month at an allotted place at Jantar Mantar, the Chief Minister said something similar could be done for the farmers so that they could exercise their democratic right to speak and share their views with the national media.“Hasn’t the BJP sat at Ramlila Maidan on protest rallies in the past? Why should the farmers not be allowed to go to their own capital and speak out against the laws if they want to?” asked the Chief Minister, urging the ML Khattar government in Haryana to allow the agitated farmers to pass through the national highway to take their voice to Delhi peacefully.Pointing out that farmers were not violating any law or indulging in violence, Capt Amarinder said the attempts to stop them were “not good for democracy.” Actions could lead to counter-reactions, especially from the thousands of youngsters who were among the agitating farmers, he warned, adding that he was surprised at Khattar’s remarks.The ML Khattar government’s actions were against the Constitutional spirit, against the farmers’ freedom of speech and in bad taste, said the Chief Minister, adding that “either we have a Constitution in India or we don’t, and if we do have one then every person has the right and freedom to speech, thought and action”.Questioning the rationale behind stopping the farmers, who in any case were breaking barricades to move forward, the Chief Minister said, “The tyrannical use of brute force against peacefully protesting farmers is totally undemocratic and unconstitutional. The hands that feed the nation deserve to be held, not pushed aside,” he asserted, pointing out that his government had allowed the farmers to protest peacefully for the past two months, without any violence or law and order problems.“It is the farmers who need to be convinced on MSP, not me. Khattar should have tried to talked to farmers before the start of their stir if he thought he could persuade them,” Capt Amarinder said. Rejecting his Haryana counterpart’s charge that he was inciting farmers to protest, Capt Amarinder asked as to why farmers from Haryana were also marching to Delhi in that case.

But you should not go out to air your grievances. If you want to do that, you can leave the party,” said Capt Amarinder, amid reports of public dissidence.The Chief Minister said he had learnt this lesson from late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when he was a Member of Parliament from the Congress. Indira had told him that internal party matters should remain within the party, and this still held true for the Congress, he added. He pointed out that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had not penalised anyone who had raised a voice of dissent but had, in fact, made then members of various committees, in the true spirit of democracy.Rejecting the suggestion for a change in the party leadership in light of the Bihar election results, Capt Amarinder said Sonia Gandhi would remain the leader as long as she wanted, after which a new leader would be elected. There was no need for a change at this juncture, he said, adding that one shouldn’t read too much into the Bihar poll verdict.He recalled the time when the BJP had only two seats in Parliament. The Congress could come back into power in 2024, he added.
