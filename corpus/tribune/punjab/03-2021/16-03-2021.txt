16-03-2021||New Delhi||Shekhawat attacks Congress; says Punjab failed to spend JJM funds||Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Tuesday counterattacked the Congress for its charge that his ministry failed to spend funds, saying it was due to non-BJP governments, including Punjab government, for failure to utilise the central funds.   Replying to a discussion on working of the Jal Shakti Ministry, Shekhawat hit out at Congress member Digvijaya Singh for questioning his administrative capability, saying the latter has been exiled from Madhya Pradesh for more than 10 months now due the failure of the government led by him in providing basic infrastructural amenities such as water, electricity and roads.He made it obvious that this was his response to Digvijaya Singh on his personal attack and questioning his administrative capability.Initiating the discussion, Singh had said that the Jal Shakti Ministry failed to spend the funds and questioned the government’s water management policy.Shekhawat said under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), the Centre had provided Rs 227 crore in the financial year 2019-20 to the Punjab government which could spend only Rs 73 crore.The state was allocated Rs 363 crore for implementation of the JJM in 2020-21, but it has not been able to avail the same, he said.The norm is that before availing the succeeding cache of funds for a recurring central scheme, a state government has to furnish details of expenditure of the preceding funds taken by it.He named the poll bound state of TMC-ruled West Bengal, JMM-led Jharkhand, and Congress-ruled states of Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan as conspicuous laggards in implementation of JJM, falling much behind the national average figure.Responding to protests from opposition benches, including Congress member from Punjab Pratap Singh Bajwa who wanted to know the reason for Punjab government not spending the funds, Shekhawat shot back: “It is for the Punjab government to explain.”He lauded the opposition ruled state of Telangana for 100 per cent coverage of rural households under the scheme.He said while the Congress governments provided piped drinking water to just above three crore rural households during 55 years of its rule, the present Union government has provided piped water supply to additional 3.85 crore households in 15 months under JJM.He said the government is in the process of mapping the aquifers to know the status of underground water across the country. Details of it would be shared with all the village panchayats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/shekhawat-attacks-congress-says-punjab-failed-to-spend-jjm-funds-226124

They never entered the Haryana Vidhan Sabha precincts”. He said as far as the complaint of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha Speaker that the Akali MLAs had stopped the way of the chief minister and showed him black flags was concerned, “I want to ask if it is a crime to show black flags in a peaceful protest in a democracy?”Cheema also made it clear that the Akali MLAs had held a symbolic protest to highlight the atrocities inflicted on farmers as well as human rights activists by the Haryana government. He said famers were “attacked with rubber pellets, tear-gas shells and water cannons when they led a peaceful march to Delhi”. He said similarly human rights activists Nodeep Kaur and Shiv Kumar were “tortured in the custody” of the Haryana government.The former minister also condemned Punjab Speaker Rana K P Singh for surrendering the area which was used by Punjab legislators in the Vidhan Sabha complex to Haryana. “This is clear proof of the fixed match played by the Congress government with the BJP.” Stating that the Punjab Speaker did not have any right to give away Punjab’s rights in this manner he said “people will never forgive Rana K P Singh for indulging in this act”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-condemns-false-case-registered-against-its-mlas-at-the-instance-of-haryana-speaker-226123

The accused are currently living at a rented house situated on the outskirts of the village.Other members of the gang were identified as Arun Kumar ( husband of Harpreet Kaur), Raj Kumar (brother of Arun Kumar) and Anjli ( Raj Kumar’s wife).SSP Ludhiana (Rural) Charanjit Singh Sohal informed that a team of cops supervised by SP (D) Balwider Singh and DSP (D) Rajesh Sharma had apprehended the accused from their house at Khadoor village late evening on Monday. “As we had received secret information about alleged illegal activities of the drug peddlers in the area, our cops apprehended them when they were hiding at their house situated on outskirts of the village, following a scuffle with villagers earlier in the day,” said Sohal.Preliminary investigations revealed that the accused were already been facing a number of criminal cases registered at various police stations.Having been identified as drug peddlers in their native area of Kapurthala, the trio had shifted to this area for carrying out illegal activities recently.The police are yet to arrest the owner of the house and ascertain his role in facilitating the accused as he had not performed his mandatory duty to inform the administration about his tenants.Investigations further revealed that all suspects, except Neelam, had already been booked under many criminal cases and Balwinder Singh was serving a life term after being sentenced in a murder case. Harpreet Kaur was caught with 3.2kg of heroin by STF Mohali a few months ago and she had been released on bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhiana-police-bust-notorious-drug-peddlers-recover-4-kg-heroin-226049

I urge the DG to find a way out of this vexatious issue. Already, unemployment is at a peak and this development will only complicate matters,” he said.He revealed half a dozen delegations of parents had met him in the last two months. Babbu said, “Every second household in Sujanpur, Bhoa and Pathankot has at least one of its members in the defence services. “The BRO is considered to be an extended arm of these services. Ever since it came into existence in 1960, it has always been a fertile ground for providing jobs to the residents of this area. If the need arises, I myself will go to meet the DG.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mp-sunny-deol-mla-dinesh-babbu-stand-up-for-jobless-youths-225898

Sometimes both groups come face to face with each other while they have arrived for medico-legal services and things take an ugly turn.Doctor shot at as groups clash in Amritsar hospital“In such circumstances when a large number of people are angry and are vouching for each other’s blood, the medical staff being the soft and vulnerable target has to pay the price,” said an employee at the hospital.The medical staff said even if the members of the security staff and police are present on the occasion, they mostly remain indifferent.After the condemnation of the incident by different associations associated with medical fraternity and the threat by the Civil Hospital doctors to not handle medico-legal cases, the police authorities deputed eight cops and a sub-inspector to guard the hospital.The hospital employees said the decision would instill confidence in the staff, but they demanded that strict punishment be given to those responsible for the violence, so that this acts as a deterrent for future.Meanwhile, the medical staff at Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) Hospital, Majitha Road, boycotted medical services for two hours and demanded arrest of the culprits.Shamsher Singh Kohri from the Punjab State Pharmacy Officers’ Association and general secretary Ashok Kumar said they stand united with Dr Bhavneet Singh, who was injured in the incident, demanding security of medical employees.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/attack-on-doctor-at-amritsar-hospital-exposes-security-issues-225904

So, I get more satisfaction writing in Hindi. — Anamika, multi-award winning poet and writerDuring the interaction, Anamika shared her childhood influences, the early impressions of her father’s writings on her. “A famous poet, he used to read to me poetry and excerpts from his favourite books.

Of about 130 women appearing for the tests earlier this month, only four have passed.Three women candidates have qualified for the six seats in the general category; one for two seats in the SC (Mb) category. None has made it in the economic weaker section, SC (R), ex-serviceman (G) and the Backward Class categories.The written examination conducted in November also did not go well for most candidates. Of about 11,000 candidates taking the test, only 3,751 could qualify for the next round. Of these, only 571 were women.“We are also surprised at the performance of women candidates. The exam schedule was announced in November last year and the candidates had good time to prepare for the physical tests,” said Raman Behal, Chairman, SSB.The board is using modern technology for conducting the tests. Behal said all tests were computerised and video-graphed. “Unlike tests conducted by other recruitment agencies, we do the bio-metric tests at three levels — exam, physical tests and counselling. Also, the movement of the examination papers submitted by the candidates is GPS-monitored. The tests have been most transparent,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/women-fail-to-clear-100-m-race-hurdle-for-jail-department-posts-225698

But it all depends on the political decision,” said a government functionary.The Chief Minister, who returned on Monday from his retreat in Himachal Pradesh, is expected to take a decision soon. Sources said an informal discussion on the reservation roster had already been held but the final decision would be taken by the CM after consultation with Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar, who also heads high-powered group of ministers and MLAs on the civic body polls.Jakhar said a party-level committee would meet once the notification of the elected representatives was issued and decide upon the candidates for the posts of mayor and president“Once the notification is issued, the elected representatives have to take oath and elect the mayor and president of the civic bodies within 14 days”, said the sources. A senior party leader said, “There has been inordinate delay of near one month on part of certain quarters in issuing the notification of the elected representatives. Moreover, lack of clarity about the reservation is creating anxiety among different pressure groups in the party”.Women candidates have been elected in nearly 1,100 wards. In the Congress, 675 women candidates have been elected.

This was a major cause of higher CFR in the state, he said, adding that it was the moral responsibility of all citizens that Covid patients should get early treatment.The minister pointed out that the infection was frequently underestimated by high-risk population. Because of this, people with severe symptoms remain undetected and thus failed to get treatment at healthcare facilities.He said 71.40 per cent cases had been confirmed from the urban population and only 28.60 per cent cases had been reported from the rural population from January to February 2021. However, deaths reported in urban areas were 45.50 per cent which was lower than 54.50 per cent in rural population. He said 31.70 per cent of deaths were reported in patients aged between 61-70 years, 31.50 per cent above 70 years, and 20.30 per cent deaths in patients aged between 51-60 years.Taking serious note of the incident in which EMO Bhavneet Singh was shot during a scuffle between two groups on Sunday at the Civil Hospital, Amritsar, Sidhu has written to the DGP to provide security at emergency services during night.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-19-late-case-reporting-behind-high-death-rate-says-health-minister-225706

The number of people has been restricted to 100 for indoor events and 200 for outdoor gatherings.“The district administrations have been asked to ensure enforcement of guidelines in containment and micro-containment zones, and penalise the violators,” said the Chief Secretary. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-monitors-to-check-norm-violations-225707
16-03-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Assured price for potato, kinnow from next fiscal||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 15In a move that is sure to give a final push to crop diversification, the Punjab Government is all set to bring two horticulture crops — potato and kinnow — under the assured price regime from coming financial year.A minimum price for these crops will be fixed by the state and in case of fall in rates below the fixed amount, the government will pay the difference from its own kitty to the farmers as compensation to mitigate their loss. The move will benefit potato and kinnow growers, who are often subjected to the market price variations.This year itself, the prices of kinnow fell to Rs 9 per kg against last year’s Rs 15-18 per kg. Potato growers too are getting Rs 6-7.50 per kg for their produce this year against Rs 10-15 per kg last year. “Also, the cost of input for potato cultivation has gone up drastically in 2021, hitting the earnings of growers. If a base price is fixed for these crops, it will go a long way in assuring the farmers of good returns and wean away many others from the wheat-paddy cycle,” says Jaswinder Sangha, general secretary of the Jalandhar Potato Growers’ Association.It may be mentioned that the total potato production in Punjab is estimated at 27 lakh metric tonnes and that of kinnow at 13 lakh metric tonnes per annum. A total of 4.39 lakh hectares of area is under horticulture crops, which contribute 12 per cent in the state gross domestic product. Though the announcement for this scheme of assured prices was made in the Budget 2021-22, the finer details are being finalised now. Official sources in the state government have told The Tribune that it will be creating a committee of officers and agriculture policy-makers, who will decide the minimum base price for the two crops before each harvest. This committee will also be overseeing the marketing of the two crops, through the horticulture estates. At least five new horticulture estates are to be set up across the state at an estimated cost of Rs 80 crore.It is learnt that the Punjab Government set up four horticulture estates last year for kinnow at Tahliwala Jattan, Badal, Chaunikalan and Bhunga. The success of these estates, which provide all kinds of extension and marketing services to kinnow growers, has prompted the state government to set up 25 more, with five of these to be set up this year. “The estates will not only cater to farmers growing a major horticulture crop in the district where they are set up, but will provide support to growers of all other horticulture crops grown in the area, including facilities like soil and leaf testing,” says Shailendra Kaur, Director, Horticulture, Punjab.Why scheme needed?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/assured-price-for-potato-kinnow-from-next-fiscal-225708

16-03-2021||Balwant Garg||Baba Farid University moves National Medical Commission over colleges ‘fleecing’ MBBS students||Tribune News ServiceFaridkot, March 15Some private medical colleges in the state have collected Rs 1.5 crore from 40 final year MBBS students in the name of “providing them with NOC” and allowing them to do one-year-internship from other medical colleges. However, terming it “fleecing” of students, the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) has raised the matter with the National Medical Commission (NMC).While every medical student owes his one-year internship service to his college after completing the academic part of their MBBS course, the BFUHS has come across many cases where students from private institutions are paying heavy fee to shift to other institutions for their internship.To give “NOC” to these students for internship in other colleges, some parent colleges have forced students to pay up to Rs 3 lakh per student. These students were also made to pay Rs 60,000 for “NOC” to college where they want to join the internship. Other than paying Rs 3.6 lakh to the parent and receiving colleges, every student has to pay Rs 20,000 to the BFUHS for its approval for shifting of a student for internship.In a letter to Secretary General, NMC, the BFUHS said many students from private institutions, who got admission on a low percentile, want to shift in top institutions of the state to do their internship. For this shifting of students, some private colleges are forcing them to pay high fee in lieu of NOC, alleges the medical university.Every internee is paid a monthly stipend by his parent institution, but most of these students don’t get stipend if they opt out of their parent colleges.“There’s a fixed quota for transfers to and from the colleges for the purpose of internship, so we are not allowing this shifting or migration of students for internship as it is against rules,” said Dr Raj Bahadur, VC, BFUHS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/baba-farid-university-moves-national-medical-commission-over-colleges-fleecing-mbbs-students-225710

16-03-2021||Blurb||High Court bars tainted cops from probing cases, occupying public dealing posts||Saurabh MalikTribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 15The Punjab and Haryana High Court today barred tainted police officers from investigating cases and occupying public dealing posts. It also condemned the posting of PPS officers as SSPs in several districts. Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal directed the issuance of a notice to Punjab Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Home Affairs and Justice, Anurag Aggarwal.He was asked to show cause why directions be not issued for filing a complaint with the judicial magistrate for the offence of perjury. The notice came more than a month after Aggarwal admitted that “certain false information” was disclosed in his earlier affidavit in the tainted cops’ case.Justice Grewal added it was apparent that information sought by the court was not forthcoming. The Additional Chief Secretary should have taken due care and caution as it was expected from the department administrative head to disclose the entire information.Concealment amounted to swearing a false affidavit, which had the tendency to subvert, obstruct, impede and interfere in the due course of judicial proceedings. It could not be overlooked, especially when the affidavit was filed by a senior officer, he said.In his order, Justice Grewal made it clear that police officers chargesheeted and/or convicted in a criminal case involving moral turpitude, would not remain on a public dealing post. They would not be assigned probe either as investigating officer or in a supervisory capacity and would not be posted in the Vigilance Bureau till the final decision was taken by a committee.A committee was being constituted to frame a policy for action to be taken in cases of convicted police officers. Justice Grewal made it clear that the committee would also examine the issue of officers against whom FIRs were registered and trial pending.Justice Grewal observed it was disquieting to note that Rajinder Singh Sohal convicted in a criminal case was posted as Gurdaspur SSP. His sentence had been suspended, but conviction had not been stayed.“It is apparent that there is arbitrariness in dealing with officers facing criminal cases….In our system of governance administered by rule of law, the government cannot act like an absolute despot at its whims and fancies by patronising certain officers while imparting a step-motherly treatment to others. It is, thus, the need of the hour to put in place a proper structure,” Justice Grewal added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-bars-tainted-cops-from-probing-cases-occupying-public-dealing-posts-225713

This accounts for 7.7 per cent of the Army’s rank and file, even though its share of the national population is 2.3 per cent.With 1,67,557 soldiers, Uttar Pradesh tops the list of states contributing manpower to the Army. While Uttar Pradesh, the nation’s most populous state, makes up 16.5 per cent of the country’s population, its share in the rank and file is 14.5 per cent. Maharashtra, with 87,835 soldiers occupies the third slot followed by Rajasthan, with 79,481 soldiers.Among other states in the region, Haryana is sixth in the national tally while Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh 11th and 12th position, respectively. The contribution of these states to the Army, however, is significantly more than their share of the national population.The Ministry’s data shows that with 65,987 soldiers, Haryana accounts for 5.7 per cent of the rank and file where as its share of the national population is 2.09 per cent. Jammu and Kashmir, along with Ladakh, and Himachal Pradesh have 47,457 and 46,960 active duty soldiers, respectively. While they account for 1.01 per cent and 0.57 per cent of the national population, respectively, they make up 4.1 and 4 per cent of the army’s strength, respectively. The Army currently has 11,51,726 soldiers on its rolls against the authorised strength of 12,29,559, facing a deficiency of 77,833 men in the ranks. As far as officers, other than those in the medical stream, are concerned, the present holding is 42,959 against the authorised 50,806.  Unlike the Air Force and the Navy, the Army does not maintain state-wise details of the number of officers on its strength. As far as the Air Force is concerned, Haryana has the second highest number of officers after Uttar Pradesh and the third highest number of airmen.Incidentally, the number of doctors presently with the Army Medical Corps and the Army Dental Corps is 6,608, which is higher that the sanctioned strength of 5,736. The posted strength of Military Nursing Officers at present is 3,841 against the authorised number of 4,389.The region has a strong martial heritage and a rich military history that dates back thousands of years, and is a witness to many wars and battles. Joining the armed forces is a tradition in many families and several generations have donned the uniform.In the infantry, the largest component of the army, the Punjab Regiment, Dogra Regiment, Sikh Regiment, Sikh Light Infantry, Jammu and Kashmir Regiment, Jammu and Kashmir Rifles and Ladakh Scouts draw their manposer from this region. Soldiers from these states also make up a sizable chunk of other arms and services.Vacancies in the rank and file are allotted to the state on the basis of their respective population. In case a state fails to fill up the allotted vacancies, these can then filled from, other states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-second-among-all-states-in-contributing-to-armys-rank-and-file-225565
16-03-2021||New Delhi||Centre giving step-motherly treatment to Punjab: Bajwa in Rajya Sabha||Congress Rajya Sabha member from Punjab Partap Singh Bajwa on Monday accused the Centre of meeting out a step-motherly treatment to the state and highlighted how instead of lending a helping hand in dealing with COVID-19 induced economic slowdown, it is cutting down on central assistance.Raising the matter during Zero Hour in the House, Bajwa said, “Instead of helping the State of Punjab recover from the COVID-19 economic slowdown, the Government of India has taken steps to harm the State, such as cutting the Rural Development Fund (RDF) from 3 per cent to 1 per cent, which will cause a loss of over Rs. 1,000 crore to the exchequer of the state”.He also highlighted that at the height of the pandemic, the Centre had arrears over Rs. 8,200 crore to the state, due to slow release of GST dues.Further noting the March 11 order of the Food Corporation of India, in which it has been proposed tighter quality controls for the procurement of wheat and paddy, the Congress MP pointed that this move comes barely 15 days before the harvesting of wheat begins in Punjab.“The new requirements such as 12 per cent moisture content and reduction of foreign matter in the produce are weather related, and by penalising the farmers for this, the Government of India is essentially arguing that global warming is in the hands of the farmers.” he said.Bajwa alleged that the Centre is trying to punish the farmers for their protests by making it practically impossible for them to sell their products at MSP, and thereby allowing the central government agencies to run away from procurement.Other changes such as requiring farmers submitting land ownership records to receive MSP for wheat is further sign of the Centre’s intent to stop procurement of grains.“Nearly 45 per cent of land holdings in Punjab are leased out, and such a move along with direct bank transfers to the land owner, will greatly affect the cultivator,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-giving-step-motherly-treatment-to-punjab-bajwa-in-rajya-sabha-225564
