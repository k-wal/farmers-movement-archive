However, the PSPCL took a stand that the IPPs were not entitled to be paid washing and related charges.Earlier, the SC on October 5, 2017, had asked the PSPCL to pay the two IPPs “coal washing and transportation charges” but the PSPCL did not pay the entire amount. The IPPs again moved the Supreme Court and the court, in an order on 2019, asked it to follow the judgment dated October 5, 2017, in letter and spirit.After this verdict, the PSPCL paid Rs 421.77 crore to Nabha Power Limited, Rajpura, and around Rs 1,002.05 crore to Talwandi Sabo Power Limited. As the PSPCL continued to make certain deductions under different heads, representatives of the two IPPs approached it, but all talks failed. “We will review the orders and move the regulator,” said PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad. “This was a contempt case and the original case was already decided against us two years back,” he added.According to power experts, had the PSPCL paid the charges to the IPPs in time, the cost would have been almost half as the interest cost is too high. Also, this amount would have been spread over a period of seven years and would not have hurt the consumers.To pay Rs1,070 cr along with Rs680-cr interestThe cash-strapped PSPCL has been directed to pay a principal amount of Rs1,070 crore along with an interest of Rs680 crore to the two IPPs in the state against deductions made by it while calculating coal washing and transportation charges.

Four days back, The Tribune had highlighted the hardship of teachers in 19,680 government and government-aided schools in the state who were forced to stop the meals in view of piling up liabilities as the state government had not released any funds for the scheme since October 2020.

Other than releasing rice and wheat by the food procurement agencies to many schools in the state, the school Education Department also started releasing the cooking cost and salary of cook-cum-helpers on Wednesday. Though the Education Department had submitted bills to the Finance Department in the last week of October 2020 and the Centre had also released its share of 60 per cent, the funds were not released by the Finance Department.

Tehsil complexes were announced for Rajpura and Banur; a sports complex, swimming pool and an officers colony for Sangrur; sewerage treatment plants for Ghanaur and Fatehgarh Churian; hospital upgrade at Amloh; irrigation channels at Amritsar; a stadium at Mukerian, railway underbridge for Dhuri; a food street and park for Hoshiarpur; a Ram Tirath Balmik Dharamshala at Amritsar and another at Sultanpur Lodhi.Even as the Opposition continued to target the Finance Minister for bringing a Budget “dictated by their party poll strategist,” Manpreet insisted that his Budget was targeted at only revealing the true picture of the state finances, with welfare schemes meant to reach out to the poorest of the poor.“The biggest thing that our government has announced is the decision to reserve 33 per cent of government vacancies for women. There are one lakh government vacancies, of which 33,000 will go to women by the year-end… we are on the throes of seeing Punjab’s economic resurgence now, even though we have been forced to make additional borrowings by the Centre to get our rightful GST compensation,” he said.As the Finance Minister spoke, both SAD and AAP legislators continued to disrupt him by storming into the well of the House and raising slogans. They accused him of making promises like free travel for women and college students in government-run buses, as these operated on few routes. Opposition MLAs, including AAP MLA Aman Arora, said women and elderly would have been happier had the Finance Minister increased the social security pension to Rs 2,500 as promised by the Congress before the 2017 elections.Earlier, just as the discussion on the Budget began, AAP MLAs staged a walkout over the government attempt to impose a new infrastructure tax on retail fuels and immoveable properties. Unperturbed, Manpreet continued to say: “The MLAs on the other side have chosen to overlook that I have set aside Rs 150 crore for buying new buses,” he said.Reacting to the charges levelled against him yesterday and today, regarding the state’s debt having increased manifold in the past five years; decreased spending in social sector and low asset building through decreased capital expenditure, the Finance Minister said this year’s Budget had countered all this.Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema said the Budget was insensitive towards the vulnerable sections. The government had not fulfilled the promises made by the Congress in its poll manifesto.Gurpratap Singh Wadala from SAD wanted to know how the huge revenue deficit would be bridged. He also accused the government of facilitating a Rs 1,500 crore paddy purchase scam, where paddy from outside the state was brought to Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/finance-minister-of-punjab-lists-new-projects-for-congress-segments-draws-oppn-flak-223514

11-03-2021||---||Vigilance unearths scam under Ayushman Bharat||Chandigarh, March 10The Punjab Vigilance Bureau has exposed a big scam worth crores of rupees under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, wherein several private hospitals obtained health insurance claims from IFFCO-Tokio on the basis of fake bills.Contrary to this, the IFFCO-Tokio rejected hundreds of insurance claims pertaining to government hospitals, causing a huge loss to the state exchequer.Claims worth crores rejectedDGP-cum-Chief Director, Vigilance Bureau, BK Uppal today said it had came to light that several private hospitals in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala prepared fake bills in the names of smart card holders for their treatment under the scheme and took insurance claims from IFFCO-Tokio.He said the scam was unearthed by SSP (Vigilance Range), Jalandhar, Daljinder Singh Dhillon. In this connection, a major negligence has been seen at the end of the deputy medical commissioners concerned and doctors of state hospitals or primary health centres. “The major reason for rejecting the insurance claims of government hospitals by the company was to get financial benefits of Rs 52,06,500. As a result, the state government has incurred a financial loss from the three aforesaid districts in the past one year,” said Uppal.During investigations, it came to light that a renowned hospital at Sultanpur Lodhi in Kapurthala claimed Rs 4,43,98,450 for the treatment of 1,282 patients. However, 519 claims were rejected. On the basis of these medical bills, the Health Authority, Punjab, passed claims of this hospital to the tune of Rs 4,23,48,050. The insurance company reimbursed Rs 1,86,59,150 to the hospital.Giving an example, the vigilance chief said a woman from Turna village in Jalandhar was admitted to the hospital for the removal of stone. Though she could not undergo the surgery, the hospital prepared a fake medical bill of Rs 22,000 and took reimbursement from the insurance firm under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.In another case at the hospital, a patient was told that her treatment could not be done with one smart card. She was told to either deposit Rs 25,000 in cash or bring six-seven smart cards to avail the benefit under the scheme. Following this, her family submitted three smart cards to the hospital.Later, the hospital shot videos of the patient’s family members lying on hospital beds and took their signatures on blank papers. The hospital administrator reportedly told them that if they received any phone call, they should say that they underwent an operation. The hospital allegedly claimed Rs 25,000 each for three persons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/vigilance-unearths-scam-under-ayushman-bharat-223511

It was going beyond its brief.”Taking a strong exception to the statement, Jagir Kaur said: “Grewal should stand by the farmers and not question the organisations extending help to them.”— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-stir-sgpc-snubs-bjp-leader-harjit-grewals-advice-223509

This would help generate an additional revenue of Rs 216.16 crore.The Assembly also passed an amendment to the Punjab Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, thus enabling the state government to increase road tax from time to time without taking the legislative route every time. Besides, the state is all set to impose green tax or environment tax as per the vehicle scarp policy being framed by the Centre.In the amendment passed by the Assembly, a provision has been made for the imposition of a green tax of Rs 50,000 at the time of renewal of registration certificate for non-transport vehicles and Rs 50,000 after eight years per annum for transport vehicle.The other Bills passed in the Assembly are the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulations) Amendment Bill, Punjab Apartment Ownership (Amendment) Bill; the Punjab Regional and Town Planning, Development (Amendment) Bill; the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulations (Amendment) Bill; the Punjab School Education Board (Amendment) Bill; the Punjab Anti-Red Tape Bill; the Sardar Beant Singh State University Bill; the Shaheed Bhagat Singh State University Bill; and the Punjab Abadi Deh (Record of Rights) Bill. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bill-to-impose-new-tax-on-fuel-passed-223517
