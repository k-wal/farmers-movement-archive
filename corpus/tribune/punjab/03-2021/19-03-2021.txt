19-03-2021||We catch up with Brig His Highness Sukhjit Singh sitting calmly under a huge tree in the gardens of the Villa Buona Vista||Villa Buona Vista of Kapurthala; tale of loyal service to royalty||Surrounded by dogs all around him, he has just gone through the English newspapers of the day. Amid a continuous chirping of birds, he talks about his royal past. ‚ÄúBorn and raised in a palace (the now Sainik School Kapurthala building) amid all the luxuries of life was indeed a unique experience that came my way by virtue of my birth in the family. Of all the experiences of the royal culture, one of the most memorable ones include my rides in the zebra-driven chariot in the zoological park of the palace. My grandfather had a unique collection of exotic animals,‚Äù he is still maintaining some healthy horses.The 86-year-old recalls the old times, ‚ÄúBut my most cherished moments were watching my grandfather attend to his subjects. He was so much passionate about his people. He knew many of them personally. The kind of relationship he shared with his subjects as the ruler cannot match the materialistic approach of the present-day politicians. My grandfather had always been my mentor and I tried to imbibe some of his virtues. He never went to a school but was home-tutored. I have tried to recollect all my memories with him in a book ‚ÄòPrince, Patron and Patriarch: Maharaja Jagatjit Singh of Kapurthala‚Äô that I authored along with the US-based Cynthia Meera Frederick. We released the book three years ago and it‚Äôs available on Amazon.‚ÄùIn the fieldAnyone who has met Sukhjit talks about a unique aura around him which perhaps stems from the mix of the royal and military touch. ‚ÄúI spent nearly 26 years in the Army. I had then even asked Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh to join the Army and he did it on my suggestion. I motivate every youth I meet to join the forces.‚ÄùHe is one of the oldest 1971 Indo-Pak War heroes and a Maha Vir Chakra awardee, he was honoured recently at Vajra Corps on the occasion of the celebrations of the 50 years of the war. He recalls a very interesting anecdote, ‚ÄúThe 1971 War was raging. I was Lieut Col at that time. My troops managed to round up Pakistani soldiers. Among them was a tall, smart guy with whom I began talking just to cull more information. As our conversation was on, he told me, ‚ÄòI have one last wish‚Äô. I replied, ‚ÄòWhat makes you think that we are going to kill you?‚Äô During further inquiry, we got to know that he is the son of Sikandar Hayat Khan, a former Premiere of Punjab. He was among those who were set free. Much later, I met the family as well.‚ÄùAbout VILLA KOTHIBrig His Highness Sukhjit Singh, grandson of Maharaja Jagatjit Singh, who was the last ruler of the princely state of Kapurthala, shared, ‚ÄúThe house that I am living in is a European prototype. It was commissioned in 1894. Since it falls on the bank of Bein river it used to be a perfect place as my grandfather‚Äôs shikargah (hunting lodge).‚Äù The villa has also served as the residence of Tikka Raja Paramjit Singh and Tikka Rani Brinda‚Äôs residence. It has hundreds of fruit trees all around, most of the varieties of mangoes and loquat.The GHARIALOne of the most attractive pieces in the house is a 15-ft 10-inch stuffed gharial hanging on the walls of its verandah. The gharial was shot by Brig Sukhjit‚Äôs grandfather Maharaja Jagatjit Singh on January 13, 1913, at Bein rivulet. ‚ÄúMy grandfather told me that it was a man-eater because when he sent it for preservation, bangles worn by women was found in its gut. He presumed that these must be of the women who were found missing after they went to fill water from the rivulet,‚Äù he points to a description written along the massive, precious catch.His majesty: Brig Sukhjit Singh with his grandfather Maharaja Jagatjit Singh.

19-03-2021||Saurabh Malik||Registration of marriage via video link allowed: Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 18Amid the Covid outbreak, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has permitted the registration of marriages through videoconferencing. A Division Bench has overruled a Single-Bench judgment that refused to permit the e-registration of marriage on the ground that the parties could not be exempted from being personally present before a marriage officer to sign the ‚Äúmarriage certificate book‚Äù.The Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri referred to a number of judgments before observing that it was possible for a person living thousands of kilometres away or anywhere in India to simultaneously communicate with another party.The Bench added that technology enabled affected parties to attest documents digitally and ensure digitally secure transmission through the Internet. The objective and philosophy underlying the Information Technology Act was based on these developments. Against this backdrop, the registration of marriage of spouses separated by distance had to be addressed keeping in view the changing times.The matter was brought to the HC‚Äôs notice after Ami Ranjan and his wife Misha Verma filed an appeal through senior counsel Navniti Prasad Singh and advocate Nitin Kant Setia. The Bench was told that the wife, a medical professional, had been put on Covid-19 emergency duty in the United States.It was added that Gurugram Deputy Commissioner-cum-Marriage Officer, in response to the petitioners‚Äô request, intimated that there was no provision for registration of a marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, without the parties appearing in person.The Bench asserted the husband was not seeking his wife‚Äôs complete exemption from appearance before the Registrar of Marriage. His prayer was that the wife should be allowed to appear through videoconferencing for marriage registration.The presence of the wife could be secured through videoconferencing. The certificate of marriage could be issued after verification of facts as contemplated under the Special Marriage Act. Once the marriage certificate was issued, it could be made a part of the public record by entering it in the marriage certificate book.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/registration-of-marriage-via-video-link-allowed-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-227431

They often claim that the Covid-19 pandemic is nothing but a conspiracy of the Centre to divert the public attention,‚Äù said an official.Parminder Singh of Moga claimed no farmer had been infected for three months at the stir site hence there was no need for vaccination.‚ÄúThe issue will be discussed in the next meeting of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to take a final call in this regard,‚Äù said Purushottam Singh Gill, a senior BKU leader.Civil Surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya said efforts were being made to convince the protesters.Dr Vinay Deswal, Senior Medical Officer, said health officials had been directed to meet the farmers to motivate them.

Everyone wants Sidhu to be part of the team. I hope he decides on joining back soon. Before that he has sought some time,‚Äù he said.Sources close to the Chief Minister said Sidhu wanted to meet the party high command and senior party leadership in Delhi before joining back the government. It is learnt that everything would be clear by March 31. The CM was not keen on a major Cabinet reshuffle at this juncture as the next Assembly elections were due early next year.In the given circumstances, the options before Sidhu to align with any other party are limited. After hectic parleys between Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat and Sidhu, if the latter settles for the same position at which he left, he would try to seek an assurance from the central party leadership, Rawat and the CM on his status if the party returns to power in 2022.Going beyond Sidhu, the CM said he would be happy to have Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Dhullo as part of the team. ‚ÄúWhile everyone has his/her own ambitions, it is up to the Congress president to decide. In a difficult hour, you have to set aside your own ambitions and stand with the party,‚Äù he said.On speculation that Sidhu would seek the post of Deputy Chief Minister or PPCC president, the CM said: ‚ÄúThe decision has to be taken by the party president, not me or Sunil Jakhar.‚Äù In a lighter vein, he said: ‚ÄúIf Sidhu wants my job, he can have it.‚ÄùTo a question on him leading the party and being its CM face in 2022, Capt Amarinder said it was for the AICC president to decide.

Claiming that more than 85 per cent of manifesto promises had been fulfilled, he said it was a record for any party in any state. The previous record was held by Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh. He had fulfilled 81 per cent promises.He said his government had broken the backbone of the drugs chain. He had never said he would eliminate the drugs mafia. ‚ÄúI had clearly said ‚Äì main nasheyan di lak todanga.‚Äù On Opposition allegations of not fulfilling poll promises like action against those involved in sacrilege, police firing and ending the mafia, the Capt said SIT, probing the sacrilege cases, would soon complete its investigation and he would not interfere, if it decides to challan any senior police officers or politicians.He pointed out that SIT chief IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had stated that the final supplementary challan in the Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura firing cases would be filed in a Fardikot court soon. Nine challans had already been filed by SIT in the two cases.On a question of sand and gravel prices continuing to be on higher side and the sand mafia still prevailing, he said the increase in revenue from sand from Rs 35 crore under the SAD-BJP regime to Rs 350 crore now showed the progress in revenue.Listing his government‚Äôs biggest achievement as the maintenance of ‚ÄúPunjabiyat‚Äù, he said, ‚ÄúPeople want peace, where they can conduct their business smoothly. People will see our management,‚Äù he said.Centre must hold talks with farmersMaking it clear that his government was totally opposed to the farm laws, Capt Amarinder urged the Centre not to make it a prestige issue, but immediately scrap the legislation and bring in new laws after fresh discussions with the farmers.Allowance soon for unemployed youthThe Chief Minister said the promises of debt waiver for all farmers and Rs 2,500 a month to all unemployed youth would be fulfilled. The fiscal constraints, especially due to Covid, had pushed back his government in implementing some promises.Threat realAmarinder declared, ‚ÄúAs long as I am here, no Khalistani or Pakistani or any other terrorist activity will be allowed to disturb the peace in the state.‚Äù Terming the national security threat perception real, he said he had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah amid farmers‚Äô agitation to discuss the issueOpposes pvt job quotaThe CM opposed the policy of excessive regionalisation being followed by certain states, saying ‚ÄúAmarinder stands for India for Indian‚Äù.

This was stated by PWD and Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla here today.Singla, who was here to list achievements of his government in the last four years, said the government had increased the multiplier factor for land acquisition following which there would be substantial increase in the compensation to farmers.The NHAI would acquire land in 12 districts for the two projects. Farmers had refused to give their lands for the projects, citing lower compensation. He said in Punjab, the collector rates were lesser as compared to the market rate on demand of people so that they had to spend less on stamp duty at the time of the purchase of land. This was the reason for lesser compensation.

19-03-2021||---||Punjab is your child, don‚Äôt be indifferent to us, Khadoor Sahib MP tells Centre||New Delhi, March 18Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Gill on Thursday demanded a government cancer research centre for Punjab saying the state was reeling under a growing cancer burden which it had inherited on account of excessive use of pesticides and fertilisers to boost foodgrain production for the country.He told the government not to mete out an indifferent treatment to Punjab saying ‚ÄúPunjab is your child‚Äù.¬†Initiating the discussion on the Supplementary Demands for Grants, second batch 2020-2021 in the Lok Sabha, Gill said,¬†‚ÄúPunjab played with its own health to feed the nation. We used fertilisers and pesticides to improve foodgrain production. The country was fed but Punjab fell sick with cancer. We urgently need a¬†cancer¬†research centre and hospital in the state. The hospital must be in the government sector.‚ÄùThe Congress MP also accused the Centre of meting out indifferent treatment to Punjab and demanded compensations and aid across segments. He cited the hit the state‚Äôs industry took due to tax rebates to the bordering hill states to argue for similar concessions at least for the six border districts of Punjab, if not for the whole state.‚ÄúWhen I look at the Union budget, it appears to have been tailormade for poll-bound states. Punjab has been neglected. We need infrastructure, especially because we are a border state and a landlocked one at that. We had a lot of industry but militancy disrupted that. Later, the tax rebates to hill states hampered our development. If you give rebate to six Punjab border districts our industry will be revived. We are suffering from brain drain and faced with bleak employment prospects as our educated youth is leaving for abroad,‚Äù said Gill citing the once-famous handloom industry of Amritsar, Batala‚Äôs machine tools, Jalandhar‚Äôs world-class sports goods and Ludhiana‚Äôs garment supremacy.He hailed the bicycles made in Ludhiana and said Ludhiana, the Manchester of India, needed support.‚ÄúWe have no iron ores, no coal mines. We have to take everything from the rest of the country. How can we compete? Punjab is your child. Please support it,‚Äù Gill said to the BJP government.He thanked PM Narendra Modi for opening the Kartarpur Corridor but called for enhanced connectivity.The Congress MP also demanded cuts on duties imposed on domestic electric vehicles to boost demand.Gill also sought more international flights from Amritsar airport.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-is-your-child-dont-be-indifferent-to-us-khadoor-sahib-mp-tells-centre-227045
