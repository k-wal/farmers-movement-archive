So far three cadets have become commissioned officers and another seven cadets have appeared for interview by the Services Selection Board.The finance minister has proposed to double the training targets for both the institutes in 2021-22. He also proposed an allocation of Rs 29 crore in the forthcoming fiscal for the proposed Sardar Bahadur Amin Chand Soni Armed Forces Preparatory Institute that is expected to come up by the end of 2021 near Hoshiarpur. It will train 270 youth every year for joining the defence forces as commissioned officers through the Combined Defence Services Examination or the Air Force Central Admission Test.As far as the state government’s unique Guardians of Governance scheme is concerned, an allocation of Rs 64 crore has been proposed for 2021-22 against Rs 60 crore in 2020-21. The scheme employees 4,300 ex-servicemen in the state to ensure efficacious execution of various welfare schemes and other citizen-centric services.In addition, Badal also proposed to set up two new galleries in the War Memorial Complex at Amritsar with an allocation of Rs 18 crore and an allocation of Rs 5 crore to improve the condition of the Sainik School at Kapurthala.Further, a target of training 10,000 youths every year has been set for the Centre for Training and Employment of Punjab Youth (C-PYTE) and Rs 17 crore have been proposed for this scheme. So far a total of 23,412 youths were recruited for training in the C-PYTE camps out of which 4,227 were recruited in the army and police during the tenure of the present government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-to-double-training-targets-of-armed-forces-preparatory-institutes-222401
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Crying Punjab, failed government: BJP slams state budget||Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary Tarun Chugh criticised the Punjab government’s budget 2021-22 saying it presented a grim picture of a state “crying” because its government had dashed all its hopes with empty promises.Chug called the budget a cosmetic and shallow pre-election exercise that he claimed would prove to be the last nail in the coffin for Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s government.Amarinder Singh’s party the Congress had promised minimum income per acre to farmers, jobs for farmers holding less than five acres of land, and a state agriculture insurance commission that would cover crops losses, “none of which has been fulfilled”.“Farmers in the state feel cheated,” Chugh said.The Congress also promised to do away with the state’s VIP culture, but nothing’s been done in that direction in the last four years, he said.“Instead of VIP culture it is a seven-star culture that the Amarinder government has spread in the state,” he said. “These failed promises have not only disappointed the people of the state but has also exposed ineptness and inefficiency of the Amarinder government that has brought Punjab to the brink where there has been complete break-down of law and order and mafias have come to run the state.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/crying-punjab-failed-government-bjp-slams-state-budget-222397

This is an insult to hardworking Punjabis who voted the Congress to power believing the promises made by the chief minister by taking a vow on the holy Gutka Sahib and the Dasam Pitah”.Speaking about the budget, Sukhbir Badal said: ”The finance minister knew that he had nothing to give because of bad fiscal management, which is resulting in the state’s debt doubling and galloping towards the Rs three lakh crore mark. He also knows he has only Rs 6,882 crore for capital works, which is negligible considering the number of promises made to the people, none of which have been fulfilled till now. This is why some measures like the promised enhancement of Shagun amount to Rs 51,000 and old-age pension to Rs 1,500 have been announced with a rider saying they will be implemented from July this year. Seeing the government’s track record, they might not be implemented even one month before the election,” he said, adding that the promise, which had been made to the people, was to fulfill these conditions from March 2017.“If the government is serious about fulfilling these promises it should implement the enhanced Shagun scheme and the old-age pension scheme from March, 2017 or stop trying to fool the people with empty statements.”Badal also castigated the finance minister for making another promise to women, which he allegedly had no aim of fulfilling. He said even in last year’s budget, the FM had promised 50 per cent concession to women for travel on state transport buses but did not implement the promise. He said this year the FM had now come out with a free travel facility promise for women.“How can anyone believe such a FM?” he asked.The SAD president said the government had befooled farmers by promising a complete loan waiver promise for four years.“The final budget of this corrupt and insensitive government has again betrayed the farmers. The government did not disburse Rs 3,000 crore earmarked for farm loan waiver for 2019-20 besides not disbursing Rs 2,000 crore earmarked for 2020-21. Now, it has allocated a pittance of Rs 1,712 core for farm-loan waiver and landless labourers, which is a cruel joke on both of them,” Badal added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-trying-to-fool-people-in-election-year-sukhbir-badal-on-budget-222394
08-03-2021||---||Another provocation for farmers, says Amarinder on Centre’s direct payment proposal||Chandigarh, March 8Even as he termed the Centre’s proposal on direct payment to the farmers, bypassing the arhtiyas, as another provocation that will further aggravate the current crisis over the Farm Laws, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday said the apathetic attitude of the Government of India would not help resolve the situation.The matter had to be resolved by the Centre and the farmers, with the Punjab government having no role to play as the farmers’ associations had categorically rejected any political interference, said the Chief Minister, speaking to mediapersons on the state budget, which he described as pro-farmer and pro-poor.The growth-oriented budget unveiled today in the Vidhan Sabha by Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal was designed to ensure the welfare of all sections of the society, Amarinder said. It was a people’s budget and yet another step in the fulfillment of his government’s promises to the people of Punjab, he added, citing the hike in Shagun and Pension amounts and the allocation for the state’s infrastructure development, including the link roads.Instead of amicably resolving the farmers’ issue, the central government was fuelling further angst among them, said the Chief Minister, adding that by seeking land record for making e-payment to the farmers directly from the FCI, the situation would worsen. Punjab had a time-tested system in place in 1967, with farmers getting paid through the arhtiyas with whom they had excellent relations and on whom they could depend for financial support in times of adversity, he said.“How can farmers rely on corporate houses like the Ambanis and the Adanis in times of crisis,” he asked.The Chief Minister stressed that the Centre should have taken the farmers into confidence before bringing the controversial Ordinances. “Had the Centre been sincere about finding a viable solution to this problem, it would have either consulted the Punjab government or our farmers, as our state alone contributes over 40% of foodgrains to the national pool,” he remarked.Amarinder made it clear that Punjab, which was initially not even a part of the deliberations on the agricultural reforms, was included in the high-powered committee only after he wrote to the Centre. Manpreet Badal and Secretary Agriculture KS Pannu attended the two meetings held thereafter but there was no mention there about the ordinances or the new laws, he added.The Chief Minister, in response to a question, said the Governor should immediately decide and forward the state’s amendment Bills against the Farm Laws to the President. “If the President accepts it’s good and if he refuses, it will open the doors for us for legal recourse,” he added.To another query regarding the imposition of lockdown due to recent surge in Covid-19 cases, the Chief Minister said, "I cannot say right now, but I hope we are able to control it." At the same time he asked the people to strictly follow safety norms as a precautionary measure. Asked to comment about post-vaccination effects, the Chief Minister said he was absolutely fine.In response to a question on the exclusion of PCA Stadium, Mohali, from IPL venues for forthcoming session, the Chief Minister said he had already tweeted to express his resentment. If Mumbai Stadium could be a venue with more than 10,000 cases a day why should Mohali be ignored, he asked, adding that the state government had already assured of all arrangements to ensure strict compliance with Covid protocols at Mohali.Asked to comment whether the next state assembly elections for 2022 would be led under his leadership, the Chief Minister said the decision was the sole prerogative of AICC president Sonia Gandhi. On the statement of Manpreet Singh Badal that he won’t be the next Finance Minister if Congress comes to power in the 2022 assembly elections, the Chief Minister, in a lighter vein, said that “this is to be decided by the party not him”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/another-provocation-for-farmers-says-amarinder-on-centres-direct-payment-proposal-222363

08-03-2021||Aparna Banerji||When ‘superwomen’ took control of farm protests||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, March 7“On the dark night of January 26, power and water supply was snapped at Tikri. With no bathrooms, women made every attempt to hold their bladders for as long as they can. I have colleagues who were menstruating badly and had developed infections. We eventually found bathrooms kilometres away in a liquor factory. We tried to avoid drinking water, afraid of the fact that we had no washrooms around,” says Jagroop Kaur.What made them stay at the protest site for so long despite such hardships? ‘Hond di larai naalon eh larai bahut choti hai’ (this fight is much smaller than the fight for existence). The spirit of Mai Bhago and Gulaab Kaur aids us. Without lands and grains, women shall be the worst sufferers. We can suffer, but not leave our fellowmen behind,” she added.Just back from Singhu after months, eight to nine women of Meerpur Lakha village, clad in yellow dupatta, have formed an all-women society in their village. They plan a huge gathering of women to support the farm laws on International Women’s Day. Women of the Hariana village, in Faridkot, also recently formed a nine-member all-women committee – an initiative of the elderly women.From Jalandhar district alone, two buses full of women shall head to Tikri under the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Monday to back the farmers’ agitation. While hundreds of women silently bore the impact of the snapped power and water at the borders of Delhi after January 26 – the protests have fueled a profound spirit of revolution and emancipation among the women of Punjab. Huge gatherings have been planned at Singhu, Tikri and all across the state to assert women’s voice tomorrow.On 29 January, a jatha of women – five days without a washroom due to snapped electricity and water supply after the January 26 fiasco – marched across Tikri to boost the morale of protesters, their rallying cry was, “Asi Mai Bhago Dian Vaarsan, Asi Raani Jhansi Dian Vaarsan.”Manjit Kaur (40), from the Meerpur Lakha village, 13 km from Banga, who stayed at Singhu for over 15 days (her second visit), says, “Aurat vaste vi mard de modhe naal modha jor ke larna zaroori hai. It is the elderly women who have fueled the revolution among kids. Eight to nine women of the village formed a committee and now are exhorting the young to join. Kids follow their mothers. It’s not easy to leave homes. There is no one to tend to crops, no one to cook food. Both my husband and I went there. But the protests have freed women more. They have made wats app groups to talk about their issues. On 10th more village women shall head to Singhu.”Faridkot resident Jagroop Kaur (37), who along with her husband owns 16 acres of land, stayed at the protests with her 10-year-old son from November 27 to February 1, said, “Farm protests have altered the social structures. Men at the protests are extremely respectful to women. A teacher friend who has been cooking langar said during protests he understood the value of the work his wife did at home. Younger men one day asked us to take the stage at Tikri, saying ‘ajj langar asi paka lange tusi stage sambho.’ (Today we men will cook langar you take the stage). Women who didn’t visit anywhere in village except ‘sauhre’ and ‘peke’ (maternal home, in-laws home) are making friends, sharing stories, finding freedom. Women are undergoing an alternate revolution.”Harveer Kaur, sister of activist Nodeep Kaur, who stayed put at the protest site for a long time, said, “The impact of the Kisan Andolan is lasting on us. It is going to alter our futures. My parents are both labourer activists. They had been asking us to be careful during protests. But after Nodeep’s arrest, my mother now backs us fervently. The Kirti Kisan Union is also making women wings. After the protests, women want to sign up for a larger stake in the day to day events and important decisions of the village.”Amolak Singh, Convenor of the Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak manch and member Desh Bhagat Yadgaar Committee, said, “The protests have also ushered in a woman’s revolution where women prepare for a larger role in future when they go back homes. It has ushered a social, cultural and psychological revolution. Punjab is stepping out of the medieval, feudal value system and women are going to be majorly impacted by this. They are leading the change – demanding their own space, dignity and freedom. Women are now bound to chart their own course rather than being restricted to the one defined by men. More and more women joining the protests are also joining it independently rather than just for following their husbands.”Joginder Kaur from Tarn Taran, who has been at Singhu for the past over two months, says, “Zameen jandi hai tan sabh ton zyada bibiyan nu fark paina. Ghar ja ke ki karange je zameenan gaiyan. Asi baithe aan ik muth ho ke. Razamandi naal shanti naal. (if lands go, women will be worst affected. What will we do at home if our lands are gone. We sit here together, peacefully.)”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/when-superwomen-took-control-of-farm-protests-222278

08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Election year, Punjab Budget  to focus on poll promises||With the Opposition turning the heat on the Congress government in Punjab over its “unfulfilled” poll promises, the party is all set to announce provisions to fulfil these in the Budget 2021-22, scheduled to be presented in the Vidhan Sabha on Monday.Official sources say some of the promises likely to find place in the Budget include enhancement in the old-age pension and “shagun”, skill training for wards of construction workers, unemployment allowance, free housing for SC beneficiaries and farm loan waiver for landless labourers.Likely announcements by Finance MinisterCM Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday directed all ministries and departments to proactively push for the realisation of the seven-point “Agenda 2022” unveiled by him in the Vidhan Sabha on Friday. “The agenda comprises improvisation in the announcements made in 2017 and the way forward,” said a senior party leader.Countering the Opposition, the government claimed that 84 per cent of the promises had been fulfilled. Of 546 promises made in the 2017 manifesto, the Congress has fulfilled 455 and the remaining will be met in its remaining term, the sources claim. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/election-year-punjab-budget-to-focus-on-poll-promises-222150

India last saw 18,855 infections in a day on January 29. Maharashtra witnessed 10,187 daily new cases over the past 24 hours, followed by Kerala (2,791) and Punjab (1,159). Karnataka (580), Gujarat (571) and Tamil Nadu (562) were close behind.So far as fatalities go, 100 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. Six states account for 87% new deaths. Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (47), followed by Kerala (16) and Punjab (12). The Health Ministry had yesterday sent teams to Maharashtra and Punjab and the teams have started probing the causes behind the surge although preliminary data suggests the reasons are inappropriate Covid behaviour - marriages, elections, super-spreading events and greater dependence on the antigen test rather than the standard RTPCR test.Antigen tests are prone to showing false negative reports and the Centre has mandated a negative antigen test report to be cross-checked with an RTPCR test. "That is not happening in many cases and there is a lack of fear of the disease seeing the infections decline. But this can prove costly," a ministry official said. As the share of active cases in total cases rose to 1.65% today, the Centre said 8 states were displaying an upward trajectory in daily new cases. These include Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, MP, Haryana, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-recovery-rate-dips-punjab-sees-12-fatalities-222130
08-03-2021||Milkha Singh Aulakh||Farm Laws: Half-baked policies can be counterproductive||THE three farm laws enacted by the Union Government last year could have an enormous impact on the livelihoods of various sections of society as well as food security of our highly populated country. Policy-makers often cite the examples of developed countries to justify the need for such reforms in India to liberalise and open up the farm sector to private players. However, when we compare the social security net, insurance cover and market options available to farmers in India and developed countries, the disparity is striking.Farmers and farm labourers constitute a smaller proportion of the population in developed countries (2-5 per cent) as compared to India (60-70 per cent). In the US, 897 million acres of agricultural land is cultivated by 2 million farmers; in India, only 350 million acres are cultivated by 145 million farming families. A majority of the farmers in developed countries have large-sized farms. The average farm size in the US is 448 acres, way above India (2.5 acres). Their farmers have the capacity and capability to store their products for long periods after each harvest; they also own transportation facilities. Their farmers are usually involved in decision-making policies that could impact their livelihood. In addition to a much larger cash and commodity support than in India, the government provides them social security, including old-age pension, health services and education to their wards (schoolbuses pick up and drop their wards at their on-farm residences). For example, the farmers of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta provinces in Canada have farms varying from 500 to 2,000 acres, along with modern machinery and infrastructure. They produce mainly wheat, barley, pulses and edible oilseeds that are exported to other countries. After each harvest, farmers often store grains in on-farm silos and transport them only when they get good prices.Farmers on boardThe Canadian Wheat Board was constituted in 1935 with representatives of the government and the farmers. Its functions include identification of markets, negotiations for best prices and delivery of agri products. Accordingly, the farmers grow those crops and transport their produce to allocated railway yards to upload it in containers for onward transport to seaports for export. If and when some fields are left fallow due to lesser demand of agri products, the government compensates farmers for their fallow acreage.Contract farming under India’s new agri laws would lead to the establishment of large farms and the development of state-of-the-art infrastructure by clubbing landholdings of small, marginal and poor farmers, who have less than five acres and constitute 86 per cent of the farmers. However, such large farms would render rural people unemployed, who account for 60-70 per cent of our population. Keeping in view the joblessness of a significant proportion of the urban population, the movement of people in large numbers from rural areas to cities would aggravate unemployment. In order to avoid unnecessary glut of one agri product or the other and maintain equilibrium between their production and requirements, the state governments and farmers’ cooperatives could be allowed to export their agri products, including fresh vegetables and fruits, directly to other countries.Insurance schemesIn India, several crop insurance schemes have been formulated, implemented and withdrawn from time to time. In 1999-2000, the government introduced Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana. In recent years, four insurance schemes were launched: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Weather-based Crop Insurance Scheme, Coconut Palm Insurance Scheme and the Pilot Unified Package Insurance Scheme. However, none of these schemes has become popular among farmers because their premium rates are quite high, and they have several inbuilt bylaws for calamities and other factors that are mostly unfavourable to the farmers. For example, while more than 11 lakh policies were purchased by farmers in 2017, only 3.08 lakh were indemnified. Other reasons for their non-acceptance are the complicated procedures involved, lack of education and awareness among farmers, and most importantly, the incapability and affordability of poor farmers to pay the annual premium in advance.In contrast, the farmers of developed countries are in a better position in several ways and capable of paying premium. A variety of insurance policies are available at competitive rates, which cover personal liability of farmers and their co-workers, their farmhouses and possessions, machinery and livestock, and stored-on-farm agri products, besides the insurance for crops that witness a loss in yield, whether it is due to an insurable cause of loss in the quality or quantity of the insured crop. Governments co-pay substantial premiums; for instance, in British Columbia province of Canada, the government pays up to 45 per cent of the crop insurance premium. Moreover, the system is transparent and farmers use insurance policies to cover the risk and make a profit.MSP shieldThe Union Government introduced the MSP (minimum support price) regime to guarantee a minimum profit for the farmer for his harvest if the open market offers a lesser price than the cost incurred. Although the MSP is announced for 23 farm-produced crops, the Centre does not assure that all these agri products are purchased at or above the MSP. The Centre purchases mainly paddy (unmilled rice), wheat and a few pulses through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state government agencies for their distribution among poor people through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This leaves the farmers at the mercy of corporates (including private buyers), who may purchase all remaining agri products at whatever price they offer, and farmers have no option but to sell their produce.As the MSP holds the key to farmers’ security and the nation’s self-sufficiency, the provision of its legal status is a necessity so that no one can swindle, fleece or force poor farmers, who are already in a pitiable condition, to sell their agri products at much lower than economically viable rates. This would also encourage crop diversification so as to avoid a glut of wheat and rice, and reduce imports of pulses and edible oils.In a nutshell, we should either adopt reforms of developed countries in totality, including liberalisation in agriculture and agri-marketing, social security and crop insurance, as selective actions can distort our well-established system and prove counterproductive, or try to frame our own viable and dynamic agricultural policies that will provide economic and ecological sustainability and protect the interests of various sections of the population.The author is former Dean, College of Agriculture, PAU, and founder V-C, BandaUniversity of Agriculture and Technology, UPSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-laws-half-baked-policies-can-be-counterproductive-222121

08-03-2021||Arun Sharma||Don Mukhtar Ansari named in 6-year-old murder case||Tribune News ServiceRopar, March 7In what appears to be another attempt to keep gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari in Punjab, the Ropar police have named him in a six-year-old case of a labourer’s murder.Though Ropar SSP Akhil Chaudhary said Ansari was named in the case long ago on the statement of the complainant, Vidya Rani, on June 27, 2019, the latter said she didn’t know anything about Mukhtar Ansari.Vidya Rani, sister of the deceased, said her brother was a labourer and had no enmity with anyone. “What could be his relation with a big gangster or politicians?” she said.Ansari, facing several criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh, is in a Ropar jail after he was arrested and brought from Uttar Pradesh by the Punjab Police in a case of extortion and intimidation registered in January 2019 at the Mataur police station in Mohali on the complaint of a businessman. The Uttar Pradesh Police teams seeking custody of Ansari on production warrants have been returned multiple times by the Ropar jail authorities on medical grounds.Three days ago, the Opposition had raised the issue during the Budget session in the Punjab Assembly alleging the state government was shielding Ansari.The Ropar SSP said on June 27, 2019, Vidya Rani recorded a statement apprehending that Mukhtar Ansari was behind the murder of her brother following which the name of Ansari was included in the FIR. The Ropar police also tried to get his custody several times for questioning in the case but the jail authorities refused to hand him over on medical grounds, he said.When contacted at her home in Morinda, Vidya Devi said her brother, a tempo driver at Rampur near Moradabad, came to Morinda a few years ago after the death of his wife. He was staying in an accommodation provided by his employer.About the police claims she said, “Neither I know about Mukhtar Ansari nor I recorded any such statement with the police.”No cops contacted her after death of her brother and it was only a month ago when she was called at the Morinda police station thrice to discuss the progress in the case, she claimed, adding that the cops, instead of telling her anything, were only interested to know whether she had any clue about the accused.Later, a policeman visited her home and got her signatures on some papers on the pretext of investigation in the case, she claimed.The Ropar SSP, however, claimed her statement regarding the involvement of Ansari was a matter of record and there were chances that she was influenced by someone in the case.Victim’s kin: not aware of suspectVidya Rani, sister of the deceased, said her brother was a labourer and had no enmity with anyone. “What could be his relation with a big gangster or politicians?” she said. About the police claims, she said, “Neither do I know about Mukhtar Ansari nor have I recorded any statement with the police.”Statement on record: PoliceRopar SSP Akhil Chaudhary said on June 27, 2019, Vidya Rani recorded a statement apprehending that Mukhtar Ansari was behind the murder of her brother following which name of Ansari was included in the FIR.

The doctors had advised knee replacement, which was expensive at private hospitals. An NGO took up his case with MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra and he was covered under the Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana of the state. He was admitted to the Civil Hospital, Fatehgarh Sahib, where a team of doctors, led by Dr Tripatjot Singh Randhawa and Dr Gagandeep Singh, performed the operation free of cost. The MLA also arranged camps in villages to prepare smart health cards. More than 1.5 lakh health cards have been issued in the district.‘No check’ on rural development fundsPathankot: The process of monitoring of central government’s rural development funds in Pathankot district has ‘gone kaput’. These funds, sent by the Ministry of Rural Development, for the development and upkeep of village infrastructure, are monitored by a committee called District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA), headed by MP Sunny Deol. The ongoing farm protests have ensured it will be a long time before the MP decides to touch down his parliamentary constituency. In the absence of meetings of DISHA, little is known about the coming of funds and their use. Deol’s predecessor Sunil Jakhar used to regularly preside over DISHA meetings. So was the case with Jakhar’s predecessor Vinod Khanna.

Comparatively, the per capita income of neighbouring Haryana is Rs 13,233. Even the national average of per capita social sector expenditure of major states is Rs 8,962.No wonder the focus of the Finance Minister in Monday’s Budget will be more on schemes for the uplift of socio-economically disadvantaged sections. On the cards is likely a scheme for assured buyback of some horticulture crops, an enhanced compensation for families of those farmers who commit suicide and those who have died in the ongoing farmers’ stir, self-employment schemes and enhanced social security pensions among others.Data available with The Tribune from the Reserve Bank of India (State Finances: A Study of Budgets 2018-19) reveals that the state’s spending on social sector initiatives has come down by almost 50 per cent in the past four years. From Rs 48,270 crore spent on social sector initiatives in 2016-17 (though this was also an election year), the spending in 2019-20 came down to Rs 24,896.10 crore.Other than this, the state government has not been able to perform well in its flagship welfare scheme for farmers — the Crop Loan Waiver Scheme — the atta-dal scheme has been reduced to just providing wheat as dal has not been provided for the past many years and sugar and tea leaves (as promised) have not been distributed.Another RBI report, which has analysed the farm loan waiver schemes of different states, shows that Punjab has so far waived just 46 per cent of the amount announced. The total institutional debt of the state is Rs 57,332 crore and the non-institutional loan is Rs 24,652.76 crore. Only the institutional loan has been waived. Comparatively, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have waived more than 70 per cent of the farmers’ loans.Dr Parmod Kumar, an economist, says the development of the state should be measured in terms of the social security net that it provides to the people. “Spending on the social sector has been reducing.

With pricing in the food sector controlled by corporates, farm labourers will not be able to buy it,” he added.“We demand the repeal of new farm laws. The government should also increase daily wages of MGNREGA workers to Rs 600 and provide work throughout the year,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmer-union-drums-up-support-for-march-15-rally-222000

But Leader of Opposition (LoP) Harpal Cheema said all claims were only on papers.“Since the formation of the Congress government in Punjab, government schools have seen unprecedented development. Our government schools have better infrastructure than private schools as I along with our senior officers have been keeping a strict watch over the performance of teachers,” said Singla after attending the bhog of wife of former DSP Bharthari Singh here.“We have been releasing all money sought by schools to further improve their functioning,” said Singla. However, Cheema alleged that the Congress government had failed to fulfil its promises. “All claims of development of the congress government are only on papers. State residents are well aware that the government has not fulfilled any of its poll promise,” said Cheema.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/govt-schools-in-punjab-outperforming-private-ones-vijay-inder-singla-222001

I, along with my daughter-in-law, have also been participating in protests. I will reach the Tikri border and join my husband who is already there. My daughter-in-law is alone at home along with my grandson. Same is the situation of many families in our village” said Mukhtiar Kaur from Gharachon village.“A majority of women have been leaving for Delhi from our area. The March 8 function would be an eye-opener for the central government,” said Jagir Kaur, an elderly woman from Bhawanigarh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sangrur-women-farmers-leave-for-event-at-tikri-222002

08-03-2021||London||Sikh fighter pilot memorial in UK to honour Indians who fought in World Wars||The design for a sculpture of an early 20th century Sikh fighter pilot, cricketer and golfer from Oxford University has been approved for a new memorial to be erected in the England port city of Southampton in memory of all Indians who fought in the World Wars.Hardit Singh Malik first arrived in the UK in 1908 as a 14-year-old to Balliol College at the University of Oxford and went on to become a member of the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. As the first Indian and turbaned pilot with a specialised helmet, he became famous as the “Flying Sikh”.“As such the statue to the legendary World War I hero, Hardit Singh Malik, the world’s first Royal Flying Corps (now the Royal Air Force) Sikh, turbaned fighter pilot will be emblematic for the broader Sikh contributions in the British armed forces of World War I and II, with Malik’s extraordinary accomplishments as a ‘touchstone’ for the whole Sikh community and other of its lesser-known heroes,” notes the One Community Hampshire & Dorset (OCHD) organisation behind the campaign for the memorial, which was approved by the Southampton City Council last year.Malik also played cricket for Sussex and was also the Indian Ambassador to France after a long and distinguished career in the Indian Civil Service. But it is as a fighter pilot during 1917-19 that he is best known.“I am truly overwhelmed by the striking beauty and power of the exceptional design of the memorial, which captures the spirit and endeavour of this great RAF fighter pilot, Hardit Singh Malik, so well. It gives me great happiness to learn that the design is approved by the community,” said Lord Rami Ranger, Chairman of the British Sikh Association and Chief Patron of OCHD.“This project certainly speaks for itself; strongly furthering community cohesion and integration, and testifying to the major contribution our Sikh and broader ethnic minority communities make to our country, as we live in such a vibrant multicultural society here in Southampton,” said Pritheepal Singh, OCHD CEO and Director.The memorial will be created by English sculptor Luke Perry, who is associated with other memorials such as the “Lions of the Great War” monument in Smethwick in the West Midlands region of England, which depicts a turbaned Sikh soldier to honour the sacrifices made by millions of South Asian service personnel who fought for Britain in the World Wars. His design for the latest memorial was finalised earlier this month and also received the backing of the Council of Southampton Gurdwaras.“Monuments such as this are a vital part of the fight for equal representation. These artworks are long overdue thanks and recognition to the communities from around the world who have supported Britain in its past and continue to do so in vital roles, not just in the armed forces but our health care and every aspect of modern life,” said Perry.“The public statue of Hardit Singh Malik embodies the spirit of inclusivity — representing the will to ‘breaking the glass ceiling’ at the intersection of two World Wars and minority enrolment in the RAF: a significant feat for an Indian at the time,” added Dr Sanjukta Ghosh, Artistic Director at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) South Asia Institute and OCHD Advisor.An online Go Fund Me fundraiser is also inviting funds for the memorial, the unveiling of which is expected to be accompanied by educational resources, a book and a documentary covering several educational themes. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sikh-fighter-pilot-memorial-in-uk-to-honour-indians-who-fought-in-world-wars-221976
