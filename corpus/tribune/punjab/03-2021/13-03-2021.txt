Avhad, an official statement said.Search and seizure operations were conducted at multiple locations in Khanna town by the teams of the department to gather evidence for establishing the modus operandi that involved creating firms in states outside and within Punjab dealing in copper scrap and hosiery items.The input tax credit created through bogus firms was used to support the local movement of goods of traders.The department had got alerted about the network after a vehicle carrying copper scrap was detained last year and investigation had revealed that the goods had been procured locally while as e-way and invoice were generated from some other firm.The detailed investigation revealed a network of 44 firms spread across states that was being used to create the bogus input tax credit for setting off the tax liability arising out of purchases made from local unregistered dealers.On being confronted with the evidence, the kingpin accepted that he was operating the network with the help of some other accomplices some of whom have also been arrested.The total bogus billing by the network is likely to be more than Rs 700 crore while input tax credit created or availed and tax evaded is more than 122 crore, said the official statement.The accused—Vinod Kumar, Maninder Sharma, Sandeep Singh, Amarinder Singh and Sunny Mehta—were produced before the Duty Magistrate and were remanded to judicial custody for 14 days.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/5-held-in-punjab-for-gst-scam-of-rs-700-crore-224727

Saturday was the first day. He dwelt on the nuances of the Rules and norms, protocols, formats relating to both the ‘Starred’ and ‘Unstarred’ questions, which are legislative instruments to make the executive accountable to the legislature in a functional democracy.His tutelary lessons were pepped up with narration of his practical experiences of situations, which were lateral and not available in the Rule Book of Procedure.Dwelling on the dissuasive tactics resorted to by ministers, Gujral said they would preface the answers by appreciating the questions.He said that there have been instances in the long past of Cabinet Ministers landing at the residence of Members early morning of the day their questions were listed in the Question Hour urging them to absent themselves from Parliament."Many reputations have been made and unmade by the nature of questions," Gujral said. “Ministers have lost their jobs because they could not answer the questions well.”He advised new MPs to have a sense of humour, which would add more punch and finesse to their style and diction of their questions.He urged them never to disrupt proceedings as it distracts and impinges on the time of the precious Question Hour."Question Hours is the liveliest part of Parliamentary proceedings."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/naresh-gujrals-message-to-new-mps-dont-be-taken-in-by-ministers-224722

Another act that will be presented by the same team is ‘azadi’.Tarpreet Singh, convener of youth wing of Kirti Kisan Union, said, ‘Khali Nai Partega Dulla’ will depict the consequences the farmers will face if three farm laws are not repealed. “The play shows that farmers will lose their lands to corporate houses,” he added.Jaswinder Pappi, director of the play, said, “It is a motivational play where the farmers are ‘dullas’, who will not return empty-handed after spending months at the borders. Running for 25 minutes, it will be performed by Jaswinder’s daughter Nargis (15).The team had performed this play at Delhi borders for five times and received huge applause and praise from the audiences there. When Kirti Kisan Union members saw it, they felt the need to show this to people residing in the villages who don’t have much idea on what is happening in the capital.Tarpreet said that no book can penetrate this deep into the soul of a person but visual medium can do wonders, which is why it was decided to hold such plays. “We have invited people from 10 adjoining villages of Uppal Khalsa. Once done, we will organise the play in other villages as well,” he told.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-movement-will-khali-nai-partega-dulla-penetrate-peoples-heart-224583

They know that it’s difficult to hold them after completion of their school education.In order to keep them busy, colleges from time to time have tried various methods to occupy youth for maximum time. While they initially started highlighting memorandum of understandings (MoUs) with foreign universities (half course in India and the second half abroad), the next attempt was to keep them occupied with short-term courses in air hostess training, aviation, nanny, physiotherapy, nursing and hotel management, among others, which have a good demand abroad.Now, the institutes have begun offering on-campus IELTS coaching and most recently have even opened firms to facilitate immigration of students. “Certainly, this trend is not going to settle in any way and we have seen it all. So, we thought that instead of counselling and urging them to stay back by telling tales about successful Punjabis here, we have also jumped on the same bandwagon. Tomorrow, we are going to launch CT Global Education Services, which will be a study-based immigration services firm. To ensure that we are able to pull up the same kind of clientele, we are opening our office in the hub of such activities near the bus stand,” said Manbir Singh, managing director, CT Group of Institutes, which runs a university, chain of colleges and schools.Asked how it would be different from hundreds of their counterparts in the market, Manbir said, “We will be more reliable and affordable. We will offer IELTS coaching. We will have ‘IELTS Plus’, which will have additional short-term skill training courses, including carpentery and hotel management for visa enhancement.”Like the CT Group of Institutes, KMV College, Jalandhar, is also offering IELTS course for its students as well as outsiders. “We want students to remain busy and brush up their skills as long as they are with us. So, instead of attending IELTS coaching centres, we are offering them an in-house facility wherein one can attend classes during their free periods or after college hours. We have fully-trained dedicated IELTS faculty. In addition, we are also offering foreign language courses in French and Mandarin, which have a good demand,” said Madhumeet Kaur, Dean Student Welfare.Talking about the foreign fad, she added that as regular college classes were allowed to resume post lockdown, it were largely the IELTS trainees who insisted for offline classes and were among the first few students to return to the campus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/foreign-fad-colleges-start-ielts-immigration-centres-224584

Among other things, the Bench was told that total amount of GST evasion in the case was of Rs 7,83,15,309.Petitioner challenged CGST Act provisionsThe matter was placed before the Bench after the petitioner challenged the vires of Sections 69 and 132 of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017. He also prayed for interim protection during the pendency of the writ petition as non-bailable warrants had been issued by the competent authority. His apprehension was that he may be taken into custody, as he appeared before the authority concerned.The Bench asserted it was of the prima facie view that the special enactment has been enacted for the recovery of taxes, under enabling provisions contained in Section 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The court was also of prima facie view that Parliament was empowered under Article 246A of the Constitution to enact special laws with regard to Goods and Services Tax (GST).“The legislation enacted is for levy and collection of taxes on the supply of goods and services having special provisions for recovery of revenue. It being a fiscal matter, a distinct procedure appears to have been evolved by Parliament by virtue of a special enactment, which is permissible under Section 4 of the CrPC,” the Bench added.The matter was placed before the Bench after the petitioner challenged the vires of Sections 69 and 132 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. He also prayed for interim protection during the pendency of the writ petition as non-bailable warrants had been issued by the competent authority. His apprehension was that he may be taken in custody, as he appeared before the authority concerned.Appearing before the Bench, a senior counsel on the petitioner’s behalf also raised a number of other legal issues, particularly the powers of the legislature to enact laws under Article 246A. He also referred to the provisions of the CrPC to contend that an offence under the CGST would be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to provisions of the code, subject to any provision contrary in the CGST Act. “Since we are dealing only with the prayer for interim relief at present, we do not intend to express any final opinion on the issue,” the Bench concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/parliament-empowered-to-enact-special-laws-on-gst-hc-224276

The notice by Justice Amol Rattan Singh came on a petition by Kudos Chemie Ltd director Kabir Sodhi through counsel Viren Sibal. He was seeking the quashing of a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and the orders passed thereon. Sibal among other things submitted that legal proceedings in the criminal case could not continue once the same had been initiated under the code with regard to a company in terms of the Supreme Court judgment in the case of ‘P Mohanraj and others versus M/s Shah Brothers Ispat Pvt Ltd’.  Viren, in the petition, said the Supreme Court considered “whether the institution or continuation of a proceeding under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act can be said to be covered by the moratorium provision, namely Section 14 of the IBC”. The apex court answered the question in the negative, thereby placing a bar on parallel proceedings. Viren added: “If the complainant is permitted to continue with the parallel proceedings, it may actually profit from the transaction in as much as it may wrongly recover money from the petitioner both under the pressure of an FIR and also the IBC. This could have never been the intention of the legislature”. Justice Amol Rattan Singh fixed the case for April 26 before directing the trial court to adjourn the matter to a date beyond it. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/notice-to-punjab-on-plea-against-proceedings-under-instruments-act-224277
