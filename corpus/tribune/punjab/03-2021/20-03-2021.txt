The Punjab government will also recruit around 460 qualified and trained counsellors, clinical psychologists and community and victim support officers for deployment at the family counselling centres and women help desks in all districts of the state.To further augment women power in the police department, 3,400 new women police officials will be recruited as part of the drive to enrol 10,000 more police officials in Punjab Police, mostly in the rank of sub-inspector and constables. This translates into 33 per cent women of the total recruitment, in line with the state government’s commitment to provide equal opportunity to women to compete with men for various positions in Punjab Police, said Gupta. Out of the total recruitment of women, about 300 women will be recruited as sub-inspectors and more than 3,100 would be inducted as constables in Punjab Police.The DGP said that once these specialised police officers got recruited and joined the police department in the second or third quarter of 2021, each of the 382 police stations in the state would have a dedicated police station law officer and a community and victim support officer. Similarly, 170 major police stations of Punjab, including border police stations, will have dedicated forensic officers, crime data analysts. In addition, cyber crime detectives will be placed in each of the 100 sub-divisions in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinder-announces-initiative-to-strengthen-law-enforcement-machinery-in-punjab-228014

The FCI has already announced to credit the payment directly into the farmers’ bank accounts for the wheat crop arriving in mandis next month.Earlier, the payment was credited into the account of commission agents (arhtiyas), who would further transfer it to the accounts of respective farmers.The protesting farmers said that it was evident from the new provision that the Central Government, through the FCI, wanted to harass them. The farmers claimed that in most of the cases, the land records were not updated. So, it would become impossible for farmers to get payment in time.Harbhajan Singh, union leader, said, “Around 40 percent of farming in the state is tenant farming, therefore, it would be difficult to reach the money in the hands of tenants. Moreover, small farmers don’t have proper land records.”They submitted a memorandum to the Patiala Deputy Commissioner, SDM Patran and Samana addressed to the Prime Minister for immediate withdrawal of the new FCI regulation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-wants-to-harass-us-farmers-227951

The MC wanted to generate Rs5.89 crore from additional excise duty in 2020-21, but managed to generate only Rs3.09 crore by December-end.The MC expected to generate Rs1.40 crore from rent and lease, but may manage only Rs40 lakh by the end of fiscal year. The MC was expected to generate Rs3 lakh in parking fee, but may only generate Rs2.9 lakh by March-end.Against its expected generation of funds of Rs10 crore from building application fee, the MC expects to generate Rs5.99 crore by the end of March. It expects it will be able to collect Rs11 crore under the head in the upcoming fiscal year.The MC has also been unable to generate enough funds from water supply and sewerage fee.Meanwhile, the MC had planned to spend Rs36.19 crore on development works, but managed to spend only Rs3.86 crore by December-end.Officials said they had not generated the expected sum of funds from the property tax head as the local body had earlier decided to waive property tax of around 10,000 commercial units in the city due to the pandemic. The matter is currently pending with the Local Government Department.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-mc-finance-panel-okays-rs-119-cr-budget-for-upcoming-fiscal-227939

All vends have been allotted to the same vendors who had won the bids for allotment during the current fiscal.Though this is in accordance with the state government’s Excise Policy for 2021-22, aimed at renewal of the licences of existing vends, it seems that considering the huge profits netted by the liquor licencees during this financial year, the contractors have agreed to increase liquor sales in order to retain the vends.This year, in spite of a lockdown for almost two-and-a-half months, the licencees have managed to reap in good profits. Though the initial target of excise revenue was Rs 6,250 crore, it was later scaled down to Rs 5.433 crore. Figures available from the Excise Department show that the total excise revenue till February this year is Rs 5,173 crore, with another Rs 1,000 crore to be added for the ongoing month of March, officials in Excise Department said.The policy of licence renewal was there in the previous excise policies too, but licencees would seek renewal of licence for only profitable vends. There would be no takers for the non-profitable vends and the department would have to auction these vends by lowering the licence fee. For the current financial year, too, there were no takers for renewal of licences for40 per cent of vends, which were later auctioned at reduced licence fees, many after the lockdown period ended in May 2020.A Venu Prasad, Financial Commissioner, Excise and Taxation, Punjab, says that licence holders of all 656 groups (group is a single licencing unit) had applied for renewal of the licences, which has been done.“We are looking at a net revenue increase of 15 per cent for the next year, mainly because the department has cracked down on illegal distilleries and plugged smuggling of liquor in Punjab from other states. This has led to increase in sales volumes from the licensed vends, and made these profitable,” he said.A section of liquor contractors, however, say they have been forced to retain the non-profitable vends in order to keep the profitable vends allotted to them in 2020-21, through the renewal policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-auction-of-liquor-vends-this-fiscal-in-punjab-227743

Bank accounts used for money transactions/payments for drug consignments have been frozen.“These pharmaceutical opioids cannot be sold without a valid medical prescription from a registered medical practitioner. Active drug users commonly use these as a substitute for opiods (opium and heroin) due to low cost and over the counter availability. Inappropriately high doses of these intoxicants can produce respiratory depression and circulatory failure leading to drug overdose death. Use of injections include risks of blood borne viral infections like hepatitis and AIDS if injection equipment is shared or used in a non-sterile manner,” Agrawal added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/15-held-with-intoxicants-worth-rs-54-crore-227762

20-03-2021||Chandigarh||High Court: Specify mobile tower safety regulations in residential areas||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has asked the state of Punjab to specify whether safety conditions, such as obtaining no-objection certificate from residents’ welfare associations, have been incorporated in the rules on erecting mobile towers in residential areas.The Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh also directed the submission of an affidavit on the issue by an officer of Additional Chief Secretary’s level. For the purpose, the Bench gave the state three-days time.The Bench has already stayed the installation of towers atop residential buildings in the state, after holding that its slapdash setting up may put the lives and properties of the people in danger.As the case came up for resumed hearing, the Bench asserted the Allahabad High Court had observed in the case of ‘Asha Mishra versus State of UP and seven others’ that the state had framed building byelaws with reference to powers provided under the provisions of the Urban Planning and Development Act.The Bench noticed that the byelaws made it clear that permission was accorded to the service provider only upon submission of the proposed tower’s layout plan prepared by an architect registered with the Council of Architects, along with a structural safety certificate.The service provider was required to obtain an NOC from the residents’ welfare association and the byelaws strictly prohibited the installation of towers on buildings illegally erected or situated in narrow lanes. The byelaws further required the service operator and the landlord of the premises to submit a joint affidavit indemnifying against any human or property loss which may occur.“A query has been put to state counsel whether similar conditions have been incorporated in the rules relating to erecting mobile towers in the residential area. He prays for some time to seek instructions from the department concerned,” the Bench observed.Earlier during the proceedings, senior advocate Chetan Mittal on behalf of a respondent prayed for the vacation of the interim order dated March 3. He submitted that detailed guidelines dated December 7, 2020,had already been framed by the state government in light of the rules issued by the Ministry of Communications (Department of Telecommunications).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-specify-mobile-tower-safety-regulations-in-residential-areas-227771

Indian soldiers are being killed at the borders every day. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin into Punjab via drones every other day. Efforts to create trouble in my state continue to take place. All this should stop first, only then we can talk peace,” Capt Amarinder said.For India to trust Pakistan, the latter will have to do much more than offer an olive branch, said the CM.It is important for not just Bajwa but the entire Pakistan military apparatus to be on board with the idea of burying the past and paving the way for peace with India, he said.“Are they all of the same view as shared by General Bajwa? Are they withdrawing all support to terror groups immediately? Have they asked the ISI to back off and leave India alone?” These, said the CM, were questions that needed to be answered before India could start believing in, and responding to, Pakistan’s overtures of peace. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/walk-the-talk-on-peace-overture-capt-to-pak-army-chief-gen-bajwa-227776

Ideally, these ventilators should have been sent to medical colleges or other centres offering the L-3 care for Covid patients. The L-3 care is offered to patients who require two or more organ support or the mechanical ventilation alone.No trained manpowerSources further revealed that in a recent meeting, Punjab Health Systems Corporation Managing Director Tanu Kashyap had conveyed about the status of ventilators. She said there had been no demand from the state’s medical colleges and other hospitals. Sources revealed that the biggest issue before the medical colleges was the lack of competent manpower to efficiently manage patients on ventilators.Later it was decided the that Principal, Government Medical College, Mohali, and Vice Chancellor Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, Faridkot, Dr Raj Bahadur may be asked to place the demand for ventilators. Tanu Kashyap, Managing Director, Punjab Health Systems Corporation, said they were in the process of allocating the ventilators to state government medical colleges.This was not for the first time when the state hospitals failed to use the ventilators. Five years ago, 10 ventilators were sent to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, but they remained unused for five years. Last year, it became a controversy when amid the Covid breakout it was proposed to hand them over to a local private hospital.Significantly, in the past one year, over 6,000 persons have died due to Covid in the state. In the last one and a half months, around 500 persons in the state have died.

20-03-2021||Patiala||Post jab, infection possible, but less severe: Experts||Amid the growing misconception about the Covid vaccination, health experts have opined post-vaccine the infection is quite possible. However, the vaccination would allay the severity and casualties, said the experts. In the wake of the Covid cases post vaccination, people have raised doubts about the vaccine’s efficacy.Clearing the doubts and misconception, Dr RPS Sibia, Head, Medicine Department, Government Medical College, said: “The vaccine will prevent Covid infection. Covaxin is made of killed coronavirus, while Covishield from a weakened version of the virus. There is no chance of getting positive due to vaccination.”On cases where people have tested positive even after getting vaccinated, Dr Sibia said as the vaccine efficacy was not 100 per cent, chances of infection after the Covid shot were quite there — even after 14 days of second dose.However, Dr Rajesh Bhasker, state nodal officer, claimed the vaccination would fortify the immunity to fight the virus by developing antibodies in the body — only after 14 days of the second dose. “People can get positive after one dose or second dose as it takes 14 days after the second dose for the body to fully develop antibodies. If the said time period is not over, there are chances of getting positive.”Health experts said the vaccination wouldn’t deter the virus from getting into the body rather it would fight off once it was inside the body.Meanwhile, Dr Summet Singh, MD, Community Medicine, said, “Even after getting the vaccine, people shouldn’t lower their guard and should wear face mask and follow Covid protocols. Though virus may not cause symptoms in those who have been vaccinated, they can be carriers of the virus and, they, therefore, can infect other people.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/post-jab-infection-possible-but-less-severe-experts-227715

The protest was led by Bouk Singh and Major Singh, state president and general secretary, respectively of the BKU (Mansa); and Boota Singh, state press secretary, BKU (Kadian). Boota Singh said the unions demanded compensation of Rs 5 lakh and a job to a family member of the deceased farmers and also waiver of the bank loan.He said earlier officials refused to pay heed to their demands, but later the Fazilka SDM assured compensation for the family. After this, the dharna was lifted. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fazilka-farmer-dies-of-heart-attack-at-tikri-227717

20-03-2021||Chandigarh||After calling on Capt Amarinder, Navjot Sidhu meets Priyanka Gandhi||A few days after meeting Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, former Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu today met Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi in Delhi. However, it could not be confirmed whether he met party president Sonia Gandhi.Sidhu’s meeting with Priyanka comes in the backdrop of the MLA seeking time from the Chief Minister before rejoining the Cabinet. Only yesterday, the Chief Minister had said everyone in the government wanted him to be part of the team. “I hope he decides on joining back soon. Before that he has sought some time,” Captain Amarinder said.Sources said the Congress top leadership was keen that Sidhu returns to the mainstream politics ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls, giving push to the party’s prospects in forming the government again. Punjab affairs in charge and AICC general secretary Harish Rawat, who has been instrumental in breaking the ice between Captain Amarinder and Sidhu, reached the city late in the evening.Rawat is expected to call on the CM tomorrow, before he meets Sidhu. It is learnt that Rawat has been making efforts in consultation with the “Chief Minister to give at least two portfolios that match his (Sidhu) expectations.”“If the latter settles for the same position at which he left, he would try to seek an assurance from the central party leadership regarding better post in the party or government after the Assembly polls,” said a senior leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-calling-on-capt-amarinder-navjot-sidhu-meets-priyanka-gandhi-227719

20-03-2021||---||Back your rhetoric on peace with solid action: Capt Amarinder to Pak Army Chief Bajwa||Chandigarh, March 19Reacting to Pakistan Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s remarks that it was time for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said he should back his rhetoric on peace with solid action.Bajwa’s statement had come on Thursday, a day after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan made similar overtures following an unexpected ceasefire announcement by the militaries of the two countries weeks ago. Addressing a session of the first-ever Islamabad Security Dialogue, General Bajwa had said the potential for regional peace and development always remained hostage to the issues between Pakistan and India—the two “nuclear-armed neighbours”.Terming the Islamabad-sponsored terrorism as “the biggest hurdle to normalising relations between the two nations”, Amarinder said Bajwa should first control his ISI and then talk about stability in the India-Pakistan relations.General Bajwa “should back his rhetoric on peace with solid action”, the CM said in a statement, adding that India cannot afford to go soft with Pakistan “till they walk the talk and prove their sincerity with concrete actions”.“Infiltration into India from across the border is still happening, Indian soldiers are being killed at the borders every day. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin into Punjab via drones every other day.“Efforts to create trouble in my state continue to take place. All this should stop first, only then we can talk peace,” the Punjab CM said.“For India to trust Pakistan, the latter will have to do much more than offer an olive branch,” said the Chief Minister, citing his own experience of 1964 as ADC to the General Officer Commanding-in-C, Western Command.“We used to receive daily reports of firing and trouble from the western border as we continue to do now,” said Amarinder Singh.It is important for not just Bajwa but the entire Pakistan military apparatus to be on board with the idea of burying the past and paving the way for peace with India, said Amarinder on Friday, adding that it is not New Delhi but Islamabad which has obstructed the path of peace between the two countries.“Are they all of the same view as shared by General Bajwa? Are they withdrawing all support to terror groups immediately? Have they asked the ISI to back off and leave India alone,” asked the Chief Minister.“India is all for peace, all Indians stand for peace, but India cannot compromise on its security and integrity,” he stressed, adding that peace cannot be conditional.Given the way the situation has evolved over the past few months, Pakistan’s increasing collusion with China, which has been causing a whole lot of trouble for India on the other border, is a matter of concern, the Chief Minister said.“If Islamabad seriously wants peace with New Delhi, they should send out the message to Beijing, loud and clear, that Pakistan is not with them in the dangerous escapades at the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/back-your-rhetoric-on-peace-with-solid-action-capt-amarinder-to-pak-army-chief-bajwa-227614
20-03-2021||---||Punjab bans social gatherings in 11 worst-affected districts; educational institutes closed till March 31||Chandigarh, March 19Clamping down heavily on the fresh Covid surge, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday ordered massive state-wide restrictions beginning Saturday, with closure of educational institutes till March 31 and restrictions on cinema/mall capacities.All educational institutes, other than medical and nursing colleges, will remain closed till March 31, with restriction of 50 per cent capacity in cinema halls and not more than 100 people in a mall at any time.32 more die in Punjab as nation sees around 40,000 new Covid casesThe CM appealed to people to keep social activity in their houses to the bare minimum for the next two weeks to break the transmission chain. Not more than 10 visitors should be entertained in homes, he urged.In the 11 worst-hit districts, a complete ban has been ordered on all social gatherings and related functions, except for funerals/cremations/weddings, which will be allowed with only 20 people in attendance. This will be enforced from Sunday.In these districts, which will remain under night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am, the Chief Minister has ordered cinemas, multiplexes, restaurants and malls to remain closed on Sundays, though home deliveries will be allowed subject to night curfew. Industries and essential services will be allowed to function, but barring these, all restrictions will be strictly enforced, the Chief Minister directed the top civic and police officials in these districts.Night curfew extended by 2 hrs in nine Punjab districtsAlso, starting next week, one hour of silence will be observed across the state every Saturday, from 11 am to noon, in memory of those who lost their lives to Covid, with no vehicle to ply at this time. The Chief Minister asked the district administration to involve the general public, along with market committees and sarpanches, in this initiative, which will, however, remain voluntary for them.In the 11 worst-affected districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Mohali, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar and Moga, the Chief Minister ordered restrictions on in-person public dealings in government offices, with citizens to be encouraged to visit offices only for essential services.Amarinder directed officials to encourage online and virtual modes for grievance redressal, and asked departments concerned to issue necessary instructions for limiting appointments per day for registries, etc.Though other districts will not be placed under such stringent restrictions for now, the Chief Minister ordered immediate reinforcement and strict monitoring of the strategy of micro-containment and containment zones where there are evident clusters. He made it clear that if necessary, strict curbs would also be imposed in other districts if the situation worsens and Covid protocols and norms are not adhered to.Sukhbir tests positive, Akalis cancel rallies till March 31The situation would be reviewed after two weeks, said the Chief Minister, chairing a meeting of the Covid Task Force with top officials.Directing health officials to ramp up testing per day to 35,000, the Chief Minister said special focus should be on super spreaders, and government employees, teachers in educational institutions, etc must be tested routinely. RAT testing should be stepped up along with RTPCR testing, he ordered, while directing contact tracing and contact testing to be taken up to 30 per positive person. The CPTOs must personally monitor this task, he said.The Chief Minister also directed the Department of Medical Education and Research to immediately complete recruitment of specialists/super-specialists.Amarinder said well-functioning hospitals, where serious cases are best handled, had been advised to restore the Covid beds and postpone elective surgeries.The names of the COVID monitors, who are appointed at every establishment and office - the names, should be available with the district administration, along with their numbers, said the Chief Minister. They would be responsible for ensuring following of COVID-appropriate behaviour at their organisations, he said, adding that the Departments of Labour; Excise and Taxation, among others, must assist the Deputy Commissioners in enforcing these instructions.Dr KK Talwar, who heads the state government’s expert team on Covid, said the surge in cases appeared to be the result of opening of schools and colleges, with young asymptomatic people appearing to be spreading the virus. There was no evidence as of now to show that the spike was due to the mutants, as only two cases of new strains had been found in Punjab so far. The state currently has almost 40 per cent cases from under-30 population, he added.Procurement put off to April 10 In view of the Covid spike in the state, the Punjab government will kick-start the procurement operations from April 10 this year.The decision to delay the procurement was taken at a Covid review meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told the meeting that the department needed more time to make arrangements to ensure safe procurement amid the surge in Covid cases.Pvt, govt hospitals told to vaccinate 7 days a weekTaking note of the low vaccination numbers in the state, Amarinder asked all private and government hospitals and health facilities to offer hassle-free vaccination services for at least eight hours daily, seven days a week, till March 31. There should be no requirement of a separate certificate if an eligible 45-plus person brings the medical record regarding co-morbidities, he said.The CM pointed out with concern that of the 1,291 registered private facilities, 891 had reportedly not administered a single dose. He asked the district administration to come down strictly on such hospitals, stressing that private hospitals needed to join the government battle against Covid for the survival of the state and its people. Rates to take the vaccine in private health-care institutions must be publicised and overcharging should not be permitted, he directed the Health Department.State Congress puts all rallies on hold Punjab Congress will not hold any political gatherings for the next two weeks in view of the spike in Covid cases in the state. This was announced by Amarinder Singh at the review meeting on the Covid situation.Amarinder also appealed to other political parties and their leaders to keep their gatherings within the prescribed numbers, that is 50 per cent of capacity, subject to maximum of 100 in closed and 200 in open spaces. No political gatherings should take place in the most affected districts, he said.Underlining the need for strict enforcement, the Chief Minister ordered compulsory enforcement of wearing of face masks in the state. He directed the police and health authorities to take all those moving around and loitering in public areas, and on the roads and streets, without face masks, to the nearest RT-PCR Testing Facility for taking nasopharyngeal swabs to ensure that they are not asymptomatic Covid cases.He asked the Amritsar DC to talk to the SGPC and management of Durgiana temple to encourage devotees to wear masks inside the shrines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-bans-social-gatherings-in-11-worst-affected-districts-educational-institutes-closed-till-march-31-227555
20-03-2021||New Delhi||Booker finalist Sahota pens multigenerational saga; takes readers to 1920s rural Punjab||2015 Booker Prize nominee Sunjeev Sahota takes back readers to rural Punjab of the 1920s in his new novel, which is about two characters separated by more than half a century but united by blood."China Room", inspired in part by the author's own family history, will be published by Penguin Random House India in May.Sahota, author of "Ours Are the Streets" and "The Year of the Runaways", which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Dylan Thomas Prize, says he is delighted that his new novel is with Penguin Random House India.Commenting on the novel, Meru Gokhale, publisher, Penguin Press, Penguin Random House India, says it is one of those books that "stays with you long after you've put it down. Set in rural Punjab, spanning across generations, this story is full of moments of pain that are carefully layered within the plot - the pain of what it was like to be a woman in the 1920s, forbidden to love, and the pain of a young man today who has lost his identity." One of the characters Mehar, a young bride in rural Punjab of 1929, is trying to discover the identity of her new husband.Married to three brothers in a single ceremony, she and her now-sisters spend their days hard at work in the family's 'china room', sequestered from contact with the men - except when their domineering mother-in-law, Mai, summons them to a darkened chamber at night.Curious and strong-willed, Mehar tries to piece together what Mai doesn't want her to know. From beneath her veil, she studies the sounds of the men's voices and the calluses on their fingers as she serves them tea.Soon, she glimpses something that seems to confirm which of the brothers is her husband. A series of events is set in motion, which will put more than one life at risk. As the early stirrings of the Indian independence movement rise around her, Mehar must weigh her own desires against the reality - and danger - of her situation.Spiralling around Mehar's story is that of a young man who arrives at his uncle's house in Punjab in the summer of 1999, hoping to shake off an addiction that has held him in its grip for more than two years.Growing up in small-town England as the son of an immigrant shopkeeper, his experiences of racism, violence and estrangement from the culture of his birth led him to seek a dangerous form of escape.As he rides out his withdrawal at his family's ancestral home - an abandoned farmstead, its china room mysteriously locked and barred - he begins to knit himself back together, gathering strength for the journey home.
