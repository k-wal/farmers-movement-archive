The State can always assume the role of the victim and the society at large, Mehta submitted.Mehta said that Ansari had flouted the jail manual rules and right of the victim and the State at large cannot be overlooked and the accused cannot be allowed to jettison the fair trial.“Mukhtar Ansari is being vociferously defended by Punjab. He is enjoying (life) in Punjab jail. Serious cases of murder and other offences are being held up (in Uttar Pradesh). The state (of Punjab) is supporting a gangster,” Mehta had earlier told the Bench.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Ansari, said he was being targeted for political reasons.“My co-accused was encountered. Uttar Pradesh has an axe to grind against Punjab and the Court should not allow the shoulders of the Supreme Court to be used to fire a gun. This should not be allowed”, Rohatgi said, seeking transfer of cases outside Uttar Pradesh.On behalf of Punjab Government, senior advocate Dushyant Dave contended that criminal proceedings against Ansari had been going on in UP for past 14-15 years and the Yogi Government’s plea wasn’t maintainable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-reserves-order-on-ups-plea-to-shift-mukhtar-ansari-from-punjab-220509

Harish Dhuri, Pardeep Kaler and Sandeep Bareta, all central committee members of the dera, have been booked under Section 174-A on the directions of a judicial court here.All these office-bearers in the dera are accused in connection with the theft of ‘bir’ of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015.As per the investigation by the Special Investigation Team of police, probing the sacrilege cases, the accused along with dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim were allegedly part of conspiracy in the theft of the ‘bir’, which led to Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing incidents.In January this year, the court had declared all these accused proclaimed offenders (PO) in the sacrilege case.As they have failed in appearing before the court in response to a proclamation under Section 82 of Act 2, so the court directed the police to book them under Section 174-A of IPC.The court has also directed the police to procure the list of all properties in the name of these accused so that these properties could be attached to procure their appearance before the court.To procure their appearance before the court, the police had earlier pasted the copies of proclamation of the accused at the bus stand and Satnam Shah Chowk in Sirsa. However, they did not appear before the court.The SIT claimed to have conducted searches in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan to nab the accused but without success.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2015-bir-theft-case-3-dera-followers-booked-on-court-orders-220491

The victims escaped but were chased and attacked again, the channel said.The attack left the car with more than 10,000 Australian dollars in damages, with a windscreen smashed in multiple places and also deep gouges into the car’s panelling, it added.“What’s concerning though is that these men alleged they were targeted because of their beliefs,” the channel said.Hate crime against Sikhs in Sydney. A group of Sikhs claim that they were attacked by thugs because they were wearing turbans. The victims escaped but were chased and attacked again. pic.twitter.com/blBtXFBdY0  According to the channel, increased police patrols and threats of deportation are on the table as authorities work to stamp out fighting between Indian groups on the streets of Sydney.“Disagreements over farming laws in India have seen a rising violence here with one side now claiming they were targeted by a gang wielding bats and hammers,” the channel said.Last month, the Ministry of External Affairs said that the agri laws were passed by India’s Parliament after debate and discussion and were aimed at reforming the country’s agriculture sector.“The Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector. These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming.“A very small section of farmers in parts of India have some reservations about these reforms. Respecting the sentiments of the protestors, the Government of India has initiated a series of talks with their representatives,” the statement said.The statement noted that it was unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them.“Some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India,” the MEA statement said.In part of Sydney’s Sikh community, there has been growing tensions, and fights between them and the Indian government supporters over the farming laws back home, according to the media report.“It is racial profiling…There has been lately a lot of this stuff, pro-government supporters targeting our community,” said Amar Singh, from Turbans 4 Australia.Police have been holding meetings with community leaders calling for calm while exact motives behind this latest violence are being investigated, the report said.Police are investigating whether the incident was a result of racial and political tension. They are still trying to identify those men involved and are asking for anyone who might have information to come forward, the report added.“We are coming down hard to make sure there is no further violence,” Assistant Police Commissioner Peter Thurtell said.“It is a small minority. But my message to them is under no circumstances will the NSW Police tolerate it,” Thurtell added.The Australian Alliance Against Hate and Violence held a press conference outside the Consul General of India this week and offered support for the agitating farmers in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sikhs-targeted-in-sydney-amid-growing-disagreement-within-indian-community-over-farming-laws-report-220435

Khanna||Akali MLAs ride to Punjab Assembly on bullock carts||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 4MLAs of the AAP on Thursday staged a walkout from the Punjab Assembly over alleged withholding of implementation of 85th amendment of the Constitution, by the bureaucrats.They protested in the Well of the House and raised slogans.The issue was raised by Akali Dal MLA Baldev Singh.Earlier,  MLAs of the Akali Dal rode to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha in bullock carts. This was in protest against the high taxes on petrol and diesel.Dhillon while speaking on this issue said the SAD was ready to join the state government and approach the Centre to reduce the prices of petroleum products.“We are even ready to go to Delhi and hold a protest on this issue. However, before this is done the Congress government must come to the aid of farmers and the common man by reducing VAT on petrol and diesel”. He said the VAT of 27.5 per cent of petrol and 17.5 per cent on diesel was amongst the highest in the country.Bikram Singh Majithia told the press that it was finance minister Manpreet Badal and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s responsibility to reduce the steep VAT being imposed on petroleum products in Punjab. He said instead of doing this the Congress government was playing a fixed match with the centre as each hike in prices of petroleum products resulted in a similar hike in VAT.“Instead of tackling this issue, the state government is trying to shift its responsibility to the Centre,” he added.Meanwhile, the opposition on Wednesday dubbed the Governor's address in the Punjab assembly as a "bundle of lies" and attacked the Congress-led government over its alleged unfulfilled poll promises.Participating in the discussion on the Governor's address on the third day of the Budget Session of the Punjab Assembly here, legislators of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lambasted the Amarinder Singh-led regime for “not fulfilling” poll promises like debt waiver, elimination of drug menace, jobs for each household and cheaper power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akali-mlas-ride-to-punjab-assembly-on-bullock-carts-220410

This order is being passed in view of the fact that installation of towers in a haphazard manner may endanger lives and property of the people and would violate their rights under Article 21 of the Constitution,” said the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh. Taking on record certain photographs, the Bench also issued a notice of motion to the state and other respondents asking them to make it clear whether a uniform policy was being adopted across the state or stand-alone instructions had been given for a particular place.“Due to wind velocity at times, there can be a danger of the tower being dislocated, thus endangering the lives of people,” the Bench said.The directions came on a petition filed by Simarjeet Singh. Adjourning the matter for about a week, the Bench said the larger question before the court was as regards installation of towers on residential building.The directions came eight years after a Division Bench of the HC in another matter asked the state to direct all municipal councils, corporations, etc., to make inoperative phone towers functioning from residential areas without following due norms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-mobile-towers-atop-houses-in-punjab-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-220330

Even the BJP also accused CM Capt Amarinder Singh of patronising gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari.Raising the issue during Zero Hour, he alleged that the government was even spending crores to prevent his transfer to Uttar Pradesh to answer for heinous crimes.Asking the government to explain the purpose of keeping Ansari in jail, Majithia said it was hand in glove with the criminal to ensure he was not transferred to UP. He said Ansari was arrested and brought to Punjab on the basis of a vague complaint against “one Ansari” which was registered at the Mataur police station in Mohali on January 7, 2019. He said following this the State police moved with lightning speed to register a case against him on January 8, get a production warrant issued against him on January 12, arrest him on January 21 and present him in court on January 22.He said immediately afterwards when Ansari was sent to judicial custody the government got into reverse gear. “A challan was not presented in the case for 60 days which could have resulted in an automatic bail for Ansari, but the latter did not apply for it,” he alleged. BJP general secretary Tarun Chugh, too, accused the government of patronising Ansari to evade appearance in UP. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-bjp-question-gangster-mukhtar-ansaris-overstay-220211

04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Amid comeback talks, Navjot Sidhu’s veiled attacks shock Congress||As the Congress leadership, including Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat, pushes for former Cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s re-induction into the Cabinet and giving portfolios of his choice, the cricketer-turned-politician upping his ante against the state party leadership during the ongoing Budget session has surprised many. Sidhu has been attending the session daily but is keeping a low profile.Sidhu’s diatribe comes days after Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh questioned the CM over the performance of the Congress government. In political circles, it is being seen as a signal of defiance to the Chief Minister, as he was in no mood to rejoin the Cabinet.In what appears to be a veiled attack on the state party leadership, Sidhu posted on Twitter on Wednesday, “Jis jung mai badshah ki jan ko khatra na ho, ushe jung nahi rajneeti kehte hain.” Without defining who the ‘badshah’ is, Sidhu has left to people to guess. Yesterday he had tweeted, “Yeh duniya hai janab, mehfil main badnam aur akele main salaam karti hai.”Yesterday, Sidhu, on his YouTube channel ‘Jittega Punjab’, said there was a need to come back on people’s agenda. He said there was no time for political blame game and diverting attention from real issues.Hinting out at his detractors, “I am against nobody. I am on Punjab’s side. There needs to be clarity on policy, intention and justice,” he said. In the video on “My stand on budget’, Sidhu maintained that state’s income was going into private pockets.Without naming anyone, Sidhu is heard saying that public money was being pocketed through frontmen, who were being controlled by someone.

Even if they were to order these blending machines now, it would take several weeks before the machines can be procured and used by the units. “Across the country, there are just 14 units that can make fortified rice, and their combined daily production capacity is around 50 tonnes. These units already have pre-orders from other states and won’t be able to take fresh orders from Punjab. Even if we were to hire their services, we won’t be able to deliver the quantity demanded by the FCI immediately,” said a miller from Muktsar, requesting anonymity.The order by the FCI to the Food and Civil Supplies Department came in January-end. It may be mentioned that fortified rice is prepared by blending one per cent crushed rice with vitamins and minerals in the CMR. The cost of installing the blenders is between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore.A letter demanding more time (15 days) for making arrangements to make fortified rice was sent by KAP Sinha, Principal Secretary, Food and Supplies Department, to the Chairman of the FCI, wherein he has said that millers in Punjab be allowed to blend the vitamins and minerals manually in the CMR till the mechanised blenders were installed in the mills.State seeks timeA letter demanding more time (15 days) for making arrangements to make fortified rice was sent by KAP Sinha, Principal Secretary, Food and Supplies Department, to the Chairman of the FCI, wherein he has said that millers in Punjab be allowed to blend the vitamins and minerals manually in the CMR till the mechanised blenders were installed in the mills.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fci-changes-policy-4-500-state-mills-halt-rice-shelling-220220

The police today nabbed the mother of two and her lover on the charge of murder.Patiala SSP Vikramjeet Duggal said Manjit Kaur and her paramour Baljit Singh hatched a conspiracy to kill the two children as they felt they might come in the way of their marriage in future.“Baljit Singh took the children along on the pretext of a joyride and showing them the canal waters, where the kids would play and enjoy. As they reached the banks of the canal, Baljit pushed them into the canal,” said Duggal.In July 2019, the disappearance of two siblings from Kheri Gandian village of Ghanaur block in the district had led to huge protests against the police. The infamous case hogged limelight in 2019 when brothers Hasandeep and Jashandeep, aged six and 10, respectively, went missing and later, their bodies were recovered from the Sarala head of Bhakra canal, but the family did not identify the bodies.Insiders said clinching evidence was found in which Baljit, who was working at his shop, received a phone call spanning a few seconds just half hour before the murders.

04-03-2021||Saurabh Malik||‘No My Lord,’ says Justice Tyagi||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 3“No My Lord,” says Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi. The Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge has requested the advocates not to address him as “Your Lordship” or “My Lord”.A note in the list of urgent or fresh cases to be heard by Justice Tyagi makes it clear that he wants the advocates to dispense with the archaic system of addressing judges. The note says: “It is for the information of respected members of the Bar that hon’ble Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi has requested that they may avoid addressing him as ‘Your Lordship’ or ‘My Lord’ and also saying obliged and grateful.”“What else can be a better indicator of equality before the law,” says a former Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge in context of Justice Tyagi’s request to become independent from the colonial legacy so deeply engrained in the Indian justice delivery mechanism. Read also: Don’t call us ‘Your Honour’, it’s not US Supreme Court, SC tells law studentTo address or not to address the Judges as “My Lords” has always been a contentious question among the advocates. Describing it as a relic of the Raj, some lawyers have all along been arguing that “My Lord” is an expression of submission. They have, rather, been demanding that the Judges should honour the mandate of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India by doing away to with the colonial practice of addressing the Judges as “My Lord” or “Your Lordship”.Available information suggests the then Chief Justice of India, Justice H L Dattu, in 2014 had made it clear that addressing the Judges as “Your Lordship” was it not mandatory. “When did we say it is compulsory? You can only call us in a dignified manner...Don’t address us as ‘lordship’. We don’t say anything. We only say address us respectfully,” Justice Dattu had asserted.Even before that, the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association passed a resolution to address the Judges as “Sir” instead of “My Lord”. The Association, in April 2011, had unanimously resolved “to drop the long pending symbol of slavery of the British Rule and colonial legacy to address the honorable Judges as My Lord, or My Lordship or Your Lord or Your Lordship”. It was also resolves to address the Judges “in accordance with the values of our Republican Constitution as Sir”.The members were also asked to comply with the resolution in letter and spirit and were warned of “strict action” in case of non-compliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-my-lord-says-justice-tyagi-220083
