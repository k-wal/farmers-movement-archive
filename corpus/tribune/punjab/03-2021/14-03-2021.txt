14-03-2021||Chandigarh||This officer croons with policing in Punjab||He's a young Punjab Police officer with a literary mind.He's penning poems, songs and books to create social awakening, besides equipping people with the skills to become the cyber defenders.He is 31-year-old Gurjot Kaler, Superintendent of Police (Traffic and Cyber Crime), posted in Mohali near here.After the success of music tracks 'My Hero Farmer' and 'Dil Se Salaam', Kaler on this International Women's Day, March 8, released two social poems, 'Kahan gaya woh desh  mera' and 'Betiyan', written by his mother Param Preet Ghuman."Of all things, policing is a profession. My other works—whether it's music or sports or literary works—all that is passion. So mixing profession with passion  is not very difficult, if one manages time very efficiently," Kaler told IANS on Sunday."I do policing in the daytime and when I come back home and take out one or two hours and try to do some of my own stuff, which I like and which makes me feel good. So that is how the journey has been. I think that is not very difficult to mix literary work with policing," an optimistic cop said."If you see life, one shouldn't construct compartments. Life is not about constructing the compartments. It is about taking a holistic approach in life. So it is a journey,  one should enjoy every flavour of life and this is very important," he said."Being a singer helps tackling stressful situations while in khaki," Kaler added.In March 2017, Kaler, who has previously worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, made his music debut with 'My Hero Farmer', which depicted the harsh realities of farmers' suicides in India, was well received.The English track, 'My Hero Farmer' was released on the channel PTC and was also featured at the Sikh Lens Film Festival in California.In August 2019, his second song, 'Dil Se Salaam' was released by Times Music, under the label of Speed Records.The Hindi track 'Dil Se Salaam' was a tribute to the soldiers and it was written and sung by Gurjot himself while the music was given by Jaison Thind.His third single track titled 'Bandeya' was released in August 2020 by Times Music and Speed Records.This Punjabi track was composed by B. Praak with lyrics penned by Jaani and the video was directed by Arvindr Khaira.Kaler, who has been honoured thrice with the Director-General of Police Commendation Discs by Punjab Police, has also released innumerable poems on social media like 'This happens with every girl—ME TOO' where he has talked about the sexual harassment to women at the workplace.Apart from this, he has released a poem called 'Divey Muhabaatan De' to bolster and signify the importance of the bond of love, peace and friendship between India and  Pakistan.Recently, he has released awareness campaigns on social media about cybercrime like ATM thefts, cloning of sim cards, e-frauds, OTP scams, etc., to generate social  consciousness about these important things in society.His maiden book, 'New India—The Reality Reloaded', was released in 2018, and it dealt with various concerns, conflicts, and challenges faced by India in the 21st century.Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Kaler undertook a peaceful march along with various Indians at the Trafalgar Square in Central London in June last to protest against the statues of racial discrimination of Henry Havelock and Robert Clive, who had committed atrocities against the Indians during the colonial rule.A written petition was also filed with the British government to ask for the legal removal of these statutes which symbolised racial prejudices and colonial mindsets.In September 2020, he performed a 15,000 feet skydive at Nottingham in Britain to offer a symbolic salute to the corona warriors of the Punjab Police.With this, he became the first officer in the Punjab Police to undertake an official skydive. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/this-officer-croons-with-policing-in-punjab-225111

14-03-2021||Lt Col Dilbag Singh Dabas (retd)||3 MVCs for Dera Baba Nanak battle in 1971||The community hall in Beri village in present-day Jhajjar district of Haryana has an old black marble stone on which are engraved in golden letters the names of the bravehearts from the villages around who laid down their lives in the service of the nation during World War I and II. A close look at the long list reveals that Gochhi village has the maximum number of names. It also has the maximum number of families with a military background, some even going back to five generations.Captain Devinder Singh Ahlawat was a third generation soldier; his grandfather fought in World War I and his father was part of live action in World War II and also during India’s wars in 1947-48, and 1962. Devinder, son of Lieutenant Colonel Subha Chand Ahlawat, was born on July 4, 1947 at Gochhi village in Rohtak district of then undivided Punjab.After a year in Government College, Rohtak, he joined the National Defence Academy and was commissioned into 10th Battalion of The Dogra Infantry Regiment on December 15, 1967. The battalion was raised by Lt Col Kapur Singh Ahlawat on June 1, 1966.Dogras have throughout outperformed themselves in all the wars fought since World War I, but a battalion earning two Maha Vir Chakras within just about five years of its raising speaks volumes of the training, commitment and dedication of its men and officers. 10 Dogra is proudly referred to as ‘Terrific Tenth’.While raising 10 Dogra, Lt Col Ahlawat, also incidentally from Gochhi, never imagined that his own bhatija (nephew) would join it and make his battalion proud.The India-Pakistan border in Punjab generally follows the Ravi river between Gurdaspur and Attari and Sutlej between Ferozepur and Fazilka. There are three bridges over these two rivers at Dera Baba Nanak (DBN), Hussainiwala and Sulemanke. Of these, the bridges at DBN and Sulemanke were under Pakistani control. The areas east of these two bridges gave the Pakistan army readymade bridgeheads where from it could launch its strike formations across the border into Indian territory.It was necessary to eliminate the Pakistani enclaves at DBN and Sulemanke to prevent Pakistan from using them as launch pads for any offensive. 10 Dogra and 71 Armoured Regiment were tasked to capture the east-end of DBN bridge near the enclave, which was heavily fortified by the enemy with concrete pillboxes and bunkers.In the first phase, ‘Alpha’ and ‘Bravo’ companies of 10 Dogra were to capture the depth bundh, bundh junction and river bundh. In the next phase, ‘Delta’ company commanded by Major Inder Singh and ‘Charlie’ company by Devinder Ahlawat, now a Captain, were tasked to capture the link bundh, rail bundh and road bundh.The companies made steady progress in decimating the Pakistanis and clearing the bundhs allotted to them. Devinder’s company was to follow ‘Bravo’ and clear the most formidable link bundh in the second phase. And the intrepid Ahlawat led his company from the front and cleared the supposedly impregnable bundh which cost him his life, but for the ultimate cause and in the best traditions of the Indian Army. The grateful nation recognised the conspicuous bravery of Captain Devinder Singh Ahlawat and awarded him the Maha Vir Chakra, posthumously. The battle account reads:“During the 1971 India-Pakistan war, 10 Dogra was tasked to capture Dera Baba Nanak bridgehead on the night of December 5/6. As per the battalion attack plan, ‘C’ company led by Captain Devinder Singh Ahlawat was to capture east-end of the bridge on which the enemy defences were based on a series of concrete embankments with anti-tank guns and heavy automatic weapons. The company, led by Captain Ahlawat, came under heavy machine gun fire from a concrete pillbox. With complete disregard to his life, Captain Ahlawat charged onto the pillbox, grabbed the burning hot machine gun barrel with his right hand and threw a grenade into the pillbox with his left, killing the firing crew, thus making it possible to continue the momentum of the attack and capture of the objective soon thereafter. In this action, Captain Ahlawat lost his life and his body was found with six bullet wounds on his chest, and his hand still clutching the machine-gun barrel.”Captain Devinder Singh Ahlawat met his date with fate unmarried but not unsung — the black marble sacred stone in Beri Community Hall has his name, too, engraved in golden letters. In his honour, the Army Welfare Housing Complex in Sector 56 in Gurugram, is also named after this braveheart.From the battle for Dera Baba Nanak emerged two more Maha Virs: Lieutenant Colonel Narinder Singh Sandhu, Commanding Officer of 10 Dogra, and Brigadier K Gowrishankar, Commander of 86 Infantry Brigade.Having taken over 10 Dogra just a few months before the war, Lt Col Sandhu, an alumnus of Khalsa College, Amritsar, for his dynamic leadership and bold execution of the attack plan, was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. The battle account reads:“On December 5, 1971, 86 Infantry Brigade Group was ordered to eliminate the Pakistan bridgehead across river Ravi, north of Dera Baba Nanak. The area consisted of a series of embankments defended by an elaborate system of concrete defence works housing machine guns, anti-tank weapons and other small arms. 10 Dogra battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Narinder Singh Sandhu, was allotted the task of capturing the east-end of the bridgehead, which was the hub of the enemy defences in the area. Lieutenant Colonel Sandhu led his battalion most skillfully when the men fought from bunker to bunker to capture the objective. In the bitter fighting, he was seriously wounded in his leg; however, with complete disregard to his own safety, he continued to lead his men with cool courage and determination. His exemplary conduct and inspiring leadership so enthused his men that the vital objective was captured with minimum casualties to the battalion.”The conspicuous courage and outstanding leadership of Brigadier Krishnaswamy Gowrishankar, Commander of 86 Infantry Brigade, originally from Corps of Signals, too, did not go unnoticed. For his boldness and originality in planning and execution of the offensive, he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-mvcs-for-dera-baba-nanak-battle-in-1971-224925

The helmet has two bullet marks slightly on its left side. It perhaps were these marks, which led to his killing in the Indo-China war.The ex-serviceman discloses as to how he collected it and what makes it so special for him. “The Indian Army deputed me at Dhola post in Arunachal Pradesh in 1986. Dhola post was a border post set up by the Indian Army in June 1962, in the Namka Chu river valley area disputed by China and India. During the Sino-Indian war, Chinese troops attacked the Indian side. Many Indian soldiers lost their lives. So, 24 years later when Army sent me to this posting, I realised that the bodies of many soldiers could not even reach homes and we could seldom spot their skeletal remains. There during a routine recce, I found this helmet with a part of the skull in it and I picked it,” said Maj Gen Balwinder.“I went on moving with this helmet to all my postings. I have always kept it with me and displayed it well wherever I got posted. After my retirement, this was one thing that I brought back home, maybe out of respect for that soldier who died fighting on the front. This remembrance of the ‘unknown soldier’ has become my biggest prized possession,” he concluded, pointing to the black special memoir which he has got nicely juxtaposed on a black oval background on the front elevation of his house.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/soldiers-bullet-pierced-helmet-is-his-prized-possession-224899

Masons and labourers can be seen working at various spots on the roadside building permanent structures.“We are staying at the Delhi borders for the past over 100 days, but the Central Government does not want to pay heed to our demand of repealing the three farm laws. That’s why we have decided to construct special structures and have also brought solar panels. We are ready to stay here for a long time,” said Gurpreet Singh Sahabana, a farmer leader from Ludhiana.“We have constructed a permanent structure for our union office and are ready to fight till our last breath. We will go back only after winning the fight,” said Gian Singh Mand, block president of the BKU (Lakhowal), Ludhiana.“The farmers have no option but to build concrete structures to stay for a long fight and save our protesting brethren from the summer,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of the BKU (Lakhowal)“We are prepared for a long haul and will not go back till the government repeals the laws. We have come at the Centre’s door to save our land and our future generations,” he said.“Not only permanent structures, but we have also installed solar panels. We are also constructing offices at the site,” he added.Anand Sharma, Project Director, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), in a complaint to the police, said that constructions were underway along the NH-44. “Unidentified people have erected illegal structures along the NH-44 in front of Malwa Motors.

Researchers have created a name for this common condition — Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).Dr Parul Gupta, an ophthalmologist from Bathinda, said, “There has been a hike in the number patients, who are working professionals, complaining of dry eyes and blurred vision”.The overexposure to screen had increased during the pandemic, leading to dryness and stinging sensation in eyes, and pain in neck, back and shoulders, she said.As per doctors, watching programmes on OTT platforms for a long duration on mobile phones or TVs, could also cause eye problems.Dr Parul said, “For working professionals, it is important to follow ‘20-20-20 rule’ to prevent them from staring at their computer screen for long. Take a 20-second break from your computer or any other device after 20 minutes and look at something 20 feet away.”Health expert Dr Vitul K Gupta said, “Living in the modern digital world, mankind is confronted with new health challenge — ‘21st century epidemic’ — stealthily destroying relationships, increasing mental disorders, making people impulsive.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/excess-screen-time-taking-toll-on-eyes-224778

14-03-2021||---||SKM’s Balbir Singh Rajewal says PM Modi bigger threat to India than Pakistan||New Delhi, March 13The farmers’ agitation that began with an apolitical agenda, one to get the three farm laws repealed, has turned "political" with senior most leader of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) Balbir Singh Rajewal targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Rajewal, the most respected face of the SKM, the umbrella unit of over 40 Kisan Unions, has kicked off a political storm after saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a bigger threat to India than Pakistan.Rajewal, who was addressing a gathering at Nandigram, which will see a pitched battle between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and former TMC MLA and now BJP’s firebrand leader Suvendu Mukherjee, also asked the voters to vote for anyone but the Bharatiya Janata Party.“BJP only knows vote ki Rajniti. You possess a great weapon called a vote. Please don’t give that vote to Modi. Give your vote to anyone, rather give it to a winning candidate but please don’t vote for Modi,” 77-year-old said addressing the Kisan Mahapanchayat in Nandigram on Saturday.“Modi is the biggest threat to our country. We are not threatened by Pakistan or any other country. But Modi is our biggest threat,” he added.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had also requested the voters to not vote for the BJP ahead of the SKM’s three-day campaign in West Bengal. Ironically, Tikait’s faction is called BKU (Arajnaitik).Rajewal also touched the topic of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) from the same stage. “There is another issue of the EVM. We are thinking of doing something about it once the Kisan Andolan gets over,” he added.Rajewal’s outburst is part of the anti-BJP campaign currently being undertaken by the SKM in poll-bound states. On Friday, the SKM had issued an open letter to the farmers and citizens of West Bengal asking them to teach ‘arrogant government’ a lesson.Yogendra Yadav read the open letter that would be circulated in all of the 294 constituencies in West Bengal.“…The BJP government without consulting the farmers brought the three laws which will not only destroy our produce but also our next generations. They called us brokers, anti-nationals and even terrorists. We were peppered with water cannons, we were lathicharged and were framed in false cases. Because of all these atrocities I want your help. Elections are being held in Bengal. BJP does not bother about good or bad, constitutional or unconstitutional acts. It only understands one language that is of vote, seat and power,” the letter stated.“Shaheed Bhagat Singh had once said we need a bomb to shake up the British. Similarly, to wake the BJP out of its slumber we need to hurt them with votes. Please do this job for me. BJP is desperate to win in Bengal. If farmers of Bengal punish them in these elections, it will teach them a lesson. If BJP loses in Bengal then it will bring down their arrogance and Modiji will be forced to hear farmers. I am hopeful that you will keep my request in mind when you go to vote,” the letter added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/skms-balbir-singh-rajewal-says-pm-modi-bigger-threat-to-india-than-pakistan-224730
