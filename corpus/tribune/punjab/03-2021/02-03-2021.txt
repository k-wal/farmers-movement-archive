02-03-2021||London||India appeals to extradite terror accused Kuldeep Singh from UK||The Indian authorities have moved the High Court in London to seek permission to appeal against a magistrates’ court order turning down the extradition on human rights grounds of Kuldeep Singh, wanted in India as an alleged member of the banned terrorist organisation Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF).Singh, also known as Keepa Sidhu, is charged with conspiring with others to commit terror activities in Punjab dating back to 2015-16, including a plot to assassinate the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.The 44-year-old is also accused of recruiting youths in Punjab to the banned organisation by offering them money and organising a meeting of separatists in a gurdwara.District Judge Gareth Branston, presiding over the extradition case at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, ruled in January that as the offences carry maximum sentences and “no possibility of a review of such a life sentence with a view to its commutation, remission, termination or conditional release” it would be contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.“There is no dispute that these offences carry maximum sentences of life imprisonment. There is no dispute that Singh faces a real risk that he will receive such a sentence of life imprisonment,” reads the judgment, dated January 25.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing on behalf of the Indian government in the legal proceedings, confirmed that the grounds of appeal against Singh’s discharge were lodged on February 19, with his lawyers scheduled to file a response this Friday.“We have appealed the decision to discharge Singh. We haven’t had the permission decision yet,” a CPS spokesperson said.Singh faces a total of four charges in India, under Sections 17, 18 and 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967 related to raising funds for terrorism, conspiracy and being a member of a terror outfit, and Section 25 of the Arms Act 1959, related to firearms offences.The court documents note that he is accused of being a point of contact in Punjab and liaising with the head of the KZF, who was residing in Pakistan, and other co-accused members of the banned organisation, who lived in Belgium and England.Singh, who entered the UK illegally in 2005, was on immigration bail when he was arrested at Loughborough Immigration Reporting Centre in eastern England in October 2019.In September 2020, the Indian authorities were successful in revoking bail granted to him at the magistrates’ court level.“I do place significant weight on the fact that Singh entered the United Kingdom illegally and remained at large and undetected for a period of some eight years. That suggests that he is a resourceful man and is a man who is capable of going to ground for an extended period when he chooses,” noted Justice Swift, presiding over that appeal at the High Court last year.Singh – who used a Punjabi interpreter in court – then remained remanded in judicial custody for the duration of the extradition hearings before District Judge Branston, which concluded in December last year.In his judgment in January, Judge Branston accepted the Indian government assurances regarding prison conditions under which Singh would be kept as “clear, binding and sufficient”.“There is no evidence that Singh has previously been ill-treated in India. This country has considered and accepted previous assurances by the Indian government. There is no cogent evidence to suggest that they will not be complied with,” he said.He also noted that it is undisputed that there is evidence of a conspiracy to commit criminal offences in India but questioned the proportionality of a life term without parole.The judge said: “In my judgment, if such a sentence were imposed upon Singh in the context of this case, then such a sentence would plainly be grossly disproportionate to the offending alleged.“Whilst clearly very serious allegations, Singh is alleged to have been involved in the funding and recruitment of terrorist activity. As is observed, there is no evidence that anyone was actually killed as a result of his alleged activities. He is accused of acts preparatory to terrorist offences."On prison conditions and the sentencing provisions in India, he relied on evidence and reports presented by Dr V. Suresh and D. Nagasalia, advocates of the Madras High Court, and Arjun Sheoran, advocate of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.Besides the human rights issue relating to a life sentence without parole, the court also found that there is “insufficient evidence to make a case requiring an answer by Kuldeep Singh”.If permission to appeal against the magistrates’ court order is granted, either on paper or through oral submissions, the case would then proceed for a High Court hearing. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/india-appeals-to-extradite-terror-accused-kuldeep-singh-from-uk-219572

Former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s wife and ex-MLA Navjot Kaur Sidhu was chief guest at the event, which was organised by a close aide of Sidhu and local leader, Mithu Madan.An FIR was registered at police station GRP, Amritsar, against unidentified people. However, no arrests were made. Later, a departmental action was taken against two civic officials for negligence in performing their duties.The Centre and state governments had given an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, respectively, yet the affected family members were not happy as this amount could hardly secure their future.The state government’s assurance of job to the 34 eligible family members as per their qualification has brought some solace to them. A few cases were rejected on account of family disputes or non eligibility.Deepak, who had lost his father Virender and uncle Pawan, believed that now the state government would not take long to absorb the affected families in government departments. “It’s already been quite late for the government to respond. I think, when the Cabinet has approved other formalities must not take more time before providing jobs ‘actually’. We were dejected lot after the indifferent attitude of Sidhu couple, who never lived up to their words of supporting the families, but now some ray of hope has emerged,” he said.He told that 37 files were submitted with the Office of Deputy Commissioner and three cases were rejected.Mukesh Kumar who lost his 19-year-old son was happy that now his daughter would take care of the family after getting the job. “I work as a labourer. My daughter who had completed +2 would now be family’s support,” he said.Similarly, Joginder who work as a driver had lost his son in the tragedy, but was happy that his another son Sandeep Singh, who has completed his engineering, may get a job.Sandeep said, “I have done civil engineering and was already searching for a job. It would be a great relief if I get the job as I share the responsibility of my two unmarried sisters.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2018-amritsar-train-tragedy-victims-kin-see-a-ray-of-hope-for-future-219566

Dogs dragged her to the bushes near the colony. She suffered bruises all over the body.The girl has been identified as Aditi Sarkar, daughter of a labourer from West Bengal.A bloodied girl was admitted to the Emergency Ward of the Civil Hospital late night, where she died.On the other hand, her parents alleged that the girl has been murdered and the case should be probed thoroughly.On Tuesday morning, the board of doctors conducted a post-mortem and handed over the body to her family members.SI Beant Singh of Sadar Bathinda police station said in theprimary investigation it seems to be a case of attack by dogs.

02-03-2021||Bathinda||Canadian Labour, social society groups come out in support of protesting farmers||More than 100 labour, community, and civil society organsiations in Canada, and other countries have issued a joint statement in solidarity with the protesting farmers of India.The organisations include Canadian Labour Congress, Alberta Federation of Labour, British Columbia Federation of Labour, British Columbia Teachers’ Federation, Canadian Union of Public Employees, Canadian Union of Postal Workers, Manitoba Federation of Labour, National Union of Public and General Employees and many more.In the statement, they have stated that the farmers’ agitation for the repeal of the pro-corporate farm laws has become the largest and longest sustained non-violent movement in Indian history, surpassing Mahatma Gandhi’s historic Dandi March against the abhorrent Salt Law of the British colonial regime.The Modi regime rammed the farm laws stealthily through Parliament in September 2020, using its brute majority in the Lok Sabha, resorting to the questionable manoeuvre of a voice vote in the Rajya Sabha where it did not have a majority, and counting on the pandemic to muffle opposition outside Parliament.These laws were drafted without any consultation with farmers or their representatives, the farmers’ unions.The farmers have consistently opposed these laws, which go against the promises and commitments made to farmers by different governments over several decades.For several months the hundreds of thousands of farmers protesting peacefully on the borders of the national capital have faced and withstood brutal repressive policing including water cannons, tear gas and barricades in the near freezing conditions of a Delhi winter.220 farmers have died as a result of the harsh conditions, a few unfortunately by their own hands as despair overcame them.We are the organizations that work to extend and defend democratic rights, we recognize that an attack on such rights anywhere is an attack on them everywhere.The farmers are literally sacrificing their well-being and putting their lives on the line to uphold these constitutional guarantees on behalf of all the people of India and are setting a glorious example to the entire world. Their heroism and their sacrifice deserve our strong support and our undying gratitude.We salute the heroism of the farmers and pay homage to the departed souls who sacrificed their all to the larger cause.We demand that the Government of India stop vilifying the movement and criminalising the human and democratic rights defenders and others who are part of the widespread support for it from diverse sections of Indian people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/canadian-labour-social-society-groups-come-out-in-support-of-protesting-farmers-219528

The family of jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar, an important leader of the Gurdwara Reform Movement, had migrated to Habri village in Kaithal district of Haryana after the partition of the country.Speaking on the occasion, Bibi Jagir Kaur said, “The brutal atrocities perpetrated by the goons of mahant Narain Das, on the Sikhs who had come to restore the sanctity of the holy shrine Sri Nankana Sahib a hundred years ago, was a cruel truth of the times which could never be forgotten. This incident had laid the foundation of the country’s independence. Whenever there was a calamity in the country, the Sikhs rendered great services as per teachings of the gurus, yet the present government has restricted the Sikhs from visiting their pious Shrine in Nankana Sahib without bothering about their religious sentiments”.The SGPC president also announced financial assistance for Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha at Habri village, including Rs 5 lakh for Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar Diwan Hall and Rs 2 lakh for a library.Jathedar Jhabbar’s grandson Jograj Singh Jhabbar and prominent personalities were honoured on the occasion with siropao (robe of honour) and mementoes.Members of SGPC executive committee Harbhajan Singh Masana, Bhupinder Singh Assandh, Jagsir Singh Mangeana, Tejinderpal Singh Ladwa, Bibi Arvinder Kaur, Baba Sukha Singh Kar Sewa Karnal and other Sikh leaders from Haryana were present.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-decision-to-stop-sikhs-from-visiting-nankana-sahib-has-hurt-them-219201

They rued that they were already burdened with high agricultural input cost and such decision would further increase prices of fertilizers, thereby affecting their farm income drastically.Shingara Singh Mann, president, BKU Ugrahan, said, “Selling stakes of the NFL to private players will clearly result in increased prices of fertilizers, thereby burdening the marginal and medium farmers with additional input cost. If the government goes ahead with the decision of the privatisation of the NFL then we will chart out a plan to hold agitation against it in the coming days.”Mayank Sharma, public relation officer, NFL, Bathinda, said, “With the decision to sell 20 per cent stakes out of 74 per cent holding, the Union Government has made its intentions clear regarding privatisation of public sector enterprises. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management has already initiated the process for the same.”He, however, said since the government would still have 54 per cent (above 50 per cent) stakes in the NFL, it won’t let private players to dictate pricing and they would barely have any say or control over it. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nfl-stake-sale-move-has-farmers-worried-219168

A solution will be found sooner or later. The Centre wants no confrontation with farmers and will let them protest till they understand. — Manohar Lal Khattar, CMThe revenue receipts are 10 per cent lower than the estimates. This has meant an increased reliance on loans though the government remains well within the permitted limits.Speaking to select mediapersons here today, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that the revenue receipts are down by Rs 7,000-8,000 crore and the Centre’s grant-in-aid share has also seen a decline.“We are short by Rs 15,000 crore. However, due to the Covid-induced lockdown, the pace of development also slackened and the budget earmarked for the purpose witnessed a reduced outgo of Rs 8,000-10,000 crore. So, we are essentially short of Rs 5,000-6,000 crore which has been met by increased debt,” Khattar said.Stating that Punjab Government’s Bill on MSP is against the farmer since no buyers would purchase the produce below the price, Khattar — commenting on the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s laws — said that the matter would be resolved soon but he can’t set a dateline for it.“People from among the farmers will emerge and explain to them that the stalemate cannot continue forever. A solution will come sooner or later,” he said, reiterating that the government wanted absolutely no confrontation and would let them continue till they understand.Khattar maintained that farmers destroying their standing crop or announcing that milk would be sold at Rs 100 per litre is no way of registering a protest.“Economics tells us that the price of a commodity depends upon the demand and supply. Milk can be sold at Rs 500 per litre provided there are buyers. Further, milk is a perishable item and there is no organised market,” the CM said.He said that Haryana had purchased bajra at MSP over and above the production in the state since farmers of neighbouring states — attracted by the rates — flocked to Haryana to sell their produce.On the Antyodaya scheme for uplifting the status of poor families, Khattar said that the government wants to identify the most economically backward families through the Parivar Pehchan Patra. “Our effort is to extract honey from haves and distribute it among have-nots,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabs-bill-on-msp-anti-farmer-haryana-cm-219324

The unprecedented action is set to affect other banks also that operate through the clearing house of the SBI.Allegedly, higher officials of the SBI had not taken the communication from local officials seriously. As the MC team and the police entered the main office, customers were present inside, but they could not do any kind of transaction. Gaurav Aggarwal, chief branch manager, expressed inability to take the responsibility for the unprecedented situation, claiming he had already informed higher officials about the dispute.Sandeep Kumar, Superintending Engineer of the Municipal Corporation, along with the staff, escorted by the City-1 police team, reached the bank at 11 am. The MC team said since 1982, the bank had a liability of about Rs 1 crore. Notices had been sent to the bank in this regard several times, but no payment was made.The bank has to pay the increased rent, according to the MC rules, but since 1982, even the rent calculated at Rs 20,000 had not been paid.The MC had instituted a case under the Public Premises Act on January 16, 2019 in the court of SDM- cum-Collector, which had been decided in favour of the MC on December 15, 2020. A time of one month was given to the bank to hand over the possession of the building, but neither the arrears were paid, nor the building was vacated. The MC today sealed the bank on the orders of the SDM.The customers and the staff present at the bank were told to move out of the building. The MC team comprised XEN Raman Kumar, SDO Chirag Bansal, Superintendent Ravi Kumar, JE Sagar Soni and Taxation Superintendent Vikram Dhuria.The SE said the building, built in 1939, had been declared unsafe and was sealed.

The string subsequently came in contact with an iron rod on the roof of an adjoining house and the current travelled downward, causing burns to Ramandeep Kaur, who was working in the kitchen.Made of nylon threads and coated with chemicals such as lead, Chinese tensile string is stronger than cotton strings available in the market and is a good conductor of electricity, causing electrocution if it comes in contact with electricity wires.Officially there is a prohibition on the sale of the string, but it is readily available due to its low cost and high profit margins.Popular among kids, the string could cause severe injury to the eyes and throat of passersby as well as kill birds and animals, said Sandeep Arora, convener of Society for Environment and Ecological Resources (SEER), which organises camps in schools every year to dissuade the students from using the string.The use of the ‘banned’ string for kite-flying has left many, including bike rides and birds, injured. Holding meetings with school students, Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja, president, Bhai Kanahiya Cancer Roko Society, said the string was made of plastic-like material and stretched on being pulled.“Due to a shortage of open spaces and grounds, kite-flyers rely on rooftops to fly kites, increasing the chances of the string coming in contact with power cables,” said Vikas Arora, a schoolteacher in Faridkot. — TNSLurking danger||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/chinese-kite-string-kills-2-in-kotkapura-219154

The couple moved the court seeking directions to the Union of India and other respondents to permit parting of ways with the self-quarantine procedure as they had to appear before a court for divorce. However, Justice Anil Kshetarpal of the HC made it clear to them that “the citizens of all countries of the world are already suffering” due to Covid-19 spread and the interest of individuals could not be protected at the cost of the public.Justice Kshetarpal observed the husband and wife had filed the writ petition for directing the respondents to revoke the order dated February 19 vide which they had given an undertaking to remain in 14-day self-quarantine from the date of landing. It was pleaded by their counsel that the petitioners had to appear before a subordinate court in Gurdaspur for the hearing of their petition for divorce by mutual consent.After hearing the counsel for the petitioners at some length, Justice Kshetarpal made it clear that public interest could not be compromised by asserting the court was of the opinion that such a direction could not be issued to the respondents. “In these circumstances, no ground to issue the writ, as prayed for, is made out. However, the family court, Gurdaspur, is requested to adjourn the case beyond the date of their quarantine period,” Justice Kshetarpal asserted before disposing of the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cant-forgo-quarantine-period-for-divorce-high-court-219148

She was just 13 when her father Meghraj Bhagtuana was gunned down by Khalistani militants at Sewewala village in Faridkot on April 9, 1991.Bhagtuana had floated the Front Against Communalism and State Repression and one of its slogans was “Na Hindu raj na Khalistan, raj kare mazdoor-kisan (Neither Hindu rule nor Khalistan, we demand workers’ rule”).Camping at the Delhi border since the agitation began, Bindu, while talking to The Tribune, said, “It is unfortunate that the government and a section of media labelled farmers as ‘Khalistanis’. How can we support them when many of us are their victims. Our only demand is the repeal of the three agricultural laws”.She alleged that earlier too, politicians had divided the country for their benefits, and now to weaken the farmers’ movement, ‘Khalistan’ was being used as a propaganda. “We don’t want ourselves to be labelled as ‘Khalistanis’. We are part of India. Even after the Partition, nobody has gained anything,” she added.Bindu alleged that it was a deep-rooted conspiracy against farmers and international bodies such as the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund were also pressurising the government to go ahead with these reforms to help big corporate houses.Lashing out at the Centre, Bindu said, “We are being described as ‘urban naxals’, ‘Khalistanis’, terrorists, ‘tukde-tukde’ gang and anti-nationals, whereas farmers are protesting for their land and survival.”She said on International Women’s Day, a number of women from Punjab would head towards the Delhi protest site.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/khalistan-ploy-to-weaken-stir-219138

The last survey conducted in 2011 was the basis of Shanta panel’s observations whereas the population kept on increasing in due course.Find solution to farm crisisOn farmers’ cause, the MLA opined that the state government should take steps to neutralise the three laws enacted by the Centre.
