Why has she forgotten the commitment of the Narendra Modi government towards ‘pardarshita’ (transparency),” said Goyal.According to Goyal, “the FCI procurement is going on well throughout the country” and that there is “only one State that says we will not give records”. “Why the state does not want to do that, she should ask the state government.“Land records should be updated. Not wanting to update land records is not correct. The government wants a transparent system to ensure tax’ payers money is not wasted,” added Goyal.In a bid to enable direct transfer payment of Minimum Support Price (MSP) to the bank accounts of the farmers, the FCI’s Punjab office has sought land records of farmers from the state government.The FCI intends to make direct online payment of MSP to farmers from the upcoming Rabi marketing season (RMS) onwards, and has therefore written to the state’s Director of Food, Civil Supplies, and Consumer Affairs, stating that land records are a must for wheat procurement in RMS 2021-22.Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who dubbed Centre’s move on direct payment to farmers for crop procurement as “another provocation” has said that by seeking land records for making e-payment to the farmers directly from the FCI, “the situation would worsen”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fci-procurement-going-well-only-punjab-objecting-to-transparent-way-piyush-goyal-222791

Due to the global pandemic, the entire tournament will be held in six venues only—Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata.Through this, the BCCI decided to get rid of home games.Raising this issue, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that they wrote a mail to BCCI for considering Mohali as a venue as well. He added that they are ready to take every precaution for the tournament.The Chief Minister also snapped at BCCI for including Mumbai as a venue that is reporting over 9,000 COVID-19 cases daily.“I have written to them (BCCI) saying if they can have a match in Mumbai, which has had 9,000 cases per day, then what’s wrong with Mohali.

Though the size of the Budget was Rs 1,38,015 crore but it failed to please the local industry here as industrialists feel that there was nothing for the industry and it (industry) was on last on the priority list of the state government.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president, FICO, shared his opinion about the Punjab Budget 2021-2022 and said just like the previous four Budgets, this was also a dummy Budget and had nothing for the industry. He said the industry had been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and was expecting some relief package from the government. However, it was disappointing.FICO terms it ‘Dummy’ BudgetHarjit Singh Sondh, co-chairman, FICO, said no special package for the bicycle industry had been introduced whereas the country was the second largest cycle manufacturers in the world after China. The sector needs special attention of the government to flourish so that it could upgrade itself to compete at the global level.Vipan Mittal, vice-chairman, FICO, welcomed the decision of the government to establish a women’s hostel in Ludhiana and other industrial towns of the state, but establishing a hostel won’t serve the cause, there was a need to set up hostels in every phase and sector of industrial areas and focal points.Rajeev Jain, general secretary, FICO, said it was a disappointing Budget as far as the industry was concerned. There was literally nothing for the industry to fetch out of the Budget.No new Industrial areas, devp of focal pointsPresident Upkar Singh Ahuja and Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, CICU, have also expressed disappointment on the Budget presented by the Finance Minister as it had totally ignored the Industry. Ahuja said it seems to be only a poll Budget meant to please farmers and all other sections, except the industry. Only Rs 150 crore had been earmarked as the Innovation Fund that also for early stage start- ups which is nominal. Pankaj said the industry had been crying for improvement in infrastructure but there was no provision for infrastructure.“We have been asking for new industrial areas and basic amenities in focal points, which were neglected by the state government.OTS policy an eyewashPankaj Sharma, general secretary, CICU, said the OTS policy for loan defaulters was badly required but the one announced by the Finance Minister was with many riders. It seems to be an eyewash.Full of fake statements: AITFBadish Jindal, president, AITF, said in the post Covid-budget, no relief had been announced by the government. The industry was expecting some major relief but nothing as such announced. The whole budget is “full of fake statements”. Even the government announced GSDP rate of 10.43 per cent from 2017-18 to 2019-20 has no relevance as compared to the economic condition of the state.The subsidy of Rs 1,928 crore was not sufficient to provide power to Industries at the rate of Rs 5 per unit, The government promised to supply power to the industries at the rate of Rs 5 per unit as per their manifesto but the industry is paying from Rs 7 per unit to Rs 18 per unit due to fixed charges on power. Most of the issues taken up in the Budget were previously announced policies which had no relevance with the Budget speech, he said.Sanjay Goel, Director, Ludhiana Smart City, said there was less allocation of Budget for Infrastructure and development in the state (rural and urban areas).Decisions hailedThe decisions in the Budget which were hailed by the industry include working women hostels in Jalandhar, Patiala, Ludhiana, Mohali, Mansa, Barnala, Amritsar; two medical colleges in Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur; Rs 16,557 crore for rural, urban and other infrastructure; 25 new bus stands in the state and free travel for women in government buses across the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nothing-for-industry-in-punjab-budget-say-ludhiana-bizmen-222688

09-03-2021||Chandigarh||Farm sector to outpace manufacturing: Survey||Agriculture is set to cushion the shock of the pandemic on the state’s economy in 2020-21 with a growth rate of 6.30 per cent. It is the only sector that has contributed positively to the overall Gross State Value Added (GSVA), according to the state’s economic survey. This indicates that agricultural activities for rabi harvesting and kharif sowing were largely unaffected by the lockdown, states the survey.Gross value added (GVA) is the measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. On the contrary, the manufacturing sector was hit hard, but has picked up though mining still remains impacted. The construction and services sector were hit the hardest due to the pandemic-induced requirements of social distancing and minimising of personal interaction. Punjab though sheltered by the relatively resilient agriculture sector is expected to experience informal labour shocks in the services sector.According to the survey, yet unlike the national economy, agriculture and allied activities in the state continues to contribute a large share in the state’s overall value added, exceeding the share of the industry. In 2019-20, agriculture and allied sector is expected to contribute a share of 28.68 per cent of the state’s GSVA.Like national economy, the services sector has contributed the largest share in state’s gross value added. Over the past five years (2015-16 to 2019-20), the services sector in Punjab has contributed an average share of 46.5 per cent annually. Quick estimates for 2019-20 indicate an increase in the share of services sector in Punjab’s GSVA to 47.18 per cent in 2019-20.The survey points out that since 2013-14 growth rate in the state was slower than the national average, Punjab’s GSDP grew at 3.98 per cent in 2019-20 (quick estimates) as compared to 5.76 per cent in 2018-19 (provisional). However in 2019-20 (quick estimates), the growth rate at all-India level and Punjab was more or less same at 4 per cent.Despite the moderation in growth rates of the Centre over the past few years, Punjab’s economy is expected to contract in 2020-21.However, the estimates for 2020-21 indicate a shift in this trend. The advance estimates for 2020-21 indicate that the contraction in the GSDP of Punjab is 1.3 per cent less as compared at all-India level. Punjab GSDP will witness a negative growth of 6.41 per cent compared to 7.75 per cent negative growth at national level.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-sector-to-outpace-manufacturing-survey-222630

No case has ever been registered against me,” he had claimedGhali, a UK-resident, courted controversy on January 28, 2017, ahead of the Assembly elections after he provided accommodation for a night’s stay to Delhi CM and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal at his local residence here.Kejri connection In 2017, the suspect courted controversy after arranging night stay for Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal at his house ahead of the Assembly electionsKejriwal was accused of being hand in glove with radical elements by the Opposition parties. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had filed a complaint in the regard with the Election Commission. Local police officials said Ghali had come to India a few days ago to appear in the case filed against his sister-in-law Harwinder Kaur (61), her husband Karamjit Singh Sandhu (58) and their sons Ivraj Singh and Roman Singh, all residents of Amritsar, under Sections 307, 148, 149 and 120B of the IPC.Knowing that the two were to travel to Moga for the court appearance, Ghali today waited in his car at Gagra village along the Amritsar road.

She died in the evening.The police arrested Ghali while he was trying to flee and seized the weapon used in the crime. He was taken to the Kot-ise-Khan police station.Preliminary investigations suggested Ghali had a dispute with his sister-in-law’s family for the past two decades. Many years ago, Ghali was booked in an attempt to murder case at Amritsar on the complaint of his sister-in-law’s family, but was acquitted by court. He later filed a criminal case against them in a local court.On July 9, 1997, an FIR under Sections 302, 307, 112 and 120B of the IPC; 25, 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act; and 3, 4 and 5 of the Explosives Act was registered against Ghali at the Baghapurana police station.

Their presence at the protest site was all-pervasive on the International Women’s Day.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) had given a call to its member organisations to hand over the reins of the protest to women to mark the occasion.A large number of women from Punjab and Haryana reached Tikri in buses, tractor-trailers and cars to join the protest. With verve and vigour, they discharged the duty of volunteers throughout the day.Dressed in traditional attires, Haryanvi women danced on folk songs and raised anti-government slogans in their local dialect.“Every day is a women’s day, but today is a special day for us we have taken the centrestage. Today’s programme symbolises unity among us all. Some hard steps will be taken to get the three farm laws repealed,” said Suman Hooda, an activist from Hisar.Another women leader Sudesh Goyat said, “Women are soft, but not weak.

09-03-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Debt waiver, jobs: Please-all Punjab Budget in poll year||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 8In the run-up to the Assembly elections expected early next year, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal today presented a please-all but deficit Budget with an outlay of Rs 1,38,015 crore and focus on welfare schemes. No new taxes were announced.The state will incur an additional debt of Rs 20,823 crore in the 2021-22 fiscal on account of the populist schemes, including Rs 9,000 crore for implementing the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, filling 48,989 vacancies and free transportation for women and college students in government buses. There is a provision for assured buy-back of potato and kinnow, doubling of social security pensions and Rs 11,000 crore for free power to various sections. Manpreet dedicated the Budget to the farmers and set aside Rs 17,051 crore for agriculture-related schemes. The state’s outstanding debt is estimated to reach Rs 2,73,703 crore by next March, an increase of over Rs 91,000 crore since the Congress government took over in March 2017.The state will raise Rs 35,041 crore as loans and spend Rs 38,828.43 crore in servicing its debt. Brushing this aside, Manpreet said his Budget proposals had ensured the welfare policies reached out to the lowest rung of the society. Blaming the high debt liability in the current year to a Covid-induced slowdown, he said the schemes would benefit the socio-economically disadvantaged sections and farmers.Loans worth Rs 1,186 crore of 1.13 lakh farmers and Rs 526 crore of landless farm labourers will be waived in the coming year. A sum of Rs 300 crore has been set aside for cane growers while several new agriculture and horticulture research and innovation centres are proposed to be set up. A new scheme, “Kamyaab Kisan Khushaal Punjab”, worth Rs 1,104 crore has been announced.An unprecedented 62 per cent of the allocations (Rs 19,640.82 crore) have been made for the social sector wherein the social security pension for all elderly, destitute children and widows has been doubled from Rs 750 to Rs 1,500 per month. Under the Aashirwad Scheme, the assistance has been increased from Rs 21,000 to Rs 51,000, requiring an outlay of Rs 250 crore. Both the measures had been announced by the Congress in its poll manifesto in 2017 and the government had repeatedly drawn flak over these promises not being met.Even as the two Akali Dal MLAs walked out over the inability of the government to enhance compensation for families of farmers who had died by suicide, and later by AAP MLAs over Punjab’s rising debt, the Finance Minister continued to rain sops like enhancement of pension for freedom fighters and their kin from Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,400, among others.Emphasis has also been on upgrading school and higher education infrastructure; besides seven hostels for working women; additional grants to universities, including Punjabi University to see it come out of the red; urban infrastructure; repair and maintenance of water resources; upgrading roads in rural areas; among other sops. No direct sops have been announced for trade and industry hit hard by the pandemic, though some new policies have been announced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/debt-waiver-jobs-please-all-punjab-budget-in-poll-year-222541
