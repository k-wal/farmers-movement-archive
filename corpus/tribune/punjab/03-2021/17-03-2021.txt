17-03-2021||Raj Sadosh||Will target corporates’ godowns if ‘black laws’ not repealed: Tikait||Abohar/Sriganganagar, March 17BKU spokesman Rakesh Tikait on Wednesday warned the Central government in unambiguous terms that if the three “black” farm laws were not withdrawn, then the next action of the farmers’ ongoing agitation will be to demolish the huge godowns that some private companies had constructed to store grains.At the Kisan Mahapanchayat held today on the call of United Kisan Morcha at the grain market in Sriganganagar, 40 km from Abohar, Tikait said a few private companies had constructed huge godowns and started storing grains at different places in the country even when new farm laws were yet to enacted.“The BJP-led NDA government was planning to sell some banks, insurance companies and other government enterprises to private players. The government is going to bring laws that milk, electricity, fertilisers, seeds and motor vehicles marketing will go into the hands of a few corporates,” he claimed.Giving a call to youth to take charge of the farmers’ movement, Tikait said there are no more jobs left in this country for them, youth should turn to their fields and create job opportunities in the fields itself.He said in the districts of Barabanki and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, when paddy and sugarcane were not purchased at the MSP, the farmers piled up the agricultural commodities at the district collector’s offices. “The government will have to buy the produce on the MSP.”Tikait said the media was not carrying the news of farmer movements in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other parts of the country, but we will reach out to people through social media. In Punjab, Haryana and parts of Rajasthan, agricultural produce was purchased on MSP only, but the farmers stir will get contentious agri laws repealed as well as implementing MSP across the country, he added.In Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, the MSP procurement movement is going to start in the next 15-20 days. Farmers have made adequate arrangements in view of the scorching heat and the agitation will be intensified for the remaining eight months.Revealing that the Samyukta Kisan Morcha will soon give a call to gherao Delhi from all sides, Tikait said millions of people will reach there. After Vidhan Sabha polls results in a few states, the NDA government will realise the heat of the farmers’ movement.Morcha leader Yudhveer Singh said “Modi bhagao, desh bachao” call has to be given. Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, chairman of Rajasthan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (ad hoc), said he will not let the martyrdom of his grandson Navreet Singh go waste. A youth rally will leave Moga on March 25 for Singhu border, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-target-corporates-godowns-if-black-laws-not-repealed-tikait-226582

Prospective places could be Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport, local railway station and Attari-Wagah joint check post.Over a year ago on the instructions of CM Capt Amarinder Singh, the Cultural Affairs Department had shifted statues of folk dancers from Heritage Street in the vicinity of the Golden Temple. Taking into account the religious sentiments of the Sikh community, the life-size statues depicting “giddha” and “bhangra” were shifted. Now, these are placed in the parking bay of the PHTPB, situated opposite the Gobindgarh fort.People associated with the tourism industry said these must be judiciously used to draw the attention of the tourists at the earliest. Post Covid-19, the industry is striving to regain its lost ground and each step would contribute in this direction.The PWD had got these bronze statues constructed from famed artists of Jaipur during the tenure of previous SAD-BJP government in 2016. Sikh bodies had objected to the location of the statues on the way to the Golden Temple as these “prompted youngsters to take selfies and vitiated the minds of devotees going to pay obeisance at the holiest Sikh shrine”.A few Sikh youth had even vandalised the statues and clashed with the police on duty on January 15, 2020. It had prompted the CM to take swift decision to remove the statues from the place. PHTPB project incharge AR Mishra said these statues would be installed at a place where tourist footfall was high.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/uprooted-from-vicinity-of-golden-temple-statues-gather-dust-226356

17-03-2021||---||HC to Punjab DGP: Explain action against POs||Chandigarh, March 16In an order liable to change the way accused leave the country during the course of trial only to return later, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today called for an explanation from the Punjab Director-General of Police.He has been asked to explain the course being initiated by the authorities concerned in cases where the accused have been declared proclaimed “offender” (PO) or “person” and “that too for years together”.Justice Lalit Batra asserted nobody was taking care of this aspect, especially the fact that the accused flew to foreign countries and came back “that too with liberal approach of the authorities concerned”.The direction by Justice Batra came on a petition seeking the quashing of an FIR registered on October 14, 2013, for theft in a dwelling house, dishonestly receiving stolen property and house-trespass under Sections 380, 411 and 454, IPC, at the Sadar police station in Faridkot district.Directions were also sought for quashing an order dated December 17, 2018, passed by the Faridkot Judicial Magistrate First Class, in terms of which the petitioner was declared a proclaimed person.Justice Batra asserted a perusal of the record revealed that the petitioner left India for Beirut in August 2016 during the course of trial in the instant case. As his presence could not be secured through warrant of arrest, a proclamation as envisaged under Section 82 of the CrPC was issued against him.He was declared a ‘proclaimed person’ in December 2018. Thereafter, the petitioner returned to India in July last year as evident from his passport’s copy. “In view of the same, respondent State of Punjab is also directed to file an affidavit of the Director General of Police, Punjab, explaining as to what course is being initiated by the authorities concerned,” Justice Batra asserted.Before parting with the case, Justice Batra also issued a notice of motion to the state. Accepting the notice, Additional Advocate-General Mehardeep Singh sought time to furnish a detailed status report in the matter. Fixing the case for April first week, Justice Batra made it clear that the status report was required to be filed well before the date.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-to-punjab-dgp-explain-action-against-pos-226337

The Bench also drew a distinction between a post and an office.“Since an Adviser to the Chief Minister is not a post, but an office, which is not regulated by any statutory rules, the argument that an advertisement should be issued is completely misplaced. The appointment in question is not a civil appointment, but for the purposes of perks and rank only and, thus, Article 16(1) of Constitution is not attracted,” the Bench asserted.Labh Singh and another petitioner had, among other things, contended that it was imperative for the state to issue an advertisement as there were a large number of educated and well-qualified persons in the state.Punjab Advocate-General Atul Nanda and Additional Advocate-General Rameeza Hakeem, on the other hand, had submitted that Article 16(1) provided for equal opportunity in the matter of appointment. But a stranger to the process could not make it a ground. Only a person falling in the same class/category of employment could take recourse to it.The Bench added the petitioners failed to point out violation of any Constitutional or statutory provision, which disentitled Kishore to be appointed as the Principal Adviser. Not finding merit in the petition, the Bench ordered it to be dismissed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-rejects-plea-against-kishors-appointment-226334

The BSNL, which is the national telephone service provider, has produced small jammers that can block cellphone signals in a given area.Pilot project in Patiala prisonAs a pilot project, these jammers are being installed in the Patiala Central Jail. If successful, we will instal these in all jails. — PK Sinha, ADGP (prisons)The large phone jammers installed earlier inside the jails had failed due to multiple reasons. Their technology needed regular upgrade as jails had presently 2G jammers while phone network was 4G now. The jammers were expensive too. They did not cover the entire jail premises but interfered with the network of civilians living in the vicinity.The small jammers will be used for a specific area like a barrack or a cell where a notorious criminal or an inmate listed as a habitual offender for the use of phones was lodged.Initially, in a pilot project, these jammers are being installed in the Patiala Central Jail, said ADGP (Prisons) PK Sinha. “We have asked the BSNL to showcase the efficacy of the jammers. If successful, we will instal these in all jails.”The Jails Department is struggling to check the menace of mobile phone usage for long now. As a number of gangsters were using phones besides causing other troubles for the jail staff, the department has now shifted them to one prison.“Ninety per cent of prisoners do not cause much trouble but equal number of jail staff is on toes to manage the remaining 10 per cent inmates, which includes gangsters, that is why we shifted them to ‘dead’ or ‘ no-phone network’ zones in the Bathinda jail,” Sinha said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/portable-jammers-in-punjab-to-keep-check-on-prisoners-226331

They have a month to appeal the order.  “After the recovery of torn pages of Quran from Malerkotla city on June 24, 2016, initially Police had registered a case against Vijay Kumar and two others including Nand Kishore and Gaurav Kumar. But later to drag the name of AAP, MLA Naresh Yadav was added. But since police failed to prove their allegations against Yadav, a local court has acquitted him and another accused Nand Kishore,” Yadav’s lawyer Narpal Singh Dhaliwal said.Yadav is the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party.Leader of Opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema was also in court during the hearing. “I’ve always said the case was politically motivated, and that police have no evidence against me,” Yadav said after the verdict.Cheema claimed that the case was a conspiracy by the former state government in 2016 to dent AAP’s growing popularity in the state. Punjab government was then led by the Shiromani Akali Dal. “Police officers acted like puppets of their political bosses and registered a false FIR against the MLA. Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh must accelerate investigations in all sacrilege cases to punish the guilty,” said Cheema.Residents of Malerkolta found torn pages of Quran in the small hours of June 25, 2016. Police booked three people—Kishore, Vijay Kumar and Gaurav Kumar—in the case soon after. Vijay Kumar was arrested from Patiala two days later. Police claimed later that he accused Naresh Yadav of being involved, prompting them to register a case against the AAP leader.Yadav had moved an application in a local court in September 2018 for an inquiry into the suspicious transfer of Rs 90 lakh to the bank account of accused Vijay Kumar.
