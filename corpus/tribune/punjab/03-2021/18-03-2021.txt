This is an important road with emotional and sentimental value for millions of devotees who travel from Harminder Sahib to Takht Kesgarh Sahib to pay obeisance," Tewari said in a supplementary regarding the project for which Gadkari laid the foundation stone in 2019.In response, Gadkari said the government has constructed the Kartarpur Corridor in record time and the New Delhi-Amritsar-Katra will also provide connectivity to important gurdwaras related to Guru Tegh Bahadur in Amritsar. Earlier this highway was not going passing through Amritsar, he said.Tewari asked about the pending project as a supplementary to a question by his Amritsar colleague Gurjeet Aujla who wanted to know the present status of the Dhilwan-Attari, pointing to heavy traffic on national highway on the Amritsar-Pathankot section. On Aujla’s query Gadkari said a new expressway between New Delhi-Amritsar-Katra will reduce the traffic load.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/initiate-work-on-banga-garhshankar-sri-anandpur-sahib-naina-devi-road-project-tewari-to-gadkari-227126

18-03-2021||Saurabh Malik||Don’t entertain pleas of innocence after probe commencement: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 18In a judgment liable to change the way criminal cases are probed, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday barred the police from entertaining representation/request on behalf of the accused to examine innocence.The order would be applicable in every case where the investigation was underway after the registration of FIR. The Bench also prohibited the initiation of parallel inquiries.Justice Manoj Bajaj also quashed instructions dated May 4, 2017, which empowered police officers to carryout fresh inquiries on commission of offences. “It is evident that the instructions violate the process and procedure of investigation established by Code of Criminal Procedure and further cause abuse of the process of Court by submitting conflicting reports, which is against the cardinal principles of administration of criminal law,” Justice Bajaj ruled.Describing such inquiries as sheer and blatant interference with the process of justice, Justice Bajaj said it could not stand the test of justification. It was unfair for the prosecution also to forward inconsistent reports expressing diverse opinions on the same facts without any other material or evidence. “By following the instructions, the police officers higher in rank have violated the procedural law of investigation contained in Code of Criminal Procedure.”Justice Bajaj also made it clear that a trial Court could pass appropriate orders for suitable departmental/penal action against officers, if it found upon conclusion of trial that the acquittal of the accused was due to deliberate lapses in investigation. In all, Justice Bajaj issued seven commandments on criminal investigation.Justice Bajaj added the investigation would be conducted by the investigating officer strictly in accordance with the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure. It would be necessary to intimate the magistrate concerned in writing, along with the reasons, in cases where the State government or the police ordered transfer of investigation after its commencement.It would also be mandatory to send a report to the magistrate, whenever the investigating officer decided to hold or stop the investigation against all or any of the accused after commencement of the probe.Both the governments of Punjab and Haryana, along with the UT Administration were directed to ensure that the police officers and public prosecutors were properly sensitised about their responsibilities and duties to strictly adhere to the statutory provisions of law on the investigation in crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-entertain-pleas-of-innocence-after-probe-commencement-hc-227112

Sit with them, talk to them and then bring a new bill. Why are you sitting on prestige and ego," he asked the Centre.Referring to the amendment bills passed by the state assembly last year to "negate" the Centre's farm laws, Singh said, "We will go to the Supreme Court if the President does not give assent to the state amendment bills." The Chief Minister, however, noted that the amendment bills are yet to be forwarded to the President by the governor of Punjab.Singh further said he could not see a middle path to break the stalemate between the farmers and the government of India, and asked the Centre to scrap the farm laws.How many more farmers have to die, he asked, pointing out that 112 farmers from Punjab alone have lost their lives since the agitation began.Targeting the governor for not forwarding the amendment bills passed by the Punjab Assembly for the President's assent, he remarked, "Are we a democracy or not?"Punjab took a unanimous decision and the governor has no business to sit on the files, the chief minister said.It is his duty to forward to the President for assent under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution, he said.Singh said his government would fulfil the promises made in the run-up to the assembly elections in 2017 before going back to the people for their blessings ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections.The Congress in Punjab has no rival. Neither the Akalis nor the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) can offer any competition, he claimed.The chief minister said more than 85 per cent of promises made in the last election manifesto have been implemented and claimed it was a record for any party in any state.He said the previous record was held by Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh (for 81 per cent of promises fulfilled).Listing his government's biggest achievement as the maintenance of 'Punjabiyat' in the state, Singh said people wanted peace so as to conduct their work or business.Asked if he would lead the party in the 2022 assembly election and be its CM face, Singh for the Congress leadership to decide.On poll strategist Prashant Kishor's appointment as his principal adviser, he said in a democracy, every leader and party has a team of strategists.Replying to a question on the inquiry into 2015 sacrilege incidents, Singh said the special investigation team would soon complete its investigation and that he will not interfere if they decide to charge sheet any senior police officer or politician.He also took serious note of the perceptible increase in drone movement from across the border since the farmers' protests started gathering heat in October 2020.Currently, the Khalistani cells in Punjab are dormant, but they were being fed weapons via the drones to create trouble, the chief minister said.On key achievements of his government, he said the backbone of the drugs chain has been successfully broken.Asked about the criminal cases against gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, who is currently lodged in a Punjab jail and whose custody is sought by Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said the matter was sub-judice.If Ansari has committed a crime in Punjab, he will have to pay the price for it, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/leave-ego-scrap-farm-laws-and-talk-to-farmers-punjab-cm-amarinder-to-centre-227096

The NHAI has broadly identified the spots, and procedure for appointment of a consultant to carry out a detailed study, and to prepare a technical proposal for improving the efficacy of the corridor has been started,” added Gadkari.The Ludhiana MP "wanted to know whether the government was aware of the problems faced by the commuters due to regular heavy traffic congestion at several places on the National Highway, connecting Delhi and Punjab, mainly due to non-completion, and delay in construction of flyovers, bridges etc".Despite this, he also needed to know about the steps taken by the government to ensure the timely completion of all scheduled projects on the highway, which could enable smooth travelling for the commuters. Gadkari answered that for road construction, the work was being executed by different agencies of the ministry, and the e-tendering process is followed. “Moreover, MoRTH has devised Model Request for Proposal /Concession Agreements for a different type of modes of execution in which provisions of imposing a penalty for non-adherence to project deadlines have also been prescribed,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/commuters-face-problems-between-delhi-punjab-nitin-gadkari-blames-113-day-long-farmers-protest-227089

In the previous year of 2019-20, farmers were robbed of Rs 957 crore. This trend continues every year as the government has not made any arrangement for the purchase of gram,” Yadav claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jai-kisan-andolan-launches-msp-loot-calculator-to-show-losses-incurred-by-farmers-227062

Later, they held a sit-in on the GT road near Main Chowk and burnt an effigy of the department.Addressing dharna, the association president, Bhagwan Das Sharma, said, “Traders purchase scrap and other material from firms in the state, outside and abroad. They supply it to furnaces and mills and pay to suppliers as per bills received through banks. They also confirm on the GST portal that suppliers have filed GSTR-1 return.”“Traders never knew that firms are bogus as these had licenses issued by the department after verification,” he added. “Traders purchase goods with proper invoices and all documents, including toll charges and photographs of loaded trucks with drivers. They have all other proofs with them and will not pay the GST again. If bogus firms are operating then it is for the GST Department to look into the matter,” he added.The Steel City Furnace Association president, Bharat Bhushan Tony Jindal, said the association decided to go on strike for 48 hours in support of scrap traders agitation. If the Centre and the Punjab Government did not intervene and stop harassment of traders then all industrialists would also close their businesses and go on a complete strike, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/scrap-traders-go-on-indefinite-strike-against-gst-dept-allege-harassment-226987

Among those manufacturers was Jalandhar-based Shrey Sports, whose management was determined to create safer equipment for the sport.Raghav Kohli, owner of Shrey Sports, says the company’s research and development team worked to identify and analyse the best material for helmets. Now their product is a hit — the company says that most of the IPL teams use their helmets.The helmet manufactured by the company is 700-720gm in weight, has a shell of plastic resins, a titanium face guard and a new Koroyd honeycomb-shaped layer in the inner cushioning part.“My helmet remains tried and tested by all bigwigs in the game including Virat Kohli, England captain Joe Root, Australian batsman Steve Smith, Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Ben Stokes and David Warner,” Kohli says.Kohli, whose family is in its fourth generation in this business, added: “IPL brought me very good orders. I have manufactured helmets for almost all the teams, including Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, RCB, Rajasthan Royals and CSK. More than 70 per cent players are using our helmets. In fact, more than 60 per cent of players in international cricket are using our helmets.”KoroydKoroyd is a welded tube structure which is used in various safety products in sports, such as helmets and skis. The material is extremely breathable and ultra-lightweight. “The use of Koroyd layer is giving us good results. It is a patented product which we get from Monaco. It has made the helmets more cushiony and breathable, so it’s comfortable to use in even hot, humid weather,” Kohli says. This version of the helmet is priced at Rs 24,000.Kohli says the Hughes tragedy made the helmet manufacturing norms very stringent. “For testing, the balls are thrown at helmets at 150 kmph. Since the Hughes tragedy, the ICC has made CE certification (quality rating for European Economic Area) a must for helmets to be used by the batsmen,” adds Kohli.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/how-jalandhar-firm-captured-cricket-helmet-market-226902

He advocated early opening of the courts to end the wait for justice for citizens, and also of schools and colleges to bridge the gap between poor and affluent families in terms of education.Apart from covering the entire population in selected areas, certain co-morbidity situations among those below 45 years, such as kidney and liver diseases, should also be covered across the state, the CM recommended, as the state continued to grapple with its second peak, which started from mid-February.With the role of virus mutation still unclear, the CM underlined the need to strengthen viral sequencing, particularly in Punjab, “as over 50 per cent positive cases now were below 40 years of age and there was an urgent need to assess whether this was due to any variant.”The state, he said, had sent a large number of samples for genome sequencing but few results had been received of which two indicated presence of variant.Listing out the measures taken by his government to battle the ongoing second wave, the CM revealed that the state had imposed restrictions on social gatherings — maximum of 100 for indoor events and 200 for outdoor events.

For two days, I have been seeking time from the Union Minister of Food and Public Distribution, but no one has responded,” he said.With the Union Minister of State for Food and Public Distribution Raosaheb Danve clarifying in the Lok Sabha yesterday that they would not be able to release the two per cent Rural Development Fund to Punjab, withheld since October last year, Punjab will suffer a loss of Rs 1,600 crore per annum (Rs 800 crore each for wheat and paddy cycle). “Our rules for use of RDF were made in 1987. How can the Centre frame new rules in 2020, overruling the state rules on use of funds, without even seeking our consent or even discussing with us,” Ashu said.He said ever since the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws started, every few days a new rule was thrown at the state, putting the agrarian state on tenterhooks.“Suddenly, the FCI decided that it will accept only fortified rice from Punjab, without the state millers having the blenders or know-how of fortification of rice. The new gunny bags for rice delivery are not available and the Centre will not decide the price of buying old/used gunny bags. Now, the specifications for the foodgrain procurement are being changed,” he said.The minister also said direct payment to farmers had been made mandatory and the land records regarding ownership were to be first uploaded by the farmers. “Why would the Centre try and de-stabilise a well developed mandi system?,” he asked.Bittu for all-party meet for resolutionNew Delhi: Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu on Wednesday said an all-party meeting should be held for the early resolution of the farmers’ issues. Flagging the sensitive security situation in Punjab, he said the delay in the resolution of the matter could lead to turmoil once again||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-indifferent-punishing-punjab-for-farm-protest-minister-ashu-226758

However, it had given nothing to people and cheated every section of society, especially farmers, former state secretary of the BJP, Vineet Joshi, said in a press release here today. He charged CM Capt Amarinder Singh with first “fuelling” the farmers’ agitation and later projecting himself as their messiah.  “Were the families of 1,232 farmers who died by suicide in your four-year rule given a compensation of Rs 10 lakh and a government job? Was a compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre given for the loss caused by natural calamities? Was the farmer pension scheme implemented?” Joshi asked. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cong-govt-cheated-farmers-bjp-226759

Farmer leaders Buta Singh Burjgil, Harnek Singh Mehma, Harish Neda, Manjit Singh Dhaner and Bhupinder Singh Kamalwala said the Modi government would not be allowed to mortgage farming sector’s interests to a few corporate houses. “Let the adamant central leaders understand that it will be impossible to defeat farmers’ peaceful agitation by misusing central agencies,” they said, adding  recalling that Punjabis had a centuries-old history of making sacrifices against all sorts of repressions. Folk singers kept the gathering spell bound. Ex-servicemen and women were also present in good strength.

As per norms, all class 8 students studying in government and PSEB-affiliated schools have to upload details of their chosen optional subject on the portal before the exams. There are three optional subjects, the most sought-after being ‘arts and craft’ while the others are Sanskrit and agriculture. However, much to the chagrin of the staff, ‘arts and craft’ did not appear on the portal following which the staff could not upload the data.The PSEB, without getting to the bottom of the matter, asked every student who was slated to take the examinations to cough up the ‘late fees’. The decision has affected students across Punjab who will be appearing in the annual examinations, set to commence from March 22.Cabinet Minister and local MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa got in touch with Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla. “I have learnt that Secretary (Education) Krishan Kumar has asked the PSEB to withdraw the decision,” Randhawa said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pseb-portal-glitch-hassles-students-226762

The BJP-led NDA government was planning to sell banks, insurance companies and other government enterprises to private players. The government was going to bring laws that milk, electricity, fertilisers, seeds and motor vehicles marketing will go into the hands of a few corporates.He exhorted the youth to take charge of the farmers’ movement and turn to fields and create jobs for themselves. Tikait said the media was not carrying news of the farmer movements in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other parts of the country, but we would reach people through social media. In Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, the MSP procurement movement was going to start in the next 15-20 days.Morcha leader Yudhveer Singh said: “‘Modi bhagao, desh bachao’ call has to be given.

Saini deputed him temporarily with the intelligence wing and he was further attached with then Bathinda range IGP Umranangal. Umranangal allotted Gurdeep Faridkot district where the then SSP, Charanjit Sharma, deputed him as the SHO Kotkapura, alleged the SIT. Sharma is also an accused in the Behbal Kalan firing case.In the police, a non-gazetted official who is on the verge of his retirement and has a clean record is granted local rank of inspector or sub-inspector so that he may step into a new and final phase of life with some dignity and improved status. These officials are not entitled to get any extra pay or allowances and benefits of seniority over enrolled police officers by virtue of having held such local rank and are not generally posted as SHOs and in charge of the police post.Alleging that the police officers tried to trap ‘peaceful’ protesters in false cases so that the accused officers could claim an alibi of self-defence for killing two protesters, the SIT alleged both FIRs against the protesters at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura were written in the office of the DSP Kotkapura in the presence of Umranangal.It is quite interesting that in the FIRs against the protesters in Kotkapura and Bebhal Kalan on October 14, 2015, there is one police constable, Surinder Kumar of Fazilka, who had been shown as injured in the hands of protesters at both places, the SIT claimed.Alleging involvement of Saini in the firing incidents at both places, the SIT claimed in the chargesheet that there were 22 phone calls between Umranangal and Saini on that day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ex-dgp-sumedh-saini-igp-umranangal-trapped-protesters-in-fake-cases-226768

This was the second meeting between the two leaders in the past four months after Sidhu resigned from the Cabinet in 2019.Though there was no formal announcement by the Chief Minister’s Office on Sidhu’s future in the party, it is learnt that the Chief Minister and Sidhu did discuss the possibility of the latter’s re-induction into the Cabinet but nothing concrete came out. “Whether Sidhu has agreed to the offer or not is yet to be seen,” sources in the party said.The meeting over tea happened for nearly 45 minutes, before Sidhu left along with Sports Minister Rana Gurmit Sodhi. After the meeting, Sidhu, in his typical encrypted one-liners, tweeted, “Azad raho vicharoan se lekin raho sanskaron se… tankee aas aur vishwas rahe kirdaroan pe”.Punjab affairs in charge and AICC general secretary Harish Rawat, who has been instrumental in pushing for Sidhu’s return to active party politics, was not present in the meeting. Sources said Sidhu’s re-induction should happen before the end of the month before he leaves for campaigning in West Bengal. It is learnt that the Chief Minister will have a word with the party high command before making any formal announcement on Sidhu. The appointment of Sidhu as PPCC president or elevating him as the deputy chief minister is being ruled out by party sources close to the Chief Minister.Refusing to share details, Sodhi said the meeting took place in a cordial atmosphere.

This not only led to lowering of the morale of the officers duty-bound to assist the public, but was also putting them in constant fear. It was bound to affect them in the discharge of their duties.“It is true that the results expected by the public may not be desirable always. But at the same time, it does not give public the right to blemish the character of an officer by doubting his integrity,” the Bench asserted.The observations came on a petition filed by Jagdish Kumar against the State of Punjab and other respondents. He was seeking directions to the official respondents to transfer an inquiry pending before Abohar Block Development and Panchayat Officer regarding uprooting of “healthy lush green religious tree” from a village.The Bench asserted a perusal of the pleadings revealed that unsubstantiated allegations had been levelled against the Abohar BDPO, doubting his integrity. Admittedly, an inquiry was conducted by the official on a complaint moved by the writ petitioner regarding illegal cutting of a tree.But mere non-conclusion of the inquiry or dissatisfactory reply to the legal notice given by petitioner could not give the petitioner a right to doubt the integrity of an official and come to the court to seek redressal, especially without approaching the higher authorities with relevant proof, if any, and take legal recourse available to him under the law.Dismissing the petition with Rs 25,000 costs, the Bench asked the petitioner to deposit the amount with the District Legal Services Authority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/levelling-charges-against-officers-sans-proof-misconduct-says-high-court-226792

This was asserted by Justice Jasbir Singh (retired), Chairman, Monitoring Committee, National Green Tribunal (NGT), after holding a meeting with district magistrates of these districts in Moga recently.“If the health of people and animals is to be taken into consideration, this issue is serious in which any kind of laxity will not be tolerated by the NGT, a national constitutional body working under the apex court,” he told the district magistrates.He said the conditions created due to the discharge of untreated water and sewage in at least 22 drains and other water bodies passing through these districts were not conducive to the health and safety of human lives. “To rectify these conditions, it is necessary to instal sewage treatment plants at required places and to operate them properly,” he said.Justice Jasbir Singh said the NGT had directed the monitoring committee to take steps to address the problem in the Malwa region. He directed the district magistrates to ensure a review of the overall performance of sewage treatment plants being set up in the aforesaid districts and send a detailed report to him. He directed officials to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the sewage treatment plants which had been commissioned by the local bodies. Those that have not yet been activated should be activated as soon as possible. Tenders of contractors who do not work should be cancelled due to departmental action and work should be given to new companies, he told the district magistrates.He asked municipal committees of the Local Government Department to make timely payment for the sewage treatment plants. He said the state government was considering that in future these sewage treatment plants should be paid for directly by the government. He said the decision of the government regarding old arrears and new monthly installments was going to be taken soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ngt-panel-water-quality-in-drains-of-malwa-belt-poor-226824

A day before the meeting, a Pakistani delegation is likely to cross over toIndia through the JCP.The annual inter-border trade worth Rs 4,000 crore through the JCP has been suspended for the past over two years. The trade had seen a turnaround after the Integrated Check Post (ICP) was set up here in 2012. Earlier, the annual average of the trade was Rs 2,300 crore.Sanjiv Puri, a clearing agent, said his only source of income was the handling of clearing the cargo for export at the JCP and Attari International railway station. “I had no option but to issue pink slips to 12 of 15 employees working in my company. I, too, have no alternative. I want the proposed talk to work so that the trade can resume,” he said.Rajan Bedi, an importer and exporter, said: “I diverted my over 80 trucks to other projects. Not everyone enjoys this kind of luxury. So many small transporters had to sell their trucks to avoid bankruptcy.”There are around 150 importers and exporters from northern India, nearly 15 clearing agents, cargo transporters, besides thousands of porters, drivers, cleaners and others who have either lost their jobs or suffered a steep fall in their income following the 200 per cent hike in duty for the trade with Pakistan and withdrawal of the MFN status by India after the Pulwama attack in 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/indus-panel-meet-rekindles-cross-border-traders-hope-226827
