18-11-2020||---||Punjab to amend inter-state migrant rules to avail 2 pc additional borrowings||Chandigarh, November 18The Punjab cabinet on Wednesday approved amending the Inter-State Migrant Workers rules, which will pave the way for availing additional borrowing of 2 per cent of the GSDP.In a virtual meeting chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, the cabinet decided to insert Rule 53A in the Inter-State Migrant Workers (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Service) Punjab Rules, 1983, to allow maintaining different prescribed registers in electronic/digital format to reduce the compliance burden of the industries.This investor-friendly initiative would encourage the digitalisation of records, besides helping to maintain transparency and easy access to records, thereby not only complying with the requirements of the Government of India but also attracting huge investments through ensuring a conducive environment in the state, an official statement said.The Centre, in instructions issued in May this year, had imposed certain conditions for obtaining additional 2 per cent borrowing of the gross state domestic product (GSDP).One of the conditions was to have automatic renewals under labour laws.At present, there is no provision of auto renewal of license under the Inter-State Migrant Workers (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Service) Punjab Rules, 1983.Hence, there was need to amend the aforementioned rules to facilitate the industries with provision of auto renewal, the cabinet felt.In another decision, the cabinet approved a set of new guidelines under a single-window policy to replace the existing norms.The aim is to create robust telecommunication infrastructure with adequate bandwidth for promoting information technology, e-governance and e-commerce in the state, the statement said.The new guidelines will supersede the telecom policy notified in 2013, an official spokesperson said after the meeting, adding that the amended policy was aligned to the Right of Way Rules, 2016.               This decision would enable speedier permissions for installation of telecom towers, masts, poles and right of way (RoW) clearances for laying of optical fibre cables to registered telecom operators/infrastructure providers at government or private buildings and lands. Enhanced period for validity of permissions and elimination of no-objection certificate (NOC) requirement from Punjab Pollution Control Board for installation of generator sets are among the key highlights of the new policy.The spokesperson said the existing fee structure would be rationalised by replacing various charges currently being collected by the state with a one-time administrative fee of Rs 10,000 per tower.The single-window policy envisages providing online clearances through the Punjab Business First Portal in a time-bound fashion, with the provision of deemed clearances built into the new guidelines.           To empower Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), the cabinet approved a new scheme—Punjab Divyangjan Shaktikaran Yojna (PDSY), to be implemented in a phased manner across the state.The first phase of the scheme will involve strengthening the existing programmes to ensure that their benefits reach persons with disabilities in a more effective manner.In the second phase, 13 new interventions are proposed to be undertaken for the empowerment of such persons.As per Census 2011, out of Punjab’s population of 2.72 crore, 6.5 lakh are differently-abled persons.In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the cabinet also decided to defer implementation of the Punjab State Council for Agricultural Education Act, 2017, till June 30, 2021.The main objective of this Act is to specify the minimum standards and guidelines for imparting agricultural education and training to be followed by the colleges/universities in the state. It was notified in January 2018.To cope more effectively with the COVID-19 pandemic, the cabinet gave approval for the creation of 16 posts of Assistant Professor in the departments of cardiology, endocrinology, neurology and nephrology of government medical colleges of Patiala and Amritsar. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-to-amend-inter-state-migrant-rules-to-avail-2-pc-additional-borrowings-172213
18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Run goods trains in Punjab first, will then consider allowing passenger ones: Farm unions to Centre||“First allow the goods trains to operate in Punjab, which will signal the lifting of the state’s economic blockade. Only then, will we consider allowing the passenger trains to operate in the state.”This was the main decision taken by the 30 farmer unions that met here on Wednesday, to discuss the further course of action in the ongoing farmers’ agitation. After deliberating for over five hours, the unions said the Centre must show its good intent by allowing goods trains to operate.The union leaders said they were under pressure from the industry as well as the state government to stop the agitation on the railway property (farmers are no longer on the tracks or railway platforms, but protesting on railway parking and other lands), as the Union Railway Ministry and the Railways Board has refused to revoke the suspension of trains. “We would like to tell the industrialists that we are fighting for a just cause, which is directly linked to the state’s economy. The Centre is responsible for keeping train services suspended... not us,” said Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala of Krantikari Kisan Union, adding that the agitation would continue.During the marathon meeting today, discussion was also held on the last week’s meeting with Central ministers in Delhi. It is learnt that all unions unanimously rejected the suggestion that the three Farm Acts would benefit farmers. They criticised the Centre for disallowing them the rally venue at Delhi for the agitation on November 26-27, and vowed to make the agitation a grand success.Ruldu Singh Mansa, president of Punjab Kisan Union, who chaired the meeting today, said they also discussed the routes that the farmers will be taking to reach Delhi, as efforts will be made to stop their march to the capital. “All district committees will be meeting on November 21, to chalk out their plan,” he said‘Disappointed’Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh expressed disappointment over the “adamant refusal” of the farmer unions to completely lift their rail blockade, saying it has brought the state virtually to a standstill for the past month and a half.In a statement, he called the farmer unions’ decision “extremely unfortunate”, saying their blockade of passenger trains was obstructing the movement of goods trains as well.He said he had expected them to back down from their “unyielding” approach in the interest of Punjab, particularly in view of the state government’s absolute support for their cause.“They should realise things could not continue like this ad infinitum, and if rail transportation continued to remain suspended any longer, the state would plunge into an irreversible crisis,” he said.He added that no government could afford such a situation.Industry has already suffered losses to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore so far, he said.Industries in Ludhiana and Jalandhar have borne Rs 22,000 crore in losses.  Over 13,500 containers are lying at Dhandari dry port, from where they could not be sent to other parts of the country.In the agriculture sector, 60,000 gunny bags are stuck in Delhi and Rajpura, impacting the lifting of paddy from grain markets, the CM said.He said the suspension of train services has also prevented the supply of 40 lakh tonnes of parboiled rice from Punjab to Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh for the public distribution system, causing the central government to pick up grain from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. ---PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/run-goods-trains-in-punjab-first-will-then-consider-allowing-passenger-ones-farm-unions-to-centre-172173

18-11-2020||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Centre taking advantage of lack of co-ordination between agitating farm unions: BKU-Urgahan||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, November 18A large number of farmers, labourers and women from Bathinda district on Wednesday staged a dharna in front of the office of the Deputy Commissioner against the ‘anti-farmer’ laws brought by the Modi government at the Centre.Addressing the protest in the city, BKU Ekta Ugrahan district president Shingara Singh Mann, state secretary Harinder Kaur Bindu and general secretary Harjinder Singh Buggi said the three agitating farmers’ centres in Punjab are BKU Ekta Ugrahan, the forum of 30 organisations and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee. The union government is taking advantage of the lack of coordination amongst them in their fight to uphold the 5 black laws and is trying to suppress the current historic farmers struggle, they said.Union Minister of State Som Prakash’s statement in yesterday’s newspapers about the possibility of the talks reaching a conclusion adds to this suspicion. An appeal would also be made to all the farmers’ organisations to strengthen the co-ordination between the three struggling centres to defeat such government maneuvers, they added.They said that 31 agitating farmers’ organisations of Punjab have taken a stand against the Modi government for repealing of three anti-agriculture laws and Power Amendment Act 2020 introduced by the Union government and these laws are being opposed by farmers all over India. Instead of repealing this law despite the protests of the farmers and instead of taking care of the straw, the government issued a new ordinance imposing a fine of Rs 1 crore and five-year sentence.They said the Modi government at the Centre had tried to implement the law by setting up a committee of representatives of the agitating farmers’ organisations, the Centre and the Punjab government to quell the struggle. The BJP is dreaming of forming the next government in Punjab, they added. They further said the “arrogant” decision of the Centre to enforce this law by force would be shattered by the farmers and other working people of Punjab.Demonstrators also took out protest march from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to Gol Diggi, urging people of the city to join the struggle for the repeal of these laws. They also demanded the repeal of these five laws and the strengthening of the public distribution system to provide rations to the needy people of all villages and towns, releasing all the innocent writers, intellectuals, democratic activists, journalists and students imprisoned immediately without any condition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-taking-advantage-of-lack-of-co-ordination-between-agitating-farm-unions-bku-urgahan-172160

Among other issues, the PDSY aims to fill the backlog of PwDs in government jobs, which has already been approved by the Council of Ministers while approving the State Employment Plan. The Department of Employment Generation would give greater thrust on filling up vacant posts of PwDs during the next six months.For overall guidance and policy support for the scheme, a Consultative Group headed by the Minister, Social Security and Women & Child Development, is proposed to be constituted with all concerned Cabinet Ministers as Members. The Group would not only review the performance under the scheme but also suggest measures for improvements if any required.The concerned line/administrative departments would implement various existing and new interventions under the scheme as part of their respective Annual Plans, the details of which would have to be submitted to the Social Security and Women & Child Development department. The Department would prepare a consolidated Annual Plan for the development of PwDs, which shall be reviewed by the Planning and Monitoring Committee (PMC) headed by its Principal Secretary. For inter-departmental coordination and resolution of issues that may crop up in the implementation of the scheme, a State Level Steering Committee (SLSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary would be constituted with all concerned Administrative Secretaries as members.Under Phase-I, the scheme would focus on providing to PwDs the benefits of existing schemes being run by various Government departments with a goal to reach out to all of them in the state, so as to provide services/benefits/rights in respect of healthcare, education, employment, safety and dignity in all spheres of life.Phase-II of the PDSY shall have new initiatives/programmes to cover those aspects and needs which have hitherto not been covered under any existing centrally/state-sponsored scheme or PwD-oriented schemes by different departments.Divulging the salient features of the PDSY, the spokesperson said that the scheme focuses on convergence and integration of various existing schemes and programmes to maximize their benefit for the development of PwDs with an aim to converge 30 existing schemes and programmes.

18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab amends rules; provides jobs to married siblings of Galwan bravehearts||Making an exception to the state government's existing 'Policy of Appointments of Honour and Gratitude,' the Punjab cabinet on Wednesday approved the amendment to provide jobs in the state services to married siblings of three bachelor battle casualties of the Galwan Valley.The decision was taken by the Captain Amarinder Singh government, in recognition of the supreme sacrifice, made by Sepoy Gurtej Singh, Sepoy Gurbinder Singh, and L/NK Saleem Khan.As per the existing rules, only dependent family members or the next of kin of the battle casualties were eligible for the jobs, but in this case, since, no dependent family members exist, the government decided to make an exception, and provide jobs to their married brothers.Disclosing this, a spokesperson of the Chief Minister's office said, that Gurpreet Singh, the married brother of Sepoy Gurtej Singh (unmarried); and Niyamat Ali, married brother of L/Nk Saleem Khan (unmarried), had applied for the appointment in the state services despite not falling under the definition of “Dependent members of the War Heroes”.The spokesperson pointed out, that under the Policy of Appointments and Honour and Gratitude in Class I and II services to the dependent members of families of "War Heroes” dated September 24, 1999, and the Policy of Appointments and Honour and Gratitude in the Class III and IV services to the dependent members of families of “War Heroes” dated August 19, 1999, the widow or the dependent member of the family of a “War Hero” is offered appointment in the state services.A dependent member of a War Hero, under the aforesaid policies, is defined as a “Widow or Wife or a dependent son or dependent unmarried daughter or adopted dependent son or adopted unmarried daughter.However, in case the War Hero is unmarried but had other dependents on him, then one of the dependent unmarried brothers and unmarried sisters was eligible for consideration for appointment under this policy", revealed the spokesperson.Notably, five soldiers belonging to Punjab laid down their lives in the Ladakh sector in June, 2020, during unprovoked aggression by the People’s Liberation Army of China.Such deaths are normally declared as Battle Casualty by the Army Headquarters and the Next of Kin of such soldiers are granted financial assistance and one dependent family member of each martyred soldier is also given jobs, as per the Policy of Appointments and Honour and Gratitude of the State Government.But out of these five soldiers, three were unmarried at the time of their martyrdom.Further, none of the family members of the above mentioned three martyrs is covered under the definition of the “dependent members of the War Heroes” in the aforesaid policies, thus prompting the State Government to depart from the norm as a mark of honour and gratitude to these martyrs, as they are survived by their old parents and other family members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-amends-rules-provides-jobs-to-married-siblings-of-galwan-bravehearts-172152
18-11-2020||Chandigarh||It's BJP vs SAD after Akal Takht Jathedar suggests 2019 Lok Sabha polls were rigged||A fresh row has erupted between the BJP and the Shiromani Akali Dal over the former's sharp reaction to Akal Takht Jathedar's statement suggesting that the 2019 Lok Sabha polls were rigged.Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh had said that an "EVM government was ruling the country".Senior BJP leader Harjeet Singh Grewal called Singh "an employee" of a political family and termed him "mentally ill". Grewal said the Jathedar had no business making political statements or calling a democratically-elected government an "EVM government".The Shiromani Akali Dal has termed the BJP's statement as "a dangerous and unprecedented attack on the temporal seat of the Sikhs"."Such provocative statements can harm the law and order situation," said SAD spokesperson Dr Daljeet Singh Cheema in a video message.Dr Cheema said Jathedar had talked about forces that were trying to weaken the Sikh Panth and those forces stand exposed.‘Irresponsible remarks’The SAD asked its former ally BJP to take note of the irresponsible utterances being made against Sri Akal Takth Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh and ensure the honour of the head of the Sikh community’s highest temporal seat was not undermined in any manner.Taking strong notice of Grewal’s outburst, SAD senior vice-president Daljit Singh Cheema said it was unfortunate that the former had not only insulted the Singh Sahab who spoken about the challenged being faced by the Sikh community at the historic 100 year celebration of the SGPC at Sri Amritsar Sahib on Tuesday, but had also hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community worldwide.“The BJP central leadership should rebuff Mr Harjit Grewal immediately and the latter should take back his utterances and express regret for the same”.Cheema said it was shocking that the State BJP leader had bad mouthed the Singh Sahab who had had only made the Sikh community aware of anti-Sikh forces who were striking against its principles, religious places and institutions. “It seems Mr Harjit Grewal feels he is the guilty party and has only exposed himself by his utterances”.Stating that Grewal or other BJP leaders should not try to take on the Sri Akal Takth which was the supreme temporal and spiritual seat of the Sikhs, the SAD leader wholeheartedly welcomed the address given by the Singh Sahib at the “panthic” gathering on Tuesday.He said the Sri Akal Takth Jathedar had earned the respect of the entire community by speaking up for minorities and highlighting how successive central governments had tried to break the SGPC.“He has made the Sikh panth aware that such efforts are afoot again and that it should face them unitedly”. He said the Singh Sahib had spoken authoritatively and given historical references in his speech to tell the ‘sangat’ about the glorious history of the SGPC.“Moreover Singh Sahib has rightly mentioned that the concept of ‘Miri -Piri which symbolised worldly and spiritual authority was part of the Sikh tradition and would remain so. There is no reason for anyone to be perturbed by this. Instead everyone should give due respect to the Singh Sahab as well as the seat he represents”, Cheema added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/its-bjp-vs-sad-after-akal-takht-jathedar-suggests-2019-lok-sabha-polls-were-rigged-172150
18-11-2020||Washington||Sikh community in US sees slight decrease in hate crimes: Advocacy||Sikhs in the US experienced a slight decrease in the number of hate crimes last year, a leading community advocacy organisation has said, citing an FBI report which showed that 2019 was the deadliest year on record with the highest number of hate crime murders since 1991.The South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), a not-for-profit organisation, cited a report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and said that the Sikh community in the US saw a slight decrease in the number of reported anti-Sikh incidents in 2019, after a record 200 per cent increase in 2018.While crimes motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment decreased, with 176 reported, overall hate crime incidents targeting Muslims and those perceived as Muslims has been up since 2015, it said.Since November 2015, SAALT and its partners have tracked 348 incidents of xenophobic or Islamophobic rhetoric, and 733 incidents of hate violence targeting Muslims and Asian Americans, and those perceived as Muslim or Asian American.As per the FBI's 2019 Hate Crime Statistics Report, a total of 7,314 hate crime incidents were reported by the law enforcement agencies.SAALT said racially motivated hate crime incidents made up the majority of hate crimes reported in 2019, with nearly half of the incidents motivated by anti-Black racism. The number of anti-Black hate crimes was the highest since2011.There were 51 hate crime murders in 2019, it said, adding that 22 of those were the racially motivated murders in the single El Paso shooting last August.There was a nine per cent increase in reported hate crime incidents against Latinos, and yet the deadly El Paso shooting was categorised under “anti-other race/ethnicity/ancestry” despite well documented anti-Mexican sentiment. SAALT said that hate violence targeting South Asians, Arabs and Muslims is fuelled by state sanctioned white supremacy.“Policies and practices like the Muslim ban, family separation and ongoing police violence endanger our communities because they embolden white supremacists.“From the constant vandalizing of mosques, harassment of Muslim women, to the targeting of South Asians in their own neighbourhoods, we have seen the very real and constant impact of this violence,” SAALT added.

He will head towards Rajasthan on Wednesday."Cancer is curable if it's detected and diagnosed early, hence there is no need for concealing the disease. The cancer patients should immediately contact the doctors as the treatment of cancer is encouraging nowadays. My mission aims at educating people about cancer, and motivating them to get treatment at the earliest," said Bedi.He added, that collecting funds for the cancer patients was another motive of his mission. So far, Rs 1 crore has been collected, and has been donated to a Cancer Foundation—which would be spent in organising a free Mega Cancer Check-up Camp in Barmer and Jodhpur."Health check-up of 2,000 tribal women would be done in these camps through cancer specialists from Delhi. I will cover most of the area of Rajasthan on the cycle, and will also pay a floral tribute to martyrs at various memorials," stated Bedi, adding, that he would also encourage the people to cycle on a daily basis.He informed, that the idea of cycling came to his mind after meeting a cancer-stricken woman 11 months ago, and instead of getting her treatment done, her husband had left her on the mercy of god due to financial crisis."Thereafter, I pledged to take out a cycle yatra to make the public aware of cancer, and collect funds to help the cancer patients," concluded Bedi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/guru-nanak-devs-descendant-on-2-800-km-cycle-mission-for-cancer-patients-172111

My character had to learn Marathi for his lady love and I had to for the love for my film. It's the kind of movie that's so seeped in innocence that you want to work towards making it better. My character speaks Marathi quite a few times in the film. He is a Bombay boy, so it's a part of his lingo," said Diljit."Picking up a new language is always difficult but that was a requirement in this film. It felt authentic. So when my character had to woo Fatima's character, he used these adorable Marathi lines. Those scenes are kinda heart-warming. It was such a joy to see the work you've put in come alive on screen. It's the kind of simple, uncomplicated love that we don't celebrate enough anymore," he added.The comedy drama helmed by Abhishek Sharma released on November 15.It is the first new Bollywood release after the theatres re-opened following the long break due to the Covid-19 lockdown.Diljit even tweeted to thank fans who ventured out to watch the film during the pandemic.

The industry in Punjab, already reeling under Covid disruption, has estimated losses in thousands of crores as train services remain suspended.Rahul Ahuja, chairman, CII Punjab State Council, has urged the Central Government to initiate train service as it is damaging the state’s industry. The Union Government, along with the state government, should sit together and resolve the problems of the farmers.“The farmers of Punjab contribute nearly 50 per cent of food in the country. In a democracy everyone has a right to represent their cause to peaceful protests and agitation. We understand that farmers may have some reservations with respect to the recently passed farm Acts. However, this agitation is now causing economic losses not only to large businesses but is even impacting the local industry, the labour in the factories, logistic providers, small kirana stores who are unable to get the supply, daily wage earners and even small farmers,” he said.Bhavdeep Sardana, vice-chairman, CII Punjab State, stated that the current crisis had adversely impacted the working capital and liquidity in market. Further continuing of this crisis would mean flight of industry, investment, jobs and capital from the state which it can ill afford at this juncture, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cii-calls-upon-farmers-govts-to-end-impasse-171803

The woman was eventually rescued by a warrant officer appointed by the High Court, as per the petitioners.Taking up the matter, Justice Sudip Ahluwalia directed the listing of the case in December first week for the filing of a status report by respondent-Ludhiana Commissioner of Police on a complaint filed in the matter. “It is further directed that the CCTV footage of the police station, Division No. 4, Ludhiana, of September 18 after 7 am of that date, be preserved till further orders,” Justice Ahluwalia said.The petitioners before the court, through counsel Abhinav Gupta, claimed they were “petty contractors” engaged in collecting debris from construction sites. The Bench was told that a police official objected to the use of machines in a plot in front of his house. In the dispute that ensued, two of the petitioners received multiple injuries, which could be corroborated from the medico-legal report. They were shocked to learn that an FIR for attempt to murder and other offences was subsequently registered against them.Gupta submitted the house of a close friend of one of the petitioners was raided. Since he was not there, the police officials abducted his sister. After the warrant officer’s appointment, a call was received at the police station. Another petitioner, abducted by the police, was made to go home. But they were unwilling to release the woman and tried to change her location. She was made to roam around in a car and was ultimately rescued by the warrant officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/preserve-cctv-footage-of-ludhiana-police-station-says-high-court-171882

Granting anticipatory bail to the accused at this stage would hamper the probe, Luthra argued even as the Bench questioned the need for custody of the accused after 30 years of the crime.Questioning addition of murder charge against Saini, the Bench observed it was prima facie inclined to grant anticipatory bail.The SC had on September 15 granted interim protection from arrest to Saini and posted his anticipatory bail plea for hearing after four weeks.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had on September 7 dismissed his anticipatory bail plea.“This case is of 1991. After 30 years what is the hurry to arrest him... We will grant you time to file a reply,” the Bench had said, adding he will not be arrested till further orders. However, the top court had asked Saini to cooperate with the Punjab Police in the investigation of the case. Multani, a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial & Tourism Development Corporation Limited, was allegedly picked up by the police in December 1991 after a terror attack on Saini that left three policemen dead. Saini was injured in the attack.Saini’s troubles started in May when he was booked at a Mohali police station along with six others for the alleged kidnapping of Multani in 1991. Murder charge was added in August after two of the accused policemen spilled the beans.Rohatgi had earlier contended the Punjab Government was after Saini because he had filed two chargesheets in which current Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh was an accused. “This is why they are after me,” he had submitted.In a separate petition, Saini has also challenged an HC order dismissing his plea for quashing of the FIR in the case. He is also facing trial in a special CBI court in Delhi along with three others for alleged abduction and disappearance of automobile businessman Vinod Kumar, his brother-in-law Ashok Kumar and their driver Mukhtiyar Singh in 1994.Bench questions need for custody||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/supreme-court-reserves-order-on-sumedh-sainis-bail-plea-171885

Ranbir along with associates Harvinder Singh Dodhi and Bhupinder, alias Bhinda, had entered the house of Manjit Kaur and her husband Rajpreet Singh, and shot them after removing the CCTV camera. Armed with three pistols, the assailants had used a bike arranged by Dodhi. Bhikhariwal was the mastermind of the incident and had provided them with financial help, the police said.A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC, besides 25 and 27 of the Arms Act, was registered on September 21, 2018.On October 22, Dodhi was arrested by the Gurdaspur police. Both Dodhi and Bhinda had not disclosed their involvement in the incidents when they were arrested by the Gurdaspur police and a special task force (STF). They have, however, confessed to their involvement now.Bira further told the police he was part of the three bike-borne attackers who freed notorious smuggler Harbhajan Singh, alias Rana, of Ferozepur from police custody at a roadside eatery near Ghall Khurd village on the Ferozepur-Moga road on August 18, 2018. They had fired on a police team, injuring one of the officials. A case was registered at Ghall Khurd police station on August 18, 2018. The conspiracy to free the smuggler was also hatched on the directions of Bhikhariwal and Chatha. They provided financial aid to them for committing the crime, claimed the police.In 2018, Dodhi, Bhinda along with one of their associates on the directions of Chatha had tried to kidnap a doctor from Ranjit Avenue, Amritsar, but it was botched as Bhinda accidently fired from his .30 caliber pistol, injuring Dodhi and they had to flee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cops-solve-double-murder-case-nab-1-171886

The matter will come up for hearing on November 27.Rajinder had filed the case in January 2017 over Sukhbir’s alleged controversial statement in which he described the group as the political face of a terrorist organisation.Sukhbir had allegedly issued the statement after Rajinder met with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal three years ago at his house. The court had earlier issued summons to Badal in the case in March but he failed to appear.Appearing on behalf of Rajinder, advocate PIP Singh, in the complaint filed before the court, said Sukhbir’s statement was baseless, slanderous, defamatory with the purpose of defaming his client and tarnishing the image of his organisation. The summons was issued after the Chandigarh Police submitted an inquiry report in the court on November 28, 2019.The report verified the authenticity of the reports, on the basis of which Rajinder filed the criminal defamation case against Sukhbir. The court ordered the police to enquire the matter.Statements of both Sukhbir and Rajinder were recorded. While Rajinder stood by his complaint, Sukhbir denied the allegations. Rajinder’s counsel argued before the court that Sukhbir in his statement to the enquiry officer had mentioned his address in Sector 9, Chandigarh.

Ahead of the winters, farmers in the state are spending sleepless nights due to threat to their crops from the growing population of wild animals.Their population has increased in the Kandi, Malwa and border belts with Anandpur Sahib, Ferozepur, Nawanshahr, Patiala, Ropar, Sangrur, Mansa, Ludhiana and the stretch adjoining the foothills of Shivalik being worst sufferers. According to farmers, the wild boars attack their crops at night. “These animals destroy more than they can consume. They aggressively charge at us, if stopped,” said Harpreet Singh from Anandpur Sahib.“Getting compensation is a tough procedure and usually a majority of farmers use electricity fencing — a very inhumane method to kill the animals,” he added.“We usually get in touch with a handful of hunters left in Punjab who save us and our crops from the wild boars, which usually attack in herds,” said another farmer, Barinder Singh.“Besides vehicle and fuel, I have to arrange for food and weapons. Further, getting necessary permits from the Wildlife Department makes it tough for us as they demand land-related documents before we are allowed to shoot wild animals. Despite hundreds of farmers visiting me, I am able to help only a few of them,” said Balraj Ghumman, a traditional hunter. “I have already received requests from over 10 villages in Bhadson and Ropar,” he said.However wildlife conservationists opine that culling is no solution and perhaps compensation claims should be simplified. Jaskaran Sandhu, Member, Punjab State Board for Wildlife Preservation, said they were aware of the issue and would soon take up the matter in their next meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-jittery-as-wild-boars-destroy-crop-approach-hunters-171893
18-11-2020||---||Only one conviction under UAPA in 11 yrs||Chandigarh, November 17  Ever since Punjab began using the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against Khalistani sympathisers, there has been only one conviction. The convicts — Jasvir Singh Jassa Manki of Barnala and Harjant Singh DC of Gurdaspur — out of nearly 400 persons booked under the UAPA, are also out on bail. An appeal against their conviction in a case of recovery of arms and ammunition in Nabha, Patiala, in 2010 is pending. It’s been 11 years and the conviction rate is one per 100 cases. As per data available with lawyers, 47 cases under the UAPA were registered between 2009 and 2016. The cases more than doubled in the next four years even as the conviction rate slipped. One of the acquitted persons, Narayan Singh of Chaura in Gurdaspur, 64, has even sued the police for false UAPA charges against him. “The police even forged my signatures on the disclosure statements. I was booked in six cases under the UAPA, besides waging a war against the country. I have been acquitted in all and sought criminal proceedings against police officials who destroyed my life. I spent over five years in jail in these cases.” Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, who is contesting most of the UAPA cases in Punjab, said the cases were a sham. “The police have booked and incarcerated several hundreds of youths on the basis of mere information that they were trying to indulge in violent acts in the name of Khalistan. In almost all cases, some arms and ammunition are shown as recovered, besides funding of the accused by foreign-based agencies. None holds ground before the court. It seems there is a deliberate attempt to conjure up such cases,” he claimed. He added, “The UAPA is just another tool in the hand of police after the similarly dangerous POTA and TADA were abolished.”  Senior officials of the Punjab Police were not available for comments. “It is difficult to prove that the money received through legal channels was meant for terror funding. Then there are some loopholes in the investigation and above all the statement of the witnesses, police officials and civilians often have discrepancies leading to acquittal,” said an official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/only-one-conviction-under-uapa-in-11-yrs-171894

Since 2004, the SAD has established its supremacy over the SGPC, post the era of Gurcharan Singh Tohra.He said, “How can the SGPC be held liable for the missing ‘saroops’ when the misappropriation was done by some of its officials and staff members? The issue is being given a wrong twist of sacrilege whereas it is a matter of corruption and administrative lapses. Required action has already been taken in the matter and officials responsible have been dismissed or suspended,” Giani Harpreet Singh said. Recalling the episode of locking of SGPC’s Teja Singh Samundri Hall office twice by protesting Sikh outfits, he asked the SAD workers to don an ‘aggressive’ approach against such anti-Panthic forces.On the occasion, Sukhbir said, “When we form the government, our focus will be on health and education. Preserving the great Sikh and Punjab heritage will be another focus area. But all this can only be achieved if we remain united and defeat those who want to divide us.”Describing the Congress as the ‘worst enemy of Sikhs’, he said, “Since the founding of the Khalsa more than 320 years ago, the Sikhs have faced three enemies: The Mughals, the British and the Congress. Ahmad Shah Abdali and Indira Gandhi were responsible for the demolition of the Akal Takht.”SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said they would establish an advisory committee to resolve grievances of Sikhs worldwide.SGPC has lost credibility: BrahmpuraSAD (Taksali) president Ranjit Singh Brahmpura on Tuesday said the SGPC had lost its credibility under the influence of the Badal clan. “There was no reason to make merry on the centenary year of the SGPC. The existing SGPC body has lost the trust of every section of society. SAD has misused the SGPC for political gains,” he said.SAD convention postponed: DhindsaChandigarh: SAD (Democratic) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa on Tuesday said the convention to mark the 100th anniversary of the SAD, which was scheduled to be held on Dec 13 in Moga with attendance of senior party leaders, had been postponed. Dhindsa said the decision was taken owing to Covid and Centre’s inability to come up with a solution to the farmers’ agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akal-takht-pitches-for-sad-from-sgpc-forum-171895

Train services are still suspended, toll plazas shutdown and protests going on against big corporate houses in the state.After the failure of two table talks between representatives of the Union Government and the farm unions to find out a solution to the controversies arisen due to the recently enacted farm legislations, the Centre seems to be adamant on its decision to implement the laws.Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of the BKU (Ekta), said the farm unions demanded to roll back these legislations and nothing less than this was acceptable to them. “All farm unions are united on this issue,” he said.After the failure of talks, the Union Government has so far not given any sign of further talks to end the impasse or repeal the recently enacted laws. On November 20, the deputations of farm unions will give memorandums of demands, which falls under the preview of the state government, to the district magistrates at all district headquarters in the state.Kokri Kalan made it clear that the farm unions were in no way disrupting the movement of goods trains in the state. “We have already cleared the tracks and it’s now up to the Centre to take a decision on plying of trains in the state,” he said.Stand by farmers in their struggle: AAPChandigarh: The AAP on Tuesday raised voice against the Central farm laws. In a press statement, Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said, “The state government should come out with a legislation guaranteeing purchase of all crops at the MSP. If The CM is serious about the issues and concerns of the farmers, he should assure the farmers to procure their crops at MSP,” he said. The party had been fighting the battle of the farmers of the state since long and would continue to do so in future, he said. Mann said the party would support the farmers in their struggle. tns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wont-budge-till-laws-withdrawn-bku-171898

During the British rule, revenue was coming from the farmers due to heavy taxes imposed on the land by the British.They said Baba Sohan Singh started a drive to send the British out of India by forming the Ghadar Party in 1913. Many of them were arrested by the British. Among them was Sarabha and on November 16, 1915, Sarabha and six of his associates were hanged by the British.Farmer leaders said today it had been more than 100 years since they were martyred but their dream of a society free from plunder had not been fulfilled yet. They urged farmers to join the struggle and end the “looting” by local and foreign companies and to repeal the “black laws”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tributes-to-kartar-singh-sarabha-on-105th-death-anniv-171899

18-11-2020||Vishav Bharti||With no rural face, contesting 117 seats an uphill task for BJP||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 17Though the BJP has announced to contest all 117 Assembly constituencies on its own after breaking up with the Shiromani Akali Dal, it seems to be an uphill task for the party as the present list of party office-bearers hardly has any leaders from the rural background.As per the current list of 43 office-bearers, 11 can partly claim to be hailing from the rural areas despite the state’s over 70 per cent constituencies falling in rural areas. The party had announced nine state vice-presidents, four state general secretaries, nine state secretaries, one each treasurer and office secretary, press secretary, spokespersons, etc.For two-and-a-half decades, the party was a junior alliance partner with the SAD, and thus it didn’t make much efforts to make inroads into rural areas. The party’s activities remained confined mainly to the 23 constituencies it would contest from.The same practice also reflected in the selection of recent office-bearers. Of the 43 office-bearers, 27 are from the 23 Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies the party used to contest in alliance with the SAD and just 16 are from the 94 constituencies Akali Dal used to contest from.The situation for the BJP has become more challenging in the rural areas where the party is facing strong resistance over the recent farm laws.State BJP president Ashwani Sharma said though the party contested just 23 seats, it had units across the state. But senior leader Madan Mohan Mittal, who is also a member of the party’s core committee, accepted that it was a valid question before the party. “Once the issue of farmers settles down, we will expand in rural areas too,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/with-no-rural-face-contesting-117-seats-an-uphill-task-for-bjp-171901
18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Banning purchase, sale of paddy anti-farmer: AAP||The AAP has slammed the Congress government for its decision to impose a ban on the sale, purchase, storage and processing of paddy in more than 4,000 sub-yards and designated purchase centres in the state, leaving the beleaguered farming community in a quandary. In a statement on Tuesday, Youth Wing president and Barnala MLA Meet Hayer said the orders imposing an embargo on the sale, purchase, storage and processing of paddy at the designated yards and centres had come as a shocker to farmers who were already waging a battle against the farm laws. He said the farmers had already suffered huge losses due to mismanagement on the part of the government  for not putting in place timely measures to protect the paddy lying scattered in ‘mandis’ due to tardy lifting.  Hayer said: “The decision, which seems to have been taken in a hurry, overrules the Union Government’s directive to allow the sale and purchase of paddy.  The decision has exposed the anti-farmer and anti-Punjab face of Capt Amarinder Singh.” He termed the decision of the government ill-timed and anti-farmer since the farmers were fighting on roads and tracks for their  survival. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/banning-purchase-sale-of-paddy-anti-farmer-aap-171902
18-11-2020||---||Not against pvt firms, but need to save farmers: CM||Chandigarh, November 17Inaugurating the USA-Punjab Investors’ Meet, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said his government was not against corporates. “We are not against corporates, but there has to be a regulation to protect the farmers and the long-standing relationship they have with the arhtiyas,” he said.Any attempt to do away with this system would not work, he asserted, adding that his government had brought in Bills to negate the impact of the Central farm laws and also taken up the issue with the Prime Minister and Home Minister.“We have to ensure food security,” he pointed out, adding that while India was currently exporting wheat, it did not mean that the surplus foodgrain would remain forever. “The country has to keep its reserves,” he said.Appreciating the growing interest of American companies in Punjab, which contributes 3 per cent to India’s GDP with just 1.5 per cent of the country’s land area, the Chief Minister said while it was predominantly an agricultural state and home to India’s Green Revolution, his government wanted agriculture to boom, with greater growth in the overseas market. Inviting the investors to enjoy the state’s unique business-friendly culture that promoted entrepreneurship, he said the USA was the top export destination ($685 million amounting to approx 12 per cent of Punjab’s total exports in 2019-20) for Punjab-based companies.At the outset, the Chief Minister congratulated the US on the completion of its electoral process and election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the President and Vice-President elects, respectively.He hoped this would usher in a new era of cooperation and friendship between the the US and Punjab.Underlining the role played by the vibrant Punjabi NRI population in the US, the CM said they were working hard to bring success to their countries.‘Want agri growth overseas’Appreciating the growing interest of American companies in Punjab, which contributes 3% to India’s GDP with just 1.5% of the country’s land area, CM Capt Amarinder Singh said while it was predominantly an agricultural state and home to India's Green Revolution, his government wanted agriculture to boom, with greater growth in the overseas market||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-against-pvt-firms-but-need-to-save-farmers-cm-171904
