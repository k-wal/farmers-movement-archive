He had got the job of a bouncer with the reference of Gurlal Brar.The DGP further disclosed that Gora introduced him to Goldy Brar. Rajan Pandey alias Vishal and Chhotu, named two persons, who seemed to hail from Haryana, stayed in their room for about 20 days and left the room with Gora two days before the murder.On the instructions of Goldy Brar, Gagan handed over a bagful of arms and ammunition to an unknown person in Kharar, a day before the murder. This bag was brought by Gora and kept in the wardrobe of his room.After Delhi Police raided his rented accommodation, he took shelter in a friend’s flat in Kharar for the next two days and then went to the Golden Temple Amritsar, from there he went to McLeodganj and then reached Kasol in Himachal Pradesh.During his escape, Gagan Brar remained in contact with Goldy Brar via various OTT apps and Goldy Brar also sent him money via Google Pay for his living expenses.The accused has been arrested in the case and booked under the Indian Penal Code and Section 25 of the Arms Act registered at police station City Faridkot.The police team produced him before the magistrate and took him on police remand for further investigations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gangster-lawrence-bishnois-close-associate-arrested-by-punjab-police-from-himachals-kasol-235002
05-04-2021||Chandigarh||Centre encroaching upon rights of states, jeopardising basic structure of democracy: Amarinder||Attacking the BJP-led Centre over farm laws and other issues, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday accused it of “jeopardising” the basic structure of democracy by allegedly “encroaching upon” the rights of states.He castigated the Central government over its “one-sided decision” to impose the farm laws and the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) on the state’s farming community.In the name of “so-called reforms”, he alleged, the Centre was trying to destroy the existing relations and systems that had worked well for over 100 years.Punjab’s farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents) have enjoyed age-old cordial ties among them, which the Centre was “hell-bent on damaging”, he alleged, terming the government’s “tough posturing and ill-conceived” decisions on farm laws as being against the basic spirit of federalism.He said during his earlier tenure, he enjoyed full confidence and support of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and subsequently of Manmohan Singh, in all major policy decisions/development issues related to Punjab, according to a government statement.He was speaking during the virtual launch of a two-day Kisan Mela organised by the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana.The chief minister expressed solidarity with the farmers against the “black” farm laws imposed by the Centre “in violation” of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution which clearly states that Agriculture is a state subject.“The Centre has deliberately impinged upon the state’s power, thus jeopardizing the basic structure of democracy,” he alleged.Singh stressed that the Centre should have taken the farmers into confidence before enactment of these legislations.“Had the Centre been sincere about finding a workable solution to this problem, it would have either consulted the Punjab government or the state’s farmers as Punjab alone contributes over 40 per cent of foodgrain to the national pool,” he asserted.The CM said that Punjab initially not even a part of the deliberations on the agricultural reforms, and was rather included in the high-powered committee only after he wrote to the Centre.Resultantly, he added, the state’s Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and the then Secretary Agriculture KS Pannu attended two meetings, but there was no mention of these controversial farm laws there, he added.Claiming that 144 farmers have died so far during their agitation, he said his government was giving Rs 5 lakh and a job to a kin of the deceased farmers, while the Centre continued to be “insensitive to their pain”.Pointing to the growing problem of scarcity of surface as well as underground water, the CM urged the farmers to go for drip irrigation in a big way to save the state from becoming a “desert” in the near future.The fast-depleting water table is a major challenge for the state and the only solution is to get out of the paddy-wheat cycle to save this precious resource, he said.Talking about the COVID-19 situation, he asked people not to be complacent but to take all necessary precautions like wearing masks, regularly washing hands and maintaining social distancing, besides getting vaccinated if they are eligible. Though the situation in the state was alarming, he would “not allow it to become another Mumbai”, he asserted.

They reiterated their pledge in favour of farmers.Rani, a migrant from near Lucknow, said her family had been residing here for the past two decades. She said no member of her family was hooked to drugs. Another protester, Sangeeta of Bihar, said the government failed to generate enough employment.A migrant leader, Mahesh Verma said: “We condemn the Union Government’s statement that farmers of the state got their agriculture-related work done from migrants in exchange for drugs. So far, no such incident has come to the fore. We come here for a livelihood so that we can rear our families and children back home.”“Clearly, there is a face-off between the Centre and farmers over the three agriculture laws.

Though different activities were resumed following relaxations, but Urdu service remained a non-starter. Santosh Rishi, Senior Director, AIR (Jalandhar), confirmed resumption of Urdu service and said all programmes will be broadcast from today.AIR officials said Urdu service could not be started earlier as content generation was being done at New Delhi-based office.However, after the Covid-19 pandemic and its induced lockdown, content generation became an onerous task. Unable to garner enough programmes with skeletal staff, Urdu service was temporarily discontinued from Amritsar station (FM 103.6).Harjap Singh Aujla, a veteran engineer, said people were dismayed with the government for snapping 12-hour long Urdu service. “Urdu service of AIR, which started after the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, has been gaining popularity since its inception. Commencing on shortwave 25 and 31 metre bands and now it has spread its wings on medium wave too,” he said and added that it was an effective tool to beat false propaganda of the Pakistan Government in border areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/all-india-radio-resumes-urdu-service-from-amritsar-district-234879

The protesters claimed the Punjab Government had reneged on its promise to provide compensation for land acquired in 1993 when the Shahpur Kandi project was conceptualised. They were also demanding jobs for the displaced families.Deputy Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal today deputed Dhar SDM Nidhi Kalhotra to hold talks. She was accompanied by Dam SE Naresh Mahajan, Tehsildar Arvind Verma, Shahpur Kandi police station SHO Bharat Bhushan Saini and senior dam officers. The DOSC was led by its president Daya Singh.He claimed during the meeting, the tehsildar asked him to call of the protest immediately “or face the music”. “In response, I took out celphos tablets and threatened to name him in my suicide note,” claimed Daya Singh. Verma, however, denied the allegations.The SDM said the demonstrators were being “unreasonable”. Daya Singh, however, claimed officials had 21 years to find out a solution. “For how long will this go on? Our survival is at stake, but the dam officials are unresponsive,” he said.SSP Gulneet Singh Khurana said the police had registered an FIR under Sections 353 (assaulting a public servant on duty) and 186 (obstructing a public servant from performing his duty) of the IPC against the two octogenarians and six others. This is seen as a prelude to some strong action that the police might take in the next 48 hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tower-standoff-protester-threatens-to-end-life-meet-called-off-234637

Neither the SGPC nor the DSGMC was taken into confidence before planning this proposal. — Manjinder Singh Sirsa, DSGMC chiefThe DSGMC and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) said the installation of the statue of the Guru would defy the Sikh ‘rehat maryada’ which prohibits creating idols of Gurus.Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa has shot off a letter to PM Narendra Modi contesting that the statue of Guru or any memorial could not be built without taking the Sikh body into confidence.Special coins, stamp to mark 400th anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur“We will never allow the Centre to have direct intervention in our religious matters. Nothing can be built outside the historic shrine. The statue culture is certainly against our tenets and any kind of structure about which we don’t have an idea will create unrest. Such a proposal will end up hurting Sikh sentiments and hence this proposal should be withdrawn. Ironically, neither the SGPC nor the DSGMC was taken into confidence before conceptualising a proposal that directly relates to the Sikh religion,” he said.SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur has also contested the Centre’s move. “If there are plans to set up a statue of the Guru, these will be strongly opposed. Idolising Gurus is against Sikh principles and ethics. If a memorial is on the cards, it should be like the Virasat-e-Khalsa,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wont-allow-guru-teg-bahadurs-statue-in-delhi-sikh-bodies-tell-centre-234652

The BKU unit of Dadumajra village has banned the entry of political leaders. Boards have been put up at several places with the message that any political leader, particularly from the BJP, will enter the village at his own risk.

Earlier, a student was required to provide his/her registration number with the Punjab School Education Board for admission to Classes IX-XII. However, this condition, too, has been waived.Private schools are allegedly reluctant in providing school leaving certificates to students, so the department has told DEOs and school heads to approve the admission after getting in writing from parents about their child’s class in the old school. “Our motive is to ensure that every child gets education,” Kumar added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-aadhaar-not-must-for-admission-up-to-class-viii-in-punjab-234638

The under-17 had refused to go along with her father and had insisted upon going with her husband. Otherwise, the minor had stated that she was not facing any problem in the Nari Niketan/child protection home.After hearing the petitioner and counsel Harsh Chopra for complainant-father, Justice Puri asserted the Hindu Marriage Act and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act provided penal provisions in child marriage cases and performance of such a marriage was also an offence. The plea taken by the counsel for the petitioner-husband’s relative that the marriage was performed with the minor girl’s consent would pale into insignificance as child marriage was an offence, although not illegal under the Hindu Marriage Act. It certainly was a voidable marriage under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act.Justice Puri added the child’s welfare was always of paramount consideration. Pleas usually taken of parents forcing the girl to get married to some other person, too, would not carry any weight. In that eventuality, steps were required to be taken to protect the girl child by keeping her in a safe custody rather than permitting marriage before attaining maturity.Justice Puri added a social menace required a solution, not another menace. “It would be trite in law to acknowledge child marriages based on consent. The element of consent is always subservient to a child’s overall”.Before parting, Justice Puri added the girl in the facts and circumstances could not be directed to be released till she attained maturity by giving her custody either to her husband or his relatives. The Child Welfare Committee would permit her to go to her father/parents if she desired before turning 18.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/minor-girls-consent-insignificant-in-child-marriage-cases-rules-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-234640

All 58 cases have been investigated thoroughly and nothing of this kind has been found. — Capt Amarinder Singh, CMThe MHA should have checked the facts and verified the information from the state government instead of making false accusations, the CM said, adding neither the data nor the said reports submitted by the BSF authorities were in tune with the content of the letter.“The MHA letter talks of Abohar also while the fact is that there is no case from Abohar and Fazilka districts,” the CM pointed out.He said of the 58 detainees, four belonged to Punjab and three of them were intellectually disabled. One Paramjit Singh, a Patiala resident, was mentally unstable for the past more than 20 years and had left his home about two months before his detention.Roorh Singh, a Gurdaspur resident, had to be admitted to the Institute of Mental Health, Amritsar, on the day of his apprehension. Another person, Sukhwinder Singh, of SBS Nagar, was also facing mental health issues. Subsequently, these three persons were handed over to their family members on the same day after verification by the local police.Further, 16 of 58 detainees were found to be intellectually disabled, of whom four were suffering from this disorder since childhood. One Babu Singh, a resident of Bulandshahr, UP, was getting psychiatric treatment from Agra. He rejected the possibility of these men being kept as bonded labourers for farm activities.“It has also come to light that 14 persons had come to Punjab only a few days or weeks prior to their apprehension, hence the conclusion that they were working as bonded labourers in farms since long is totally refuted,” Capt Amarinder said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mha-letter-on-bonded-labour-incorrect-punjab-cm-234626

The letter allowed market fee or any other fees recognised by the department for a state or states in connection with procurement operations and said the rates as notified by the states would be accepted.Unilateral cut goes against federalismAny unilateral reduction in the rate of RDF is neither as per the principles of procurement incidentals nor is it as per the law passed by the state legislature, and thus violated the very fabric of the federal structure. — Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief MinisterAny unilateral reduction in rate of RDF was neither as per the principles of procurement incidentals nor was it as per the law passed by the legislature of the state, and thus violated the very fabric of the federal structure of our nation, said the Chief Minister.Noting that the market fee and RDF levied by Punjab were duly notified under a law, and had been accepted by the Department of Food and Public Distribution, the Chief Minister said the RDF had been disallowed for the first time in the provisional cost sheet issued by the DFPD.Capt Amarinder Singh also reiterated that there were statutory provisions for spending the levy collected under the RDF Act, and it was hugely beneficial for the development of rural infrastructure, which in turn positively impacted agriculture production and marketing of foodgrain. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/give-rural-development-fund-at-3-of-msp-punjab-cm-urges-centre-234628

He is not ready to have a meeting with leading farmer organisations to discuss the farm laws. Modi is fast losing the image and respect across the world for his attempts to harm the federal structure and his anti-Constitution and anti-human attitude,” he said.Rajewal said the BJP had almost been wiped out of Punjab, the party was also losing ground in Haryana. Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders would motivate people in all poll-bound states to vote against the BJP.Its top brass had conspired to sabotage farmers’ peaceful stir by planting miscreants on Republic Day but with people’s support, the agitation had emerged stronger and would continue till black laws were repealed. BJP leaders would have to repent for calling farmers of Punjab Khalistanis, naxals and whatnot, Rajewal said. He gave a call to farmers to stage dharnas outside Food Corporation of India offices on April 5.Another senior leader, Ruldu Singh Mansa, mentioned the Malout incident in which BJP MLA Arun Narang was assaulted.

Goyal had written to CM Capt Amarinder Singh citing past exemptions the state was granted in this regard and urged urgent compliance.Pitching farmers against arhtiyasThe move uncovers the malicious design of the central government to disrupt the state’s economy and pitch farmers and arhtiyas against each other. — Navjot Singh Sidhu, Congress leaderAddressing the media at his residence here, Sidhu said Goyal’s actions were “part of a larger conspiracy”. “This letter is a way to stall procurement of wheat crop in Punjab and destroy the state’s agricultural economy,” he said.Sidhu said through “direct payment” to farmers for their produce and labour, Goyal was wrong when he said that the state’s Revenue Department had all information about land record of farmers in the state. “The information with the Revenue Department is about ownership holdings. As per the data collected by National Sample Survey for 2012-13, more than 24 per cent of the land under cultivation in the state is under tenancy. These tenancy contracts are oral and unwritten and mostly for one year. Those farmers who lease land through oral/unwritten tenancy contracts cannot get loans from official sources such as cooperatives, commercial banks, etc. due to non-registered land leases,” he said.“They borrow money from arhtiyas to pay rent in advance for the crops to be cultivated, followed by purchase of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and to bear the cultivation cost of the crops on loan from arhtiyas. This financial dependence on arhtiyas to support cultivation is widespread and not just limited to the tenancy farmers,” he said.Sidhu called all three proposals for direct payments (Draft Electricity Amendment Bill, replacing PDS with Direct Cash Transfers and Direct Payments to Farmers) anti-farmer, against the federal structure and beneficial for corporate monopolisation of food and agriculture systems.“This also uncovers the malicious design of the central government to disrupt the state’s economy and pitch farmers and arhtiyas against each other,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/piyush-goyal-lying-e-payment-will-hit-small-farmers-most-navjot-sidhu-234633

05-04-2021||Amritsar/Gurdaspur||No ‘bonded labour’, Punjab cops refute BSF claim||The term “bonded labour” was never mentioned in any of the cases lodged with the police on those apprehended by the BSF at the International Border, say the Punjab Police. SPS Parmar, IG (Border Range), Amritsar, says an investigation is being conducted to ascertain the BSF claim, cited by the MHA in its letter to Punjab, on having apprehended and handed over to the Punjab cops 58 Indian nationals from the border areas of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Abohar during 2019-20.Gurpartap Sahota, Attari DSP, said: “We are scrutinising the cases of those handed over to us by the BSF in the past two years.” A BSF official, pleading anonymity, claimed it was a known fact that labourers from UP, Bihar, MP and Jharkhand, mostly in the age group of 30-50, were allured with handsome packages and perks. “In some cases, they end up being exploited and hooked on drugs,” he said.Backing his claim, Amarjit Shastri, a trade unionist, asserted that providing drugs to the labour was a common practice in rural Punjab. But Rattan Singh Randhawa, vice-president, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, called the MHA report a “complete lie,” arguing that farmers who offered “langar” amid humanitarian crisis could never indulge in such practices. “Also, agriculture being more technical these days, a person with a low IQ would be unfit for the job,” he argued.Senior police officers of Punjab’s three border police districts — Gurdaspur, Pathankot and Batala — strongly refuted the BSF claim. Pathankot SSP Gulneet Singh Khurana emphasised: “No such activity is taking place in the border villages of Pathankot.”Ramesh Rana, senior vice-president of the Punjab unit of the Indian Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), said: “In 2019, we received information that a landlord had paid Rs 25,000 as advance to a farmhand in Pahra village of Gurdaspur, who died days later. The landlord then asked the son of the deceased to complete the task for which his father was hired. We sent a team to the village and rescued the youth. After that, we did not receive a single case of bonded labour.”Batala SSP Rachhpal Singh said about a decade ago, brick-kilns indulged in the illegal practice. “However, we cannot recall a single instance of a migrant having been forced to work in a factory or fields.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-bonded-labour-punjab-cops-refute-bsf-claim-234258
