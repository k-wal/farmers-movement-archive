18-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt approves packaging of wheat in good quality gunny bags provided by ‘arhtiyas’||To ensure unhindered procurement process during the ongoing Rabi marketing season 2021-22, the Punjab government has approved the packaging of wheat in good quality used gunny bags provided by ‘arhtiyas’ (commission agents), an official statement said here on Sunday.The statement said that this would ensure that there is no shortage of gunny bags in any ‘mandi’ of Punjab, even as it pointed out that while the arrival of wheat in mandis has increased to 8 lakh metric tonne per day there is a “nationwide shortage of new gunny bags and new PP (polypropylene) bags for storage of the procured wheat”.PP woven bags are largely used in storing and transporting agricultural products.Chief Minister Amarinder Singh reviewed the status of procurement with senior officials.Regarding the issue of slow pace of purchase in the border districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Ferozepur, it was explained by the officials that the grain of wheat in these areas is shrivelled and accordingly there is a relaxation in procurement specifications required from Government of India before it can be purchased.The Punjab government has, on April 16, already written to the Centre to grant immediate relaxation in the uniform specifications of wheat in respect of shrivelled and broken grains up to 11 per cent and lustre loss up to 10 per cent in the districts of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Fazilka without any value cut.However, the reply from the Centre is still awaited, the statement said. The chief minister directed the food and supplies minister and the principal secretary, food and civil supplies to immediately resolve the matter by pursuing it with their counterparts in the Union government.     The statement said that in the joint analysis of wheat samples in revenue district Amritsar and Tarn Taran conducted by Food Corporation of India and the state procurement agencies, lustre loss up to 5 per cent and shrivelled and broken grains up to 11 per cent have been found in a few mandis of these districts which is more than the prescribed limit.Likewise, in the case of Fazilka, the percentage of shrivelled and broken grains has been found up to 9.9 per cent which is in excess of the prescribed limit of 6 per cent.Clearing misconceptions about reports appearing in a section of the media that FCI was refusing to purchase HD-2967 variety of wheat in the districts of Bathinda and Mansa, the Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture stated that it was an approved variety of wheat by both the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana as well as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Hence, there should be no refusal to purchase by any procurement agency, he said.The chief minister directed the officials of FCI to immediately dispel any doubts in the minds of people and purchase this particular variety of wheat without further hitch.Punjab’s Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan informed the chief minister that adequate measures have been put in place in the mandis to ensure strict compliance with the Covid safety protocols in view of the spread of the pandemic.Special vaccination camps have been set up in the mandis to facilitate vaccination of farmers, arhtiyas and labour, she disclosed.   Principal Secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, KAP Sinha said that 38.95 lakh MT wheat has arrived in the mandis till April 17, out of which 34.40 lakh MT stands procured at Rs 1,975 per quintal MSP.He further said that 85 per cent of the wheat purchased has been lifted within the prescribed period of 72 hours. He also informed that payments to the farmers had started and would pick up pace from Monday onwards after the banks reopen.

18-04-2021||Washington||Sikh community and lawmakers seek probe into Indianapolis shooting as potential hate crime||Influential American lawmakers and Sikh community leaders have sought a thorough investigation into the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in the US state of Indiana as a potential hate crime that killed eight people, including four Sikhs.Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi on Saturday called for investigation of potential anti-Sikh motivations in the incident that took place late Thursday night.“While the Indianapolis and Sikh communities continue to mourn, and as the rest of our country mourns with them, investigators must also determine if this mass shooting was a hate-motivated attack in addition to serving as another example of the plague of gun violence which has beset our nation,” Krishnamoorthi said.The four Sikh community members who lost their lives are Amarjeet Kaur Johal, aged 66; Jasvinder Kaur, aged 64; Amarjit Sekhon, aged 48; and Jaswinder Singh, aged 68. Three of the deceased are women.The violence began at 11 pm local time on Thursday during shift change at the FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis—a time when the area was heavily trafficked with many employees arriving for or leaving after their shift.The tragic incident comes as the country has witnessed a recent wave of anti-Asian hate crimes during this pandemic after a broader increase in hate-motivated crimes and violence against a range of American communities over the last half decade, Krishnamoorthi said.“We do not yet know the motive of the shooter, and we may never know for sure what drove him to do what he did. We do know, however, that the FedEx facility he targeted was known for having a large workforce,” said a joint statement issued by eight Gurdwaras of Indianapolis.“Given everything our community has experienced in the past-the pattern of violence, bigotry, and backlash we have faced – it is impossible not to feel that same pain and targeting in this moment. We expect that the authorities will continue their full investigation and share what they learn when they can, and they will take this into account,” the joint statement said.Eminent community leader Gurinder Singh Khalsa, President of the Indiana-based Sikhs Political Action Committee, announced to set up a task force to look into the circumstances and potential lapses that resulted in the horrific mass shooting at a FedEx location.Given that a large number of Sikh members worked at this FedEx facility, the task force would also look into preventing hate crime at workplaces having sizable members of the ethnic and religious minorities, he said.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the Senate will move forward with a gun safety legislation.“We must all stand together to stop the gun violence epidemic that has cost too many American lives,” he said."The shooting in Indiana is a stark reminder that unless we take action on gun violence soon, these incidents will keep occurring. My heart breaks for those affected by this violence. The Senate must find the courage to act,” Congressman Eric Swalwell said.“Learning the confirmation that four of those killed in the Indianapolis shooting were members of the Sikh community is heart wrenching,” tweeted Sabrina Singh, Deputy Press Secretary to US Vice President.Though the motive is still unclear, understandably this type of event triggers fear and uncertainty -- much like what the community faced after 9/11 and in the aftermath of the killing of six Sikhs at a gurdwara in Oak Creek in 2012, said non-profit South Asian Americans Living Together (SAALT).The organisation said that it stands in solidarity with the Sikh community, in Indianapolis and across the country, as they move towards healing.“This is a shocking incident. Our prayers are with families of all the victims. We would like to advise families to be careful as many could be celebrating Baisakhi outdoors. We are in touch with federal agencies for the safety and security of people at these community events. We urge the administration to investigate all motives including hate and bias,” said Manvinder Singh, director of advocacy, UNITED SIKHS.Ajay Shah, President of World Hindu Council of America said, “a random act of violence such as this brings immeasurable suffering to the families of victims. We stand ready to help them in this hour of need. Such acts remind us that as a society, we must address mental health issues more holistically.” On Saturday, Sikh Coalition facilitated a call between the White House office of Public Engagement and other federal officials and Indiana sangat leaders, where they made several demands from President Joe Biden and his administration.“We have reached out to local and federal law enforcement to clearly communicate our expectation that they will conduct a full investigation– including the possibility of bias as a factor,” Sikh Coalition said.“My heart breaks for all the victims of this tragedy. I also want to send particular love and support to my sisters and brothers in the Sikh community who have borne targeted harassment, racism and violence in the last several years. I stand with them today and always,” said eminent Indian American Neera Tanden.Former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro said there must be a full investigation to determine the extent to which this attack was targeted and inspired by hate.Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett joined US Congressman Andre Carson, other officials, family and friends of the deceased in a candlelight vigil in Indianapolis on Saturday, the IndyStar reported. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sikh-community-and-lawmakers-seek-probe-into-indianapolis-shooting-as-potential-hate-crime-240776
18-04-2021||Dharamsala||Unable to sell wheat in Punjab, Kangra and Una farmers in lurch||Farmers of Kangra and Una districts are facing problems in selling their wheat, as Punjab has banned the sale of the crop by farmers of other states in its mandis.Manjit Singh, a farmer of the Mand area of Kangra district, said he used to sell his crop at the minimum support price (MSP) in the mandis of Pathankot district. However, this year, the Punjab Government was not allowing Himachal farmers to sell their wheat crop there. Police nakas had been set up on the borders to stop the Himachal farmers from taking their wheat to Punjab mandis.Problems farmers facingPunjab arhtiyas said that if they were found purchasing wheat from outsiders, cases could be registered against them. “We have no option but to keep our wheat with us until someone buys it at the MSP of Rs 1,925 per quintal,” he said. Farmers of Indora, Nurpur and Fatehpur also used to sell their produce in the mandis of Punjab.In Una district also, farmers of Haroli and Una, on the borders of Ropar and Hoshiarpur districts, used to take their produce to the mandis in Punjab. Kangra DC Rakesh Prajapati admitted that the farmers were facing problems. He said the FCI had set up a centre at Fatehpur in the district to buy wheat at the MSP. “We have requested the FCI to set up more centres so that the farmers do not face problems. Till new centres are set up, we have asked the farmers to take their produce to the Fatehpur purchase centre,” he said.Raghav Sharma, DC, Una, said a procurement centre had been set up in Kangar area of the district.Sources said that mandis set up in Himachal did not have adequate facilities to procure the entire crop from the farmers of Una and Kangra districts.Kangra district produces 1.65 lakh MT of wheat on 91,800 hectares. The average yield of wheat in the district is 18.3 quintals per hectare.In Una district, wheat is sown on 32,981 hectares. The average wheat yield here is 16.87 quintals per hectare.Besides wheat, maize is the main crop in the districts. Farmers said they did not get the MSP of Rs 1,850 per quintal for their maize crop this year. The farmers on an average got just Rs 800 per quintal for maize due to the shortage of mandis in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unable-to-sell-wheat-in-punjab-kangra-and-una-farmers-in-lurch-240741

The mutation needs to be studied thoroughly.”The health experts, however, continue to claim that re-infection after vaccination was not abnormal, and the patient would either be asymptomatic or would exhibit only mild symptoms.Meanwhile, it has been learned that there had been many cases of Covid re-infection but only a few were being documented by the Health Department.District epidemiologist Dr Sumeet Singh said, “Only 12 cases of Covid re-infection have been reported so far.”“People can test positive for the coronavirus even after getting both doses, but the severity will be less,” he added.Disregarding normsIt has been learnt that junior and senior resident doctors living at the Government Medical College hostels were not adhering to the Covid-19 protocol. Dr Rajan Singla, Principal, Government Medical College, said, “The students have been repeatedly reminded to follow the Covid norms.

They claimed that Pehalwan’s murder was orchestrated by a Canada-based gangster and his associate and jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.Sources said the Faridkot police had started the process to bring the two shooters on production warrant from Delhi. The Faridkot and Delhi police have already arrested nine persons in the Pehalwan case, but are facing problem in getting the production warrant of prime suspect Bishnoi, who is currently lodged in a high security jail in Ajmer. Preliminary investigation has revealed that Pehalwan was killed to avenge the murder of Gurlal Singh Brar in November 2020.A close relative of Brar in Canada allegedly hatched the conspiracy to kill Pehalwan in Faridkot. One of the assailants, arrested by the Delhi Police, is a relative of Brar.Last week, in a joint operation with the HP Police, the Faridkot police had arrested a close aide of Bishnoi, who played the key role in executing the plan besides providing shelter to the accused.Process on to bring them back||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2-shooters-held-in-faridkot-cong-leader-gurlal-singh-pehalwan-murder-case-240532

It has called for an affidavit on the issue by the incharge of the special task force.“The Director-General of Police/Additional Director General of Police, special task force, shall file an affidavit, stating as to whether contraband, specifically poppy husk, is being disposed of in a timely manner in terms of the directions issued earlier by the Supreme Court…,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh ordered. The direction came on a petition filed by a drugs case accused through counsel Ishan Gupta. Justice Amol Rattan Singh also called for details of poppy husk still lying with the state, “as has not been disposed of, which should have been disposed of in terms thereof”.In its judgment on the storage of seized narcotics, the apex court had ordered destruction to prevent recirculation. The court had, in fact, issued guidelines on the disposal of narcotic drugs, psychotropic and controlled substances. The apex court Bench, comprising then Chief Justice TS Thakur and Justice Kurian Joseph, had issued the directions to “avoid any confusion arising out of the continued presence of two notifications on the same subject”.The apex court had also requested the Chief Justices of the high courts across the country to appoint a committee of judges on the administrative side to supervise and monitor progress made by the respective states in regard to compliance of the directions.The HC had, subsequently, constituted a committee to oversee action taken on prompt disposal of contraband recovered by the police in view of the apex court guidelines.The counsels for the states of Punjab and Haryana, along with the Union Territory of Chandigarh, also undertook to comply with the Supreme Court directions “in letter and spirit”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-wants-affidavit-on-disposal-of-seized-contraband-240535

Built at a cost of Rs 5.59 lakh, the statue has been in controversy over its height and likeness to the martyr.A fortnight after writing to the CM seeking an inquiry into the “unauthentic” statue of the martyr, installed at Bhagat Singh Chowk, BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia has yet again sent a letter to the CM. Pointing out that the statue has no resemblance with the martyr, Kalia has demanded an inquiry into use of ‘cheaper’ material in violation of the terms of the tender.While the CM had ordered action on the basis of Kalia’s March 24 letter and sought a report, the BJP leader said some of the issues remained unaddressed. In his fresh letter to the CM on Friday, Kalia says: “I have raised the issue that the statue does not resemble with the authenticated photograph of Shaheed Bhagat Singh available in public domain, but the same has not been mentioned in the letter marked by your office to Principal Secretary, Local Government, for inquiry.“The Principal Secretary may kindly be directed to inquire whether the same quality of marble has been used as prescribed in the tender. I was given to understand that instead of marble, polystone material has been used to carve out the statue. The material is cheaper than the marble.”A 20-year-old bust of the martyr, erected on a pedestal, was replaced with the white statue on March 22, the eve of his death anniversary.Mayor Jagdish Raja said: “The statue had been made by a private company in Lucknow. It has been fashioned after the one in Parliament. Including the pedestal, the statue cost Rs 5.59 lakh.

Now, the state may have to set up a new investigation panel — seventh such body — after a Punjab and Haryana High Court order, into the Kotkapura police firing incident, where police fired at people protesting the sacrilege incidents. Though CM Capt Amarinder Singh has announced his government will contest the HC ruling in the Supreme Court, the investigation may be hit till the final decision is taken.The state is readying for the next year’s Assembly elections where the alleged denial of justice is set to surcharge the atmosphere. Already a number of prominent Congress leaders have demanded making public the police probe.The long series of incidents points to a deep-rooted conspiracy. After the June 1, 2015, incident of theft of “saroop” of Guru Granth Sahib, the second incident took place on September 24, 2015, when posters bearing derogatory language against the holy book were found pasted in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and Bargari villages. On October 12, several pages of the Guru Granth Sahib were found strewn in Bargari, leading to protests across the state, especially in Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura. On October 14, police opened fire at protesters, killing two.Initially, the police claimed the sacrilege was done at the behest of two youths in Australia who had funded the conspiracy to trigger riots between Sikhs and Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda followers. But the youths took to social media, explaining the money transfer being questioned. In November 2015, the SAD-BJP government handed over the probe to the CBI. However, before the CBI officially started the investigation, a three-member SIT announced the arrest of 10 persons, all followers of the dera, for carrying out the sacrilege incidents. One of the accused, Mohinderpal Singh Bittu, was later killed in Nabha jail. The CBI, however, dismissed the DIG’s report. In 2018, the CBI closed the case, saying it could not find any proof against the 10 persons.In 2017, the Congress government contested the CBI closure report. This led to another round of court battle where the government won and formed a five-member SIT, which included IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap as key investigator. On April 9, the HC quashed their investigation and ordered formation of a new team without IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap as member.

Investigations revealed that an elaborate team of CBI officials thronged the FCI godowns in three vehicles at about 5 am on Saturday. Having covered almost all units simultaneously, the officials called Manager Ashok Kumar along with his aides for verification of stocks and collection of samples from different stacks. Amarjit Vatish, who had recently been transferred to Mullanpur was also called later in the day.While the officials were still checking records and stocks at the time of filing this report, it was yet to be ascertained if the action would be concluded today. Further investigation revealed that the sleuths would take samples to their laboratories to check the quality of central food grain stocks pertaining to past years.A rice sheller owner, on condition of anonymity, said inputs by the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau had earlier given reports to the Centre that the rice sheller owners had been delivering substandard rice to the FCI in the central pool by conniving with the food agency officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/to-check-quality-cbi-raids-food-corporation-godowns-in-raikot-240545

A local TV channel, Seven News, reported the arrested accused person’s visa had expired and could be deported.“Sikhs identified by their turban were targeted because of tensions in India,” said the report, adding further arrests were imminent.Since September, local police officers have been investigating a number of incidents in Harris Park of Sydney, reported the Melbourne-based South Asia Times.The Indian has been charged with three counts of affray, three counts of armed with intent to commit indictable offence, two counts of destroying or damaging and assault.Detailing the three incidents, the New South Wales (NSW) police said in the first incident on September 16, a man was struck in the head with a baseball bat and then kicked when on the ground by a group of five men.On February 14, a man driving a car was allegedly attacked by a group of up to five men, holding sticks and other weapons.On February 28, a group of people travelling in a vehicle was allegedly attacked by up to 10 men, seriously damaging the vehicle.“We are very happy with the NSW Police and hope the culprits are caught.

It also said a police plea for further incarceration for the sole purpose of voice sampling was not justifiable.“The prosecution’s case rests largely on the contents of video recordings and footage available and accessible to all on social media sites in public domain, and there is therefore a remote possibility of the accused-applicant being able to interfere with the content on such platform,” the judge is reported to have said.Rejecting the prosecution’s contention that the accused might abscond if released on bail, the court is reported to have said: “The accused as per the own case of the prosecution is a well-known public figure with deep roots in society and such apprehensions are capable of being allayed by imposing stricter conditions.”It further said: “It would violate and infringe the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed to the accused, if the accused is denied bail in the present case on such nature of accusations and material only on the ground that the investigating agency is yet to establish the identity of the several other members of the unlawful assembly.”Granting bail, the judge directed the accused to deposit his passport with the investigating officer and appear in the police station as well as the court as and when required.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/deep-sidhu-granted-bail-240549

Farmers have been demanding financial aid from the government for their losses.As per sources, the department will conduct 2,350 CCEs across the state, but to date its officers have completed only 262 CCEs.During CCEs, officers have found that per hectare wheat production has seen a dip from average 50.04 quintal per hectare of last year to average of 49.37 quintal this year in various districts.Though the exact decrease and its reasons can be ascertained only after the end of purchase season and completion of all CCEs, the 67 kg per hectare decline is a wakeup call for many farmers demanding help from the government for diversification.“The vagaries of weather have led to the decline. The government should provide financial aid and proper market for other crops to promote diversification,” said Harwinder Singh, a progressive farmer from Bhadalwad village of the district.Some senior agriculture officers said smuggled wheat did not have any link with per hectare estimates of production of the state as they measure the production from their CCEs.They blamed high temperature and untimely rain in the past three months for the decline in crop production. The high temperature affected the wheat production at its ripening stage. Besides, pesticide-resistant weed in various parts had led to the decline at many places.“During the 262 CCEs, we have seen an average decline of 67 kg per hectare. It’s the initial trend and anything final can only be said after the end of CCEs and purchase season,” said Gurwinder Singh, Joint Director, Punjab Agriculture Extension.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wheat-production-drops-by-67-kg-ha-across-punjab-240557

Whenever the weather turns cloudy, we get terrified. Neither anything is being provided to cover the wheat nor the crop is being procured,” said Jagir Singh, another farmer.“There are several farmers who have completed all formalities but have not received any payment due to the slow processing of the e-portal,” Malkit Singh, another farmer, said.Deputy Commissioner Gurpal Singh Chahal said there was no shortage of gunny bags in the district. “Farmers are even receiving payments within the prescribed time. There might be one or two cases in which the payment may have been delayed, but this, too, will be sorted out soon,” he said.Chahal said: “I have instructed officials to make farmers aware of the Covid-19 vaccination and following the protocol to stay safe.”District Food Supply Officer Himanshu Kukkar said: “If there is any issue related to gunny bags, it will be solved soon.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nh-354-over-shortage-of-gunny-bags-240558

They also raised slogans against the agency.Talking to The Tribune, Malkit Singh, BKU Ugrahan block president, Jhunir, said, “Almost every village in the district has cultivated HD-2967 wheat variety due to its high yield, but FCI officials do not want to purchase it citing its colour. It does not make any sense, especially when the Central agency has been procuring the same during the previous seasons.”“With FCI officials denying to purchase and the threat of rain looming large, farmers are a worried lot as heaps of their produce are lying in the open and there is no space for keeping their produce in most of the mandis of the district. We will intensify our protest and continue to do so till the FCI starts making purchases of the wheat variety,” he said.Satya Prakash, mandi inspector, FCI, said, “The procurement has just started and it will take some time before things are streamlined. We cannot just start making procurement of this variety as we are not certain about it. There are stricter measures in place from the Centre this time and we have to follow a procedure to ensure that all quality parameters are being adhered to before we can make purchases.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fci-refuses-to-buy-wheat-variety-farmers-gherao-officials-in-mansa-240559

The Sikh community is devastated by this tragic incident," community leader Gurinder Singh Khalsa told PTI over the phone after meeting family members of the employees of the FedEx facility.Late Friday night, the Marion County Coroner's Office and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) released the names of the victims: Amarjeet Johal (66), Jasvinder Kaur (64), Amarjit Skhon (48) and Jaswinder Singh (68). The first three deceased are women. The IMPD said the coroner's office will determine the causes of death after autopsies are completed. Another Sikh, Harpreet Singh Gill, 45 was hit by a bullet near the eye and is now in the hospital.US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris expressed condolences over the tragic killings.“Vice President Harris and I have been briefed by our homeland security team on the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, where a lone gunman murdered eight people and wounded several more in the dark of night,” Biden said in a statement.Visiting Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, at the start of his bilateral meeting at the White House expressed his condolences to the victims and his sympathies to the families. “Innocent citizens must not be exposed to any such violence. Freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law are the universal values that link and are prevalent in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.Biden issued a proclamation in honour of the deceased. He ordered that the national flag be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all federal buildings.Khalsa said community members are in touch with officials. "Post 9/11, the Sikh community has suffered a lot. It is high time that strong measures be taken to bring an end to such mass shootings. Enough is enough," he said. Indiana has about 10,000 members of the Sikh community.Community leaders, like Khalsa, are engaged in philanthropic and charitable activities.“We have families in our country that are grieving the loss of their family members because of gun violence. There is no question that this violence must end. And we are thinking of the families that lost their loved ones,” Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters.The shooter allegedly turned his weapon on himself before law enforcement arrived at the scene. FedEx has confirmed that he was a former employee at the Indianapolis facility. No further information was released.This is the worst Sikh massacre in the US after the Oak Creek Gurdwara mass shooting in Wisconsin on August 5, 2012, where seven members of the community were killed.“This should be a wake up call for the entire country, in particular the Sikhs and Asian Americans, against whom there has been a sudden spurt in hate crimes,” Khalsa said.Not ruling out the possibility of a hate crime, Khalsa said community leaders are meeting on Saturday to discuss the tragic incident and the way forward.“We request the president of the United States that he needs to come forward and be serious about hate crimes, especially against the Sikh community because they are very vulnerable due their appearance and look,” he said.“The president should take it seriously -- gun controls, automatic semi-automatic guns -- they are very lethal,” he said.“We are deeply saddened by this latest killing in Indianapolis. It is very troubling to hear random mass shootings taking place in America almost every week. This kind of senseless killing and gun violence needs to stop,” Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion  and Education, told PTI.“I am heartbroken to confirm that my naniji (maternal grandmother), Amarjeet Kaur Johal, is among those killed in the senseless shooting at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis,” said Komal Chohan.“We are still working to identify others who were injured and killed on Thursday night. I have several family members who work at the particular facility and are traumatized. My nani, my family, and our families should not feel unsafe at work, at their place of worship, or anywhere,” she said.Although Sikhs began settling in Indiana more than 50 years ago, the first gurdwara was established in 1999. In the last two decades, the Sikh population around Indianapolis has experienced significant growth; today, there are 10 gurdwaras across the state and an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Sikh Americans who have made Indiana their home.“I am deeply shocked and saddened by the loss of eight FedEx employees following the tragic shooting at FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis. This FedEx facility was staffed by a large number of Asian Indian Sikh employees. I am saddened to know that at least four of those killed are members of the Indianapolis Sikh community,” said Democratic leader Ajay Jain Bhutoria.Meanwhile, the AAPI Victory Alliance has demanded an immediate investigation into whether or not these shootings were racially biased.
