The inquiry is being conducted in a completely fair and unprejudiced manner by the SIT under the leadership of Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, he said, adding that neither changing the officer nor setting up a fresh SIT at this stage was acceptable to his government.

Moreover, the relief comes in the election year where Akalis have already launched state-level rallies for the 2022 Assembly poll.The party immediately launched a tirade against Congress CM Capt Amarinder Singh, accusing him of using the investigation as political vendetta against the Akalis, especially the Badal family.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the High Court order had made it clear that the Chief Minister was not interested in finding the guilty and was using the case to implicate the Badal family. “We have been maintaining since day one that the entire investigation is being done with a malicious intent. Capt Amarinder Singh took an oath to take action against those responsible for the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib but has played with the sentiments of the people by indulging in a political investigation. He has wasted four years in this process.”Party insiders say the court verdict has almost washed the stains of the incidents. The party had ended up third in the 2017 Assembly elections behind the Congress and AAP. The poor show was largely attributed to the loss of face over sacrilege and police firing incidents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/shot-in-the-arm-for-akalis-237386

When I went back during the first lockdown, I struggled a lot to find a job.”Another labourer Hari Yadav from Gorakhpur said, “Harvesting season is starting in Punjab, so it is the time when we can earn some money. Moreover, nowadays, getting work is quite difficult, so we can’t leave the job midway. There is no question of going back.”No question of returning homeHarvesting season is starting in Punjab, so it is the time when we can earn some money.

Last time, after the curbs were relaxed, finding labour was a difficult task.”A Railways official said, “There is no rush of migrants in trains. Routine passengers are boarding the trains.”In Amritsar too, there is no visible panic among migrants to return to their native places.Rajesh, who works at an embroidery unit, said despite the fear of restrictions, he would not return home in panic. He said for a person with family, the travel cost was too much for a long distance. Ram Prakash, a power loom worker, said he was getting work for five days a week. With such a meagre income, it was not possible to afford travel cost of the entire family unless the government pitches in. “I am not being paid a fixed salary and the wages are decided on a piece-rate basis. Earning Rs 12,000 per month has become a difficult task after the lockdown. With this amount, it is difficult to feed a five-member family and bear education and medical expenses, besides paying the room rent,” he said.Ram Jagat, 61, working as a private security guard, is heading back to his native village in Sultanpur district of UP to take part in the elections as his cousin is contesting but there is no fear of lockdown.Ram Bhawan Goswami, general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Kalyan Parishad, Punjab, said, “There are 16 units in the district and each of them has at least 21 executive members, who have been instructed to tell migrants not to panic and adhere to Covid guidelines.

We are working to address it," Singh said at a Covid review meet called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi today.He said Punjab ranked 18th nationally on cumulative cases with an average of 3,000 cases a day for 15 days. “The number of cases is slightly stable now,” the CM said, adding: “Even in the graphs put up by the Health Ministry in the PM’s review meeting, Punjab curve appears to have flattened over the past fortnight.”Punjab is no longer among the 10 states contributing most to daily cases. The state has 27,200 active cases and a recovery rate of 87.1% against the national 90.80%. The CM said: “Deaths are a concern with 50-60 daily fatalities and case fatality rate a little under 2% against 1.28% nationally”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/vax-laxity-due-to-anger-over-farm-laws-cm-237401

The dharna on Aasoda side (KMP) was led by BKU (Ekta) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan, while activists of the BKU (Rajewal), All-India Kisan Sabha and other outfits camped on the Mandothi side.A majority of the protesters were those camping at Tikri-Bahadurgarh border while local participation seemed low as compared to the March 6 protest when farmers had blocked the expressway for five hours to mark the 100th day of their agitation.Despite hot weather, there was a considerable presence of women, especially elderly, at the BKU (Ugrahan) camp. “We are here for a decisive battle and will go back only after winning it,” said Jagjit Kaur, an elderly protester.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/adamant-farmers-block-expressways-237494

Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh said the state was left with five days of supply (5.7 lakh doses) if it inoculated up to 90,000 people a day or three days if the target of 2 lakh shots a day was achieved. Speaking at a virtual Covid review meet, Sonia held with the CMs of Congress-ruled states today, Capt Amarinder said the vaccine drive in Punjab had suffered due to people’s anger towards the Centre over farm laws.Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel said the vaccine stock would last three days, while Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said the stocks would exhaust in 48 hours. Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat said the state (which accounts for 40 per cent of the daily cases) could inoculate 5 lakh people daily if the Centre gave enough doses. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said they had vaccine for a week. Denying any shortage, the Centre said it was in talks with SII and Bharat Biotech to augment the supply.Punjab jab laxity due to farm lawsThe vaccine drive in Punjab has suffered due to people’s anger towards the Centre over farm laws.

These arhtiyas were probably misguided at that time by people who wanted to play politics, he said, adding that even though the money was yet to come from the FCI, his government would release it immediately, without waiting for it.He also assured the arhtiyas that his government would take up with the Centre the issue of 30 per cent deduction in labour payments made by the FCI.Amarinder thanked Vijay Kalra, president of the Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, for heeding his government’s plea to withdraw their proposed strike and lift the grain as the farmers would otherwise have suffered. He appealed to the arhtiyas to immediately start procurement and also take care of Covid norms. The government had to delay procurement this year till April 10 (from the previously scheduled April 1) on account of the second surge of Covid.The Chief Minister said that like last year, farmers would again be issued passes this year to reduce congestion at the mandis in view of the pandemic. He assured that farmer passes would be issued at the district level, strictly in consultation with the arhtiyas who are in the best position to know which farmer has harvested his crop and is ready to come to the mandi.Sharing the arhtiyas’ pain, which, he said, he could feel, the Chief Minister said he failed to understand why the central government was treating them and the farmers in such a shoddy manner. He recalled that the system of arhtiyas prevailed even when he was a kid, and visited mandis with his grandfather, and said it was inexplicable why the Centre wanted to ruin it. The arhtiyas are not middlemen but service providers, he said, adding that the private sector could function along with the existing system and there was no need to change it.Pointing to the 72 per cent increase in farmers’ earning, he attributed it to the combined efforts of the farmers and the arhtiyas. “Your contribution to the Green Revolution and filling of India’s granaries is unforgettable,” he told them, adding that he does not agree with anything that the Centre is doing on agriculture. He assured that all their concerns would be addressed, and all the commitments made to them fulfilled.Announcing the withdrawal of the strike in the interest of the state and the farmers, Kalra thanked Amarinder and his government for their support in their fight with the Centre. The Centre, he said, is penalising Punjab for the farmers’ agitation. Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told the Chief Minister that the arhtiyas simply wanted protection for their business and livelihood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/procurement-kicks-off-in-punjab-as-arhtiyas-call-off-strike-237296

Priority is test, track and vaccinate,” she said to CMs.Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, where Congress is in power in alliance and on its own have the highest burden of daily COVID cases nationally.Over 64 per cent of all COVID deaths in the last 14 days have happened in Maharashtra and Punjab.Case positivity rate is as high as 25 per cent in Maharashtra and 14 per cent in Chhattisgarh as against the national average of around 5 per cent.Key to COVID containment is extensive tests till case positivity falls below 5 per cent. WHO advises 140 tests per million per day until rate falls below 5 per cent.It’s feared that high burden states are missing infections as majority new cases are asymptomatic. At the meeting Punjab CM Amarinder Singh told Sonia that Punjab has only five days of vaccines left.“Punjab is left with only five days of supply (5.7 lakh Covid vaccine doses) at the current levels of vaccinating 85,000-90,000 persons a day. We have urged the Centre to share the schedule for supply of vaccines with the States over the next quarter based on their confirmed supply orders.”Hoping that the Centre would send fresh batches of vaccine supply soon, the Chief Minister said if the state is able to meet its target of 2 lakh vaccines a day, then its current supplies will last only three days. He said he had written to the Prime Minister and the Health Minister to give confirmed supply schedules.Despite being a slow-starter in vaccination, Punjab has vaccinated more than 16 lakh persons, at an average of around 85,000-90,000 per day, he said during the video conference.The meeting was attended by chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states, as well as senior party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi.Amarinder said people in Punjab were still not coming out in large numbers for the vaccination due to the massive anger prevailing against the Government of India on the issue of Farm Laws. He said since Punjab has majority population among the agriculture community, even the common man is affected by the farmers’ agitation, he said, adding “this anger is impacting the vaccination drive.” He said his government is undertaking an extensive media campaign to address the misinformation regarding Covid and vaccination hesitancy.  Ranking 18th in the country at present in terms of cases reported, Punjab is showing around 8 pc  positivity, with an average of around 3000 cases per days for the past 15 days, the Chief Minister apprised Sonia. The number of cases is slightly stable, he pointed out, adding that “this shows that the steps taken in the last three weeks are in the right direction.” Even in the graphs put up by Health Ministry in Prime Minister’s review meeting yesterday, the “curve appears to be flattened over the past fortnight,” he said, disclosing that the state currently has around 27,200 active cases with recovery rate of 87.1 per cent. CM said deaths are a concern for Punjab, with around 50-60 daily deaths with a little under 2 per cent Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the second surge. Overall, CFR is 2.77 per cent for all reported cases since March 2020, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/have-only-5-days-of-vaccine-left-punjab-cm-tells-sonia-at-covid-review-meet-237278
11-04-2021||---||HC quashes investigation in Kotkapura police firing case||Chandigarh, April 9Allowing a writ petition, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today quashed the investigation carried out by the state in the Kotkapura firing case.The High Court also directed the state to reconstitute the special investigation team without IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.The directions by Justice Rajbir Sehrawat came on a petition filed by Gurdeep Singh and another police official seeking the quashing of “subsequent” FIR registered in the Kotkapura firing case. Directions were also sought for removal of IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh from the investigation of the case.The Bench was told that the subsequent FIR dated August 7, 2018, for attempt to murder and other offences under Sections 307, 326, 324, 323, 341, 201, 218, 120B and 34 of the IPC registered at the Kotkapura city police station was illegal. Elaborating, senior advocate RS Cheema and Arshdeep Singh Cheema submitted that an FIR for the “same transaction” already stood registered on October 14, 2015, following incidents of sacrilege in the state.Probe stands exposedThe politically motivated investigation aimed at targeting senior Akali leaders, but the whole design stands exposed. Please note that the petitioner in the case was a police officer, not an Akali leader. —Dr Daljeet Singh Cheema, SAD spokesmanCM, AG must quitCM Capt Amarinder Singh and AG Atul Nanda should resign for failing to provide justice to Sikhs in the case. —Harpal Singh Cheema, AAP leaderThe petitioners also prayed for directions to the probing agency to carry out the probe into the initial FIR. The petitioners added a declaration was required to be issued that the probe in the subsequent FIR by the special investigating agency was illegal and impermissible and consequently, the final investigation report, too, was required to be quashed.It was added that the subsequent FIR was registered after nearly three years with regard to an occurrence that took place on October 14, 2015, on the statement of respondent Ajit Singh recorded in August last year, who admittedly never filed a complaint before any authority till he was actually summoned on the directions of high-ranking officers to give his statement leading to registration of the impugned FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-quashes-investigation-in-kotkapura-police-firing-case-236949
