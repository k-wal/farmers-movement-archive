03-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Amarinder writes to PM Modi, seeks continuation of existing mode of payment to farmers||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking continuance of the existing system of payment to farmers till a consensus can be evolved on the issue of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).Asserting that Arhtiyas are not middlemen between the farmers and the procurement agencies, but are service providers, the Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to ensure that the livelihood of the farmers and all others involved in the smooth procurement of food grains is not jeopardised.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Captain Amarinder also sought a meeting to apprise him about the concerns of various stakeholders about changing the existing payment system “before the situation gets out of hand”. On behalf of the Government of Punjab, he assured Modi of his complete support towards evolving a consensus amongst the stakeholders for long- term durable reforms.Expressing concern over recent efforts to “rock” the legally sanctioned, and well-established institutional and social arrangements through some guidelines and directives of the Government of India, the Chief Minister said he had noticed a pattern in some of the recent one-sided decisions and steps taken by the Government of India.He added that as a soldier and a farmer himself, he “would like to highlight the risks and threats that are likely to be posed for the ‘food security’ of the nation as a result of some of these decisions for being completely detached from ground realities of farming in this part of the country”. Recalling the role of the hard-working farmers of Punjab, Haryana and Western UP in ushering in the green revolution and ensuring national food security, he said that security systems and defenses are built over decades, but can be compromised and demolished in moments.“While I fully endorse the views that as a society, and as nation we have to continuously evolve and reform, and as the political leadership of the world’s largest democracy, we have to continuously think of improving, but I strongly believe that reforms are most successful and sustainable if carried out through a consultative process with all stakeholders, ensuring ownership of all,” the Chief Minister said in his letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-amarinder-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-continuation-of-existing-mode-of-payment-to-farmers-234190

The minister was attending a function at Sunami Gate.Sources said six members of the union came to the venue where the minister was expected for a function. They were refused entry at first, but two managed to enter later, sources said. Once inside, they began chanting slogans, which irked some of the Congress workers present at the function, the sources said.“We were protesting peacefully, but Congress leaders attacked us,” union leader Gursangat Singh said.“We are protesting for government jobs. It’s not a crime. But Congress leaders assaulted some of our members when they began raising slogans,” said Deep Banarasi, the union’s press secretary. The agitation, he said, would continue undeterred.  Congress however denied any of its workers were involved in the attack. Sangrur Market Committee chairman Anil Kicha said Congress workers had only asked them to leave the event peacefully and denied any use of force.“They’re making baseless allegations. No one from Congress attacked them,” said Kicha.The unemployed teachers’ union has been sitting on an indefinite protest in front of Sangrur Deputy Commissioner’s office since January 4 demanding jobs. The union has been demanding that the Punjab government give them preference while recruiting for the 10,000-odd ETT posts that are currently vacant.Among their other demands are withdrawal of extra marks given to education providers and volunteers, and exempting ETT qualified teachers from the age requirement rule.Members of five unemployed teachers’ union said meanwhile that they were going to gherao Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala on April 8.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ett-and-tet-pass-disrupt-ministers-function-accuse-congress-workers-of-assaulting-them-234178

Issuing a statement, the accused cleared his stand after Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) recoganise him to be a part of the Kisan Andolan. The accused—who is on the run—said that he has been fighting for the Punjabi language and the interests of Punjab to the best of his ability.  Sidhana added that they have become active in the farmers' struggles after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Central Government had "secretly and awkwardly" attacked the economy and future of the peasantry and farmers by introducing the three black agricultural laws. The implementation of these laws would have a detrimental affect on the economy of Punjab, Sidhana added. Lakha went on to clarify, that the decision to stand with the farmers' organisations were taken to give impetus to the peasant movement, and lead it to victory. He refuted the one-sided propaganda on social or print media, and clarified that the debate of his "apologizing was baseless and bogus". They were, are, and will remain with the peasant struggle. He added that his struggle was linked to the peasantry, and was appropriate to fight under the leadership of SKM leadership. Sidhana said that he would continue to play his due role, along with his colleagues, in every suitable program of Kisan Morcha. It was the duty of the farmer leaders to take into account the sentiments of the people, as every section of the society, was fully involved in this struggle, he said, adding that it was our duty to represent the sentiments of the new generation of Punjab. It is the farmer leaders' right to agree or disagree with the views of the youth. "We believe that disagreement should not be an obstacle in the ongoing struggle," said Sidhana.He also made it clear, that he would continue to oppose anyone who undermined the present peasant struggle due to fake fame and political ambitions.  "This struggle is not about any individual, and we should not rely on anyone person," he said.Now, this struggle has turned into a people's movement led by SKM, said Sidhana. He went on to appeal to the youth and other sections to take part in the success of the program given by SKM to convene Parliament in the month of May. This statement of Lakhan Sidhana was released to the media through Baba Hardeep Singh Mehraj—the organiser of Mehraj Rally, and his close aid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-laws-would-affect-punjabs-economy-lakha-sidhana-234174

03-04-2021||New Delhi||UK variant found in Punjab a potential threat: CSIR-CCMB Director||The UK variant of coronavirus found in Punjab is a potential threat due to its efficiency in spreading, while the double mutant found in Maharashtra is a matter of concern, but not a cause to create panic, suggested CSIR-CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra.Speaking with IANS, Mishra said the UK variant has contributed to the surge in cases in Punjab. "Somebody had travelled from the UK to Punjab, possibly in a group, and then people from this group would have gone to several places in Punjab, which has contributed to the surge," said Mishra.When asked why the UK variant has not been found majorly in cases in the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi, Mishra said that it may be those infected with the UK variant in Punjab have not travelled to places outside the state, or there has not been a superspreader event so far.However, it is a matter of time and there is a possibility that cases may show up later, Mishra noted.  The double mutant found in Maharashtra in 15-20 per cent COVID-19 samples sent for genome sequencing is a combination of two mutations—E484Q and L452R—the CSIR-CCMB Director said.The L452R was found in patients in California, where experts believed that it led to higher spread of Covid-19 as it was a more infectious strain, while the E484Q has been found in Maharashtra. Also, the E484Q shares similarities with the variants found in Brazil and South Africa, and it has resistance to vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca.   Mishra said the double mutant found in Maharashtra is certainly a matter of concern, but there should not be any panic now. He added that 452R was found in California, and it was considered to be more infectious, but we do not know what changes it has undergone so far. Also, the E484Q has not been studied well in India. He clarified that, for example, if double mutant is found in 50 per cent of cases in some pockets, then what is the cause for the other 50 per cent cases in the same pockets? "At this stage, we cannot link double mutant to the surge in cases in Maharashtra," said Mishra. He added that both vaccines, AstraZeneca and Covaxin, are working well against the Punjab variant and the double mutant found in Maharashtra. Mishra emphasised that people should continue to follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour—wearing masks, social distancing and hand sanitisation—to control the spread of the virus. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/uk-variant-found-in-punjab-a-potential-threat-csir-ccmb-director-234160
03-04-2021||New Delhi||MHA letter to Punjab govt is not to blame farmers over bonded labourers' issue: Centre||Noting that it has nothing against the farmers of Punjab, the Centre on Saturday issued a clarification saying that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) letter to the state Chief Secretary was only intended to highlight the issue bonded labourers in border villages and to seek appropriate action against human trafficking syndicates.In an official statement the MHA said, “A section of the media has erroneously reported that this Ministry has written to the Punjab Government allegedly leveling grave charges against the farmers of the state. These news reports are misleading and present a distorted and highly editorialised opinion of a simple observation about a socioeconomic problem emerging from four sensitive border districts of Punjab over a period of two years, which has been brought to the attention of this Ministry by the concerned CAPF.”The MHA further said no motive can be ascribed to a letter issued by the MHS to a particular state or states as this is part of routine communication over Law and Order issues. “This letter has also been forwarded to Secretary, Union Ministry of Labour & Employment with a request to carry out a sensitisation exercise in all States, with an aim to check the duping of vulnerable victims at the hands of unscrupulous elements,” it said.“Some of the news reports about the letter have juxtaposed in a totally unrelated context to conclude that the MHA has framed grave charges against the farmers of Punjab and has also connected this with the ongoing farmers’ agitation,” the statement read.The letter clearly and only states that “human trafficking syndicates” hire such labourers and they are “exploited, paid poorly and meted out inhuman treatment” besides luring them with drugs to extract more labour affecting their “physical and mental health”, it noted.Keeping in view the multi-dimensional and overwhelming enormity of the problem, the MHA has “only requested the State Government(s) to take suitable measures to address this serious problem”, it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mha-letter-to-punjab-govt-is-not-to-blame-farmers-over-bonded-labourers-issue-centre-234151

Documenting and depicting significant moments of the life of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the play focuses on presenting the Guru’s life story as a unique example in courage, secularism and self-sacrifice.“The idea is that we all have heads but not everyone has got sees. From his journey as a sage to his being selected as the next guru and years he spent meditating in Bakala, the play only highlights the most important moments from his life. His beheading at Chandni Chowk and how he came to the rescue of Kashmiri pandits before that are some of the most striking parts of the play,” shared Dhaliwal.While the play has the usual aspects of grandeur and larger-than-life design as found in Dhaliwal’s other works, one thing that stands out is that Guru Tegh Bahadur is not depicted physically throughout the play.“It’s a two-hour play and we have used the chorus and intangible elements in the narrative to portray Guru Tegh Bahadur.

03-04-2021||Chandigarh||e-payment blocked for years by arhtiyas, DBT row rages||Though most states have shifted to online procurement to plug deficiencies and ensure online payment to farmers, Punjab is one among the few which is resisting the change.The strong lobby of arhtiyas has successfully blocked the Centre’s idea of direct payment to farmers. The Centre, which is the main procuring agency for wheat and paddy of Punjab, has been consistently persuading the state government to opt for the direct payment to farmers instead paying them through arhtiyas.Rs1,500 cr goes as commissionIn Punjab, there are 47,000 registered arhtiyas and every year, they make around Rs1,500 crore just in commission for ‘facilitating’ the transfer of the Centre’s money to farmers.Around a decade and a half ago, during the last term (2002-07) of Capt Amarinder Singh, the state had principally decided to start the direct payment to farmers. But a day before the announcement, the government backtracked. Since then many governments have come and gone, but the direct transfer could not see the light of the day.Vijay Kalra, president, Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, said: “The real target behind the move is Punjab’s farmers as they are leading the agitation against the central farm laws.”However, economists have a different take on the issue. They feel the direct transfer system is not being implemented because arhtiyas are politically influential and are main funds raisers for all political parties. Prof Ranjit Singh Ghuman, an economist with CRRID, Chandigarh, says that it is not only the central government which has to unnecessarily pay a huge amount to arhtiyas, but the system also makes farmers vulnerable for plunder. “This system also gives birth to interlocking of trade. As arhtiyas often force farmers to purchase agricultural inputs from particular shops,” he says.The only way, Ghuman says, is the government should strengthen the institutional credit system. The need for services of arhtiyas was felt after the Green Revolution began and Punjab started turning into a food bowl of the country. In 1961, the commission rate for arhtiyas was just 1.5%. It was was hiked to 2% in 1990 and 2.5% in 1998.After the era of online financial transactions, the Centre, which is the main procuring agency for wheat and paddy, has been asking Punjab to do away with the arhtiya system. Much before Union Minister Piyush Goyal gave a deadline to the state government last week, two years ago, then Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Late Ram Vilas Paswan had also asked it to do away with the system.In 2018, during a meeting with Paswan, Capt Amarinder Singh had agreed to the need to put in place a system for the DBT for farmers. In a letter written on March 27, Goyal conveyed to the CM he didn’t expect payment through arhtiyas in the rabi season.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/e-payment-blocked-for-years-by-arhtiyas-dbt-row-rages-233870
03-04-2021||New Delhi||MHA alerts Punjab on bonded labourers in border districts||The Centre has alerted the Punjab Government and asked for “appropriate action” to deal with “illegal” and “inhuman” practice of engaging “mentally challenged” people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as bonded labourers by farmers in the border districts of the state, as it noted the BSF had informed the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) about rescuing 58 such workers.Given drugs, paid poorlyTerming this as a “serious problem”, the MHA in a communication to the Chief Secretary of Punjab, said the Border Security Force (BSF) had found these 58 people were brought to the state with the promise of good salary, but were exploited, given drugs and forced to work in inhuman conditions.Attempt to defame farmers, says SADChandigarh: The SAD has termed it an attempt to defame state farmers. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said such letters would send a wrong signal and create an atmosphere of confrontation. He said there were no FIRs of anyone being forced to work as a bonded labourer in any of the areas mentioned. “In fact, farmers pay labourers in advance for their services and that is why lakhs of migrants come to Punjab every year for planting of paddy crop,” he said, demanding withdrawal of the report. TNSIn the letter, a copy of which is with The Tribune, the MHA said, according to the inputs provided by the BSF, these labourers had been rescued in the past two years from the border areas of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Abohar.“During the course of questioning, it emerged most of them were either mentally challenged or in a feeble state of mind and have been working as bonded labourers with farmers in border villages of Punjab. Those rescued belong to poor family background and hail from remote areas of Bihar and UP,” the letter read.The BSF further informed “human-trafficking syndicates hire such labourers from their native places to work in Punjab on the promise of a good salary, but after reaching the state they are exploited and meted out inhuman treatment”, the MHA noted.To make them work in the fields for long hours, these labourers were often given drugs, which adversely affected their physical and mental condition, it said. The MHA asked the state to take “appropriate action” against the menacing trend and inform it on a priority basis about the action taken in the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mha-alerts-punjab-on-bonded-labourers-in-border-districts-233862

We will announce our future course of action there. The CM has taken a strong stand against the Centre’s decision on DBT. Even during his previous tenure, the CM had met then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee over the issue and it was resolved. Now, too, I have urged him to lodge a protest in front of the PMO as there is no benefit in writing letters.”Kalra further said leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, too, would attend the ‘mahasammelan’ at Bagha Purana. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hold-protest-outside-pmo-punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-urged-233873

He said working for the welfare of all sections of society, the BSP would end the outsource or contract system in government jobs. Further, the social security system for labourers would be strengthened to stop their exploitation at the hands of wealthy people, he added.Another senior party leader Vipul Kumar said the successive governments had failed in implementing the Mandal Commission report for the past 30 years. “This is an injustice towards the poor and backward people of Punjab.” The state government had also failed in keeping a check on the illegal mining, he added.Meanwhile, state BSP president Jasvir Singh Garhi said after forming the government, Punjab would be promoted as the industrial hub on the pattern of China.Later talking to mediapersons, Garhi repeated his invitation to Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu to join them.

By winning 49 of 50 wards, the responsibility of the Congress has increased. It is the responsibility of the new councillors to ensure an all-round development without any discrimination. The supply of clean drinking water is a major problem, it needs to be resolved soon,” the PPCC chief said.Jakhar also rejected the pre-poll surveys and claimed that no party could challenge the Congress that would contest the next Assembly polls under the command of Capt Amarinder Singh.He said preparations had been made to start the purchase of wheat from April 10, but the intention of the central government didn’t seem clear as the cash credit limit was still to be released. He apprehended that during the procurement of paddy in October, the Modi government could create more obstacles for the farmers as the Assembly elections were expected in December.Local Congress leaders thanked the PPCC president for getting more than Rs 200 crore released by the state govt for development work here.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/meet-pm-modi-get-farm-laws-repealed-sunil-jakhar-to-punjab-bjp-leaders-233878

Then Guru Tegh Bahadur went to Delhi and sacrificed defending Kashmiri Hindus from persecution and hostility. “Today, during the regime of the BJP and RSS, even in Uttar Pradesh, the minority religions are feeling threatened as these post-Independence rulers are following in the footsteps of Aurangzeb”, he said.Bhurakohna alleged the Sikh history, principles and doctrines of Sikhism were being secretly tampered with by the RSS and that the resolution passed by the SGPC against it was in the interest of the country and the Constitution.“Everyone in the country has the right to practice their religion. Whenever anyone would try to disrupt the unity and integrity of the country with the doctrine of a single religious nation and create a threat to the minority religions, the SGPC, would continue to pass resolutions against such ideologies”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-bjps-remark-on-rss-move-irresponsible-233881

Similarly, outsiders from Rajasthan and Jammu had teamed up with Congress legislators to form a sand mafia. All Congressmen who had indulged in scams and looted the state exchequer would be taken to task once the SAD forms the government,” he said.He also accused the CM of backstabbing farmers by promising and amending the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees in 2017 and also being part of the process of finalising the three agricultural ordinances as part of the committee formed for the process. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illegal-liquor-trade-mining-cost-punjab-rs-6-500-cr-sad-233887

Even during the lockdown, he supplied flowers and met whatever little demand was there, as the supply from other parts of the country totally dried up.“Marigold flowers are in great demand in Bathinda. Normally, I fetch around Rs 45-50 per kg, but due to the wedding season these days, I am getting around Rs 70-75 a kg. During Diwali or Gurpurb, the price soars to Rs 100 per kg as the demand is high,” says Avtar Singh.He says the marigold farming is a profitable proposition as 40 quintal of flowers are produced on two acres as compared to 60 quintal of paddy and 40 quintal of wheat in the same area. Avtar Singh says he, along with his brother, does all the work and saves on the labour cost.

This comes at a time when the teacher-student ratio in government schools across the state is quite poor.Resham Singh Khemuana, president, Democratic Tecahers’ Front, said: “On the one hand, the Education Minister and senior department officials make claims of a transparent online transfer policy, while on the other, shifting of 22 teachers to a single school when 28 are already serving there raises a serious question mark over its functioning.”Bhupinder Singh Maisarkhana, union’s block president, said: “The transfer orders do not make logical sense. It reflects how teachers use political influence to get choice postings. There are schools where single or two teachers take all classes. While in this school, the department is sending 22 teachers against two vacancies.”“The department must resolve the matter on a priority basis, else we will launch an agitation,” he said. A schoolteacher said: “We fear with surplus posting, the serving teachers may be made sacrificial lambs.”DEO (Elementary) Shiv Pal Goyal said: “We have been discussing this matter with senior officials of the department and a decision would be taken after due consultation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/22-teachers-shifted-against-2-vacancies-in-punjab-233895

The alleged recovery of contraband shown to have been carried out at his instance around 7:30 pm the same day was, as such, “absolutely planted”.Justice Batra issued notice of motion to the state and other official respondents, which was accepted by Additional Advocate-General Mehardeep Singh. Justice Batra also observed that the court on December 23, 2020, had ordered the DGP to look into and decide a representation moved by the petitioner’s wife, following which the Bathinda IGP submitted a report after constituting a committee.Justice Batra also reproduced in his order the report, which talked about the return of the electronic evidence and also stated that petitioner Rajpreet Singh and another person were stopped on suspicion on December 3, 2020. SHO Bikramjit Singh, along with a police party, reached the spot. The petitioner and the other person were made to sit in a government vehicle. When they were proceeding towards the police station, they met two persons. Bikramjit Singh allowed both the accused to go without following the due procedure on their assurance given to the police.Subsequently, accused-petitioner was again apprehended by the police under Bikramjit Singh and “Tramadol Hydrochloride” was recovered. “The respondent-state is directed to file a status report by way of an affidavit of respondent-DGP, explaining each and every aspect of the matter in question…,” Justice Batra directed, while fixing the case for April last week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/explain-action-in-drugs-case-high-court-to-punjab-dgp-233899

He has been granted war injury pension for life with effect from September 22, 2018. However, he is contending that his pension should be applicable from the date of his discharge from service.While disposing of the case earlier, the Tribunal had observed that the medical proceedings for re-categorisation held in 2000 were not valid as per the medical regulations because a single doctor had upgraded the petitioner to a higher category whereas the process should have been done by a medical board comprising two members. The Tribunal had directed the Army to hold a fresh medical board to assess the disability of grenade splinter wounds to chest and abdomen. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jawan-gets-war-injury-pension-as-aft-steps-in-233900

The court said in case he found any deficiency in the documents, he could apprise the court so that the prosecution could be directed to rectify it.After the court of Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMIC), Faridkot, had committed the challans in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan for trial before the sessions court last week, the latter had summoned all accused for today. The Additional District and Sessions Judge has adjourned the case to April 27 for further hearing.At the time of Saini’s appearance before the ADJS today, the public prosecutor sought court’s permission for summons to the former DGP in the court. After this, the police served summons to Saini in Kotkapura case also. The public prosecutors for the special investigation team (SIT) of the Punjab Police in the court of JMIC on March 26 had alleged that the former DPG was intentionally evading the summons in the Kotkapura case.On that day, the JMIC had ordered that in case Saini did not appear in the court despite the issuance of summons, the court would proceed further as per law.After he was served the summons in the Kotkapura case today, Saini appeared before the court of JMIC, Faridkot. Saini expressed his desire to submit bail and surety bonds in the Kotkapura case. However, the court observed that while staying the arrest of the former DGP on March 22, the High Court had issued no directions regarding furnishing bail and surety bonds by the accused.

Patients are evaluated first through tele-consultation and only those requiring further evaluation and examination are called to the OPD by appointment.Dr Naveen Pandey, in-charge of the OPD Administration at PGI said, “The tele-consultation is open between 8 am and 9.40 am. We have one tele-consultation number with 21 lines. The institute registers over 2,500 patients through telephone. This means, one patient is registered through telephone every minute.”“Those patients who face difficulty in registering through telephone can also register online, which is available 24X7,” said Dr Pandey.On expanding OPD services, he said tele-consultation was time consuming in comparison to physical OPDs as doctors spend around 10 minutes on each patient. This includes sharing of reports over WhatsApp, etc.The doctors are calling patients till 5-6 pm in the evening, and expanding OPD services seems difficult at the moment, he said.Prof Jagat Ram, Director, PGI, said, “In days prior to Covid, OPDs at PGI witnessed a daily footfall of 10,000 to12,000. Catering to this mammoth load through tele-consultation is very tough, but we are trying our level best and reaching out to almost 50 per cent of our patient load, considering that over 4,500 to 5,000 patients are either given consultation over phone or through physical examination.”“Though we have tried to increase the number of lines to facilitate patients, still there is a long way to go.”“At times patients with routine health issues also want consultation at PGI. However, this being a tertiary care hospital, ideally, only those patients requiring tertiary care should be catered to. All this leads to patient load much beyond the expectations and hence any facilitation or service falls short of the demand,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tele-consultation-appointments-add-to-agony-of-patients-at-chandigarhs-pgi-233868

03-04-2021||Arun Sharma||Papers of ambulance carrying Mukhtar Ansari fake||Tribune News ServiceRopar, April 2The working of Punjab Police has again come under the scanner over Uttar Pradesh MLA Mukhtar Ansari being taken from the Ropar jail to a Mohali court in a private ambulance, that too allegedly registered on a fake address at Barabanki in UP.The BSP legislator from Mau, who is wanted in his home-state for various criminal cases, was on March 31 produced before the court in connection with an extortion matter. The Ropar police claimed no rules were broken in allowing the use of a private ambulance. It feigned ignorance about the fake documents.SSP Akhil Chaudhary said Ansari had obtained orders from a court in UP in 2017-18 for use of a private ambulance for court attendance, for which expenses were to be borne by him. “Punjab Prisons (Attendance in Court) Rules, too, allow for a separate conveyance, provided the prisoner pays for it,” he added.An escort team under the supervision of a DSP-rank officer was deputed for producing Ansari at the court.The Supreme Court had recently directed the Punjab Government to hand over Ansari’s custody to the UP Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues. Following the directions, Ansari’s counsel had moved an application seeking examination by a medical board for “acute ailments and medical distress”. It was rejected by the Mohali court.Barabanki SP Yamuna Prasad said the ambulance was registered in the name of a hospital and a voter I-card and PAN card were procured for the fake documentation. A case has been registered against hospital caretaker Dr Alka Rai, who called it a conspiracy to malign her and that she did not have a hospital at the given address. She said she was preparing to lodge a complaint against Ansari.The Punjab Police had earlier too courted controversy over Ansari. As his custody was denied to the UP Police multiple times, last month the Opposition had raised the issue in the Assembly, accusing the state government of shielding him by keeping him in a Punjab jail. The Ropar police had also named Ansari in a six-year-old case of murder of a labourer citing allegations levelled by the sister of the deceased. She, however, denied having recorded such a statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/papers-of-ambulance-carrying-mukhtar-ansari-fake-233967

03-04-2021||New Delhi||India to counter Sikhs For Justice complaint before UN body||India is attempting to counter a complaint against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah by the banned Sikhs For Justice before the UN-OHCHR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights).India’s Permanent Mission in Geneva has sensitised the Office of the UNHCR about the activities of the organisation whose complaint it has accepted, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at his maiden press conference here on Friday.The UN-OHCHR has accepted a complaint filed against PM Modi and Shah by SFJ “directing and ordering the killing, beating, detention, abuse and torture of the protesting Sikh farmers of Punjab” during the R-Day tractor rally to Red Fort.The complaint was filed on March 30 on behalf of the surviving family members of Navreet Singh who was killed on R-Day and more than 88 victims who suffered injuries, detentions and charges.The MEA pointed out that the SFJ is involved in anti-national and subversive acts with the intention to disturb the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India.“It is encouraging and aiding secessionist activity and supporting separatist groups fighting for this purpose in India and elsewhere. This has been suitably conveyed to the UN-OHCR,” said Bagchi.The MEA will be try to discourage the UN-OHCHR from issuing an “Allegation Letter” to New Delhi, as is being lobbied by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, ‘General Counsel’ to SFJ.SFJ has claimed that it has also donated $10,000 to the UN-OHCHR to support its work in the area of human rights.Other sources said this was yet another caper to gather publicity by the largely-on-paper organisation by targeting big political leaders in India. In October last year, they recalled, a US court dismissed a $100-million lawsuit filed by SFJ against PM Modi and Shah.In December, no one turned up in response to the SFJ’s call to gherao the Indian High Commission in London.On Republic Day this year, SFJ caused only a brief commotion in front of the Indian Embassy in Rome on Republic Day.The SFJ’s “Referendum 2020’’ had a hard landing after it failed to get any traction in the expatriate community while the Indian authorities turned the screws by charge sheeting several pro-Khalistani supporters including Pannun, Avtar Singh Pannun, Harpreet Singh and Kulwant Singh Mothada.India has also issued a Mutual Legal Assistance Request to the US for investigations in “Referendum 2020”.SFJ was outlawed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in July last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/india-to-counter-sikhs-for-justice-complaint-before-un-body-233668
03-04-2021||Barabanki/Chandigarh||Papers of ambulance in which BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari went to Mohali court 'fake'; Punjab Police clarify||The UP Police have lodged an FIR, saying fake documents were used to register the ambulance, which recently ferried gangster-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari from a Punjab jail to a court in that state.The ambulance had the registration number of UP’s Barabanki and was used to ferry Ansari from Punjab’s Rupnagar jail to a Mohali court on March 31.Amid a row over the issue, a Punjab Police official clarified that an inmate can be transported in a private ambulance on medical grounds and the cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner.The BSP MLA from Mau, who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was produced before the Mohali court in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion case.Ansari was taken to the court in a wheelchair. He was sent back to the Rupnagar jail, where he is lodged since January 2019.“After an initial probe, the name and address given for the registration of the ambulance were found to be false. An FIR in this regard has been registered by an additional road transport officer against Dr Alka Rai, whose name was given for the registration of the ambulance,” a senior police official said in Barabanki.An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using documents as genuine), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).Superintendent of Police Yamuna Prasad said acting on media reports that Ansari was produced in a court in Punjab on an ambulance with the registration number of Barabanki, police teams probed the matter and found that documents such as PAN, electoral photo ID card and others were fake.The address on which these documents were made was also found to be wrong, he said.However, the Punjab Police official said if an inmate has any medical condition, then he can be taken in a private ambulance, subject to due diligence by the security in-charge. The cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner, he said.According to the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Court) Rules, 1969, police can allow a private vehicle on the request of a prisoner, the official added.It was also clarified that ambulance in which Ansari was taken to the court on March 31 was not a bullet-proof vehicle. Meanwhile in UP’s Mau, Dr Alka Rai, the manager of Shyam Sanjivini Hospital there, said that she had nothing to do with the ambulance and termed it as a conspiracy of Mukhtar Ansari and her rivals. Dr Rai, who visited the Mau Kotwali police station on Friday, gave a complaint to police in this regard and appealed to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice.The Supreme Court had recently directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said that a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be a helpless bystander when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The court had said the custody of Ansari, a BSP MLA from the Mau constituency, be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh.The apex court had also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in various cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, lodged in Uttar Pradesh and out of them, 10 cases are at the trial stage.Mukhtar Ansari’s wife has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, expressing fears that he might be killed in a fake encounter while being transferred from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh following a Supreme Court direction.His brother, BSP MP from Ghazipur, Afzal Ansari told PTI, “To divert attention from the life threat to Mukhtar, BJP government is making wheelchair and ambulance as an issue.”  “If the BJP is making Mukhtar Ansari (2022) election agenda, we and our supporters will also make vindictive action of the government against their family an issue,” he said.Asserting that Mukhtar Ansari has been ill for the past two years, his brother said that if there is any shortcoming in the documents of the ambulance, a fine could be imposed.Meanwhile, a Mohali court has rejected a plea of Mukhtar Ansari who sought directions to jail authorities to constitute a medical board for examining him.The court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (JMIC) Amit Bakshi said the Supreme Court has already considered Ansari’s plea regarding his medical condition.“There is nothing on record which can suggest that after the apex court order on March 26 there have been any fresh medical issues with the accused,” the Mohali court judge said.
