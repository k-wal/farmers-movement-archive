Scheduled Caste widows/divorcees are also entitled to the benefit at the time of their re-marriage.Muslim girls were in the list even in 2006, and if they have been inadvertently left out, they should be added, he directed the department.The latest increase will benefit 60,000 beneficiaries, putting an addition burden of 180 crore on the state exchequer, said the spokesperson.Social Welfare Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot congratulated the chief minister for the various measures taken for the empowerment of the vulnerable sections of the society.To avail the benefit, the annual income of the family from all sources should not exceed Rs 32,790. The parents/guardians of the girl should be domiciled in Punjab and the financial assistance under this scheme is limited to two girls only from one family.The applicant is required to submit application for getting financial assistance in the prescribed proforma before the date of marriage or 30 days after the marriage of the girl.Approves restructuring of Languages DepartmentIn a bid to bring greater efficiency in the functioning of the Languages Department, the Punjab Cabinet also approved its restructuring plan for creation of 13 new posts in lieu of 61 non-essential surrendered posts thus reducing burden on the state exchequer.The Cabinet authorised the chief minister to approve the notifications regarding amendment in service rules, to be prepared in consultation with the Personnel department and Punjab Public Service Commission.The restructuring proposal, prepared by the Languages Department in line with the instructions of Finance Department, has been approved the Cabinet as per the recommendations of the Officer’s Committee headed by the Chief Secretary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-paves-way-for-hike-in-ashirwad-scheme-to-rs-51-000-245455

28-04-2021||Balwant GargFaridkot||Kotkapura firing: After HC verdict, sessions court consign case file to record room||About 20 days after Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed the investigation and the charge sheet in the Kotkapura police firing case of October 2015, the court of Faridkot Additional District and Sessions Judge Harbans Singh Lekhi on Wednesday consigned the case file to the record room.The court orders came here after the counsel for accused Charanjit Singh, former SSP Moga and Baljit Singh, an SP rank officer, moved applications for exemption of their personal appearance and filed applications for dropping the proceedings against the accused in view of High Court’s April 9 orders.The counsel pleaded as the investigation and charge sheet presented in this case was quashed, so proceedings of the case against the accused may be dropped.In this criminal case, registered under section 307, 323, 341, 148, 149 of IPC and Section 27 of Arms Act, many police officers and former SAD (B) MLA from Kotkapura were nominated as accused.In the high profile case, the High Court has quashed the investigation and the charge-sheet filed by Kunwar Vijay Partap, an IGP rank officer. While the IGP has opted for voluntary retirement from police service after the High Court verdict, it has set the political leaders in the state in a political “brick-batting”.In its order, issued by the court on Wednesday, the court observed that the High Court orders were verified. The perusal of the record shows that FIR No.129 of August 7, 2018, registered under Sections 307,323,341,148,149 IPC and Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959, was registered against unknown on the statement of Ajit Singh, a resident of village Ghania in Barnala. This case was registered about three years after the firing incident at Kotkapura.The court order reads that vide DDR No.45, on January 28, 2019, an offence under Sections 148,149 IPC was deleted and an offence under Sections 201,218,34 and 120-B IPC was added. Then vide DDR No.36 dated, May 18, 2019, an offence under Sections 324,326 of IPC was added.During the investigation, Paramraj Singh Umranangal, Charanjit Singh, Mantar Singh Brar, SI Gurdeep Singh, DSP Baljit Singh and Paramjit Singh Pannu were nominated as accused having found involved in the occurrence and after completion of an investigation conducted by the Special Investigation Team (SIT), challan was presented against them in the Court of learned Illaqa Magistrate, Faridkot on May 27, 2019.This challan was committed to the Court of Sessions on August 3, 2019, and the case was pending for awaiting supplementary challan filed against another accused Sumedh Singh Saini and arguments on charge.The court observed that the charge-sheet and investigation, in this case, has been quashed and the investigation of the case has been ordered to be conducted by a Special Investigation Team of senior police officers, to be constituted by the State Government and to submit the final report of investigation to the concerned Magistrate.So, now in view of the above order passed by the High Court, the commitment order passed by the Court of learned Illaqa Magistrate, Faridkot, does not survive and this Court has become functus officio and cannot proceed further to deal with this case, said the court, while consigning the file to the record room.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kotkapura-firing-after-hc-verdict-sessions-court-consign-case-file-to-record-room-245416

On Tuesday, nearly 15 legislators met the CM to give their views on the issue, besides listing failure to control the sand and transport mafia.The meeting gains significance in the wake of reports of some MLAs approaching the party high command over failure to counter the narrative of party’s “friendly match” with Akalis. As the MLA flagged the issue as they had to face people in the 2022 Assembly elections, the CM is learnt to have allayed their fears saying there was no failure on part of the government in not defending the case.The legislators were also briefed about constituting a fresh SIT as per the court directions. Among the MLAs who met the CM were Kiki Dhillon, Kuljit Nagra, Raja Warring, Parminder Pinki, Harvinder Laddi, Gurkirat Kotli and Darshan Brar. More MLAs are expected to meet the CM over the next two days.Sources said after fireworks at yesterday’s Cabinet meet that saw PCC chief Sunil Jakhar and Sukhjinder Randhawa offering resignations over government’s failure to address the issue, the exercise was more about keeping the MLAs in the loop in the wake of disquiet on the sacrilege and police firing cases.

If anyone wants to deviate, they can announce their separate programme. — Joginder Singh Ugrahan, BKU chief“They claim to have the support of 35 lakh youth. Khalistani money and power is supporting them. They should go to Parliament and get the farm laws repealed. If they are able to do it, we will follow them else they fall in line,” said Ugrahan.Talking to The Tribune over phone, BKU (Sidhupur) president Jagjeet Singh Dallewal said: “Only Joginder Singh Ugrahan can answer to whom he is referring, but if you see his entire speech, it is clear it is based on his ideology, which he follows, whereas we are fighting against only farm laws.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fissures-in-farm-unions-over-parliament-march-245223

As against 20 per cent of the total wheat that the central food agency has been allotted to procure, it has so far bought just eight per cent.Figures available with The Tribune show that of the 95.37 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of wheat procured till Tuesday evening, the FCI has bought just 8.03 LMT, against an allotted target of 26 LMT. The state procurement agencies — PUNGRAIN, Punjab State Warehousing Corporation, Markfed and PUNSUP — have together procured 87.34 LMT of wheat.Not shying away from purchaseThe FCI is not shying away from wheat purchase. We are buying foodgrain in all 400 mandis allocated to us. Our purchase is corresponding to the wheat arrival in mandis allotted to us. — AS Thind, GM, FCI, PunjabIn the past many years now, the purchase by the FCI is less than the target set for it. Last year, against the target of 20.25 LMT, the FCI actually directly purchased 14.19 LMT in Punjab.The reason behind the FCI’s rather slow wheat procurement this year is not just the adherence to quality checks set by the agency for buying wheat, but also that many of the mandis allotted to the FCI are the ones where wheat arrivals are traditionally less.FCI’s General Manager, Punjab Region, AS Thind said the quality norms followed by them were the same as the state government agencies.Officials in the state government said being an election year, the mandis that traditionally had lesser wheat arrivals were allotted to the central agency, mainly because it pays only 70 per cent of the MSP upfront and releases the remaining dues later, after deducting packing and labour charges.Though FCI officials said they had no knowledge about this aspect, they said the reason for the less purchase so far was because of the government decision to reduce their target.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fci-lags-in-procurement-in-punjab-245221

By attacking the Congress, the Chief Minister of his own government, Sidhu wants to join some other party, said Capt Amarinder, adding, “But neither BJP nor Akalis will take Sidhu. He has limited choice, either stay in the Congress or join AAP”.The Chief Minister’s clear line on Sidhu seems to bring to an end not only the efforts by party’s Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat to rope him back, it also signals the start of a cold war between the two leaders. — TNSStop doubting my abilitiy to leadIf Sidhu has any doubt about my capability to lead the government, he should test the ground by contesting the election against me from Patiala. If he has any issue, he should talk to me. — Capt Amarinder Singh, CMFight is for justice, Punish the guiltyMy soul is Punjab and Punjab’s soul is Guru Granth Sahib Ji ... our fight is for justice and punishing the guilty.

Another ventilator was donated by a local NGO to the Civil Hospital last year, however, it was shifted to a private hospital, after it remained dysfunctional for a long time.“Members of our NGO had donated money from their pockets to purchase the ventilator for the hospital. However, after gathering dust for months, it was shifted to a private hospital,” said Rajinder Malhotra, NGO president.The NGO had provided Rs 5 lakhs to the Deputy Commissioner for the purpose. In the absence of functional ventilators, critical patients are either being referred to the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, or to private hospitals, where the ventilators are available.Some patients have to eventually move to Ludhiana or other towns for treatment. Sources said at least four trained persons were required to operate a single ventilator in three shifts with one person in surplus, and if all of them were to be made functional, almost 30 paramedics were required.Dr Rajinder Raj, Chief Medical Officer, said she had written to the higher authorities regarding the shortage of manpower. “Hopefully, we will get additional trained staff soon,” she said.As per information, around 250 ventilators were provided by the Central Government at an estimated cost of Rs 30 crore under the PM Cares Fund last year in March, but many of them were not being used and lying unpacked in the stores. Senior Health officials admitted there was an acute shortage of trained staff, who could operate the ventilators, but the process to recruit them had reportedly not been initiated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/staff-crunch-at-ferozepur-civil-hospital-seven-ventilators-gather-dust-245189

This medical college has long-time oxygen-supply contract with the firm.However, before this oxygen tank was unloaded at Faridkot, a police team reached the spot, asking the medical college authorities to shift this tank to Amritsar.The Faridkot medical college authorities strongly opposed shifting of this oxygen tank to Amritsar as it was meant for Faridkot college where more than 265 Covid patients were under treatment.
