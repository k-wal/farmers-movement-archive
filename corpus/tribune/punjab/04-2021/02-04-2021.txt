Farmers of Punjab pay labourers in advance for their services and that it why lakhs of migrant workers come to Punjab every year for planting of paddy crop,” said the SAD leader.

02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali court rejects Ansari's plea for medical examination||A Mohali court has rejected a plea of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari who sought directions to jail authorities to constitute a medical board for examining him.The court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (JMIC) Amit Bakshi said the Supreme Court has already considered Ansari's plea regarding his medical condition."There is nothing on record which can suggest that after the apex court order on March 26 there have been any fresh medical issues with the accused," the Mohali court judge said.No separate order to constitute a board for treatment of the accused is required to be passed, the judge wrote in his March 31 order.Ansari, wanted in Uttar Pradesh for several cases, was on Wednesday produced before the Mohali court in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion matter. He was in a wheelchair when he was brought to the court.Ansari, through his counsel Raj Sumer Singh, had moved a plea in the court for directing the jail authorities to get him medically examined due to "acute ailments and medical distress".The counsel had also claimed that the accused suffered a "medical" emergency on March 29, 2020, and since then he has been suffering from "acute chest pain".Ansari had a previous medical condition and had also suffered two major heart attacks. It was feared that if he was denied proper medical assistance, he might succumb to his medical ailments, it was further submitted.The counsel had also sought a reply from the Rupnagar jail superintendent before deciding the application.The counsel also mentioned in the plea while referring to the March 26 Supreme Court order that as the MLA from Mau had to travel to Uttar Pradesh, keeping in view his medical condition, he be treated through a recognized government medical hospital in Mohali by constituting a board.The Mohali court judge in his order said, "No reply on behalf of the jail superintendent would be required as the jail superintendent was duty-bound as per law to provide appropriate medical facility to the accused as per his medical condition (if any), as per the jail manual and also to comply with the order dated March 26 of the apex court." The court also directed that as Ansari is in judicial custody in the present case, therefore, the jail superintendent, at the time of transferring the custody of the accused to UP as per directions of the apex court, will mention that he be produced through video conferencing on April 12 in the present case.Ansari has been lodged in Rupnagar district jail in Punjab since January 2019 in connection with an alleged extortion case.Also read: Papers of ambulance in which BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari went to Mohali court fake, FIR lodged: UP policeOn March 26, the Supreme Court directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying the custody was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said that a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts should not be a helpless bystander when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy had said the custody of Ansari be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda District Jail in UP.The apex court also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in several cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, which were lodged in Uttar Pradesh. Out of these cases, 10 are at the stages of a trial. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mohali-court-rejects-ansaris-plea-for-medical-examination-233630

However, the BFUHS came across many cases last month where students from private institutions paid a heavy fee to shift to other institutions for their internship.To give the NOCs, some parent colleges forced each student to pay up to Rs 3 lakh. Internship should be completed in the teaching hospital affiliated with the medical institutions where the student was enrolled for his/her MBBS training, said Dr Vanikar in the letter to all medical colleges.In the event of any difficulty due to the pandemic, the internship could be completed at another NMC-approved medical college hospital subject to the satisfaction of the college authorities and the university concerned where the student was enrolled for the MBBS training, said Dr Vanikar, adding that no charges should be levied on the student for completing the internship.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-charge-students-for-internship-migration-nmc-233507

It appears that a very casual approach is adopted and priority is not given to the cases where the accused are in long custody,” Justice Sangwan asserted.As the petition filed by Ashwani Kumar against the state of Punjab and other respondents came up for hearing, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that more than three years had lapsed yet only one of the 10 prosecution witnesses had been examined, even though that charges were framed in March 2019.Justice Sangwan asserted an explanation was sought from the Kapurthala Senior Superintendent of Police, as well as the trial court, on the delay in recording the prosecution evidence. In an affidavit pursuant to the directions, it was stated on behalf of the police that the summons issued to the prosecution witnesses were received unserved as some of the police officials were transferred from their present place of posting. The trial judge also submitted a report stating that the statements could not be recorded as the summons/bailable warrants were not executed on the police officials. Thereafter, the work could not start following the pandemic.Without commenting on the merits of the case and considering the fact that the petitioner was not involved in any other case and was in custody for more than three years, Justice Sangwan asserted the court deemed it appropriate to grant him the concession of regular bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-slams-police-trial-courts-for-very-casual-approach-233505
02-04-2021||---||High Court raps VC, says Panjab University being run as ‘one-man show’||Chandigarh, April 1In a scathing indictment of the Panjab University vice chancellor, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the orders putting off indefinitely Senate-2020 elections were passed to usurp its powers.“The respondent, being the vice chancellor, to usurp the powers of the Senate, appears to have chosen a way out and in this scheme has managed to pass orders, thereby putting off the Senate elections, 2020, indefinitely…,” Justice Fateh Deep Singh asserted.In his 13-page order on a petition by Prof Keshav Malhotra and others through senior counsel RS Cheema and advocate R Kartikeya, Justice Fateh Deep Singh also noticed the allegations that the manipulation was under a politically-backed group’s influence after the beginning of the election process.Justice Singh began his order by quoting English writer Charles Caleb Colton as saying, “Power will intoxicate the best hearts, as wine the strongest heads. No man is wise enough, nor good enough, to be trusted with unlimited power.”Justice Singh went on to add that the enactors of the Panjab University Act would have little realised that the comprehensive and exhaustive legislation would come to be a tool in the hands of its own academic officer (the vice chancellor), “pursuing not the educational goals, but satisfying his own personal ends”.Justice Singh observed in the process, the governing body looking after the management and superintendence of the august institution, once of international fame and oldest in this country, was virtually ousted.He said the provisions made it clear that the university’s supreme authority vested in the Senate, comprising the chancellor, the vice chancellor, ex-officio fellows and the ordinary fellows. The vice chancellor was the principal executive and the university’s academic officer and was to exercise general control over its affairs in accordance with the statutes, rules and regulations.“However, with dismay, this court has observed that all these provisions have been thrown to the wind and what stands enumerated thereby is that the university is being run as a one-man show …,” Justice Singh observed.The election process was required to be held at the earliest to prevent autocratic governance in the university, affecting its democratic functioning “which could be a scar on its reputation, being one of the oldest and prestigious universities of this country and internationally acknowledged as well”, Justice Singh said.He added the purpose of elections was to ensure that the university’s main administration was vested with the Senate. The respondents’ act smacked of mala fide, caprice and was in utter violation of the Act and the regulations governing the respondent-university. Being unconstitutional, it was hereby set aside.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-raps-vc-says-panjab-university-being-run-as-one-man-show-233504

On the other hand, a few districts in southern Haryana received excess rain in March, though the north-western parts of the state received little or no rain.An active western disturbance and its induced cyclonic circulation had caused fairly widespread rainfall, snowfall and thunderstorms over western Himalayan region and Punjab from March 22-24, but according to the IMD, the precipitation was five per cent below normal.The weatherman has predicted that due to absence of any active western disturbance, rainfall activity is likely to be below normal over northwest India during the first week of April, while maximum temperatures are expected to rise gradually by 4-6 degrees Celsius.As far as the water level in crucial dams is concerned, which is crucial for irrigation, domestic and industrial use as well as power generation, the present storage is reported to be 46 per cent below normal in Himachal and 42 per cent below normal in Punjab.According to information released by the Central Water Commission (CWC), the present storage at Bhakra Dam that lies on the Sutlej in Himachal is just 20 per cent of the total reservoir capacity.

Claiming that the SGPC had “failed miserably to stop Sikhs from converting to Christianity in Punjab”, BJP leader RP Singh said as a “cover-up for their failure, they keep raising the false bogey of Hindu Rashtra”.SGPC passes resolution against RSS for suppressing other religions“I challenge the SGPC president to bring one case of Sikh lured by Hindus to convert,” he said. Asserting the RSS “has never spoken about creating Hindu Rashtra”, Singh said the work of the SGPC was to “propagate the message of the Gurus. Instead of doing that, it was trying to divide the people of Punjab through such messages”.Cover-up for own failureHow many times has the SGPC issued a statement or acted against Sikhs being lured by missionaries to convert? Rather it was the RSS that through ‘ghar wapsi’ brought converts back to the fold. — RP Singh, BJP leader“How many times has the SGPC issued a statement or acted against Sikhs being lured by missionaries to convert? How many converted Sikhs have been brought back to the fold? Rather it was RSS that through ‘ghar wapsi’ brought converts back to the fold,” said Singh.Accusing the BJP’s ideological fountainhead of “suppressing the freedom of other religions and minorities in an attempt to make the country a Hindu Rashtra”, the SGPC’s general house meeting had passed a resolution against the RSS, accusing it of “threatening the minority communities by intervening in their affairs”.“Such attempts were made by the Mughals in the 17th century which were resisted by Sikh Gurus, while ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur made a supreme sacrifice for other communities,” the resolution read.Cautioning the Union Government, the SGPC said it should rein in such elements and ensure “religious freedom of other religions”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/list-one-case-of-hindu-trying-to-convert-sikh-bjp-to-sgpc-233432

We can now board a government-run bus without thinking twice.”Gurpreet Kaur, a student from a village in Talwandi Sabo, said: “Bus fare is a major expense especially among poor and middle income group families.

Though he did not think the Prime Minister would give time to him, he and his government will keep writing to the central government and knocking their doors, he asserted.He had already written to the Prime Minister on March 19, and had personally spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and the latter had assured of all help in the matter, Captain Amarinder told the Arhtiyas.

He will later address the ‘Punjab Mangda Jawab’ rally in Ajnala.Sukhbir said, “The Covid pandemic has affected humanity and dented global economy. I have also passed through this phase and am fully recovered now. I have come to the Golden Temple to pray for the well-being of all.”The Delhi Gurdwara Elections department had held the party not eligible to contest the April 25 DSGMC election as it had failed to give an undertaking that it’s a religious party and the symbol ‘bucket’ was frozen pending litigation. However, the SAD challenged it in the Delhi High Court and got relief as the court stayed the order issued by the Delhi minister for gurdwara election while allowing the party to use its old reserved symbol ‘bucket’.Sukhbir alleged that the BJP-led Centre had hatched a conspiracy with Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government, Paramjit Singh Sarna-led SAD (Delhi) and former DSGMC chief Manjit Singh GK to prevent the SAD from contesting the poll.“By God’s grace, we managed to procure a stay on the issue of election symbol of the SAD, which is the only representative body of Sikhs for over a century. If these people think they are popular why do they feel insecure,” he said.On the 2022 Assembly election in Punjab, he foresaw bright prospects for the SAD. “We will contest even on those seats from where the BJP used to field their candidates. Most Congress candidates will forfeit their securities,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-delhi-govt-tried-to-prevent-sad-from-contesting-dsgmc-poll-sukhbir-233160
