01-04-2021||Ajnala (Amritsar)||Punjab CM afraid of facing Centre over direct payment to farmers: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday alleged that Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is “afraid” of standing up to the BJP-led Centre over the issue of direct payment to farmers for wheat procurement.That was why he has not taken any concrete step to stop the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for the procurement of the forthcoming crop, he alleged.Talking to the media after addressing a gathering here, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president alleged that the CM is “playing a fixed match” with the Centre, which was clear from the fact that Amarinder Singh asked for time to implement the scheme instead of declining to implement it.“It is clear that the chief minister has become part of the central conspiracy to punish the farmers of Punjab for opposing the three agricultural laws”, he alleged. Punjab “arthiyas” (commission agents) are up in arms against the Centre’s latest directive for direct payment to farmers for grain procurement.Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday assured “arhtiyas” of his government’s full support for the restoration of the older system of payment through them.Earlier addressing the gathering, the SAD chief took on AAP convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for allegedly playing a “double game” on the agricultural laws.He said Kejriwal had enacted a “big drama” of opposing the farm laws during the party’s recent meeting in Baghapurana even though his government was the “first to implement the laws in Delhi”. He took on Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, asked him to name one hospital, college or road he had constructed during the last four years. The SAD established 13 universities, 30 colleges and 300 hundred skill centres during its tenure, he claimed. He said rather than do anything, the chief minister had “defaulted” on a holy oath he took in the name of the “Gutka Sahib”, promising to waive loans of farmers.“Similarly, the CM has also backstabbed the youth whom he had promised jobs besides an unemployment allowance of Rs 2,500 per month,” said Sukhbir.

But instead of doing that it was trying to divide the people of Punjab through such messages”.“Their duty is to ensure that ‘panthak’ traditions.“How many times SGPC has issued a statement or acted against Sikhs being lured by Missionaries to convert? How many converted Sikhs has been brought back to the fold? Rather it was RSS which through ‘ghar wapsi’ brought converts back to the fold,” Singh said.Accusing the BJP’s ideological fountainhead of “suppressing the freedom of other religions and minorities in an attempt to make the country a Hindu Rashtra”, the SGPC’s general house meeting had passed a resolution against the RSS, accusing it of “threatening the minority communities by intervening in their affairs”.“Such attempts were made by the Mughals in the 17th century which were resisted by Sikh gurus while ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur made a supreme sacrifice for other communities,” the resolution read. Cautioning the central government, the SGPC said it should rein in such elements and ensure "religious freedom of other religions".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-slams-sgpc-%C2%A0challenges-it-to-show-one-case-where-a-sikh-lured-by-hindus-to-convert-233231

01-04-2021||Amritsar||BJP dividing people on religious lines: Farmer leaders||The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) organised a massive protest at Bhagatawala Dana Mandi (the district’s biggest grain market) on Wednesday against the three controversial agri laws.Speaking on the occasion, farmer leaders accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of trying to divide community on religious lines, especially after the recent manhandling of BJP’s Abohar MLA Arun Narang. Farmer leaders said the BJP was trying to portray the incident as a clash between Hindus and Sikhs.They said the incident, though shameful and condemnable, happened with a member of the party which has been hell-bent on destroying the livelihood of the farming community.Sarwan Singh Pandher of the KMSC said, “Today’s gathering was a meeting of farmers to chalk out the future course of action. We will hold dialogue with diverse groups of society, including shopkeepers and traders to inform them about the ill effects of three agri laws.” He said the intended laws would not only destroy the agrarian sector, but would also make lower economic groups miserable.

01-04-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ protest: Former bureaucrats, ex-Army men join hands||To amplify the voice of farmers against the three agro-market laws, a group of former bureaucrats, including two Padam Shri awardees, and former Army persons, have come together to form Kirti Kisan Forum in the city.So far, the group has written a letter in connection with farmers protest to the President of India and organised a seminar on the three farm laws at Punjab Kala Bhawan auditorium this month in the city, apart from donating beds and books at the Sighu border in January.“We even met farmer leaders and members of Samyukt Kisan Morcha on January 31. They didn’t ask us for anything, except to spread awareness about the three laws and the adverse affect they will have on country’s farmers,” says Padam Shri SS Boparai, former Vice-Chancellor, Punjabi University, Patiala.“The forum’s main concern are farmers, who have been battling financial adversities and are mostly in debt already,” he adds.“You must be wondering how we ‘ji janaabs’ got together to form this forum,” says IAS (retd) Kulbir Singh. “I had posted a viral video of my brother, who is paralysed and was waving the Kisan Union flag to show support to farmers, who are protesting at the Delhi border. That started the conversation about farmer protests on our WhatsApp group,” he adds.Padam Shri awardee RI Singh, who is also the former Chief Secretary, Punjab, explains, “We, retired bureaucrats have a WhatsApp group where we keep expressing our views on issues, policies and decisions that impact economy and society. It’s a freelance commentary, but for farmers we thought of going beyond just commenting. To build public opinion it was important to have a forum that allows debate and discussion, formulate a firm opinion and then project it.”Formed originally, through conversations on WhatsApp, Kirti Kisan Forum was conceptualised on December 20, last year.“We had a meeting on February 9, which was attended by many former IPS, IAS officers and were also joined by ex-Army men along with many influential people at Kisan Bhawan. At first we were analysing what farmers needed at Singhu border and other protest points near Delhi, So, we took books in January. Then, we took beds for farmers,” says Boparai.Pained by the events of January 26, the forum has also written to the President of India. “We wrote a long letter to the President of India, but have not received any response yet,” he adds.The group also organised a seminar on the farm laws this month. On its panel was agriculture expert Devinder Sharma.“In our country, there are 86 per cent small farmers with less than five acres and out of these 68 per cent are marginal farmers, who have less than two acres. These Bills will push them to depths of poverty,” says Sharma.The group plans to hold more seminars and discussions in future. Kisan Kirti Forum includes former Chief Secretary, Punjab, Rajan Kashyap, former DGPs of Punjab MPS Aulakh, and MS Bhullar, former DGP, Haryana, MS Malik, along with former IPS Surinder Kumar, and former IG, Punjab Police, Amar Singh Chahal.The forum counts over 15 former senior IAS officers, including former member of Human Rights Commission, MS Chahal, former Principal Secretary to CM, Punjab, SK Sandhu, and former Additional Chief Secretary, Punjab, DS Bains.Among ex-Army men, the group has Brig Kuldip Singh Kahlon, Brig Harwant Singh, Brig RPS Maan and Brig Inder Mohan Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-protest-former-bureaucrats-ex-army-men-join-hands-232797

We have already spent lakhs preparing for the same. Now, even when we withdrew from the posts following 33 per cent reservation for the new posts, the PPSC is not retuning our hard-earned money,” a candidate said.From April 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021, the commission collected over Rs 32.60 crore as examination and registration fee for various recruitment drives, while the total expenditure incurred on conducting these exams was only Rs 8.91 crore. In February, following women reservation of 33 per cent, many PCS (executive) candidates were allowed to withdraw from the exam as the seats for men were reduced against the 77 posts advertised.Except SC/ST and OBC categories, all other categories are being charged Rs 3,000 per exam in the state. This includes persons from economically weaker sections, those with disabilities, sportspersons and descendants of ex-servicemen.In October 2020, the Amarinder Singh government approved 33 per cent reservation for women in direct recruitment for the Punjab civil services, boards and corporations.

The wheat procurement will start from April 10.The ministers sought an early resolution to the issue in wake of the farmers’ agitation and the Assembly elections due next year. “If the BJP government’s insistence on the farm laws was not enough, the push for DBT is only adding to the woes of the protesting farmers and disturbing the law and order in the state,” said a minister.The Chief Minister informed his Cabinet colleagues that despite writing to the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Food Minister, nothing had happened. Opposing the direct bank transfer (DBT) scheme for farmers, the Chief Minister had written to the PM, seeking his intervention in issuing directions to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution to defer the implementation of the DBT scheme for at least a year.“The arhtiyas and farmers had good relations. There is no need to change the system when it was working well. Around 50 per cent farmers gave their land on contract. So how will those who till the land get their money under the DBT,” the Chief Minister had stated. After a detailed discussion, the Chief Minister decided to tomorrow chair a meeting on the issue with all stakeholders, including arhtiyas.Don’t implement scheme, says SAD||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ministers-nudge-punjab-cm-on-farm-dbt-232841

The protesters claimed that former Pathankot Deputy Commissioner (DC) Gurpreet Singh Khaira had prepared a detailed report which went in their favour. “Both octogenarians will climb down only and only if the district administration assures us that the Khaira report will be implemented. Saram Singh, actually, is sick. He needs medical aid.

01-04-2021||Arun Sharma---||Ropar villagers protest illegal mining as tubewells go dry||Tribune News Service Ropar, March 31 As the authorities have failed to keep a check on illegal mining in the district, residents of several villages on the banks of Swan and Sutlej have decided to take up the cudgels against the mining mafia. A large number of people have been sitting on a dharna near Algran bridge since March 15, demanding a clampdown on the mafia. Protesters said deep pits left after illegal mining not only posed a threat to their lives, but had also pushed groundwater further down, rendering several tubewells useless. The issue was also highlighted in the columns of this newspaper on July 15, 2019. Earlier, the riverbed was dug up to 10 feet and groundwater recharged through it used to maintain high levels in adjoining villages.  Experts say a riverbed is dug up to 50 feet and the water recharge also starts from the same depth, resulting in groundwater depletion. This also leads to groundwater pollution. Tikka Yashvir Chand, a local resident, said taps in their villages had gone dry due to deep digging of riverbeds. Farmers in Harsa Bela, Mehandpur, Bhangal, Khera Kalmot, Majari lower, Aalwan, Haripur, Plahta, Samundrian, Bhanuh, Nalhoti lower, Kalwan, Swarha, Surewal, Sahjowal, Bainspur, Sukhsal, Daghour, Dayapur, Majari Upper, Bhaladi, Nangran, Taraf Mazara, Bhalan, Taraf Mazari, Algran and Sansowal villages had spent lakhs of rupees on new tubewells, he said. Akash Rana of Nangran village said that they were not against the regulated mining, but the plunder of sand and gravel and the non-availability of potable water had forced them to protest.  Admitting that illegal mining was rampant in the area, mining department officials stressed they were taking strict action against offenders. District mining officer Sukhwinder Singh Kalsi said he met the protesting villagers last week and assured them of action against the mafia. Five persons had already been identified and cases would be registered against them by tomorrow and efforts were being made to identify others also, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ropar-villagers-protest-illegal-mining-as-tubewells-go-dry-232845

Experts pointed out that by condemning the sacrilege of the holy scripture at Bargari village in October 2015, the Shiromani Akali Dal, which controls the apex body, was trying to regain its lost ground following debacle in the 2017 Assembly polls. The failure of the SAD government in curbing the sacrilege instances and bringing the perpetrators to book was considered the main reason for its downfall.Though the resolution was originally not on the agenda, it was included and unanimously passed after several members raised the issue. They pointed out that the committee had failed to condemn the incident even after several years. The members also demanded monetary help to the victims’ families, besides stringent action against the police responsible for the firing.Following this, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur brought in a special resolution, condemning the incident, and instead of seeking action from the government. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/6-yrs-on-sgpc-flays-bargari-sacrilege-and-killing-of-2-sikhs-232856
