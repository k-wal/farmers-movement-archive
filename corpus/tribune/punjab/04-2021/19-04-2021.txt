19-04-2021||New Delhi||IOC, BPCL to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab||After Reliance Industries Ltd, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19.In a statement, IOC said it has “begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.”       “The first batch of the lifesaver medical grade oxygen was dispatched today to Maha Durga Charitable Trust Hospital, New Delhi,” it said. “Delhi is already facing an oxygen emergency situation.”  In the face of a massive surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic, IOC has diverted the high-purity oxygen used in its Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen at its Panipat refinery and petrochemical complex in Haryana.The throughput of the unit has also been scaled down for a more critical cause.In a separate statement, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost.“The company will be supplying around 100 tonnes per month,” it said.With average daily cases of COVID-19 rising again since last one month, the demand for oxygen has significantly risen. In fact, in most parts of the country, the cases are hitting new peak, thereby disrupting the demand-supply scenario for medical oxygen.Last week, Reliance’s twin oil refineries in Jamnagar in Gujarat through minor process modification converted industrial oxygen into medical-use oxygen that can be administered to COVID-19 patients low on oxygen. In all, 100 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied from the Jamnagar refineries free of cost.BPCL is also supplying 1.5 tonnes per day of medical oxygen to Kerala from its Kochi Refinery.Last year, BPCL had supplied around 25 tonnes of medical oxygen when the average daily cases had risen in October-November.The Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7 per cent purity.Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity.Reliance operates the world’s largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat.IOC Chairman S M Vaidya reiterated the firm’s unstinted support to the country at this critical hour in every possible way.“All through the pandemic, our prime focus has been to ensure the supply of essential fuels 24X7. We have also stepped up the production of raw material for PPEs, and we are now providing lifesaving medical oxygen to hospitals.“Our expertise and assets, including refineries, pipelines, petrochemical units, bottling plants, terminals and aviation fuel stations, will continue to serve the people despite the stiff challenges”, he added.As the COVID-19 cases in the country continue to rise, the demand for medical-grade oxygen too is growing rapidly. “The current initiative by IOC aims at supporting the states in fighting the battle against COVID-19,” the statement added.

Whoever is disabled 50 per cent and above will get the same amount. Experts believe that financial help should be given to a beneficiary as per the degree of disability.Gursewak, whose upper and lower limbs were completely paralysed in a road accident in 2018, is fully dependent on his mother for personal care.The youth, who belongs to a poor family, is entitled to get only Rs750 per month as financial assistance from the government despite having been disabled 100 per cent.He is finding it difficult to get the due treatment. Besides, his father, Krishan Singh, who is a goat herder, has to spend Rs1,000 per week to change the urinary catheter of bed-ridden Gursewak.Gursewak wants to get treatment from New Delhi. However, he doesn’t have money at all. “I want to walk again and fulfil my dream to get into the Indian Army. But, we don’t have money to get even a balanced diet, as advised by the doctors.”He said the government should revise the existing policy and base it on the degree of disability. “Many people who have disabilities only in one of the parts of the body get the same financial help while people like me, who can’t drink water by themselves, also get the same amount.” Meantime, it has been learnt that Gursewak is yet to get his pension.Varinder Tiwana, District Social Security Officer, said: “The case has been approved and Gursewak will get financial help of Rs750 this month. There are no categories in the scheme based on the degree of disability. However, the government has already announced that it will increase the amount of financial assistance from Rs750 to Rs1500 per month.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/100-disabled-patiala-youth-gets-a-mere-rs-750-per-month-241069

On October 14, 2015, the police had opened fire on those protesting sacrilege, killing two persons. In a letter written to Sidhu, he appreciated him for his stand on righteousness, be it against his own party.The former AAP MLA reminded Sidhu that how both of them together defended Justice Ranjit Singh’s report in the Vidhan Sabha in August 2018 and requested the government to initiate action.Questioning the ‘accountability’ of the government, he said, “After two-and-a-half years, action from the government is still awaited. The government’s legal team cannot be reliable. Now is the time for you to strike. The whole of Punjab knows that you dare to stand against your government. Come in your true colour and act against those who made false promises. If the action is still not taken, not only Punjab, but the Guru too will not forgive us,” he said.He requested Sidhu to initiate proceedings for demanding a special session of the Vidhan Sabha where the government should be held accountable for doing nothing in the matter. He also demanded action against the members of SIT, who obstructed the inquiry and the case should be handed over to the Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) to probe their role.“In my opinion, the advice of CVC Justice Mehtab Singh Gill should be followed. But if for some reason the government is hesitant, then the investigation should be handed over to a panel under Justice Ranjit Singh,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/act-against-sacrilege-cases-hs-phoolka-writes-to-navjot-singh-sidhu-240928

The CM must pinpoint responsibility for technical flaws in the probe. The police and the legal team are blaming each other on the issue”, said Bajwa, while sharpening his attack on Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.He said the calling of a meeting of a selected few ministers and MLAs by the Chief Minister to brainstorm on the issue would not suffice and instead all MLAs and party MPs should have been called for a threadbare discussion on the issue, said Bajwa.“The government is not run by a few ministers and MLAs. A wider consultation on the probe into the sacrilege incidents and the police firing case was required,” the Congress leader added.He was referring to the recent meeting of PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar, ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa, Tripat Bajwa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria and MLAs Kiki Dhillon and Navtej Cheema called by the Chief Minister.He said when the government had already shown its willingness to reconstitute the SIT, excluding IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, it should start the investigation so that the perpetrators of the heinous crime should been taken to task on time. —TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kotkapura-probe-poor-coordination-to-blame-for-debacle-says-pratap-singh-bajwa-240943

Ajit and his father work as a granthi in a gurdwara at Ghania villageof Bathinda.Seeking the DGP and the BoI Director’s intervention, IG Kunwar alleged that he had come to know about some high-profile accused persons in the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing cases who were all out to pressure the witnesses, especially those from the underprivileged class.He said it was brought to his notice that Ajit was called at the SGPC office on February 2 in Amritsar at the behest of Sukhbir, who has been holding a grip on the SGPC affairs since long. However, Ajit claimed that he was never invited by the SGPC for any job.IG Kunwar had sent the copy of this letter to the ADGP, Intelligence, and Faridkot SSP.Talking to The Tribune, he said: “Instead, I had approached the SGPC for a job as I was without any work and needed one badly.

Though openly local Congress leaders have been staying away from their events, insiders claim many are in touch with them.Sidhu, however, claims his “focus is not to make any political gains, but to highlight the injustice for the victims of drugs and Bargari issues”. Meanwhile his wife and former Amritsar (East) MLA is often seen meeting party workers at her husband’s ancestral house in Yadavindra Colony. Off late, she has been taking keen interest in the two Vidhan Sabha segments of Patiala (rural) and Sanaur constituencies.“Cabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra is an elected MLA from Patiala (rural) and is projecting his son as his political successor. However, the recent opening of an office by Navjot Kaur in Sanaur, is seen as a move to counter Congress leader Harinderpal Singh Harry Mann, who lost the last polls,” say political observers.Also read: Sources say local Congress leaders have been meeting the Sidhu couple primarily highlighting “corruption in the Municipal Corporation and the role of handpicked leaders in mining and illegal liquor trade”.Officially being the state president of women wing of Jat Maha Sabha in Punjab, Navjot Kaur Sidhu is using the platform to open offices and holding meetings with the youth leaders.Patiala District Congress, president (urban) KK Malhotra states that the Congress in Patiala is united under Preneet Kaur and he is unaware of any Congress leaders holding meetings with the Sidhu couple. “We are united under our MP Preneet Kaur”, he stated.Recently Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had taken potshots at Congress government over the “botched-up probe” into 2015 sacrilege cases and the drugs menace.Holds political functions, press meetsWhile Navjot Singh Sidhu is holding press conferences and political functions in the bastion of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu is taking keen interest in the two Vidhan Sabha segments of Patiala (rural) and Sanaur constituencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-couple-sets-political-circles-abuzz-in-capt-amarinder-singhs-bastion-240926

But the farmers didn’t pay heed to it and conducted an illegal event, putting the lives of several persons in danger. This could never be ignored.Amritsar DC Gurpreet Singh Khaira said despite warning, they continued to flout the guidelines laid down in the light of Covid spread.“The Mandi Board Department had issued a warning against holding a gathering. But the farmers didn’t pay heed to it and conducted an illegal programme, putting the lives of several persons in danger.

Instead of coronavirus, the ill-will policies of the governments will kill the farmers and we were fighting for our survival and future of the next generations,” he said.They demanded that the procurement of wheat should be carried out without any conditions. The condition of depositing the fard should be abolished, the crisis of bags should be resolved immediately and the lifting of wheat in mandis be expedited and farmers be compensated for the loss of crop due to inclement weather conditions.“We are prepared to continue the struggle until our demands are met.

Globally, India is facing a serious setback to its cherished values of democratic and human rights.”The appeal goes on to say that the adamant attitude of the government is causing unprecedented psychological and physical suffering to lakhs of agitating farmers consisting of women, children, old people and the youth. “Already more than 300 people have died and several hundreds suffered injuries and detentions in the ongoing struggle and there does not seem to be an amicable solution in sight,” says R S Ghuman, economist and one of the brains behind the appeal.Among the other signatories to the appeal are Sompal Pal Shastry, TKA Nair, Dr Sudarshan Iyengar, Dr R Radhakrishna, Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon, Dr Neera Chandhoke, Dr KS Aulakh, Ashok Arora, Rajinder Singh Cheema, Dr MS Mallik, Dr D Narasimha Reddy, Dr Biswajeet Chatterjee, Dr Sucha Singh Gill, Dr Ajit Kumar Singh, Gurdial Singh Pandher, Dr Kamal N Kabra and Devinder Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-agitation-begin-dialogue-break-stalemate-eminent-persons-urge-centre-240915

19-04-2021||Moga||Straw reapers banned in Moga||The district administration of Moga has imposed a ban on the use of straw reaper machines during the ongoing wheat harvest as it often leads to incidents of fire and air pollution. The wheat straw left in fields after harvesting and making hay (dry fodder) with straw reapers is burnt by farmers to prepare fields for the next crop.District Magistrate Sandeep Hans and Plant Protection Officer Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar said strict action would be taken against farmers who used straw reapers and burnt the crop residue in fields.Farmers generally burn the residue as they consider it more convenient and economical than mixing it in the soil using plows. Officials claimed in previous years such fires often damaged trees and standing wheat crop in nearby fields. “The environment gets polluted and soil health gets degraded,” said an agro-official.The plying of combine harvester machines in wheat fields during the night time has also been banned by the district administration. The wheat harvesters cannot be used to harvest the crop after 7 pm and before 9 am. The agro-scientist said the wheat harvested during night had more moisture content.Meanwhile, DM Sandeep Hans claimed the district administration had made all preparations for the procurement of wheat. He said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) would procure 20 per cent of wheat, Pungrain 23 per cent, Markfed 22 per cent, Punsup 22 per cent and Punjab State Warehouse Corporation 13 per cent from the markets allotted to these agencies. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/straw-reapers-banned-in-moga-240917

The new system has made payment easier and faster. Earlier, it took more than a week.Confirming the numbers, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Bharat Bhushan Ashu said: “More than Rs 100 crore has already been credited to the accounts of farmers. Payment of more than Rs 300 crore was cleared today. This will be credited to the accounts of beneficiary farmers by tomorrow morning.”The state has more than 11 lakh farmers so the final results might show later. However, there is no denying the fact that the system has been accepted. Harvest is being done in a staggered manner all over the state, so numbers will add up gradually. Unlike Malwa, which is witnessing a bulk of crop harvest these days, Majha and Doaba areas are yet to join the crop rush in the mandis.Farmer Harnek Singh from Moga said: “I think arhtiyas need not be scared about the change in the procurement process. Their work profile, too, can evolve according to the new situation. The new system has made payment easier and faster. Earlier, it took more than a week.”Farmer Dasonda Singh from Bathinda district, who received the direct payment recently, said: “We are only used to the old system of operating through arhtiyas. We got the direct payment this year and sure we will understand the new process also.”Maninder Singh Gurm from Jhabewal village in Ludhiana district said: “The direct payment system won’t impact the farmer-arhtiya relations. This does not mean a farmer cannot borrow money from arhtiya now. The change will need some time for acceptance.”Farmer Harpreet Singh from Sardulgarh in Mansa district said: “I got Rs 12.64 lakh as DBT this year. Our arhtiya helped us with the procedural work, including getting our bills cleared from the market committee. If we have no option, we will find ways to adjust.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/over-10k-farmers-in-punjab-opt-for-e-payment-240907
19-04-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Some struggle with glitch in e-system in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 18Despite tall claims made by the Centre about the success of its DBT rollout, the ground situation in Punjab reveals how farmers are waiting for payment in their accounts for days now and the commission agents are still struggling to upload documents on a portal that is showing frequent glitches.As a result, there is a glut in mandis. It has been eight days since the wheat procurement started in the state. Farmers are bringing their grain to 2,700-odd mandis (of the total 4000 markets notified), but waiting for days to get their payment. Arhtiyas are now reluctant to extend farmers’ credit due to their exclusion from the e-payment system.Simarjit Singh, a farmer from Sadiq Mandi in Faridkot, sold 230 quintals of wheat through an arhtiya on April 11. Eight days down the line, he has not received a single penny. “I hear that the government is facing a financial crunch. Could they be holding back my payment? The earlier system was better, when we would receive a cheque from the commission agent within two to three days of the grain being sold,” he said.Pankaj Aggarwal, an arhtiya, who got Simarjit’s grain auctioned, said the process of filing all forms on the new portal — Anaaj Kharid — was not clear. “The portal itself has too many technical glitches. As a result, just two or three zamindars who have sold their grain in Sadiq Mandi have so far received the direct payment.”The story is no different in other parts of the state. Naib Singh of Thuha village near Rajpura, who along with his son- in-law Harwinder Singh, sold 250 quintals of wheat on April 11, said their dues had not been credited in their account. In Payal Mandi, Sukhwinder Singh Cheema, an arhtiya said the procurement in their Mandi began on April 12, but he was unaware of any farmer having received the payment to date.In Mathi village of Fatehgarh Sahib, farmer Sandeep Singh said he sold 80 quintals of grain on April 11, but is yet to receive the payment. “We have already deposited the Aadhar card, a cancelled cheque and bank details and are told it will be credited soon,” he said.Ravi Bhagat, Director, Food and Supplies, Punjab, however, assured by Sunday evening, Rs 360 crore would have been transferred in the farmers’ accounts by the state government.Bag shortage creates glutSuresh Sood, an arhtiya in Fatehgarh Sahib, said there was a glut in mandis as lifting was slow because of the shortage of gunny bags. Till Sunday, 46.01 lakh metric tonne (LMT) of wheat arrived in the mandis, of which 40.24 LMT has been purchased. However, only 10.38 LMT has been lifted from the mandis. Ravi Bhagat, Director, Food and Supplies, Punjab, said they had allowed all government agencies to use the already used gunny bags.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/some-struggle-with-glitch-in-e-system-in-punjab-240908
19-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Govt nod to used gunny bags||With a view to ensuring the unhindered procurement process, the government has approved the packaging of wheat in good-quality used gunny bags provided by arhtiyas. This will ensure that there is no shortage of gunny bags in any mandi. The arrival of wheat in mandis has increased to 8 lakh MT per day and there is a nationwide shortage of new gunny bags and PP bags.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh reviewed the status of procurement with senior officials. Regarding the slow pace of purchase in border districts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Ferozepur, it was explained that the grain in these areas was shrivelled and accordingly there was a relaxation in procurement specifications required from the Government of India before it could be purchased.On April 16, the Punjab Government had written to the Centre to grant immediate relaxation in the uniform specifications of wheat in respect of shrivelled and broken grains up to 11 per cent and luster loss up to 10 per cent in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Fazilka without any value cut. However, the reply is still awaited. CM directed the Food & Supplies Minister and the Principal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, to immediately resolve the matter by pursuing it with their counterparts at the Centre.In the joint analysis of wheat samples in FCI district Amritsar (Revenue District Amritsar and Tarn Taran), conducted by FCI and state procurement agencies, a luster loss up to 5 per cent and shrivelled and broken grains up to 11 per cent had been found in a few mandis of these districts which is more than the prescribed limit. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-nod-to-used-gunny-bags-240916
19-04-2021||Ranjit Powar||Direct Benefit Transfer: Restructure the system in farmers’ favour||AT the Centre’s insistence, Punjab has finally started making direct payments to farmers for their produce under the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode during the ongoing wheat procurement season. Other states are already implementing this system, even as Punjab had been keen to route the payments through the arhtiyas (commission agents), as per the long-established practice. The arhtiyas in Punjab and Haryana initially registered a protest by proceeding on strike, but they relented after the state governments promised to safeguard their interests. Earlier attempts to introduce DBT had been resisted and were eventually shelved. Hopefully, DBT is now here to stay, reducing delays in payment to the farmer and letting him receive his earnings directly.Much has been said about the close-knit relationship between the farmer and the arhtiya. The arhtiyas insist that implementing the DBT will ‘destroy’ the farmer. It remains to be seen how the new system will change the dynamics of the farmer-arhtiya ties.Why this resistance to DBT by the arhtiyas, and why have successive governments in Punjab been silent connivers? What is the normative role of commission agents in any business? The arhtiya is a mere facilitator of the transaction between the farmer and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) or a private trader. He has absolutely no claim to the farmer’s land or grain. Why, then, was he entitled to receive payment on the farmers’ behalf?The arhtiyas in Punjab are paid a commission of 2.5 per cent (among the highest in the country) for their services during procurement, including handling and cleaning of the farmers’ grain when it arrives in the mandi, filling it in bags, weighing, stitching and subsequently loading the bags into trucks for despatch. They play an essential role in one of the most extensive government operations in Punjab, a predominantly agricultural state. Nevertheless, is it restricted to the official brief, or does it include a concealed, unkosher agenda?In addition to his officially designated duties, the arhtiya is also the modern-day moneylender, financing the farmer in times of need at interest rates ranging from 18 per cent to 37 per cent. The Punjab Government acknowledges the arhtiya as being the ‘ATM’ of the farmers! Do other businesses withdraw money from the ATM at an interest rate of 37 per cent? Why is the farmer forced to turn to the arhtiya to borrow money at exorbitant rates, pledging his earnings as collateral? Why is the farmer driven to self-destruction through such borrowings? Why have successive state governments played along with this exploitative system? Are cooperative banks set up to give easy access to credit at modest rates in rural areas defunct?Let us open this can of worms. The farmer brings his crop to the mandi yard, from where the arhtiya takes over. The crop is weighed and cleaned (often inadequately). It is put up for auction, bought either by a government agency at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) or a private trader. The arhtiya’s multi-pronged rapport with the purchase inspector is a major contributing factor that determines whether or not the grain qualifies for MSP. The purchased grain is next filled up in jute bags (often in the late evening when the farmer is absent) with a considerable error margin. In keeping with the rates of the parallel economy operating in the grain yard, a certain amount per bag is reportedly paid to the inspector of the purchasing agency, which is further said to be shared with a section of district and state-level administrative functionaries.The uneducated or semi-educated farmer feels incapable of dealing with the inspectors and relies on the ‘skilful’ arhtiya to sell his grain. He turns to borrowing money from the arhtiya at high rates because the banks usually do not help him get loans. For him the arhtiya is a necessary evil because there is a trust deficit and general lack of honest handling by state agencies.Exploitative side businessThe arhtiya insists on the farmer’s payment to be routed through him to be able to deduct his loans. Is the government pledged to cover the risk for his exploitative side business? There is some give-and-take here. The arhtiya is also the conduit for deducting the payoffs for the purchase agencies from the farmer’s payment check. Thus, all beneficiaries from the farmer’s earnings want to keep the system going to safeguard their share. The farmer, with no solid lobbies or effective organisations, has been the ultimate victim.A conversation with some farmers after the implementation of the DBT system has revealed that the arhtiyas insist on receiving signed blank checks from the farmers before auctioning their produce. Haryana has reassured the arhtiyas that they would be duly intimated one day prior to the disbursal of payment!Restrict arhtiyas’ roleNot surprisingly, a large number of commission agencies are owned by local politicians. It is a no-loss business with an assured income through two-three months’ work in a year. Though the arhtiyas are essential functionaries in the grain procurement process, their role needs to be restricted to official limits. The financial dynamics of the procurement system must be restructured in favour of the farmers, not of those exploiting him. Instead of unabashedly lauding the arhtiya as the ‘ATM’ of the farmers, let the state government activate ATMs where they should be — in the rural banks. Politicians and procurement agencies should clean up their Augean stables. DBT might change the scenario only if the state government genuinely works to safeguard the interests of the farmers.The author retired as Deputy Director, Department of Food and Civil Supplies, Punjab||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/direct-benefit-transfer-restructure-the-system-in-farmers-favour-241017

Further, these are made by renowned companies. I appeal to everyone to come to the centre to buy medicines.”On this, Dr Sunil Bansal, Deputy Medical Commissioner, Muktsar, said, “The Jan Aushadhi Kendra is helping needy people. We are now celebrating Jan Aushadhi Week to spread awareness about generic medicines among people.”Some patients, however, complained that doctors were still prescribing medicines with their brand name, rather than writing the name of the salt.The staff of the kendra said the sale had doubled from last year. “In February last year, we sold medicines of Rs 2.84 lakh. But this February, we did a business of Rs 5.5 lakh. It happened due to the support of doctors and the district administration. Though the state government also provides free medicines to patients, its dispensaries do not cover all medicines.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/muktsar-aushadhi-kendra-boon-for-poor-240922
