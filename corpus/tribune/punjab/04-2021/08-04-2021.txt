During the meeting, the Chief Minister apprised the Prime Minister of the situation in the state, and also the steps taken by his government to control and manage the disease.Union Home Minister Amit Shah was also present at the meeting, during which the Chief Minister assured the Centre of all-out efforts by his government to contain and manage Covid. He stressed on the fact that the UK variant which is dominating the second wave in the state, is reported by experts to be more virulent and affecting the youth disproportionately.In his subsequent letter, the Chief Minister said his suggestions, some of which had been earlier submitted on March 17 to the PM, the Union Minister and the Union Health Minister, were based on the state government’s interaction with independent experts.Amid reports of some states facing vaccine shortages, Captain Amarinder also requested the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to share the schedule for supply of vaccines with the States over the next quarter, based on their confirmed supply orders.Given that over 80% positive cases found in Punjab are of the UK variant, as per early reports from central laboratories, the Chief Minister also sought strengthening of viral sequencing in the state, which has been reporting around 3000 cases per day since the last 15 days, with around 8% positivity.The Chief Minister reiterated his earlier request for covering all teachers and staff in all educational institutions for vaccination to enable resumption of physical classes once the surge abates. Also, occupation-based immunisation for judges & judicial officers, bus drivers & conductors, elected representatives at all levels, etc should be allowed to take the vaccination, he stressed. Further, PGIMER, Chandigarh should be asked to earmark at least 50 Covid ICU beds for patients being referred by the State, he added.Sharing the overall testing figures for the state, Captain Amarinder said 40,000 COVID tests per day (yesterday 44,250) are being conducted, of which more than 90% are RT-PCR and less than 10% Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). Punjab’s testing per million is higher than national average, and is now being increased to 50,000 per day, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-seeks-review-of-vaccine-strategy-calls-for-flexibility-for-states-to-devise-own-local-strategies-236417

The investigation also established that a network of narco-traffickers, terrorists and hawala operatives based in Punjab, Delhi and Dubai was operating at the behest of Harmeet Singh and Hakimzada and was indulging in subversive activities against India,” the NIA said in the charge sheet.The case arose out of a Punjab Police FIR relating to seizure of 500 gm of heroin and proceeds of drugs about Rs 1,20,000 on May 31, 2020 from accused Jajbir Singh Samra and two other accused persons. Later, NIA took over the case and earlier after completion of investigation, the agency had filed a charge sheet against 10 accused persons in the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-3-accused-in-khalistan-liberation-force-narco-terror-case-236410

Our doctor was thrashed by the villagers. His body still has marks.”When questioned about filing a complaint to the concerned police station, Dr Kiran Walia answered: “I have verbally informed the Station House officer. He assured me of taking action.”Meantime, SHO Julkan, said that he was not aware of any such incident, however, he would take action if a complaint was made.Reportedly, the villagers were upset over the death of a 55-year-old, Charu Kaur, Covid patient.  When asked about taking up the matter with police, Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said: “The SMO told me that he has already filed a complaint.

He said some people were trying to discredit the management of the SGPC and mislead the sangat. Gurdwara Sri Amb Sahib had about 24 acre land at Premgarh Saini Majra village, of which about 12 acres was acquired by GMADA in 2012-13. The compensation for this land was offered at Rs1.69 per acre and accordingly, it came out to Rs19.40 crore, approximately.WHat’s the matter?He said though the land acquisition was done as per law, the compensation amount was contested in Mohali court. “We contested that GMADA should have given us compensation to the tune of at least Rs5 crore per acre, which was the market price,” he said. He further clarified that the amount received by the gurdwara sahib for this land was used to buy another chunk of 59 acres at Bagrian village in Sangrur district, which was worth Rs14.30 crore. “The FDR of the remaining amount is still prevalent in the name of Gurdwara Sri Amb Sahib only,” he said. Advocate Harjinder Singh Dhami said: “In February 2019, GMADA acquired 5,500 acres at Saini Majra, Bakarpur, Patto and Seon villages. Here also, nearly nine acres of the remaining land belongs to Gurdwara Sri Amb Sahib. The GMADA has fixed the price of this land at Rs2.17 crore per acre. Apart from this, GMADA is also offering a land pooling scheme.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-clarifies-mohalis-gurdwara-sri-amb-sahib-land-row-236179

He said the rejection of their prayer may put the lives of both the appellants to danger in the absence of legal redressal.The Bench said: “We deem it appropriate to seek assistance of the (Punjab) state counsel as well… He shall assist the court on the issues involved in this appeal,” the Bench said. The matter was placed before the Bench after the single judge observed that the representation filed by the petitioners did not reach the police authorities. The petitioners filed the plea on the same day and “no time was given to the authority for redressal of their grievance”.The single Bench said the representation submitted by the petitioners to the police also did not reveal the manner and mode of alleged threat to them.

For the past around 20 days, the police have been facing a tough time in getting the custody of Bishnoi for his questioning in the killing of District Youth Congress chief Gurlal Singh Bhalwan here due to this ‘mistake’.The police have nominated 13 persons, including Bishnoi ,in the murder of Bhalwan who was killed on February 18. The police have already arrested nine persons in the case.Facing as many as 19 criminal cases in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, Bishnoi is presently lodged in the High Security Jail in Ajmer. On March 16, the police had approached the CJM court here for Bishnoi’s production warrants from Ajmer.

We understand why the arhtiyas are being attacked. It is mainly to push them out and give a free field to the private players to operate. The system will not work at all, as the tenant farmers get the land on lease only through a mutual settlement, without their names as cultivators being recorded. How will they prove that they are the producers of grain?” he asked.Ministers’ delegation to meet GoyalThe Punjab Government has formed a high-level delegation of three ministers and chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board, to meet Union Food Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday and resolve the issue regarding direct payment to farmers.CM supporting Centre on DBT: AAPThe CM is only enacting a ‘drama’ on the DBT system for payment to farmers as he is supporting the central government.

On an average, Punjab residents have been stealing power worth between Rs 1,000-1,200 crore annually with Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts leading the chart.Sources said rural residents are ahead of their urban counterparts in the “power loot”, accounting for around 66 per cent of the theft through concealed devices, capacitors, ‘kundis’ or meter-tampering. “The sad part is that even wealthy families steal power and run to local politicians when raided. Our teams are attacked and gheraoed by villagers as they know they have political backing,” said a top official.Rs800 Cr annual loss in rural areasData showed that villagers, majority of whom get free power for tubewells, steal power around Rs 800 crore per annum while urban consumers (domestic and commercial) account for thefts worth Rs 300 crore. The industrial sector steals power worth Rs 100 crore.Govt releases Rs10,106 CR pending subsidyPatiala: The Punjab Government released Rs 10,106-crore pending subsidy to the PSPCL for the financial year 2020-21, following which the balance subsidy of Rs 5,779 crore up to March 31, 2020 is still pending. — TNSData compiled by The Tribune from official documents prepared by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), confirmed that “power theft alone had caused loss worth over Rs 6,000 crore to the state exchequer in the past six years.”Documents suggested that in Tarn Taran, Bhikhiwind and Patti, the PSPCL had faced losses (primarily due to power theft) of 79.14, 67.36, and 45.64 per cent, respectively. In Amritsar suburban circle, three divisions of West, Ajnala and sub-urban have losses of 55.32, 55.37 and 44.34 per cent, respectively.In Sangrur district, Patran and Lehragaga have losses of 54.87 and 52.49 per cent, respectively. The average distribution losses for the current financial year is 13.4 per cent comprising 10.94 per cent distribution losses and 2.46 per cent as transmission losses.The PSPCL in its annual revenue receipt for the year 2021-22 had attributed the losses to the “rampant theft of energy” in these divisions. The PSPCL claims that whenever surprise raids are conducted, employees are often gheraoed and manhandled.“Politicians fear they might lose elections if power theft ‘facility’ is withdrawn from consumers,” said VK Gupta, spokesman, All India Power Engineers’ Federation.“Had power theft been controlled, the tariff would have come down by 30 paise per unit every year during the past six years,” he added.PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said he had already asked all field officers to carry out regular raids and keep an eye on habitual offenders. “It is true power theft is a problem but we are now adopting a zero tolerance for power theft and thousands of cases have been registered in the recent past,” Prasad added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rs-6k-cr-power-stolen-in-6-years-in-punjab-236159

However, the Health Department is finding it difficult to meet the demands regarding the kits given the recent spike in cases.Patients said while they were flooded with calls from the department, the actual kits did not come for weeks. Also, some Covid-positive patients under isolation are being asked to collect the kits themselves.Ready to distribute 4,000-6,000 kits dailySome districts with sudden spurt might have had a temporary shortage, but we will start distributing 4,000 to 6,000 kits on a daily basis from tomorrow.

They asked us to contact the 104 helpline. We repeatedly sought the kit but no one gave it to us. Another doctor called us and made me write a few numbers. It’s been four days since the 104 team noted our address. So far, no kit has been given to us.”Another Covid patient said, “What’s the use of home quarantine if I have to go and take the kit myself?

It was more gradual and slow last year. The cases are rising rapidly so the demand has risen. At times, there is shortage.

Maharashtra has vaccinated only 25 pc of the elderly, Delhi 30 pc and Punjab just 13 pc where four states and UTs have vaccinated more than 50 pc.“Doesn’t it seem evident these states are trying to divert attention from their poor vaccination efforts by continuously shifting goal-posts? Politicisation of public health is a damning indictment of some political leaders who should know better,” said Vardhan specifically taking on Maharashtra saying, “It is shocking how Maharashtra is putting its people in danger by letting people escape institutional quarantine mandate for personal vasuli,” Vardhan said.The minister’s statement followed appeals from CMs of the respective states to expand vaccinations.The government further said there was no vaccine shortage in Maharashtra and the repeated narrative was “an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government’s failures to control the pandemic”.Maharashtra contributed the most – 55,469 cases to the daily basket of 1.15 lakh cases today.Vardhan said the state’s inability to act responsibly was beyond comprehension and a greater folly was to spread panic among people by claiming vaccine shortages that do not exist.Vardhan also slammed Congress ruled Chhattisgarh for spreading “misinformation and panic on vaccination.”“Chhattisgarh has seen disproportionately higher number of deaths in three weeks. Their testing remains heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests which is unwise.

08-04-2021||---||Capt orders ban on political gatherings in Punjab; leaders, violators to be booked under DMA & Epidemics Act||Chandigarh, April 7As Covid cases continue to remain high in the state, Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, on Wednesday ordered a total ban on political gatherings till April 30 and said that violators, including political leaders, will be booked under the DMA and Epidemics Act.The chief minister also announced extension of night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am, which hitherto was imposed in 12 districts, to the entire state and reduced the number of attendees at funeral/cremations/weddings to 50 people indoors and 100 for outdoors.Wearing of masks has been made mandatory for all government employees while in office.These restrictions, coupled with the ones imposed earlier, which include closure of schools and educational institutions, shall remain effective till April 30.However, there was some respite for shop owners in Malls, as the Chief Minister allowed entry of 10 people per shop at any given time, as against the earlier order of not allowing more than 100 people in a mall at one time. This would imply that 200 people will be allowed in a Mall with 20 shops at any given time.Amarinder, in his weekly review of the Covid situation, expressed concern at the high positivity and mortality rates in the state. He said it was matter of concern that over 85 per cent of cases in Punjab are of the UK strain, which is more contagious and virulent.He said he had no option but to go in for stricter measures to further control the ongoing surge, even though the number of positive cases had somewhat stabilised in the last few days due to curbs imposed earlier.He said he had been forced to order a ban on political gatherings, as his pleas to all political parties to refrain from organising such events had been ignored, despite the fact that the Congress had unilaterally announced its decision of not holding any rallies or public meetings last month.Expressing surprise at the behaviour of certain political leaders, including Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal, and SAD’s Sukhbir Badal, who had been attending political rallies without following safety protocols, the chief minister said such irresponsible conduct doesn’t behove them.“How do you expect people to be serious about the spread of the disease if senior political leaders behave like this’, he said adding that his government would need to be tough to tackle such violations and political leaders would also need to be booked.He ordered the police and the districts administrations to register cases against the political leaders, organizers and participants of political gatherings under DMA and Epidemics Act, besides booking the owners of the tent houses, who provide the infrastructure for such gatherings. He said even the venue owners, who would provide space for such events, will not be spared and they too would be booked and their venues sealed for three months.He said that no social, cultural or sports gatherings and related functions will be allowed till April 30.  In-person public dealing shall be restricted in all Government offices and online and virtual modes for grievance redressal shall be encouraged, he said while adding that all government employees will need to compulsorily wear a mask while attending office.Captain Amarinder said citizens should to be encouraged to visit public offices only for essential services and the concerned departments should issue instructions for limiting daily appointments for works like registries etc. He said restrictions of running cinema houses at 50% of their capacity and closure of schools and educational institutions, except medical and nursing colleges, shall continue till April 30.The chief minister also directed Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict implementation of the night curfew.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-orders-ban-on-political-gatherings-in-punjab-leaders-violators-to-be-booked-under-dma-epidemics-act-235874

08-04-2021||Banda (UP)||Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari brought back to UP's Banda jail from Punjab||After spending over two years in a Punjab prison, gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari was brought back to Banda jail early on Wednesday morning.He was ferried in an ambulance guarded by a strong posse of gun-toting security personnel throughout his 900-km journey from Ropar to this Uttar Pradesh town in the Bundelkhand region.Acting on a Supreme Court order, Uttar Pradesh Police took custody of the 57-year-old BSP MLA at Ropar jail on Tuesday to bring him back to Banda prison. It took around two hours to complete the formalities before he was handed over to UP Police after a medical check-up.Once the convoy entered the state on Tuesday evening, the fleet of security vehicles of Uttar Pradesh Police, which included an ambulance equipped with all life-saving equipment to meet any exigency en route to Banda, a journey that takes around 14 hours from Ropar, and an anti-riot police vehicle 'Vajra' whizzed past the newly-laid expressways.Before the convoy entered Banda jail at 4.30 am, it slowed down near Kanpur Dehat as stray animals blocked the road along a patch of thick forest. Apart from the ambulance, three police vehicles also entered the Banda jail premises.At 1.30 am, the police convoy in which Mukhtar Ansari was moving, was stopped for sometime in Satti police station area.As anxious reporters ran to the policemen and sought the reasons for the sudden stoppage from them, no response was given, and the policemen at the spot tried to evade the questions posed by reporters.Later, SO of Satti police station Kapil Dubey told PTI, "Mukhtar used toilet in the Satti police station premises to answer nature's call. He stayed inside the police station for almost five minutes."  Before this, around 1.10 am, the convoy came to a halt on the road between Bhognipur and Ghatampur due to stray animals. Initially, the speed of the vehicles was reduced, then the vehicles were stopped, and local police removed the stray animals, following which the convoy resumed its journey.While heavy security arrangements were made by Punjab Police outside Ropar jail, the Banda prison area looked like a cantonment zone with policemen keeping a hawk-eyed vigil all around.The police convoy entered Uttar Pradesh through the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Baghpat around 6 pm, Allahabad zone Additional Director General of Police Prem Prakash told PTI.The Uttar Pradesh team had reached Ropar police lines at 4.30 am on Tuesday and left for the jail around noon for the transfer.The convoy left the jail premises at 2:08 pm taking a side gate, dodging mediapersons waiting outside the main gate. As the convoy took the Ambala road, some media vehicles gave a chase but soon gave up.The five-time MLA will cool his heels in barrack number 15 of the Banda district jail, where he was lodged in the past before being shifted to Punjab. Additional police force has been deployed at the jail at the request of prison authorities.He will be guarded by three security personnel round-the-clock inside the barrack."Security personnel have been posted inside as well as outside the jail premises," Banda jailor Pramod Tiwari said."In barrack number 15, where Ansari will be kept, arrangements for light, drinking water and cleanliness have been made," he said.Tiwari said access to the barrack had now been denied to other jail inmates.The main prison complex gate, which generally remains open, will now be kept closed. Only those jail staff reporting for duty would be allowed in after proper screening, he added.High towers have been put up outside the jail and extra police pickets have also been set up to keep a watch on every visitor.Meanwhile, principal of Government Medical College, Banda, Dr Mukesh Kumar Yadav, said a panel of four doctors had been constituted on the apex court's directions to monitor Ansari's health.Ansari was lodged in Ropar jail in January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.The legislator from Mau in eastern Uttar Pradesh faces 52 cases in the state and elsewhere, and 15 of them are in the trial stage.Also read: Mukhtar Ansari denied food, water during Punjab-UP transfer, alleges brother; govt says no health issuesThe BJP-run Uttar Pradesh government had accused the Congress government in Punjab of shielding Ansari for several months by not letting the state take custody.Punjab's home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take Ansari's custody by April 8, following the March 26 Supreme Court order that had set a two-week deadline.The apex court had noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in cases of murder, attempt to murder, cheating and conspiracy, apart from offences under the Gangsters Act.It said his custody was being denied to Uttar Pradesh Police on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gangster-turned-politician-mukhtar-ansari-brought-back-to-ups-banda-jail-from-punjab-235824
