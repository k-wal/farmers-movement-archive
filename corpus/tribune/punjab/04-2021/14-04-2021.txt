14-04-2021||New Delhi||HC dismisses plea to defer Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee elections due to spike in COVID-19 cases||The Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition seeking postponement of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections, scheduled for April 25, on the grounds of unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases.The high court said that once a decision to hold the election has been taken and the process has not been stopped in spite of a rise in the number of infected persons in the city, which is functioning barring a few restrictions, the court would not interfere in such policy matters.A bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal said once it is shown that guidelines for ensuring that the holding of election do not lead to spread of the virus any more than it is already taking place, the court would not interfere in such policy matters.“The respondent Delhi government as well as the central government is already taking all steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, without however restricting day-to-day life any more than necessary,” the bench said.It added that besides the general restrictions put in place by the governments, each institution is taking its own steps for restricting the spread of COVID-19 virus.“We are confident that not only will Delhi government enforce guidelines already issued to prevent spread of virus during the election, a body as the DSGMC also, will take all possible steps to ensure that the conduct of elections is not a source of spread of the COVID-19 virus,” the bench said in its April 8 order.A letter was sent to the Chief Justice on April 7 by petitioners Jagmohan Singh and Manjeet Singh Chugh, voters in the list maintained by the Directorate of Gurdwara Elections, and it was registered as a petition and placed before the bench.The petitioners sought postponement of elections on the grounds that there is an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases in the national capital with doctors stating that if the cases continue to rise at the same rate, Delhi will have 15,000 cases per day and the situation is grim as there is no adherence to the norms.They have stated that during the election meetings held by various parties and their candidates, it has been seen that neither the candidates nor the voters attending such gatherings are complying with the COVID-19 guidelines on masking and social distancing.They added that in the past also, elections of the DSGMC have not been conducted on time and the existing body has continued beyond its tenure and can function for another few months, keeping in mind the high rate of infections.The counsel for Delhi government said that once the election process has begun, it is not to be interfered with.He said the petitioners have concealed that they had earlier also filed a petition seeking deferment of elections on another ground which was dismissed in March itself and the present plea is yet another attempt on their part to have the elections deferred and to perpetuate the existing body.The high court found merit in the contention of the Delhi government counsel that the petitioners ought to have disclosed the earlier filing of the petition by them in which they had sought deferment of elections till framing of rules and placing a ceiling on the election expenses incurred by the contesting candidates.“The conduct of the petitioners of seeking deferment of elections in the earlier petition as well as in the present petition does indeed raise a doubt that the petitioners are acting at the behest of the existing committee members who desire to perpetuate their term as members of DSGMC beyond the stipulated time. There is no merit in the petition. Dismissed,” the bench said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-dismisses-plea-to-defer-delhi-sikh-gurdwara-management-committee-elections-due-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases-238998

The Punjab Board has broadly aligned its examination dates with those of CBSE.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-writes-to-centre-seeking-postponement-of-cbse-board-exams-238983

The farmers said the present government at the Centre was moving on the same lines as over 350 farmers have died during the ongoing protests at Delhi borders but it had failed to accept the justified demands of the farming community.The leaders exhorted farmers to take inspiration from the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh massacre and continue the protest till the three controversial laws were repealed. The farmer organisations also criticised the government’s plan of setting up a ticket counter outside the memorial. They said people would launch another agitation if the government did not abandon its plan to set up the ticket counter.Leading the protest, farmer leader Balkar Singh Dudala said: “Like the British government, the present rulers, too, are working against the common masses.” He said the three agriculture laws would destroy the farming community and benefit the corporate.Another leader Rattan Singh Randhawa said: “The farmers’ protest at Delhi borders will soon complete five months. The government is indifferent and focused more on elections. Any sensitive government would have by now addressed the issues of the agriculture sector.” He said the protest would continue till the demands of farmers were accepted. Others who addressed the gathering included Davinder Singh Chattiwind, Harjit Singh Jheeta, Mehtab Singh Sirsa, Bachittar Singh, Hoshiar Singh Jhander and others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-pay-tributes-to-jallianwala-bagh-martyrs-238852

They said they were seeing more infections in youngsters and children, unlike the first wave.Senior Medical Officer AS Duggal said a high number of youngsters were being tested positive. “Even kids below the age of 10 and those below 30 years are getting infected,” he said.Jalandhar Civil Surgeon Dr Balwant Singh said during the first wave, mostly elderly were affected, but this time, the virus has been proving fatal for youngsters as well. “Also, infection is spreading quickly and patients are getting serious at early stages,” he said.Nawanshahr Civil Surgeon Dr Gurdeep Singh Kapur said the new strain was spreading rapidly and mortality rate was very high. “This time, we have seen children contracting the virus, which was not the case before,” the Civil Surgeon said.Why are some Covid-19 survivors at risk of blood clotNotably, in Nawanshahr, a high number of school students had got infected.Duggal said even after a year, people were not coming forward to get tested. “People are still adopting delaying tactics so that they don’t have to undergo testing. They still don’t accept that their symptoms might be related to Covid. Residents take medication by their own, which is not right. A person who is aged 30 and contracts the virus, but doesn’t gets tested becomes a carrier. Even if fever does not lasts morwe than three days, the persons will go out and spread the virus,” he said.If every person who has fever gets tested, positivity rate would be much higher, said the doctors.Apart from this, experts in the Health Department said there were still some inhibitions among people regarding vaccination. “They (people) still see if those getting vaccinated in their neighbourhood are safe or not and get inoculated after gaining a little confidence,” said a doctor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/experts-new-covid-strain-more-dangerous-for-youth-238691

The national average is 1.2 per cent.For almost a year, Punjab’s fatality rate remained above 3. Till the end of January, the case fatality rate in Punjab was 3.23, which was the highest in the country. Since then, the fatality rate is coming down consistently.In past one month, the state has reported around 82,940 cases and 1,557 deaths. The number of cases has witnessed almost 40 times increase as compare dto the situation in January.While figuring out the reason behind high fatality rate, state health officials say a large chunk of population in Punjab suffers from comorbidities. However, the reason behind the decline in CFR is the increase in the number of cases in proportion to the number of deaths.Nationally, after Punjab, the distant second is Sikkim, where the CFR is 2.1, which is followed by Maharashtra and West Bengal with CFR 1.7. Among the neighbours, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have CFR 1.6, Chandigarh and Delhi 1.5, Jammu and Kashmir 1.4 and Haryana 1.53 more succumbThe state reported 3,009 cases and 53 deaths in the past 24 hours. In the district-wise break-up of deaths, Hoshiarpur topped the list with seven deaths, followed by Sangrur and Gurdaspur (six each), Amritsar, Jalandhar and Patiala (five each), SAS Nagar (four), and Kapurthala and Ludhiana (three each).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fatality-rate-dips-to-2-75-in-punjab-but-still-highest-in-country-238701

Besides, the central government had asked Patiala to enhance focus on vaccination.Dr Bhasker said the Centre, in its report, had said 100 per cent of the active cases in Ludhiana were home isolated, which was obviously not true. “There was some communication gap in the interpretation of data, therefore, we have now replied with explanation thereof.”Dr Sumeet Singh, an epidemiologist, said: “Our testing figures are far better than the national average. So, there is no question of low testing. Moreover, our contact tracing is better than the national figure.”On the Centre’s remark on the pace of vaccination in Patiala, Deputy Commissioner Kumar Amit said they had been vaccinating more than 8,000 people every day, which was the second highest in the state.The central government had directed Patiala and Ludhiana to enhance contact tracing and said contact tracing in SAS Nagar was hampered due to staff shortage.

It would have ensured an uninterrupted tradition of paying respects to the martyrs,” he said.“When people are visiting religious shrines and shopping malls, and leaders are addressing political parties in various parts of the country, why restrictions were imposed on remembering the martyrs?” asked Amarjit Singh Bhatia, a visitor.He recalled that as a child, he had accompanied his “tayaji” (father’s elder brother) Prem Singh Bhatia when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had felicitated him during her visit to Jallianwala in 1972. Prem Singh had survived gunshot wounds during the 1919 massacre.Sunil Kapoor, general secretary of the Jallianwala Bagh Freedom Fighters’ Association, said the memorial had been lying shut since February 15 last year. On the other hand, police officials said in view of the surge in Covid cases, there was a ban on all public gatherings, including political rallies, in the state, and therefore they could not allow the martyrs’ kin to visit the place.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jallianwala-bagh-closed-martyrs-kin-stage-protest-238704

The board has pegged the estimated cost at Rs 292 crore to be shared equally by the Railways and the state government. MLA Vij said the state had already given “administrative approval for Rs 146 crore.”“This amount will be deposited with the Railways soon,” he said.All nine railway crossings close down simultaneously when the Joginder Nagar-Pathankot train passes by, after which the town becomes “static and economically unviable” for six-eight hours every day. Traffic jams are the order of the day and real estate prices have fallen.The proposal for the track’s elevation has been hanging fire for the past three decades.In the period ranging from the 60s till the 90s, the city’s economy flourished on the basis of timber, transport and tourism.

Functioning in a restricted mode for more than a year following the Covid outbreak, the court was initially hearing a limited number of cases through videoconferencing. Although physical functioning has resumed to some extent in the subordinate judiciary, the process of hearing matters is yet to gain momentum.As a result of the inordinate pendency of cases, it is suspected that many of the petitioners are no more there to pursue their grievances. When some of these cases are suddenly listed, the counsels are often at a loss in the absence of complete records or instructions. Attribute it to the shortage of judges in the subordinate judiciary, or the filing of frivolous pleas and delaying tactics, the fact remains that the delay also tends to change the course of the outcome.The assertion came in a civil suit where the trial court vide an impugned order dated March 2, 2020, rejected the defendant-petitioner’s application for leading additional evidence. Referring to the facts of the case, Justice Mittal asserted the defendant-petitioner was obviously trying to delay the trial and such tactics could not be condoned in law. The trial court noted that the defendant-petitioner did not examine himself and his own witness, despite 17 opportunities having been granted to him. “The tendency amongst litigants to delay the trials is on the rise and this adds to the arrears of the courts of law. The time is now right to curtail such tendencies,” Justice Mittal ruled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/curtail-tendency-among-litigants-to-delay-trials-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-238713

During interrogation, the boy, who has been sent to a juvenile home, admitted to hitting his grandmother with an iron rod in the head before setting her bed afire.The police said the boy had planned the murder after watching a TV series. “He even tied his hands and feet and hid in a bed box to give an impression that the crime was committed by outsiders,” SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said. They said the boy had called his parents, who had gone to a nearby market, and said some unidentified people had entered their house and killed his grandmother.Mahal said the boy’s father Harjeet Singh, a resident of a village under the Hariana police station, had informed the police about the incident.“The boy told his father that the attackers had threatened to kill the entire family if he did not withdraw the court cases against them,” the SSP said. Initially, a case was registered against unidentified persons on Tuesday under Sections 302, 201 and 34 of the IPC but the investigation revealed that the boy’s statement did not match with the circumstances.

The firm, at best, has an alternative efficacious remedy to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal.  The ruling by Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri came on a petition filed by an Amritsar-based firm against City Union Bank Limited and another respondent. It was seeking the quashing of demand notice dated July 3, 2019, issued under the SARFAESI Act. Directions were also sought for quashing possession notice dated September 18, 2019, on the ground that it was ready to settle the dispute by way of one-time settlement as a prospective buyer had given consent to purchase the property. The Bench asserted it was of the opinion that the present petition was liable to be dismissed. Admittedly, the petitioner-firm was a defaulter and Rs 7,12,90,740 was outstanding towards it as against a total loan of 7.05 crore taken at various points of time.  It was further not in dispute that the petitioner-firm was declared as a non-performing asset on September 30, 2018. Not even a single penny was paid thereafter. Consequently, the respondent-bank initiated proceedings to recover the money, which was the only way with it to secure the lent amount. “Once that it so, we do not see how the present petition is maintainable, as the petitioner-firm expects us to interfere in the due process of law adopted by the bank at this stage when the possession has been taken way back on September 18, 2019,” the Bench asserted. Referring to a Supreme Court judgment, the Bench observed it was held that SARFAESI Act was a complete code in itself and the HC ought not to have entertained a writ petition in view of the alternative remedies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-cant-interfere-once-bank-proceeds-under-sarfaesi-act-238719

He demanded that the IG’s probe report be made public.In a statement, Capt Amarinder said: “I have rejected his resignation. Kunwar Vijay Pratap is a skilled, capable and courageous officer. We will challenge the HC orders.”The IG headed the SIT, probing the 2015 police action in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan against people protesting over sacrilege incidents. His investigation had held many senior cops and former Akali MLA Mantar Singh Brar guilty. The probe also pointed fingers at former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and the then CM Parkash Singh Badal for “mishandling” the situation.In his resignation, the IG didn’t mention the investigation or the HC order. A senior police official said the IG said he had completed 22 years in service and wanted to take voluntary retirement. The IG did not respond to calls and messages.There are reports that AAP leaders are in touch with the IG. Party MLA and leader of opposition Harpal Cheema, however, denied any such move.On the other hand, the state BJP too is looking for new faces to contest Assembly elections on all 117 seats. “It is not a mere coincidence that Sidhu, who has challenged the authority of his own party’s CM a number of times, timed his Bargari visit when the IG resigned.

Kotkapura and its two nearby villages, Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and Bargari, have been the epicentre of controversy for the past over five years. On June 1, 2015, a ‘bir’ of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from the gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of this ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of the gurdwara in adjoining Bargari village. There were massive protests in which two Sikh protesters were killed at Behbal Kalan, followed by the killing of a Dera follower at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 16, 2016.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-targets-capt-govt-over-weak-probe-in-bargari-sacrilege-cases-wants-sit-findings-made-public-238531
14-04-2021||Neha Saini||Healing trees: IRS officer Rohit Mehra starts a tree hospital and ambulance in Amritsar||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, April 12From using plastic bottles to create vertical gardens and popularising the concept of micro-gardens and seed balls, IRS officer Rohit Mehra, who is known for his ‘green ideas’ has now come up with probably the nation’s first tree hospital and ambulance service.For the initiative, Mehra has been working on several sustainable ideas to preserve green wealth and encourage low-cost and eco-friendly lifestyle ideas. Opening a tree hospital is just one of the many green initiatives this IRS officer has come up with. 32 kinds of services offered“The idea behind the tree hospital and ambulance service is to safeguard our plants as everything in our ecology is dependent on them. We offer 32 kinds of services such as removal of outgrowths, tree guards, nails, transplantation services for heritage trees, immunity boosters for plants and trees as required and provide expert care and advice to those who seek it,” said Rohit. Within just a month of its operation, Rohit and his team of 20 volunteers at the hospital has already received more than 300 queries.“People call us to help them preserve some heritage trees in their backyards that have been compromised due to concretisation. Some seek help to protect plants from insect attacks and to provide them with immunity boosters. We also help in unpoisoning of plants,” he said.The unique services have attracted the interests of city residents. Rohit has converted an e-rickshaw into a green ambulance that stocks necessary plant medication and the required equipment. He has also been creating awareness regarding preservation of green belt in the local community.Through his latest initiative, Rohit wants to encourage people to learn to live in harmony with the nature. “I am a firm believer that trees are our ancestors and we cannot survive without them. Just like a human body or any other living being requires regular nourishment and care, trees too require care and protection,” he said adding that he aspired to expand the idea of tree hospital to other cities, including Ludhiana, where he was posted at that time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/healing-trees-irs-officer-rohit-mehra-starts-a-tree-hospital-and-ambulance-in-amritsar-238298
