22-04-2021||Chandigarh||One side of road at Singhu border to be cleared for oxygen supplies: Farmer leaders||Farmers camping at Delhi’s borders in protest against three new agriculture laws of the Centre on Thursday said one side of the highway at the Singhu border will be cleared for giving passage to vehicles carrying oxygen supplies.The decision was taken after the leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farm unions that is spearheading the agitation, met officials of the Haryana government in the evening.“At the meeting, it was decided to remove the barricades on one side of the highway at the Singhu border to give a free passage to oxygen, ambulance and other such emergency services,” SKM leader Darshan Pal said in a statement here.He said the protesting farmers will support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in every possible way and they are committed to causing the least inconvenience to the citizens.The meeting was attended by the Sonepat superintendent of police, officials of the Chief Minister’s Office and several SKM leaders, the statement said.Darshan Pal dismissed the allegation against the protesting farmers of obstructing oxygen supply to Delhi as “baseless”.He alleged that the police were seen “misdirecting” the trucks carrying oxygen towards the protest sites, instead of guiding the vehicles towards the shortest route to the national capital.The farmer leader further blamed the government for putting up barricades on the road that were obstructing a free passage of vehicles.He said more farmers will start coming back to the protest sites from Friday.A large convoy of protesters will be leaving for the Singhu border from Barwasni in Haryana’s Sonepat district on tractor trolleys, he added.

22-04-2021||New Delhi||Red Fort violence: Court allows Delhi Police to obtain Deep Sidhu’s voice sample||A court here on Thursday allowed Delhi Police plea to obtain the voice sample of actor-activist Deep Sidhu, accused in connection with the Red Fort violence on the Republic Day.                       Metropolitan Magistrate Sahil Gupta allowed the application in which the police claimed that in order to authenticate the voice of the accused in several videos (Facebook live, TV interviews etc.), it was necessary that his voice was matched with the voice in those video clippings.Sidhu was arrested on February 9 and was granted bail by a Delhi court on April 16 in the case.       He was later arrested in another related case and is currently in judicial custody, while his bail application is pending in the matter.In its application, the police said that during the investigation, it came to the notice that accused was live on Facebook page and also made various posts on the date of incident.    “These video clips/Facebook live have been taken on record which contain the voice of accused,” the police told the court, while seeking his voice sample.The application was opposed by Sidhu’s counsel, saying that the police plea was an infringement of his fundamental rights.While allowing the police plea, the court termed as ‘premature’ the arguments made by the counsel for the accused that the application was vague and lacked any concrete detail of the videos for which the voice sample was required, saying that “the manner in which investigation is to be done is the prerogative of the investigating agency”.“Also, at the stage of investigation, one cannot assume that by obtaining the voice sample, false evidence by tampering with the video clips could be imputed against the accused.    “The admissibility and quality of evidence is a question to be determined during the trial and not at the stage of investigation,” the court said.The court added, “In light of above observation, the application of the IO (investigating officer) is hereby allowed. The accused Deep Sidhu was, in FIR No. 98/21, remanded to 14 days in Judicial Custody.”“Production warrant be issued against the accused with direction to Jail Superintendent to produce the accused at FSL, at a convenient time allocated by FSL, under more favourable conditions for the purpose of recording his voice sample in the presence of his counsel,” the court said.On January 26, thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border clashed with police, the agency claimed in its FIR registered in connection with the Red Fort violence, adding that many of them driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted.In the FIR, police said two magazines with 20 live cartridges were snatched from two constables by protestors who also damaged vehicles and robbed anti-riot gear.

Taking the issue seriously, School Education Secretary Krishan Kumar has issued directions in this regard.Commenting on the decision Kumar said, the condition of submitting transfer certificates was causing unnecessary harassment to the parents wanting to change schools of their children due to one reason or the other. Therefore, in order to resolve the problems being faced by the students, all earlier instructions regarding obtaining the transfer certificate from the previous school have been waived off.While admitting the students to any recognised/affiliated school, the school head might, after ascertaining the facts from other sources, allow the admission. Parents could give a self-declaration that the student had actually studied in the previous school and had passed the examination of the previous class, the spokesperson said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-waives-off-transfer-certificate-norm-for-admission-to-govt-schools-242710

22-04-2021||Washington||Manish Tewari urges Biden to take steps against ‘increase’ in hate crimes against Sikhs in US||Senior Congress leader Manish Tewari has written to US President Joe Biden expressing concern over “increase” in hate crimes against Sikhs in America, saying last week's Indianapolis shooting has reverberated throughout the community both in India and the diaspora.Eight people, including four members of the Sikh community, three of whom were women, were killed in a mass shooting at a FedEx location in Indianapolis.“As we approach the 20th anniversary of the dastardly 9/11 attacks, it is regrettable but needs to be flagged that the aftermath of that catastrophe saw an increase in hate crimes targeting the Sikh community,” Tewari said in a letter to Biden that was delivered to the White House on Wednesday.The Congress leader expressed "deepest condolences" to the aggrieved families of the “horrific and dastardly” tragedy at Indianapolis.“I represent the constituency of Sri Anandpur Sahib in the Indian Parliament. This constituency is located in the state of Punjab situated in the North West of India. Punjab is the natural and spiritual home of millions of Sikhs who live across the world,” he said.“This unfortunate outrage in Indianapolis has reverberated throughout the community both in India as well the diaspora. This tragedy is personal for me as it was in Sri Anandpur Sahib that the Sikh faith was consecrated on the 13th of April 1699,” wrote the Congress leader.Tewari highlighted the August 2012 attack on a Sikh temple at Oak Creek in Wisconsin which claimed seven lives.“Members of the Sikh faith once again became victims of a perverse mindset,” he said.“May I on behalf of the over two million people that I represent and the state that the community calls its organic home, appeal to your good self to kindly advise all US state governors and mayors to try and ensure that members of the Sikh faith are protected from such gut-wrenching and absolutely senseless attacks,” Tewari wrote.Noting that the Sikh community is “very altruistic”, Tewari said: “Most recently this spirit of selflessness was evidenced once again when the Sikh community of New York City served meals to health care workers, Covid-affected patients as the city was ravaged and unable to cope with rising cases of Covid,” he said.“It is integral to the Sikh ethos to serve all those who need to be served de-prioritising one's own needs for the greater good of society,” the Congress leader wrote.

On an average, three persons are testing positive in rapid antigen test (RAT) everyday.The lockdown fears have forced migrant workers, including those owrking in industries and brick kilns, to head back to their native places while farm labourers have decided to stay put.Santosh, a daily wager who hails from UP, says trains are going full everyday and now he is paying Rs 3,000 for bus travel in order to reach his native place as soon as possible. “Going home is better than starving. I didn’t get a train ticket, so I borrowed Rs 3,000 to pay for bus travel.

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi smugglers among top 3 notorious gangs in Canada||From drug trafficking to gang wars, extortion and money laundering, Punjabi smugglers figure among top three notorious gangs in Canada behind the biker gangs and Vietnamese groups.The Punjabi gangs have hogged international limelight these days with the Canada police claiming on Monday that they have broken a major drug cartel run mainly by Punjabis. Out of 33 persons charged for the possession of drugs and firearms besides huge currency and a gold-plated car, nearly 25 were of Punjabi origin.Reward policyThough this is the biggest operation concerning the Punjabi community, reports reveal a number of smugglers were arrested earlier also, though never in such large numbers. Notably, Punjabi gangs are formed on clan basis. Gangs of Johals, Dhak-Duhre, Sanghera, Malhi-Buttar, and the Kangs feature regularly in drug seizures, gang wars and other criminal activities. One report from Canada said about 21 per cent of gangsters died in gang-wars or police operations since 2006 were of Punjabi region.Their activities are of high concern back home in Punjab as some of the gangs have been linked to either arrested or wanted smugglers. The main being the gangs of Devinder Dev, Kamaljit Chauhan and Amarinder Singh Chhina.The Punjab Police and NCB officials said Dev even had links with the Jagdish Bhola gang. These persons had used Punjab as the base to transport drugs to Canada, the USA and Australia through the Golden Crescent of drugs network featuring Pakistan and Afghanistan. In December 2017, a couple identified as Gurminder Singh Toor and his wife Kirandeep Kaur was caught with little short of 100 kg of heroin they were smuggling into Canada. In September 2018, another Punjabi Inderjit Bhinder was caught with 41 kg of heroin on the US-Canada border.“Punjabi smugglers in Canada and Punjab have a robust network. They indulge in to and fro of drugs. While Canadian gangs are interested in cheap ‘import’ of heroin from Afghanistan via Pakistan and Punjab, they ‘export’ refined drugs besides cocaine and ICE to Punjab,” said a police official.He said the Punjab Police was hoping to get the details of local links of the smugglers arrested in Canada so that their network in Punjab could be checked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-smugglers-among-top-3-notorious-gangs-in-canada-242358
22-04-2021||Jalandhar||Hundreds of fish die in Kali Bein||Days after the water supply from the Mukerian hydel channel was snapped, hundreds of fish have died in the Kali Bein at Sultanpur Lodhi.Environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal said, “It is the fourth time that this is happening. The water flow from the Mukerian hydel channel was stopped on April 17. We had informed the PPCB that the pollutants from the toxic discharges into the Bein might kill the fish. While officials came to visit the spot, fresh water in the Bein was still not released. The level of the oxygen in the water has been reduced to 0.4 mg/L. Dead fish began turning up yesterday. The number is likely to rise tomorrow. The toxic discharges from the Bhalane Dian Colonian and the partially operational STP, Kapurthala, have also choked the Bein. Without fresh water, the fish die due to the toxic discharge.”Even after two decades of Seechewal’s kar sewa drive at the Kali Bein and numerous letters to the PPCB, council and various other departments, the dumping of pollutants at multiple points in the Bein has continued unabated. Notably, the dying of fish in the Bein ahead or after Baisakhi every year has now almost become a routine affair. This happened earlier in 2013, 2015 and 2017.The environmentalist said the stretch near the Ber Sahib Gurdwara was the worst-affected as most of the dead fish had been found there. Seechewal said, “Every year during the repair of the Mukerian hydel channel, water is stopped for some days. As the level of toxic discharge is high, fish die.”Deputy Commissioner, Kapurthala, Deepti Uppal said, “The SDM has been informed about the situation and he is reviewing it. Action will be taken accordingly.”Prof SS Marwaha, Chairman, PPCB, said, “The issue was brought to the notice of the state government on Baisakhi regarding release of water into the Kali Bein. It had stopped the water due to repair work for some days. Today fresh water has been released into the Kali Bein. I have also asked a team at GADVASU to look into the cause of the deaths of the fish.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hundreds-of-fish-die-in-kali-bein-242359

In 2021-2022 budget, the SGPC has allocated Rs 223 crore for education.The SGPC has spared Rs 8.96 crore for the salaries of its 38 aided and non-aided schools. During the current session, an expenditure of Rs 34 crore has been estimated to exceed the actual income from its educational institutions only. It is learnt that due to non-approval of posts in its aided schools by the government, the SGPC on its own had recruited teachers. Hence, no grant was being paid by the government against such recruitment.Balkar Singh Valtoha, general secretary, Government School Teachers’ Union, Punjab, claimed that teachers of schools that run under the SGPC directly were not getting their salaries regularly.SGPC chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami said, “The SGPC’s main source of income is through offerings. Due to the pandemic, the footfall of devotees has come down. The government is providing 20% lesser grant against aided posts which has further increased the burden. Still, the SGPC is committed to pay teachers’ dues, though delay can be there.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-schools-struggle-to-pay-salaries-to-teachers-242389

Today, 15,000 persons from the three borders at Dabwali, Khanauri and Sardoolgadh reached the protest sites.”Confirming this, Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala, vice president, Kirti Kisan Union, said he came back two days ago and had been holding meetings with the members of his union, urging those who were free from the harvest and the sale of wheat to go to Delhi.Baldev Singh, a marginal farmer from Bhairupa, who has been at the protest site since November last year, said for the past two days thousands of farmers had returned for fear that the government could forcibly evict the morcha leaders.“We think the deadlock with the Centre will end if the BJP does not do well in the elections, especially in West Bengal... it is all the more important to strengthen our cadres at the protest site,” he said.With many of them having sold their harvested wheat, they are free for a little while before they plant the next crop, and are now going back to the border in droves. Almost 50 percent of these are women. Gurpreet Kaur, from Brass village, today led a group of 46 from her village to the protest sites, which include 37 women. “Our village took a conscious decision that since the men are still in mandis, the women should move to Delhi in high numbers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/eviction-threat-unions-fortify-protest-sites-242293

These days, they are busy stenciling and printing old gunny bags before putting these to use.Every bag needs to be stencilised with “used bag allowed for RMS 2021-22” to use them for packaging wheat in purchasing centres.Facing a shortage of jute gunny sacks for the packing of wheat, the state government on Saturday gave its approval for the use of good quality used (old) gunny bags.However, before using these old bags, the Food and Supply Department has issued directions to follow some instructions. As per these directions, before putting these old jute bags to use, there will be reversing and stenciling of every old bag.Though the department has asked procurement agencies to make this reversing and stenciling of old bags, the agencies have shifted this responsibility on arhityas and farmers. Other than making printing of “used bag allowed for RMS 2021-22”, it is compulsory to print the name of arhtiya’s firm on every bag.As per the directions by the Food Supply Department to all food procurement agencies, the agencies have been asked to maintain proper account of wheat delivered in the old bags and monthly report regarding the use of used bags would be given to the FCI.Sources revealed that food procurement agencies were facing 26 per cent shortage of jute gunny sacks in the state. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/stenciling-on-reused-bags-troubles-growers-242296

22-04-2021||Ropar||Probe gunny bag shortage : SAD||Demanding resignation of Agriculture Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, the SAD today alleged the shortage of bardana during the procurement season was a conspiracy to take monetary benefit out of the crisis.SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema sought a judicial inquiry to expose the conspirators behind the shortage of bags. He said initially the state government failed in getting jute bags and later it delayed purchasing second hand ones. He said the minister must clarify under what circumstances the order for required quantity of gunny bags could not be placed in time, even though usually every time such order is placed nearly four months before the start of the procurement season.“The tenders for jute bags were not floated timely to create circumstances under which purchase of plastic bags was forced and people involved could make crores,” he alleged.Cheema further alleged people involved in the scam earned crores, while farmers continued to suffer. Local SAD leaders would present a memorandum for the Chief Minister on April 24 to all Deputy Commissioners, he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/probe-gunny-bag-shortage-sad-242298

22-04-2021||Muktsar||Channels shut, Sirhind feeder carries ‘black’ water||The Sirhind feeder canal is carrying “black” polluted water of the Buddha Nullah even as many water channels are closed for cleaning. This has lead to acute shortage of potable water in Muktsar and some neighbouring districts. The Sirhind feeder canal supplies water to a number of minors.A number of waterworks in the district are shut or operating after using underground water, which is unfit for consumption in most parts of the district. The reverse osmosis (RO) water treatment plants, too, in villages are non-functional from the past few years.Davinder Singh, a resident of Haraj village here, said, “The Sirhind feeder is carrying black water and the waterworks in our village are not operating. We have no option, but to use underground water, which is saline.”Similarly, Baljit Singh, a resident of Gurusar village here, said, “We are forced to use dirty water from the Sirhind feeder canal to irrigate our fields. The authorities concerned should be taken to task for supplying polluted water.”Some residents of Muktsar town said they were not getting potable water supply through the waterworks from the past few days.Amritdeep Singh, Executive Engineer, Water Supply and Sanitation Department, Muktsar, said, “There has been canal closure for almost a week from April 14, so we are unable to supply potable water. We have taken some samples of water being supplied from the canal.”Jasjit Singh Gill, Superintending Engineer, Water Supply and Sanitation Department, Muktsar, said, “I will immediately get the reports from the executive engineers.” About the “black” water flowing in Sirhind feeder canal, Rajiv Goyal, Superintending Engineer (Canals), Ferozepur, said, “Many minors are closed for regular cleaning. The relining work of the Rajasthan feeder canal is under way. Earlier, 12,000 cusecs of water flowed in the Rajasthan and the Sirhind feeder canals. As the Rajasthan feeder is closed and about 2,000 cusecs is flowing through the Sirhind feeder, polluted water of Buddha Nullah is visible.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/channels-shut-sirhind-feeder-carries-black-water-242301
22-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM writes to Vardhan over O2 plants||Faced with shortage of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today urged the Centre to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply, with at least 120 MT daily allocation for the state, while reiterating his request for urgent steps to set up two pending pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants approved by it two months ago.Allocate 120 MT dailyIn a letter to Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Harsh Vardhan, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh requested that allocation to Punjab be kept at least at 120 MT daily, excluding (22 MT) of Punjab quota in supply to the PGIMER, Chandigarh.In a letter to Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Harsh Vardhan, the Chief Minister sought immediate consideration of his request for uninterrupted oxygen supply from the liquid medical oxygen suppliers as per commitment on a daily basis. He also requested that allocation to Punjab be kept at least at 120 MT daily excluding (22 MT) of Punjab quota in supply to the PGIMER, Chandigarh.Alarming surge 4,970 Daily cases69 Deaths in 24 hoursWhile the capacity for storage of medical oxygen for all healthcare facilities in the state was around 300 MT, daily consumption/requirement of medical oxygen as per the present case load in Punjab was around 105-110 MT, the Chief Minister pointed out, adding that this was expected to further rise to around 150-170 MT in the next two weeks as per the projections of increase in hospital admissions due to the rising case load.Captain Amarinder noted that since the main requirement of the state was fulfilled from outside, adherence of supply as per the allocation made by the Centre for all states, including Punjab, was critical to be able to meet the daily requirements. The Central Control Group on Oxygen had allocated 126 MT (including 32 MT from the local ASUs) on April 15th, 2021. However, the allocation has subsequently been reduced to 82 MT from the week of April 25, 2021, said the Chief Minister, adding this allocation would be grossly insufficient to meet the demand. Further, the Central allocation control room had clubbed allocation of Punjab with the Union Territory of Chandigarh (22 MT) which further reduced the allocation for the state, he added.The demand is currently fulfilled by the manufacturers, refillers, ASUs of the state and PSA plants in few of the districts, both in government and private sector. He said the biggest constraint faced by Punjab was the supply to the manufacturers/distributors and the refillers for liquid oxygen was fulfilled by manufacturers from outside the state (namely Inox, Baddi, HP; Air Liquide Panipat & Roorkee; and Linde, Selaqui, Dehradun) as there was no liquid medical oxygen plant within the state.On the two pending PSA plants, which were approved by Centre two months earlier for Government Medical College and Hospitals at Patiala and Amritsar, he urged the Union Minister to initiate the process for setting them up expeditiously, in order to reduce oxygen requirement from the suppliers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-writes-to-vardhan-over-o2-plants-242310
