Farmers are helping COVID warriors reach their destinations, it added.The SKM, the statement said, with the help of some social welfare organisations and doctors, is encouraging farmers to maintain sanitation at the protest sites.At Tikri border, a team led by Dr Sawaiman Singh is reaching out to the farmers and urging them to take necessary precautions against coronavirus, it added.On Wednesday, the Delhi Police created a green corridor for a truck carrying oxygen containers from the Singhu border to a private hospital in Rohini that was running out of supply.

The farmers have been harassed since the day the BJP government came to power,” he said.Further, he said, “I have noticed that farmers in Haryana are not facing any problem in the procurement centres. In Punjab, the Union government is deliberately harassing the farmers. The BJP government at the Centre is resorting to all sorts of manoeuvres to crush the peasant movement.”He said, “If the black laws are not withdrawn the Centre will have to pay a heavy price. I will go first to thank the Central Government and would pay homage at the Golden Temple.”On this occasion the Chairman of Zila Parishad Mansa and Congress leader Bikram Singh Mofar said that “if the Union Government tried to suppress the farmers’ agitation by using force, we will take a large number of tractor trolleys from our area to reach the protest site to support the farmers’ struggle”.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait was honoured with a cart. He also commended the contribution made by Bikram Mofar in farmer agitation by setting up a permanent tent and arranging rations from the area and taking the farmers to Delhi.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait was also felicitated by the farmers of the area at the residence of Chaudhary Anoop Singh Karandi of Karandi village.Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November of last year against the Centre’s agriculture reform laws.The protesting farmers are demanding the repeal of the three laws along with a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for their produce.More than 10 rounds of talks between the central government and the farmers’ union have failed to end the deadlock.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-never-allow-centres-operation-clean-to-succeed-rakesh-tikait-243580

The DC has been asked to ascertain the facts and circumstances leading to the deaths at the hospital, which prima facie seemed to have flouted orders given to all private hospitals with Oxygen shortage to shift their patients to Government Medical Colleges. The DC has set up a two-member committee, comprising a PCS officer, Dr Rajat Oberoi (Deputy Director Local Bodies), who is also in-charge of the death analysis committee, and a civil surgeon Amritsar, to probe the matter, an official spokesperson said later.Taking stock of the situation in view of the Oxygen shortage being reported from various hospitals, and the fact that the current allocation to Punjab is not sufficient to meet the urgent needs, the Chief Minister said he had already taken up the matter with the Centre, seeking increase in quota on urgent basis, and Chief Secretary, Vini Mahajan, was following it up. Sudden influx of patients from neighbouring States had put added burden on oxygen requirement of Punjab, he noted.Ordering closure of industrial operations at the iron and steel plants, the Chief Minister said the state government will convey its decision to the Centre. The Chief Minister has also asked for a feasibility report from the Power Department on use of thermal plants for providing oxygen for medical use.Punjab has witnessed a sharp increase in demand over the past few days. Demand for Oxygen currently stands at 250 MT per day and is further expected to go up to 300 MT in the coming days on account of spiralling Covid cases.The Chief Minister also directed that contracted oxygen supply under private hospitals may be reviewed to ensure that oxygen supply is optimally used and rationalised across the State. Reacting to reports of increase in the price of oxygen by suppliers, he asked PSIC to discuss, negotiate and settle the pricing with bulk suppliers and inform Principal Secretary, Medical Education & Research, on the final decision.In another decision, he ordered PHSC to procure 100 more Oxygen concentrators, including 50 approved earlier, in addition to 234 Oxygen concentrators already being utilised in Covid facilities.  It was pointed out that Oxygen concentrators can support L2 facilities with current patient load, and also help increase the number of L2 beds in facilities such as in Tarn Taran and in Gurdaspur where more L2 beds are needed.Principal Secretary Industries has been directed by the Chief Minister to urgently set up the State Control Room at Udyog Bhawan, Chandigarh, with support from Director Industries and Commerce, with other officers, as required, to be provided by the Personnel Department. The PS Industries has also been asked to get the control rooms in districts set up at the earliest. The state control room will ensure that all oxygen supply from within Punjab and from outside is closely supervised and directly monitored by the government. The Chief Minister directed the Department of Health & Family Welfare and Punjab Police to provide all necessary support in this regard. The district level control rooms will map all oxygen vendors, suppliers, bottlers and re-fillers for each hospital, so that it can monitor and facilitate oxygen provision accordingly.Vini Mahajan said later that two senior officers, Harpreet Sudan (IAS) and Rahul Gupta (PCS), are being posted to the state control room to coordinate all activities. In view of shortage of oxygen cylinders, all districts having industries with empty unused cylinders would be asked to use those, such that they can be refilled for medical use.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-orders-shutdown-of-industrial-operations-at-iron-steel-plants-to-divert-oxygen-for-medical-use-243569

Warning of stringent action against violators, the Chief Minister said anyone, including officers and police personnel, found conniving in illegal sand mining operations should also be dealt with strictly.While directing the DGP and the newly constituted Enforcement Directorate Mining to crack down strictly on any night mining activity, the Chief Minister, however, ordered that there should be no hindrance to the smooth movement of sand and gravel during the night in view of the high level of construction activity going on in the state.Availability of the material at affordable price should also be ensured, he told the department, directing Principal Secretary Mining, to coordinate with authorised contractors to bring down the prices of sand and gravel.During the meeting, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Minister, Water Resources, informed the Chief Minister that the creation of Enforcement Directorate for Mining had made a positive impact on the ground in curbing illegal sand mining activities.

A hospital official said they had also informed the families and asked them to shift the patients to other hospitals.The shortage of oxygen in the district was reported three days ago when Government Medical College had shifted to its buffer stock. Later, the district administration and Medical Education Minister OP Soni had claimed that oxygen supply had been restored.However, the local chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Friday apprised the deputy commissioner of the shortage faced by private hospitals.The problem of shortage of oxygen has partially been due to the administration diverting the entire supply to Government Medical College which is handling the maximum Covid cases.The IMA alleged that private hospitals are not being given oxygen by vendors and police guards have been deployed outside the godowns so that the maximum supply is reserved for government hospitals.Also read: Manjit Singh, attendant of a 33-year-old pregnant woman admitted to Neelkanth hospital, said, “The administration has the responsibility to care for all patients. Patients admitted to private hospitals are as important as those admitted to government hospitals.”He said he had been asked to shift the patient to another private hospital. “If one hospital does not have oxygen, what is the guarantee that the other would not face the same problem,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/6-patients-die-following-oxygen-crisis-at-private-hospital-in-amritsar-cm-orders-probe-243526

For the purpose, the gurdwara has also set up a helpline, 9097041313.Explaining the process through which the oxygen is provided to the needy, Singh’s son Rumid Singh Rabin (in his 20s), who has been actively involved in the exercise, said, “As soon as the gurdwara receives a call on the helpline number, a car is sent to the patient and as soon as the patient reaches them, they are provided oxygen supply until the person’s oxygen level reaches to the safe level or till hospital bed is not allotted to him or her.” He said for some logistic reasons the services are not provided at the patient’s door.“Amid this critical situation when many leading hospitals are facing an acute shortage of oxygen, this initiative by the gurdwara is commendable as people are getting immediate relief. A large number of people are already gathering at the Indirapuram Gurdwara for oxygen supply,” said Raghav Pal, a local resident, who got oxygen for his brother at the facility.Covid has been creating havoc in Uttar Pradesh as the state recorded 34,379 new cases in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day spike. As many as 195 persons succumbed to the virus. Ghaziabad saw almost 1,000 cases in a single day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gurdwaras-oxygen-langar-proving-lifesaver-for-covid-patients-as-govt-runs-out-of-supplies-in-ghaziabad-243515
24-04-2021||---||IKGPTU staff oppose decision to set up skill varsity at Chamkaur Sahib||Kapurthala, April 23The staff of IK Gujral Punjab Technical University (IKGPTU) here is sore over the fact that the state government, without any prior recommendation of the varsity’s Board of Governors, has okayed the upgradation of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Institute of Skills at Chamkaur Sahib into a skill university from the 2021-22 session.Notably, the Sri Guru Gobind Singh Skill Institute was to come up as IKGPTU’s constituent campus. The IKGPTU staff has alleged that the NOC for change of land use (CLU) was yet to be granted for the site and not even a single brick had been laid yet for setting up of the constituent campus when the government had even announced the upgradation of the proposed institute as a university.Dr Dinesh Kumar, president of the University Teacher Welfare Association, said the IKGPTU had not granted any approval for it to be turned to a Skill University and the state government had no power to take any decision of its upgradation. “The Board of Governors is the sole decision-making body of IK Gujral Punjab Technical University,” he maintains.Pawan Kumar Khichy, president, PTU Non-Teaching Employees Association, recalled: “The state government had planned to develop Skill University at Chamkaur Sahib as per the initial announcement made by the Punjab Chief Minister in 2017. But due to financial crisis, the state government could not fund the project and eventually put the financial burden on IKGPTU to establish its campus there with a plan to later convert it into Skill University.”He added: “In 2016 also, the then SAD-BJP government bifurcated IKGPTU into two universities and created Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University for which they demanded Rs 550 crore from IKGPTU. A civil writ petition was filed by employees of IKGPTU against this decision of the Punjab government in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on which verdict came against the state government and its decision was held unconstitutional. The High Court further went on to state that ‘it is an outrageous and arbitrary provision which permits one separate statutory entity to make forays into the financial autonomy of another statutory entity created under a separate Act without there being a provision in it enabling such an outflow’. But by then, Rs 150 crore had already transferred. Going on the same lines, the current Punjab government is using the financial resources of IKGPTU to establish yet another university.”Pre-empting such a move, the employee association leaders said they had already raised an alarm and had written to the Board of Governors not to establish any campus at Chamkaur Sahib via an email sent on October 18, 2018, but the BoG had then ignored the concerns of its employees.They further alleged: “It is clear that the Punjab Government has very cleverly chose this time for the announcement as strict curbs have been imposed in Punjab regarding holding any protest. If the available financial resources of IKGPTU are diverted, then there shall be no funds left for the development of the university and to pay salary to employees”. The employee associations have planned to meet Governor of Punjab and Chancellor IKGPTU and Chairman BoG, IKGPTU, to register their grievance.

The Bench ruled that IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh (who has taken premature retirement) indulged in political manoeuvring and misused his official position.In his 89-page judgment release today, Justice Rajbir Sehrawat ruled that conversation between a CM with the district administration or the state DGP during disturbed law and order was not sufficient to infer conspiracy to kill or injure anybody through police firing upon the protesters, unless some other material was collected by the investigating officer to establish prior meeting of minds for conspiracy, directly linking the CM to it.Kotkapura firing: Simple crime probe made to fester, rules HC“If mere talking by the Chief Minister, or for that matter by a minister, with his DGP or the district administration is taken as criminal conspiracy, any CM can be held criminally liable every day for any wrong-doing resulting from wrong functioning of district officials,” Justice Sehrawat ruled.The Bench said the fact that the then CM was in touch with the district officials showed he was alive to the situation and to his responsibility. “Otherwise, he would have run the risk of being branded another Nero playing fiddle when Rome was burning.”No material was collected by Kunwar to even remotely suggest a direct link to any conspiracy, except the call records. After hearing senior advocate RS Cheema for the petitioner-police officers, the Bench ruled the firing was stated to have taken place in the “third stage after a third order was passed by the civil authorities…the protestors are recorded to have chased and attacked the police, including with swords. Therefore, the conclusion that the protesters were sitting peacefully when the police started firing and also the conclusion that firing by the police was unprovoked, is against the record,” the Bench asserted.Kotkapura probe: Amid clamour, Cong top leaders briefedPROBE CONDUCTED IN PERFUNCTORY MANNER||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/badals-get-high-court-clean-chit-in-kotkapura-firing-case-243352

Rakesh Mishra, Director, CSIR’s Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, said findings from an early study revealed that Covishield offered protection against the double mutant.The scientists said the double mutant had been detected in some samples from Maharashtra, but was not a common cause for infection. “Punjab and Kerala don’t have it.Both these states have had major outbreaks recently,” said Anurag Agrawal, Director, CSIR-Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. “Many doctors, who have received the Covid shots, but have had breakthrough infections have some kind of an escape variant and yet have a mild disease. This is a good sign for the quality of our vaccination programme,” Agarwal said.

Bishnoi had recently moved an application in the court, opposing his production warrant, fearing a fake encounter.Dismissing the plea, CJM Sanjeev Kundi observed there was no reason to distrust the police and it should make formal arrest of the accused and make him join investigation in the case.In such cases of serious nature, when direct evidence was not easily available or the modus operandi of the commission of the offence was such that there were certain hidden facts that needed to be brought to the fore, custodial interrogation of the accused by the police was necessary as Bishnoi was accused of playing a role in the crime at the back stage, observed the court.Opposing his production warrant, Bishnoi relied on Supreme Court’s February 4 order staying permission for Bishnoi’s custody to the Haryana and Chandigarh Police.Denying relief to Bishnoi on the basis of the SC order, the CJM order said the present incident occurred on February 18, but the SC stayed permission for his custody to Haryana and Chandigarh Police on February 4, so the SC’s order did not operate as stay of proceedings in the present case.Counsel for accused Bishnoi argued there was no reliable evidence with the police to connect him with the murder. To save real culprits, the police wanted to eliminate Bishnoi in a fake encounter, he alleged.However, the police claimed Bishnoi along with Goldy Brar of Canada had taken responsibility for the killing through a Facebook post.Bishnoi remained at the back stage and masterminded the murder, so his interrogation was urgently required to unearth the conspiracy and motive of elimination of Pehlwan, the police maintained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bring-gangster-lawrence-bishnoi-from-ajmer-jail-court-243351

The weather-linked insurance will protect the income of small and marginal farmers by compensating them in case of loss in milk yield, which normally happens with the rise in temperature.The product was recently launched on a pilot basis, covering 1,905 buffaloes in 270 villages of Bathinda, Ludhiana, and Tarn Taran districts. Once it is successful, it will be launched across the state and later on in other parts of the country.At Rs140 premium, Rs2,500 sum assured“Milk production is severely affected by temperature-humidity index (THI). It decreases with the increase in temperature to the extent of 10 per cent. Further, during summer, indigenous dairy animals also suspend their breeding activity, affecting the milk production,” said JS Gill, Director Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU).Based on research, the period between April and September has been verified as heat stress period by the university. Lactating cattle experience stress when THI is more than 72 and severe stress when THI exceeds 88.A premium of Rs 140 per animal is being charged from participants and in case THI breaches its limits an approximate amount of Rs 2,500 may be released to them as sum assured. According to 2019 livestock census, there were 38 lakh buffaloes and 24 lakh cows were in the state. The average daily milk production in the state is around 340 lakh litres.“The project is being implemented through a multi-departmental coordination involving GADVASU, Punjab Agricultural University, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development Board, Punjab Energy Development Agency and Punjab State Council on Science and Technology. ICICI Lombard has been entrusted for the purpose,” said Dr Rajiv Siwach, CGM, NABARD, Punjab Regional Office.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-a-first-milch-cattle-yield-to-be-insured-243350

Arhtiyas have accused officials of diverting the anger of farmers towards them for failing to ensure a speedy lifting.“We have been trying to find good quality old gunny bags, but have failed to meet the demand. Some persons had already hoarded a majority of such bags as they were already aware that the government would announce their reuse. The approval for the reuse of old bags has been given to favour certain influential persons and not to help farmers,” said Ravinder Singh Cheema, president, Arhtiya Association Punjab.“The government officers are provoking farmers by saying that we are not providing used gunny bags. These are baseless allegations,” said Cheema.

They vowed to continue their protest until the process was expedited.Slow procurement and lifting — despite the government’s claims of smooth and hassle-free process — has created a glut of wheat at many grain markets of the district. As per the district administration, 61.24 per cent of the total procured wheat has been lifted so far. A total of 9,361 MT of wheat was lifted on Friday.Jasdev Singh Nugi, a farmer, said: “The procurement of wheat at the Chappar Grain market has been severely hit due to lack of gunny bags. Consequently, farmers have to spend nights at the market. We will continue to protest until procurement is expedited.”Notably, two procurement agencies, Markfed and PUNSUP, are, reportedly, facing a shortage of gunny bags which has affected the procurement process in some grain markets. District Food and Supply Controller Harsharanjit Singh Brar, however, said: “We have now enough bags as the government has allowed to reuse old gunny bags.”Farmers also said rain had added moisture to wheat that was lying in open at the grain markets. However, the district administration claimed they had provided the enough tarpaulins to keep the grains dry.  Govt presenting wrong figures: SAD||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-farmers-protest-tardy-purchase-243343

It resulted from dangerous mixing of religion, politics and the police administration. As such, the aggrieved — whether the police persons or the injured protesters must be finding themselves cheated and endlessly waiting for real justice,” Justice Rajbir Sehrawat ruled.The Bench added the investigation conducted by IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh suffered from malice, irrationality and absurdity. As such, it was one of the rare cases where the court was under duty to step in and quash the investigation and consequent report under Section 173, CrPC, filed in the two cases related to the incident.Kotkapura probe: Amid clamour, Cong top leaders briefedThe Bench ruled Kunwar was a person who indulged in misuse of his official position to further his designs. He made attempt to overawe the processes and the authority, indulged in theatrics and political manoeuvring to draw mileage out of it. He went to height of fantasy when he brought film actor Akshay Kumar into the picture. Even the religious act of alleged pardon of Dera Sacha Sauda, Sirsa, was brought into picture to strengthen his hypotheses of conspiracy against Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal.

Jalandhar can only produce 2,400 cylinders from two plants.Designated supply ensuredOf 2,200 cylinders generated in city, 400 are sent to other districts. The remaining have to be divided equally among private hospitals. Designated supply has been ensured. Officials have been deputed at processing units to eliminate foul play. — Ghanshyam Thori, DCAs the number of patients grows in city hospitals, the district needs a 16 MT tanker of liquid oxygen from outside to meet its demands, says the administration. To add to this, the district has at least 27 patients referred from outside the state, including Delhi, Himachal, Haryana and Jammu.Private hospitals warned that lack of oxygen was driving the city’s health system to the brink of collapse.Dr BS Johal, proprietor of Johal Hospital, submitted to the DC and the Civil Surgeon he was referring five of his patients to the Civil Hospital due to lack of oxygen.“I had 47 patients on oxygen support with six hours of supply left this afternoon. We can’t let our patients die. There was no option but to refer them. Against the quota of 65 cylinders a day, we need 170 to 180. After the letter, we were allotted 100.

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing: Punjab and Haryana HC gives clean chit to Badals||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has not only given former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal a clean chit in the Kotkapura firing case, but also ruled that the conclusion of police firing being unprovoked was against the record. The Bench also ruled that IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh indulged political maneuvering and misused his official positionIn his 89-page judgment release on Friday, Justice Rajbir Sehrawat ruled conversation between a Chief Minister with the district administration or the State DGP during disturbed law and order situation was not sufficient to infer conspiracy to kill or injure anybody through police firing upon the protestors, unless some other material was collected by the investigating officer to establish prior meeting of minds for conspiracy and directly linking the CM to it.“If mere talking of the Chief Minister, or for that matter by a minister with his DGP or the district administration, is taken as a criminal conspiracy, any Chief Minister can be held criminally liable every day for any wrong-doing resulting from wrong functioning of district officials,” Justice Sehrawat ruled.The Bench added the fact that the then chief minister was in contact with the district officials, rather, showed he was alive to the situation and to his responsibility even during odd hours. Otherwise, he would have run the risk of being branded as another Nero playing fiddle when Rome was burning.No material was collected by Kunwar to even remotely suggest direct his linkage to any conspiracy, except the call records. He claimed the then CM talked through the phones of his principal secretary and OSD. But their version was taken on record to substantiate the nature of conversation. None of the other witnesses was stated to have even remotely suggested that he conspired to kill the protestors by police firing.Police firingAfter hearing senior advocate RS Cheema for the petitioner-police officers, the Bench ruled the firing was stated to have taken place in the third stage, after third order was passed by the civil authorities. “The protestors are recorded to have chased and attacked the police, including with the swords. Therefore, the conclusion that the protestors were sitting peacefully when the police started firing and also the conclusion that firing by the police was unprovoked, is against the record,” the Bench asserted.Kunwar Vijay Pratap SinghThe Bench found that Kunwar conducted the investigation in a perfunctory manner and the final investigation report filed by him was more in the nature of a hypothesis based on his assumptions and fantasies, than on material or evidence. Even before starting the investigation in FIR No.192 dated October 14, 2015, he declared police firing was totally ‘unprovoked’ and the protestors ‘peaceful’The petitioners were successful in showing he went to the extent of manufacturing statements of witnesses to suit his designs. The conclusions drawn by him were found to be against the statement of witnesses and material collected.He intended to create a narrative in favour of a political party against the other during the election process. Public pressure to get alleged erring police officials convicted also appeared to have adversely affected the fairness of the investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kotkapura-firing-punjab-and-haryana-hc-gives-clean-chit-to-badals-243145

Punjab’s supplies come from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and there are reports of supplies being ‘hijacked’,” he said at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s virtual conference to discuss the Covid situation with chief ministers of the worst-hit states.On the vaccination front, the Chief Minister said at the rates declared by one manufacturer, the cost to the Punjab government will be over Rs 1,000 crore. He sought central government funding for vaccination, with permission to make the cost a fit charge on SDRF funds in the interim.Regular vaccine supply must be ensured to maintain the supply chain to the last vaccination booth, he said, adding that due to supply shortage, the vaccination in last one week has been slightly low, ie, around 75,000-80,000 daily. While Punjab received fresh supplies on Thursday, the current stocks could last only three days as demand for vaccine is increasing, he stressed.Amarinder also expressed concern over lack of clarity on the quantity of vaccine to be made available by the Centre after May 1, and how the manufacturers will regulate supplies to different states and private purchasers.The state government, on its part, has constituted an expert group under virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang to advise on our vaccination strategy for those from 18-45, which states have been allowed to vaccinate at their cost, he said.The Chief Minister also pointed to the shortage and blackmarketing of medicines like remdesivir and toci, which, he said, was creating panic in the media and general public. Though the Centre was making efforts to increase their supply, a clearer messaging was required to inform the public that they are not magic wands, and also about available substitutes, he stressed.Pointing to the shortage of anti-viral remdesivir injections and zero availability of toci injections in the state, he said hospitals were, however, following treatment protocol for critical patients and using alternative medicines.Citing the increase in the number of cases to around 5,000 per day, with 10 per cent positivity in the last one week, from around 3,000 per day with 8 per cent positivity during the last virtual conference on April 8, the Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to direct central institutions like AIIMS Bathinda, PGI Satellite Centres and Military Hospitals in Punjab to provide additional Covid beds. Pre-fab structures on offer by CSIR could be used for this purpose, he said, pointing to the grave situation in the state, with a case fatality rate of 1.4 per cent.Expressing concern over the fact that Punjab had not received any fresh results on viral genome sequency in the last almost a month, when the last results showed over 85 per cent UK strain, Amarinder urged the Prime Minister to order escalation of efforts to understand the mutations, and their implications for proper policy response.  He also urged the Centre to build a consensus on Covid-appropriate behaviour to check the spread of the virus.Assuring the Prime Minister of all-out efforts by his government to combat the Covid spread, the Chief Minister said his government had launched a series of containment measures with stringent enforcement. He listed some of the measures in place in the state, and added that micro containment zones are being increased with special monitoring teams.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centres-vaccine-policy-for-18-plus-unfair-to-states-says-amarinder-243093
