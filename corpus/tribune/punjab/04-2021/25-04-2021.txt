ESIC should be asked to support the vaccination of industrial workers covered in the scheme, and the Board for Welfare of Construction Workers for construction labourers, he added.Reviewing the vaccination strategy, the chief minister asked an expert group led by Dr Gagandeep Kang to submit a priority list for that age group (vulnerable groups in high risk areas -high transmission, high mortality, etc. including Construction workers and Industrial workers) in its first report by April 29.He also made it clear that in pursuing the 18-45 age group vaccination strategy, the state government would not compromise on its ongoing vaccination drive for people over 45.The Chief Minister said the government will consider approaching Astrazeneca (India) directly to allow Punjab government to avail the lower price of Rs 162 per dose available to the global community.The state has so far received 29,36,770 doses of Covishield (including 3.5 lakh doses meant for AFMS and Central Healthcare Workers) and 3.34 lakh doses of Covaxin.  Out of the available stock of vaccine till April 22, 25.48 lakh doses of Covishield and 2.64 lakh doses of Covaxin had been utilized, leaving the state with only 2.81 lakh doses of Covishield and 27,400 doses of Covaxin in its stock. The Health Department had on April 22 written to the Union Health Ministry seeking additional supply of 10 lakh doses of Covishield, to be made available on priority to enable the state to meet its immediate requirement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-asks-health-department-to-order-30-lakh-covishield-vaccines-as-it-gears-up-to-vaccinate-18-45-age-group-244043

Around 35 police officials are providing round-the-clock security to these dera followers and their families.The eight, accused of theft of ‘bir’ of Guru Granth Sahib from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village and desecration of the ‘bir’ at Bargari, were provided police security in July last year after the killing of Mohinder Pal Bittu, one of the accused, inside the Nabha jail by two inmates.Their security was further stepped up in January after the Punjab and Haryana High Court replaced the head of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Punjab Police, headed by then DIG RS Khatra. The court orders had come on a plea of a dera follower, who had challenged the summoning order by a trial court, passed after the chargesheet was filed against him by the SIT into the ‘bir’ theft case. With the High Court recently quashing the investigation into the Kotkapura police firing case and the decision on the police investigation in the Behbal Kalan case expected in the coming days, the police see an increased threat to the lives of the dera followers, said sources in the police.

He also directed setting up of oxygen control rooms amid the escalating oxygen crisis in the state.Taking stock of the situation, the CM said he had already taken up the matter with the Centre, seeking increase in oxygen quota urgently.

The demand for oxygen currently stands at 250 MT per day and is further expected to go up to 300 MT in the coming days on account of spiralling Covid cases.Reacting to reports of increase in the price of oxygen by suppliers, he asked the PSIC to discuss, negotiate and settle the pricing with bulk suppliers and inform the Principal Secretary, Medical Education & Research, on the final decision.In another step, he ordered the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC)to procure 100 more oxygen concentrators, including 50 approved earlier.
