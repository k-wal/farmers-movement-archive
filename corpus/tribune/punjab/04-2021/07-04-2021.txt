07-04-2021||---||Ban on political rallies direct fallout of success of ‘Punjab Mangda Jawab’ rallies: SAD||Chandigarh, April 7The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday said the Congress government’s decision to ban all political gatherings till April 30 was direct fallout of the resounding success of the Punjab Mangda Jawab rallies organised by the SAD and that the government had resorted to this step to prevent the public angst from boiling over.In a statement here, SAD Spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the ban on public meetings had more to do with the discomfiture of the Congress party and its chief minister Amarinder Singh than with the COVID pandemic. “In rally after rally, the SAD has exposed the chief minister as well as the false oath taken by the latter in the name of the Gutka Sahib and the Deshmesh Pitah. This has upset the plans of Prashant Kishore who has given the suggestion to ban public rallies to contain the damage being cause to the Congress party.”Asserting that the truth about the Congress government and how it had betrayed each and every section of society besides presiding over scams worth thousands of crores was before the people, Cheema said the Congress did not only want to ban rallies by the opposition, but also its own employees who had come out on the roads against the government. “It is clear that the government wants to control the outburst of public angst against its policies through such autocratic decisions”.Cheema also lambasted the chief minister for imposing lockdowns without any scientific basis which he said had already caused economic devastation in Punjab. He said the Congress government had allowed holding of municipal elections earlier. “Assembly elections are also taking place in five States in the country. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections have also been announced. Similarly the ‘Kumbh’ mela also took place recently which involved congregation of lakhs of people.”The SAD leader said instead of knee-jerk reactions, the government should focus on improving tertiary care in its hospitals and upgrade its medical infrastructure. He said simultaneously the vaccination drive should be intensified.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ban-on-political-rallies-direct-fallout-of-success-of-punjab-mangda-jawab-rallies-sad-235926

07-04-2021||---||Punjab sets target of 2-lakh vaccinations per day||Chandigarh, April 7With Covid positivity and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) rates in Punjab hitting 7.7 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in the last week, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday directed the health department to further increase the vaccination drive and target vaccinating 2 lakh people per day.He also directed the officials to increase the sampling to 50,000 per day, besides vigorously pursuing contact tracing to 30 people per positive patient.Expressing concern at the high CFR rate, the Chief Minister said these deaths, many of which are avoidable with timely treatment, pain him. He directed Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to undertake a massive public awareness campaign to motivate people to approach hospitals at early stages. He said the quality of health care in hospitals also needs to be improved and the list of approved hospitals with required facilities should be put out in the public domain.He said death audit should be done by all districts and private facilities which are not participating in the expert group discussions should be encouraged to do so.The Chief Minister, who was informed by the health department that PGI was refusing to admit patients from Punjab, despite being referred through proper channels, said that he would take up the matter with the Prime Minister at Thursday's video conferencing meeting and would request him to direct the hospital to reserve at least 50 ICU beds for patients referred by the state government. Chairing the weekly Covid review meeting with officials of Health Department and medical experts, the Chief Minister said though under the current vaccination drive about 90,000 people were being vaccinated per day, this needed to be raised to 2 lakh people per day. “Vaccination is the only way to prevent the spread”, he said directing the health department to take immediate steps to speed up the drive.He also asked the Chief Secretary to address the issue of vaccination hesitancy by undertaking well designed media campaigns. He said he would again urge the union government for relaxation in the age criteria for vaccinating people under the age of 45 years in areas showing weekly doubling of positivity rate. He reiterated his demand that the union government should allow vaccinations to all potential super-spreaders - students above 18 years, teachers, councillors, sarpanches etc.On the issue of vaccination supply, Vini Mahajan informed the Chief Minister that the union government had assured that the state would not face any shortage.The Chief Minister was assured by the health department that daily sampling would be increased to 50,000 – 35,000 RTPCR and 15,000 Rapid Antigen Tests. He was, however, informed that government of India’s institutions - IISER, IMTech, AIIMS, PGIMER – were sampling only 100 samples/day, which is low, and the matter was being taken up with the centre.DGP Dinkar Gupta informed the chief minister that all districts were taking penal action for violation of Covid protocols and so far, 2.03 lakhs people had been taken for RTPCR tests after they were found not wearing masks in public. He also said that 43,000 challans had been issued and a fine of Rs 3.60 crores collected, besides registration of 206 FIRs and arrest of 246 people.On the vaccination front, Gupta said 77 per cent of the police personnel had been vaccinated with the first dose and of these 26 per cent had taken the second shot too.The meeting was also attended by Cabinet Ministers OP Soni (Medical Education) and Balbir Sidhu (Health), medical experts Dr K K Talwar and Dr Raj Bahadur and Principal Health Secretary Hussan Lal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-sets-target-of-2-lakh-vaccinations-per-day-235887

In over 15 hours journey, he was not given water and food on the way and was also denied medical aid. Due to this, he became unwell and reached Banda jail in a semi-unconscious state," Afzal Ansari, the BSP MP from Ghazipur, told PTI.Afzal Ansari, however, did not elaborate on how did he get to know about the treatment meted out to his brother during his transfer to the Banda jail.Also read: Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari brought back to UP's Banda jail from Punjab"The Yogi Adityanath government has left behind Britishers by such acts. Contrary to the jail manual, Mukhtar has been kept in isolation barrack. Those who have to protect laws are creating terror. It would have be better that he (Mukhtar) was made to stand at some road crossing and shot dead." he said.The Uttar Pradesh government in an statement issued here said, "Undertrial Ansari was brought from Punjab's Ropar jail at about 4.50 am to Banda prison gate by a special team and he finally got entry at 5 am. All his belongings were checked and no objectionable items were found. A team of Banda Medical college doctors did his check-up and found no immediate health issues." "Mukhtar Ansari would be tested for COVID-19 later in the day inside the jail. According to the Supreme Court orders, with the help of district administration and Chief Medical officer, Banda, his health arrangements are  being ensured," the statement said.ADG, Prison Anand Kumar has given strict instructions for round-the-clock security of Mukhtar Ansari, who is also Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau.Elaborate arrangements have been made inside the prison, where he will be kept in barrack number 16, which will be under 24-hour camera surveillance, the statement said, adding the entire Banda jail is covered with CCTV cameras and is being monitored by senior officers from jail headquarter command centre in Lucknow.For outer security of the jail, additional force of PAC has been deployed and Banda city magistrate has been made incharge jail superintendent for administrative and security arrangements, it said.Two new deputy jailors have been deputed and additional head jail warder and jail warder have been made available to the prison, the government statement said.Afzal Ansari also claimed that the blood-sugar level and blood pressure of Mukhtar Ansari, who has diabetes, have increased and alleged that the jail administration is not accepting the request to provide him a doctor."Instead of treating him, he was being administered injection to put him to sleep," Afzal Ansari alleged. He further claimed that his brother was kept in the ambulance for over one-and-half-hours even after reaching the Banda jail."At around 9 am, some persons known to Mukhtar reached the jail to meet him but were returned from the prison premises. Mukhtar is an undertrial and despite this he is getting treatment like a convict," he said, adding "such a treatment was never given to any undertrial in the history of the country".After spending over two years in a Punjab prison, Mukhtar Ansari was brought back to Banda jail in the early hours of Wednesday.He was ferried in an ambulance guarded by a strong posse of gun-toting security personnel throughout his 900-km journey from Rupnagar to the Uttar Pradesh town in the Bundelkhand region.Mukhtar Ansari was lodged in Rupnagar jail in January 2019 in connection with an extortion case. He is facing 52 cases in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere, and 15 of them are in the trial stage. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mukhtar-ansari-denied-food-water-during-punjab-up-transfer-alleges-brother-govt-says-no-health-issues-235864

07-04-2021||---||Jailed Mukhta Ansari handed over to UP Police team||Ropar, April 6The Uttar Pradesh Police took the custody of gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari from the Ropar jail authorities here today. A team from Banda, led by a DSP with 37 policemen, arrived at the Police Lines here around 4.30 am.After staying there for seven hours, the convoy of eight vehicles, including an ambulance, reached the jail around 12 noon, where the authorities had beefed up security by barricading the entrance.After completing the formalities, the Uttar Pradesh Police took the MLA away around 2.10 pm in an ambulance, manned by a doctor, paramedic and a helper.Keeping in view the presence of a large number of mediapersons in front of main gate of the jail, the convoy used gate No. 2 to exit the premises for Banda, 900 km away. Ansari had been lodged at the Ropar jail since January 2019 after he was brought by the Punjab Police from the Banda jail on production warrant for allegedly demanding ransom from a businessman.After the Ropar jail authorities refused to hand him over to the UP Police, the Yogi Adityanath government moved the Supreme Court. On March 26, the apex court ordered the Punjab Government to shift the MLA to the Uttar Pradesh jail. Following this, the Punjab Home Department had written to the UP Government asking it to take Ansari away by April 8.Meanwhile, the controversial private ambulance that Ansari took to appear in a Mohali court from the Ropar jail on March 31 was taken away by the UP Police last evening. The ambulance was found abandoned 10 km from Ropar on the Anandpur Sahib road on Sunday. It was found registered on fake documents at Barabanki in the name of a private hospital in Mau, from where Ansari is a BSP MLA.A section of the media had reported the chassis number of the seized ambulance had been tampered with. Ropar SSP Akhil Chaudhary, however, claimed the police inspected the vehicle but did not find any tampering.‘CBI must probe MLA’s prison stay’Chandigarh: Former Vidhan Sabha Deputy Speaker Bir Devinder Singh on Tuesday demanded a CBI inquiry into Mukhtar Ansari’s links in the upper echelon of power in Punjab. “It’s reprehensible that Punjab Jail authorities strongly resisted the UP Police move to give back Ansari’s custody. The CBI should identify those behind making his two-year stay in Ropar jail comfortable and unravel the ulterior motive to retain Ansari for such a long duration in Ropar jail,” he said.

Experts are wondering as to how the illegal construction, especially lifting of lintel with jack machines, was allowed without any official intervention.Meanwhile, the Ludhiana police have arrested unit owner Jaswinder Singh Sonu, while contractor Mohd Harun is on the run.Experts say the fatal roof collapse on Monday that left four dead and nine injured, or for that matter the 2017 plastic factory collapse after a blaze that killed 16 persons, are the direct outcome of “slack enforcement” and “collusion” of staff and officials of the regulatory mechanism of MC.Sources in the MC said around 15,000 illegal buildings, mostly commercial and industrial, had been constructed in the city without approved building plans and/or in gross violation of building bylaws. “In most of these buildings, standard safety norms have been compromised,” they said.Kapil Arora, president, Council of Engineers (CoE), said the mishap took place due to negligence of MC officials and employees who failed to perform their duty diligently. “Had timely action been taken to stop an illegal construction of this extent, the tragedy could have been averted,” he said.He said lifting of existing roof/building was a common practice in various countries, but with advanced technology and equipment as it saved time and cost of construction. “In Ludhiana, such lifting is commonly performed using jacks, loose bricks and wooden logs only, which is wrong and highly risky. It can turn out to be dangerous and also fatal if not done after proper structural analysis of existing buildings as the strength and condition of the building plays a major role in such highly risky practice,” Arora said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhiana-mc-officials-role-under-lens-in-roof-collapse-case-235587

Cotton growers in the Malwa belt (hub for cotton cultivation in the state) rued that an increase of Rs 37 per packet would add up to the already high input cost they have been grappling with for a long time now.The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has via notification confirmed the increase in the price of Bt cotton seed. On an average, the cotton cultivation on one acre requires minimum of three packets of Bt cotton seed.A sizable number of cotton farmers after not getting remunerative prices for the produce were coerced to resort to paddy cultivation in the past few years. But after concerted efforts of the Agriculture Department, the area under cotton was increased to 81,000 hectare in Bathinda district in 2019-20. Following a bumper crop this season, both private as well as government procurement agencies made a record purchase of cotton on remunerative prices.In the Malwa region, cotton is grown on a large scale in Bathinda, Mansa, Faridkot, Abohar, Ferozepur, Barnala, Muktsar and Fazilka districts.Balkaran Singh Balli, a leader of Punjab Kisan Sabha said, “Such moves are nothing but knee-jerk reactions of the Centre to pressure the farmers protesting the three agricultural laws.

Jainism was based on principles of non-violence, truth and universal brotherhood, it stated.  “Keeping in view the religious sentiments of Jains, every year, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been issuing orders of ban on slaughtering of animals, serving of non-vegetarian food in hotels and closure of liquor vends. As a tribute to the apostle of peace, the 24th ‘tirthankara’ of Jains, the Punjab Government should also announce a ban on slaughtering on this pious day,” he said. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ban-meat-sale-on-mahavir-jayanti-jain-community-appeals-to-punjab-cm-235590

The elections to the civic bodies were held in February.In the guidelines on the elections of presidents and senior vice-president and vice president in municipal councils and nagar panchayats — issued by the Joint Director, Local Government, to the Deputy Commissioners — section 7 reads that for candidates to be elected as president against a reserved post should have been elected from a reserved ward for the specific category.The clause not only denies the right to a reserved category candidate who has won from a general category ward, but also violates the Supreme Court order in a case of Haryana.Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra said, “The law has been strictly followed. But I will look into the matter.” Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) Chief Sunil Jakhar, who heads the Committee for electing mayors in municipal corporations and presidents of municipal councils and nagar panchayats, said he had no knowledge about the tweaked guidelines.As per the “The Determination of the number of Elected Members and Reservation of Offices of President of Municipalities Rules, 1994” for municipal councils and nagar panchayats, the posts of president in Khanna, Morinda, Mukerian, Kot Fatta and Kot Ise Khan civic bodies had been reserved for SC candidates. The Kharar, Nayagaon, Nurmahal, Longowal and Kot Shamir civic bodies had been reserved for women (both general and SC) and the civic bodies of Kotkapura, Patran and Lehra Mohabat had been reserved for Backward Class candidates. The remaining municipal councils and nagar panchayats are for general category candidates.Violation of apex court orderThe apex court in one of its orders had said “whether the office of president of a municipality is required to be filled in by a member belonging to SC, ST or Backward Class,it would be enough if one belongs to one of these categories irrespective of the fact whether they have been elected from a general ward or a reserved ward”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/norms-to-elect-civic-body-chiefs-tweaked-235591

Likewise on February 9, Punjab’s AAP co-incharge Raghav Chadha presided over gatherings in Gurdaspur, Batala and Pathankot, where there were blatant violations. The BJP and the Congress, too, had big gatherings in the run-up to the recent MC polls.The government’s Covid notification reads: “If suitable measures are not taken to prevent the spread of Covid, it can pose grave danger to human life.”“Visit the vegetable market early morning and you can see poor labourers and small-time kiosk owners being fined. However, when it comes to challaning a powerful person, the same cops suffer a meltdown,” said Romesh Chander, a local.Meanwhile, SSP Nanak Singh said he would probe as to why the demonstrators went scot-free. “I will also inquire why the police did not take any action in this regard,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-norms-cops-hound-poor-spare-the-powerful-235598

Meanwhile, the Army has fixed a recruitment rally at Ferozepur, 117 km from Abohar, for which the youths have been told to reach by 5 am on Wednesday along with the mandatory latest Covid-negative report.  On Tuesday, dozens of youths were seen walking from the Civil Hospital to the Subdivisional Administrative Complex. They told SDM Jaspal Singh Brar that for the past three days, they had been visiting the hospital for tests and reports but to no avail. They feared that delay in tests or reports may deprive them of the opportunity to take part in the recruitment rally. When contacted, the Civil Hospital officials said the test reports were awaited from the Faridkot lab, which was burdened with samples from three districts.  Notably, no additional arrangements have been made to meet the requirement arising due to the Army recruitment rally.  However, an official, trying to pacify the aspirants, said the SDM had taken note of the issue and pending tests and reports would be cleared by tonight.  Meanwhile, sources said the Rajasthan Government had set up two testing labs at Sriganganagar, 40 km from Abohar, one each in the district hospital and a private hospital, which provide the reports within six-seven hours.

They have now written to the Sangrur DC and Vigilance Bureau for a high-level inquiry and sought strict action against the guilty.“We had spent lakhs on the treatment of my father as he remained ill for many years before his death in 2016. We were hopeful that SSBY would help us in case any other member of our family faces any health issue. After my mother Balwinder Kaur got her SSBY card, rest of us also applied for one. But, the government records show that our cards have already been issued. How is it possible without our fingerprints and Aadhaar card,” Amritpal Singh said.Besides Amritpal, those who do not have the SSBY card in his family are his wife Rajwinder Kaur, daughter Guntaj Kaur, brother Sandeep Singh, Sandeep’s wife Baljit Kaur and their daughter Navdeep Kaur. “Our Aadhaar cards are linked with the ration card. I request the authorities to cancel the cards issued in our name and investigate the matter,” Amritpal said.A senior official said the SSBY was an extended benefit to beneficiaries of various government schemes. “Whenever anyone wants to get the health card of SSBY issued, authorities collect his name, address, fingerprints and Aadhaar card details. With this card, a family can avail treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh in a hospital after being admitted. The goof-up seems impossible as the government has put in place the required mechanism to maintain transparency. But if this has happened, we will investigate it,” said Sangrur DC Ramvir.How’s it possible without Aadhaar card?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/health-plan-under-lens-as-cards-issued-without-verifying-data-235603

Cases are surging and genome sequencing has also established the presence of the variant. This case surge is mainly event driven with marriages, local body elections, and farmers’ agitation playing a part.”On Haryana’s disease graph, Vardhan said the infection spreading to smaller towns is a matter of concern.“What is happening calls for introspection and action. Laxity is evident in this constant surge. Even right now everything is in our control and if we stick to strategies that helped us contain the infection until February we can bring down the cases,” said Vardhan.He said 50 central teams in Punjab, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh will send daily feedback on containment progress to the Health Ministry for corrective action.The minister also said the recent spate of elections, Kumbh, reopening of offices, outdoor events by people and complete disregard for masks had led to the current surge.“The fight against COVID is no rocket science. We just need to do more of the same—masks, hand hygiene, social distancing,” Vardhan said, urging states to stringently remind people of the lost lessons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-protest-events-behind-punjab-surge-harsh-vardhan-235477
