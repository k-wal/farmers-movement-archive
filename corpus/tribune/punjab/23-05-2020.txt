23-05-2020||---||DSGMC objects to depiction of Sikhs in ‘Paatal Lok’ series||New Delhi, May 23The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Saturday asked online video promoter Amazon Prime to immediately withdraw a part of ‘Paatal Lok’ series depicting Sikhs in a bad light.“It depicts baptised Sikhs contrary to their real character. Either withdraw objectionable part or face legal action.” In a statement released here today, Sirsa said Sikhs are always known to be saviours of women and whole world recognises them for their service of humanity, but this series produced by Anushka Sharma has “shown Sikhs as rapists”.He added that what is more intriguing is that one of the baptised Sikh has been shown as a one who is witnessing a rape incident and not reacting on it. He added that it is well known history that Sikhs have even saved women belonging to their enemies and have always lauded women as one who gave birth to kings.No Sikh can tolerate anything against women, Sirsa said, adding the series depicts Sikhs as raping women or a silent participant to this incident, which is unacceptable.“We cannot allow Amazon Prime to hurt our sentiments and faith again and again. This agenda of hatred and painting our religion wrong must stop,” he added.Sirsa urged Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar to take strong action against the web series. He said the series must be banned and Amazon must be fined for their repetitive attempt to disturb religious harmony.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dsgmc-objects-to-depiction-of-sikhs-in%C2%A0paatal-lok-series-88943
23-05-2020||Saurabh Malik||Can’t order opening of religious places on analogy of businesses: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 23The opening of religious places and holding of religious congregations could not be ordered on the analogy of opening of business establishments, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Saturday asserted, while holding that freedom to religion was subject to public order, morality and public health.Upholding the guidelines issued on March 24 by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs stating that all places of worship would be closed for public and religious congregations, a Division Bench of the High Court added directions could not be issued to the State government to relax restrictions regarding places of worship.The order by the Bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Ajay Tewari came on a petition filed by advocate Mubeen Farooqi seeking directions to the State of Punjab and other respondents open all religious places.The Bench added the imposition of restrictions on religious places was in larger public interest and the object sought to be achieved was prevention of gathering at religious places to control the spread of coronavirus.Holding that the guidelines were issued strictly in conformity with the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Bench added the imposition of restrictions was not repugnant to Article 25 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of conscience to every person and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the StateDescribing the current situation as “extraordinary”, the Bench added the restrictions did not amount to interference in the religious affairs of any community. It was a public policy and the scope for judicial interference in such matters was “very limited”.“The restrictions imposed by the Ministry of Home Affairs do not violate any fundamental or legal right of the petitioner or the similarly situated persons. The endeavour of the Ministry is to break the cycle by maintaining social distancing. We will not substitute our wisdom for the wisdom of the Executive decision, which has been taken in the larger public interest,” the Bench added.Before parting with the 68-page judgment, the Bench asserted the right of the State to impose restrictions, required or found necessary on the ground of public order, health and morality, was inbuilt under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and the imposition of restrictions constitutes “paternalistic act”.Merely relaxation of restrictions in certain areas could not be a ground to relax the same regarding religious places of worship. “The discretion not to permit opening of all the places of worship for public and prohibiting holding of religious congregations/gatherings has been exercised judiciously,” the Bench concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cant-order-opening-of-religious-places-on-analogy-of-businesses-hc-88938
23-05-2020||---||14-day home quarantine for anyone coming to Punjab by domestic flights, trains, buses: CM||Chandigarh, May 23Ruling out any complacency despite Punjab posting the highest recovery rate of 90% in the country, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday said all those coming to the state, including via domestic flights, trains and buses, would have to undergo compulsory home quarantine for 14 days.Screening of those entering the state would be done at all state and district border entry points, as well as railway stations and airports, and those found symptomatic would be sent into institutional quarantine, while the others would have to undergo mandatory 2-week home quarantine, the Chief Minister said, in today’s edition of his FB Live programme ‘#AskCaptain’.Rapid testing teams would check on the home quarantined persons while those found symptomatic would have to undergo thorough testing in hospitals/isolation centres, said Captain Amarinder, making it clear that his government would not rely on any certificates of testing from any part of the country or the world. He cited Punjab’s experience with those who came from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, as well as the more recent case of Dubai, from where Punjabis coming back had tested positive despite carrying medical certificates showing them to be negative.It may be recalled that those returning to India via special international flights are already required to undergo institutional quarantine, as per the Central Government’s guidelines.With a large number of Punjabis coming home, and more and more investors also showing keenness to resume business in the state, the Chief Minister underlined the need for strict caution, asserting that “we will not let the pandemic spread further in Punjab, which has so far managed to keep the situation under excellent control”.In response to a question, the Chief Minister said there is likelihood of infection coming here from Punjabis returning from other countries and states, but the state is taking no chances and has made elaborate arrangements for their testing and quarantine.Five flights have come today, and a total of 20,000 people are expected to come from other countries on 88 flights, while 60,000 are expected from other states. “I will not let this infection spread any further in Punjab,” he asserted.The Chief Minister thanked labourers who had chosen to stay back and contribute to Punjab's economic strength, adding that “this is your state and you are part of it”. It is vital for industry to function for ensuring livelihood, he said, urging all to keep following social distancing norms stringently at work places to beat the virus at every step. “Given the way we have controlled the situation, we will not need a strict lockdown again,” he said, in response to a question.1.5 lakh industries resume operationsOf those migrants who had applied for online registration, nearly half had willingly decided to stay back and had also started working in the industry, revealed the Chief Minister, adding that of the total 2.56 lakh industries in the state, 1.5 lakh have already resumed operations.At the same time, his government is moving aggressively to reach out to embassies of various nations looking to shift their manufacturing/business out of China, said the Chief Minister, adding that the state is in talks with various embassies, and offering them all possible support, in terms of land, infrastructure and other facilities, Amarinder said.On the issue of arrangements for transportation of migrants wanting to leave the state, he said his government had been facilitating the return of migrants through special trains, along with 607 buses sent to Bihar, Jharkhand, UP and Orissa.Expressing his appreciation and gratitude for the cooperation of the people in checking the spread of Covid in the state, which has “done exceedingly well in controlling the situation”, Captain Amarinder said the success of Punjab’s strategy is evident from its slowest doubling rate of 86 days against the national average of 14 days.Of the total 2028 confirmed cases in the state, 1819 had fully recovered, he said, expressing the confidence that the 200 patients under treatment would also be fine soon.“There is no patient who is on oxygen support with only one patient on ventilator support,” he disclosed. As far as high recovery rate is concerned, he said it had been possible only by strict discipline by Punjabis in following all social distancing norms.The Chief Minister warned that social distancing and compulsory wearing of masks would need to be strictly followed to keep the situation under control. He said he had directed the police to take stringent action against such offenders.Despite the ongoing battle against Covid and the mammoth wheat procurement operations, the state has achieved 96% BCG and Polio immunisation of its children.Appreciating the hard-working farmers for overcoming all challenges to deliver another bumper crop in these unprecedented times, the Chief Minister said 125 LMT wheat had already been procured and payments were being made strictly as per laid out norms. He asked the farmers to bring to his notice any delay in payment. He also lauded the Agriculture department officials besides police as well as the NCC Cadets for ensuring that the mega procurement operations had so far been conducted without a single case of Covid infection being reported from the Mandis.On some school not following directions regarding online fee charges, the Chief Minister asked the Amritsar resident who raised the issue to share details of the school and promised strict action.Responding to a question, the Chief Minister said ‘Mission Fateh’, as the state’s battle against Covid is called, “reflects our spirit of resilience in the face of war”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/14-day-home-quarantine-for-anyone-coming-to-punjab-by-domestic-flights-trains-buses-cm-88935

Even a small Union Territory like Chandigarh has 49,268 cases pending.National Judicial Data Grid figures reveal more than 5.6 lakh cases are pending in the High Court alone. It is suspected that many of the petitioners in these cases are no more there to pursue their grievances. When some of these cases are suddenly listed, the counsel are often at a loss in the absence of complete records or instructions.Even though the High Court has been making concerted efforts to bring down the pendency, the number of old pending cases has been piling up progressively; and with the Covid lockdown and shortage of Judges, the piles are unlikely to shrink easily. The High Court, as of now, has 55 Judges against the sanctioned strength of 85. Three Judges are scheduled to retire this year upon attaining the age of superannuation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-hc-cancels-summer-vacations-for-itself-lower-courts-88919
23-05-2020||Rajmeet Singh||Completion certificates issued to housing projects in Zirakpur since Oct under probe||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 23After cancelling the completion certificates issued since January this year to residential-cum-commercial projects in Zirakpur, the Punjab Local Bodies Department has widened its probe into the issuance of the illegal certificates. Now, all certificates issued since October 2019 are being probed. The Chief Vigilance Officer of the department, in an interim report, has pointed out that all the certificates are illegal as the minister in-charge and the department secretary were competent only to accord technical approval before issuance of the certificates by the executive officer concerned of the civic body. The instructions, giving reference of Minister Brahm Mohindra’s directions, were issued on October 18, 2019.So far, the department has cancelled the certificates issued after Executive Officer Manvir Singh Gill took over in January this year. Gill has already been placed under suspension by the Additional Chief Secretary, Local Bodies Department, Sanjay Kumar.“Now, the department would cancel all the certificates issued since October last. A public notice is being issued asking all the builders concerned to apply afresh as their certificates stood cancelled," said a government functionary.Pointing to a larger builder-official-politician nexus, the certificates issued to incomplete projects by the Zirakpur MC were meant to be used by the builders to stop payment of the assured monthly returns to their investors. To attract investment, builders offer assured returns on the investment till issuance of the completion or occupation certificates.Though the projects are still incomplete on the ground, the certificates managed by the builders help them stop the assured returns to the investors.The scam came to light after some of the investors reportedly approached a senior government functionary. Sources said the suspended EO, who is said to have the backing of a Congress leader from Derabassi, had initially stated that he had not issued any certificates. But after facing pointed queries from the vigilance teams, he is learnt to have admitted to issuing the certificates. The vigilance is struggling to gets its hand on the entire record pertaining to the projects, it is learnt.The EO did not even carry out physical verification of the projects for issuing fire safety no-objection certificate or giving permissions for sewerage and water connections and setting up of sewage treatment plant. Official record pertaining to some of the projects is said to be missing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/completion-certificates-issued-to-housing-projects-in-zirakpur-since-oct-under-probe-88909

23-05-2020||New York||Sikh student in US drops out of school over bias-based bullying; files lawsuit||A Sikh student in the US state of New Jersey has filed a lawsuit against a Board of Education alleging that he was subjected to bias-based bullying because of his faith and was forced to permanently pull out of school due to the prolonged harassment.Community-based organisation the Sikh Coalition said it has joined with co-counsel at the Law Offices of Brian M Cige to file a complaint against the Gloucester County Special Services School District Board of Education in Sewell, New Jersey.The complaint addresses the case of the Sikh student, who remains anonymous as he is a minor, enrolled at the Gloucester County Institute of Technology.It alleges that the student suffered “under a pattern of bias-based bullying since 2018.” “No student should experience what my child has gone through—not the bullying by fellow students, and certainly not the indifference, dismissiveness, or criticism of the adults who are meant to protect them,” said the student's mother, who also remains anonymous to protect her child's identity.“I am hopeful that a civil court will recognise this clear case of bullying and take decisive action, both for the sake of my child and to create a safer learning environment for all students in this district.”The Sikh Coalition said in a statement that despite being subjected to slurs based on his actual and perceived race, derogatory comments about his articles of faith, and other bullying and harassment to the point that he were permanently pulled out of school, the student's pleas for help from the school district have been repeatedly brushed aside by educators and administrators.Prior to the filing of the complaint this month, the Coalition worked with the family to formally appeal the negative finding of the school district's initial investigation.The organisation said both the first investigation and the appeal ended with the school board refusing to take action; officials ignored the clear pattern of harassment, and insisted on characterising obviously bias-motivated attacks as harmless ‘nicknames.' The suit calls for acknowledgement of the school district's wrongdoing, training and processes to better recognise bias-motivated harassment in the future, and damages.The organisation further said that even after more than a year out of school, the effects of the bullying on this student persist.“The student remains in treatment for negative mental health consequences of his experience. And while students across New Jersey were transitioned to distance learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this student—who was already learning from home—has been subjected to additional reporting burdens and reduced learning time by the district,” it said.Sikh Coalition Senior Staff Attorney Giselle Klapper said the organisation's top priority is ensuring a safe path for the child to return to a healthy learning environment.“However, it is also important that the School Board recognise and remedy how their investigation failed to acknowledge—let alone appropriately respond to—the obvious bias driving this bullying behaviour.This acknowledgment must be accompanied by new training and procedures to keep from repeating these mistakes in the future,” Klapper said.The Sikh Coalition added that despite being members of the world's fifth largest religion, Sikhs in the United States are often subject to bias, bigotry and backlash.“This harassment often focuses on Sikhs' visible articles of faith, including unshorn hair, head coverings, steel bracelets, and other items,” it said.The bullying of Sikh youth on the basis of their perceived and actual identity remains a “systemic problem” in the United States, it said, citing the results of the Sikh Coalition 2014 survey and a report entitled 'Go Home, Terrorist'.In the past year alone, the Sikh Coalition has received 14 legal intakes pertaining to school bullying across the country, it added.

People are said to have been opting for personal vehicles over the PRTC.“Right now, the occupancy was not up to the mark as we are going in deficit only. I hope things would improve in the coming days,” he said.MD informed that only 83 PRTC buses ran on the first day while 114 on the second day. He said that more buses would be pressed into service if the seating occupancy increased.He said: “People are still not aware that bus services have already resumed. Moreover, they may not be knowing all the precautions — like sanitization and social distancing norms — are followed during the travel.”The poor response from the travellers, seemingly, is a cause of concern for PRTC because it has already faced over RS 5O crore losses due to the lockdown.MD Jaskiran said that situation was not good, but the number of passengers was likely to increase after May 30 when the lockdown would be lifted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/only-4-700-people-travel-on-first-2-days-as-punjab-resumes-bus-service-88857

It was around three months ago in February when the PSTCL authorities had noticed that sand was dug up to 20 feet around two 220-kV electricity towers on the Sutlej riverbed at Agampur village near Anandpur Sahib.One of the towers is on the verge of collapse.

Sources in the department said searches were conducted in Mohali, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Bathinda, Mansa and Kapurthala distilleries. This was also confimed by Principal Secretary (Excise and Taxation) A Venu Prasad. Excise Taxation Officers and Inspectors posted in these distilleries were being transferred, the sources said.The department suspects that many of these distilleries, under the garb of making sanitisers, manufactured liquor and sold it illegally. These distilleries may have supplied extra neutral alcohol (ENL) to illegal distilleries that have flourished across Punjab during the lockdown.The distilleries were allowed to manufacture alcohol earlier this month. Misusing labels and passes allowing sale to states such as Arunachal Pradesh, these distilleries are believed to have sold liquor illegally within Punjab, thus evading taxes. The Excise Department is yet to give the nod to liquor sale to Arunachal. Importantly, the average growth in excise revenues in the past three years has been just 2.86 per cent.A meeting of liquor contractors with two members of the Group of Ministers —Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Vijay Inder Singla — was held last evening where liquor contractors are learnt to have raised the issue of smuggling and illicit sales.They particularly mentioned a distillery in Majha region impacting sales at vends in Ferozepur, Fazilka and Abohar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/crackdown-on-all-15-punjab-distilleries-88784

I will welcome his resignation and support his voice against the current Congress regime.”He alleged that, “The reality is that Pargat has a pre-planned strategy and his basic character is to enjoy all privileges of being MLA for the first four years. When the public start questioning his total absence from the area, he scripts a drama to portray himself as an innocent and ethical leader by transferring his failure and allegations onto his party and colleagues. Surprisingly, it took Pargat four years to realise the loss of excise revenue and the losses to the state exchequer and suddenly he has differences of opinion with his own political party.”Makkar along with Youth Akali Dal Jalandhar chief Sukhminder S Rajpal took on the Congress leadership saying, “As per sources, it was from Day 1 that liquor mafia started paying all Congress MLAs their share of excise bootlegging and smuggling and they completely shielded the mafia for about four years. Sadly, public parks were shut during the lockdown, but were actually being used for illegal alcohol supply every day after the sunset. Rather a few Congress men setup their own illegal alcohol factories causing further loss to the state exchequer. All smuggling and protection of mafia by Congress men has led to massive losses to the state’s revenue and huge personal monetary benefits to MLAs and ministers.”He attacked Pargat Singh again, “Pargat woke up and scripted the whole drama to save his skin after the Shiromani Akali Dal and especially Bikram Singh Majithia raised his voice against the bootlegging and smuggling of alcohol in Punjab. I want to ask Navjot Sidhu and Pargat Singh about the castles they are making in the air. I question the validity and strength of their stands for Punjab and Punjabis.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pargat-befooling-punjabis-must-resign-88557

Sources say some centres have fired their staff as enquiries regarding immigration and IELTS coaching have nosedived in the past couple of months.‘POOR RESPONSE TO ONLINE CLASSES’To maintain one’s presence in the market, IELTS centres are conducting online classes. But the attendance is poor. It’s wait-and-watch situation for now. Once the market reopens, we have to start from scratch to attract students.Rahul Gupta, MD, Achievers AcademyAs for students who had planned to study abroad, they are considering alternative options as there is no clarity from colleges and universities about their upcoming academic calendar.Hundreds of students from Doaba were planning to go abroad for the May and September intake. Now, such plans have taken a back seat.Aakash (21), a native of the district’s Jandiala village, said he was on cloud nine three months ago when he received a letter of acceptance from the University of Manchester, UK.After the Covid outbreak, there has no update on his application. “Now, I plan to take admission to one of the local colleges as my immigration consultant has told me that foreign nations may not invite students from other countries until mid of 2021,” he said.The next six to eight months are crucial for the immigration industry. If the situation does not improve soon, many agencies would be forced to shut shop.‘ NO PLAN OF GOING TO UK’I was on cloud nine when I received a letter of acceptance from the University of Manchester. After the Covid outbreak, there has been no update from the university. I plan to take admission in one of the local colleges.Aakash, native of jalandhar’s Jandiala VillageHarsaurabh Singh Bajaj, Managing Director of International Education Services, told The Tribune, “The Covid outbreak has hit the immigration sector hard and its effect will be long lasting. In spite of offering 60 to 70 per cent discount on consultation and IELTS coaching, there are hardly any takers. We have been running online visa consultancy and IELTS classes, but the response has been poor.”Online classes, claimed to be the solution in times of Covid, have failed to beat the lockdown effect. “Only one out of every 10 institutes in the city has the infrastructre to conduct online classes. This arrangement is not easy sailing as institutes have been facing poor Net connectivity,” said Satish Sareen, the owner of Sareen Ligua World.Sources say many immigration and IELTS offices in the district have fired telecallers and teachers as there are no takers for IELTS coaching. This is the obvious fallout as Class XII board exams and final-semester exam of college students are still pending.

23-05-2020||Saurabh Malik||High Court: Private schools can charge 70% fee||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 22ENDS ROWAfter the state of Punjab came out with notifications, memos and orders “making the functioning of private unaided schools virtually impossible” and putting them into “financial difficulties”, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today made it clear that one-time admission fee would be paid by parents in two equal instalments.Putting to rest the controversy over payment of charges during the days of Covid lockdown, Justice Ritu Bahri made it clear that 70 per cent of the total school fee would be charged from the parents. Besides, 70 per cent salary would be paid to teachers during the pendency of a writ petition on the issue.Justice Bahri also directed the state counsel to file a detailed reply and seek instructions on ways the state and other respondents could help private schools “with regard to amount deposited in the ‘reserved fund’ for sanitising the school buildings”.The directions came on a petition by the Independent Schools’ Association, Chandigarh, and other petitioners through counsel Aashish Chopra. Among other things, Chopra contended a vital question of law for consideration before the Bench was whether the directives issued in impugned memo dated May 14 — on schools charging only the tuition fee — were illegal arbitrary, without jurisdiction and rationale.Chopra said the memo had been issued without any authority of law and basis. “It is the inherent and inescapable right of private unaided schools to be able to generate funds to function and discharge their financial obligations. As such, the direction to the schools not to charge fee is unsustainable,” he added. While interim directions have been issued by the Bench, the question of law is yet to be decided.Appearing before the Bench, Chopra contended the Punjab School Education Board had issued directions in the impugned memo that schools could charge only the tuition fee and not building, transportation and other expenses.At the same time, the schools were directed not to reduce the teachers’ salary. “Both these conditions are contradictory, keeping in view that on the one side, parents are to be given concession of not depositing the full fees but on the other, schools are being directed not to reduce the salary of teachers,” Chopra argued.He also submitted that all private unaided schools deposited amounts under the ‘reserved fund’ with the education board, which came out to be Rs 77 crore at present. Referring to the issue of sanitisation, he added it was being done by the private schools.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-private-schools-can-charge-70-fee-88575

He alleged the state government had attempted to exclude Amritsar from the projectfor its “vested interests”.“The authorities will re-evaluate the alignment on the directions of the Ministry for Road Transport and Highways. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has confirmed that Amritsar will be included in the project and an amendment is being introduced accordingly,” he said.Sources said modalities were being worked out to so that the alignment touches Manawala, about 17-18 km from Amritsar city, before tilting towards Gurdaspur.In the last alignment, the expressway was supposed to divert 60 km ahead of Amritsar city through Kartarpur (near Jalandhar).A controversy had erupted over the proposed 575-km-long Delhi-Katra stretch of the expressway as Amritsar was supposed to be dropped from the final plan of the Rs 60,000-crore project. The issue was taken up prominently by MP Gurjeet Aujla and lately, the SGPC had also taken up the matter in its executive body meeting. It is learnt that the land acquisition process for the project had already started in February in parts of Malwa and Majha. Once executed, the travel span between Amritsar and New Delhi will be curtailed to half. “It will tentatively be just a four-and-a-half-hour drive to New Delhi and three-hour drive to Katra,” Malik said.To promote tourismThe e-way project is aimed at promoting religious tourism by connecting two major shrines — the Golden Temple in Amritsar and Mata Vaishno Devi at Katra in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-to-be-part-of-60k-cr-e-way-project-88579
