28-09-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu: ‘Born Congressman’ who stumped party with shock resignation||Nearly five years ago when he joined the Congress, ex-cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu had said he is a “born Congressman” now coming back to his roots.But on Tuesday, he bowled a googly at his party by resigning as its Punjab unit chief.The maverick-triggered political developments saw one of the party’s tallest leaders Amarinder Singh forced to quit as chief minister just over a week ago.Barely days after Charanjit Singh Channi took over as the Punjab CM and on a day portfolios were given to members of the new state Cabinet, 57-year-old Sidhu’s resignation came as a jolt to the party, with the Assembly elections just less than five months away.At the time he switched over to the Congress from the BJP before the 2017 Punjab Assembly polls, Sidhu had said he is a “born Congressman”, who came back to his roots.Sidhu had said he would be ready to work under anybody appointed by the high command and contest from where the party wants him to.It is premature to talk about the issue, Sidhu had then said when asked whether he would like to be the chief ministerial candidate of the party.Four-and-a-half years later, the rift between Sidhu and party leader Amarinder Singh escalated to such a level, resulting in 79-year-old Congress veteran stepping down as chief minister, who said he felt “humiliated” over the way the party handled the protracted crisis.Amarinder Singh, who had called Sidhu “dangerous” and “anti-national”, while reacting over his resignation, again took a dig at him and said, “I told you so, he is not a stable man, not fit for the border state of Punjab.”Donning many hats from cricketer, commentator, TV show host, Sidhu, who also remained a four-time MP, has always maintained that for him Punjab comes first.Sidhu’s father Bhagwant Singh was the district president of the Congress in Patiala and it was his wish to see him play cricket at the international level.Sidhu made his debut in first class cricket in 1981-82 and later went on to earn the sobriquet of “sixer Sidhu” for his powerful stroke play.In 2004, Sidhu began his political innings contesting the Lok Sabha elections on a BJP ticket from Amritsar, where he shifted his base from Patiala, and in his first election defeated Congress heavyweight R L Bhatia.When he was in the BJP, Sidhu had sour relations with the Badal family despite the SAD then being an ally of the BJP. Later, his ties with BJP also turned cold when the party fielded senior leader Arun Jaitley from Amritsar in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.Though he was accommodated in the Rajya Sabha later, he quit the party to join the Congress.Sidhu’s wife Navjot Kaur, who was sitting MLA from Amritsar (East), made way for him to contest the seat in 2017.Just before his joining the Congress, Sidhu had floated a front “Awaaz-e-Punjab” but it was soon shelved.When the Congress returned to power with an overwhelming majority in 2017, it was being speculated that Sidhu would be made the deputy chief minister, but he was made a cabinet minister.As Sidhu and Amarinder Singh’s relations never remained cordial, the latter changed his portfolio from the local bodies to Power, but the cricketer-turned-politician resigned in protest.From the time he quit his Cabinet in 2019 till early 2021, Sidhu maintained a low profile. However, once he was back in thick of things a few months ago, he not only took on the opposition but repeatedly kept on making veiled attacks on the chief minister over host of issues.In July, Sidhu was appointed as the new president of the party’s Punjab unit, notwithstanding the strong opposition from Amarinder Singh.The appointment of Sidhu and four other leaders as working presidents of the state unit came after days of internal squabbling and public bickering that divided the state unit between two factions owing allegiance to Singh and Sidhu.With his elevation as the state Congress chief, the party leadership clearly signalled to put its weight behind Sidhu while ignoring Amarinder Singh’s opposition.The support of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had also helped in Sidhu clinching the post despite strong resistance.Sidhu’s ability to pull crowd and launch a vigorous campaign appeared to have worked in his favour.Sidhu can win an election even in Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan had once said when the Congress leader went to that country to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Khan.Sidhu was later criticised for hugging Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa at the high-profile event.Though Sidhu earned the wrath for his visit to Pakistan, the Amritsar legislator was hailed by many for his role in the opening of the Kartarpur corridor, enabling devotees especially Sikhs to offer prayers at the historic gurdwara in the neighbouring nation.The corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district.

28-09-2021||New Delhi||AAP, BJP train guns at Navjot Singh Sidhu after his resignation as Punjab Congress chief||The Aam Aadmi Party accused Navjot Singh Sidhu of being envious of Channi for being made chief minister, and the Bharatiya Janata Party said Sidhu was thinking only about his own interest—reactions that came within minutes of Sidhu announcing his resignation as Punjab Congress chief.The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday claimed that Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu quit from his post as he ‘could not bear” that a Dalit has been made the chief minister of the state.Sidhu on Tuesday resigned as the chief of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee ahead of the Assembly elections in the state early next year.In a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Sidhu, however, said he will continue to serve the party. He had taken over as the state party chief in July this year.“This shows that Navjot Singh Sidhu is against Dalits. One poor son was made the chief minister... this, Sidhu could not bear. It is very sad,” AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj told reporters.Aam Aadmi Party's Punjab in-charge Raghav Chadha called "complete and absolute anarchy"."Complete and absolute state of anarchy in Punjab Congress. How can the people of Punjab expect these selfish leaders to give a stable, progressive, and inclusive administration? How can these people be trusted with a state which has 550 km border with Pakistan," Chadha, AAP's Punjab in-charge, said in a tweet.The AAP is the main opposition in Punjab.Navjot Singh Sidhu resigns as Punjab Congress chiefThe Bharatiya Janata Party—the party that Sidhu had once belonged to until relations soured, making him switch to the Congress—meanwhile said Sidhu's resignation was in his own interest alone. "Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation from the post of Punjab Congress President is not in the interest of Punjab but in the interest of his future,"  Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma said in a tweet in Punjab.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi, Sidhu wrote:  “The collapse of a man’s character stems from the compromise corner, I can never compromise on Punjab’s future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab”.“Therefore, I hereby resign as the president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. Will continue to serve the Congress,” he further wrote.Incidentally, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the convener of AAP, is headed on a two-day tour to Punjab starting Wednesday. — Agencies ਨਵਜੋਤ ਸਿੰਘ ਸਿੱਧੂ ਵੱਲੋਂ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਕਾਂਗਰਸ ਦੀ ਪ੍ਰਧਾਨਗੀ ਤੋਂ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਗਿਆ ਅਸਤੀਫਾ ਪੰਜਾਬ ਦੇ ਹਿੱਤ ਲਈ ਨਹੀਂ ਬਲਕਿ ਆਪਣੇ ਭਵਿੱਖ ਦੇ ਹਿੱਤ ਲਈ ਲਿਆ ਗਿਆ ਫੈਸਲਾ ਹੈ।@News18Punjab @ZeePunjabHH pic.twitter.com/FNoh0Jv1af||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-bjp-train-guns-at-navjot-singh-sidhu-after-his-resignation-as-punjab-congress-chief-317416

Asserting that his government had taken the right decision regarding the appointment, he said, “Nothing should be looked into his being a lawyer with the previous DGP or a suspended IG. Now that he will be a part of the government, I am confident he will serve the state government dutifully in his new role. Now, he will offer his legal expertise in matters being contested by the state government. He has also been a lawyer for ex-Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh for nearly 20 years, including for cases lodged against him during the tenure of the Badals.”Vidhan Sabha Speaker Rana KP Singh, who accompanied the CM, said, “Every lawyer has a contract with his client. As a senior lawyer, earlier Deol’s clients could have been hundreds of people, including the ex-DGP and the ex-IG but now his services have been roped in by the government. I do not think any controversy should be made out of the issue.”Minutes after defending Deol on the matter, Channi also put a photograph with the new A-G on his Twitter account. “Congratulations to Mr Amar Preet Singh Deol for being appointed as the Advocate General of Punjab. I am sure your legal acumen and expertise will help Punjab in getting its due (sic),” he wrote. But the tweet invited him a lot of criticism over his decision with people questioning him as to how anyone could expect a logical conclusion to the 2015 sacrilege and police firing incident when the new A-G is the lawyer of the accused.Even BJP state general secretary Subhash Sharma had on Monday criticised the decision to appoint Deol as the A-G saying the Punjab CM had lost the first moral and ethical battle with this appointment.On the sidelines of the same event, Channi was also quizzed over the selection of Rana Gurjeet Singh and Gurkirat Kotli as the ministers despite their controversial past. He defended them too saying, “Kotli comes from the family of ex-CM Beant Singh who got assassinated during terrorism. There is nothing against both of them now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-channi-defends-a-gs-appointment-says-every-lawyer-takes-up-different-cases-professionally-317410

This is his first visit since he resigned as CM.Although right after arrival, Capt said he was in Delhi for a personal visit and to vacate Kapurthala House for the new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the political circles remained abuzz with what the days ahead might hold, with Punjab staring at a crisis following the resignation of state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and at least one minister loyal to him Razia Sultana.Navjot Singh Sidhu resigns as Punjab Congress chiefAsked if Capt would meet BJP top brass, including home minister Amit Shah, sources close to Capt said there was no confirmation of any meeting yet.“There are likely to be a host of engagements in Delhi,” a source sufficed to say.Singh after resigning as Punjab CM has said he would “sacrifice anything to keep PCC chief Navjot Sidhu from becoming CM terming Sidhu dangerous for the country and Punjab”.Punjab CM Channi defends A-G’s appointment, says every lawyer takes up different cases professionallyIt was coincidental that Sidhu resigned as PCC chief on the same day as Capt arrived in Delhi.Although it is being speculated that Capt may meet Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda, there’s no official word on any meeting with the suspense still lingering.Capt is also likely to meet some senior Congress leaders in Delhi, including G23 group members.The visit is being keenly watched in Punjab and nationally.BJP sources said there was no meeting planned with Shah as yet but did not completely rule out the possibility of an engagement between the two leaders.Too much being read into @capt_amarinder’s visit to Delhi. He’s on a personal visit, during which he’ll meet some friends and also vacate Kapurthala house for the new CM.

28-09-2021||Aparna Banerji||Bhagat Singh: A martyr who dreamt of egalitarian India||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, September 27Enclosed within the 1929 edition of the Kirti Magazine issue was one of Bhagat Singh’s iconic essay Achoot Da Sawaal or ‘Question of Untouchability’, penned by a 16-year-old him. “The upper castes should also realise that their own status in life cannot change for the better as long as they persist in considering these people as inferiors, calling them menials, and keeping them under their heels. It is argued, they are unclean. The harsh truth is that they are poor; remove their poverty and they shall be clean. Don't we find that the poor even among the upper castes are no less unclean?” — Bhagat Singh, Achoot Da Sawaal, Kirti magazine, 1929 It was a scathing critique on the age-old discrimination meted out to the oppressed and a vigorous exhortation to Dalits to arise! “So called untouchables, the real sustainers of life, awake and reflect over your past,” he mentioned.Bhagat Singh’s call for Dalit consciousness and simultaneous exhortation against fundamentalism rings true even in the present times. Achoot Da Sawaal also bears an important reference to the Ad Dharam Movement of Punjab, led by Doaba-based ideologue and Dalit pioneer Babu Mangu Ram Mugowalia, born in Hoshiarpur. With the help of Seth Kishan Das (a wealthy merchant of Boota Mandi) the headquarters of the Ad Dharm Mandal were established at Jalandhar.In ‘Achoot Da Sawal’ Bhagat Singh wrote... “When they (untouchables) discovered that the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were raking profits due to them (untouchables), they gave a thought to re-organising on their own. No one is certain whether they are doing so as a result of official prompting or at their own but once this line of thinking takes roots, this trend will be fully backed up by official quarters. “Ad Dharam Mandal” and the like are the end result of this trend...The answer is quite obvious; above all, it needs to be settled for good, that all humans are equal without distinctions of birth or vocation.”Scholars today say Bhagat Singh’s constant exhortations on Dalits along with the Ad Dharam Movement have had a major impact on the Dalit consciousness in the state, the references to these however, are only found in academic circles and scholarly works while no prominent reminders are found in the mainstream political discourse.ExpertspeakProf Raunki Ram, Political Science professor at Panjab University and an expert on Dalits, said, “As far as equality and the social justice are concerned, Bhagat Singh was very clear that caste and religion were two categories which were responsible for the rift in the society. Bhagat Singh had his own unique understanding of the Dalit cause. He was very supportive of the Ad Dharam movement and believed that such movements were necessary because they fight against the caste oppression. The Ad Dharam Movement stressed that empowerment of the oppressed castes was only possible if they got due share in the local structures of power. It asked for shares in the agricultural land, in education, in government structures at par with others. Ad Dharam Movement and Bhagat Singh’s thinking have both contributed hugely to the Dalit and progressive consciousness in Punjab.”He adds, “When the question of the real leader of the oppressed classes arose, Mangu Ram wrote many telegrams to London, proclaiming Dr BR Ambedkar as their leader. He said our leader was Ambedkar, not Gandhi.”Chiranji Lal Kangniwal, eminent historian and Independence movement scholar, said, “Babu Mangu Ram started the Ad Dharam Mandal in Punjab highlighting the demands of Dalits. The movement started two years before Bhagat Singh’s Achoot Da Sawal was penned. In 1927, Katherine Mayo has also just released her book ‘Mother India’ which was a strong critique on oppression against Dalits. All these factors shaped the times in which Bhagat Singh lived.”Noted Bhagat Singh scholar Professor Chaman Lal said, “Bhagat Singh’s Achoot Da Sawal has come again into focus in the past three decades. It has had a major impact in shaping Dalit consciousness. However, all radical thoughts are being diluted by the establishment. And in the present times, caste has become a major socio-political factor.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhagat-singh-a-martyr-who-dreamt-of-egalitarian-india-317310

28-09-2021||---||Bharat Band: Industrial activity comes to standstill in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar||Chandigarh, September 27Amid farmers’ protest across the state, industrial production and dispatches came to a standstill, affecting all major industrial clusters — Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar.Though it’s difficult to quantify the losses, industry veterans claim it may run into crores and it would also affect investor sentiments in near future.“Not only normal life, but the industrial production and dispatches also came to a standstill as transporters did not operate amid Bharat Bandh. This is peak time for industries. Many goods produced by Ludhiana industries have to be delivered in time considering the festival season,” said Badish Jindal, president, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Associations (FOPSIA).Contrary to other industrial cities, a majority of the industrial units in Mohali were operating, sources said.Farmers across the state blocked highways and railway tracks at many places to mark Bharat Bandh on the call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of farmers’ unions, to mark the first anniversary of the enactment of the three agricultural laws. At various places, transport services were also suspended. Besides, shops and commercial establishments remained shut at many places.“It’s a double whammy for industry. Initially, the industry had to shut operations for a few days in July amid power shortage. Now, again a day was lost. The worst-affected are the exporters as they have to deliver the export consignments in a time-bound manner. Amid bandh, they were not in a position to produce or dispatch the finished goods,” said an exporter from Amritsar.As many industries are striving hard to survive after recovering from the pandemic-induced crisis, the bandh has further aggravated the problem. “Normally, on an average, we have 24-25 working days in a month. Due to protest and bandh, almost 5 per cent of the industrial production was affected across the state. This may have serious implications on domestic as well as export market,” said another industrialist who did not wish to be named.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bharat-band-industrial-activity-comes-to-standstill-in-ludhiana-jalandhar-amritsar-316980

The convoy with over a dozen Army trucks and a Jeep was heading towards Rohtak.An officer leading the convoy spoke to the farmers at the protest site to persuade them to remove the barricades. Initially refusing to budge, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) activists later allowed them to pass through.A goods train was also stopped by protesters forcibly at the Dakoha railway crossing near the Jalandhar Cantt railway station.Though the locomotive operator of the train remained adamant on moving ahead, he had to move in the reverse direction after protesting farmers refused to leave the tracks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/doaba-army-convoy-stopped-in-jalandhar-briefly-papers-checked-316982

However, ambulances were allowed to run.At some places, particularly near the Civil Hospital at Babri, farmers could be seen facilitating the movement of patients and their kin towards the hospital.In Pathankot, which is known as a traders’ hub having a substantial chunk of BJP vote, it was widely expected that shops and commercial establishments would remain open or at least partially open, but all this speculation remained unfounded.In Batala, activists of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha blocked traffic at Gandhi Chowk and near VMS Educational Institute on the Batala-Amritsar road. SSP Ashwani Kapur said farmers held protests at 19 points in the city. The bandh proved to be a success in rural as well as urban areas in Amritsar as majority of markets remained closed and people in large numbers gathered on roads to block vehicular traffic to support the cause.Farm unions blocked roads of major towns of the district, including Attari, Ajnala, Rayya, Majitha, Kathunagal, Chogawan and Mehta. Members of the Kisan Sangharsh Committee laid siege to railway tracks at Devidaspura and Amritsar-Batala railway track. Students associations at Guru Nanak Dev University also boycotted classes and blocked entry to the campus.Railways officials said six trains were cancelled and three were rescheduled from the Amritsar railway station. Members of the Kisan Sangharsh Committee blocked the passport office after learning about it being functional. However, finding the applicants having come from far-off places, they lifted their protest at 2 pm. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/majha-pathankot-traders-down-shutters-316983

He said the earlier resolutions passed by the state Assembly in support of the farmers’ demand to repeal these “black” laws should be conceded by the Centre without any further delay.Expressing solidarity with the families of those who died during the ongoing agitation, the CM stressed the need to win their confidence as the Congress government had always stood in support of their demands.He asked all ministers to personally visit the houses of the deceased farmers to deliver the appointment letters for government jobs to their family members. He said nearly 155 such appointment letters were ready and should be delivered to people concerned within a week.He also directed the Chief Secretary to ensure verification of remaining such cases expeditiously so as to complete the process of giving government jobs to the eligible next of kin.Taking cognisance of the widespread resentment among farmers for being given inadequate compensation for the land acquired by various government agencies, Channi directed the Chief Secretary to explore ways and means to rationalise the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the farmers to their satisfaction.Prepare 100-day roadmap, babus toldNext meet on Oct 1Portfolios today?Prune security: CM to ministers||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/channi-cabinet-expresses-solidarity-with-farmers-316984

This is having a cascading effect and consequently the tremors are being felt at the district, block and village levels. I am working hard to bring things back on the track,” he said.Factionalism to blame for inertiaThe party’s present indolence is direct fallout of factionalism in the state unit. This has a cascading effect and tremors are being felt at the district, block and village levels. I am working hard to bring things back on track. —Sukhjinder Randhawa, Dy CMFollowing his elevation from an MLA to minister and now to the post of Deputy CM, his clout has increased manifold. The other seniormost party leaders of this area are Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Aruna Chaudhury. “They, too, are powerful in their own way but Randhawa’s recent climb on the political ladder means he clearly enjoys an edge,” said an MLA.Barely six months after winning the 2017 polls from Dera Baba Nanak by a thin margin, he consolidated his position by notching up an impressive 40,000 vote lead from his seat for Sunil Jakhar in the Gurdaspur parliamentary bypoll. In the 2019 general elections, he again managed a sizable lead of 20,000 votes for Jakhar even as BJP’s Sunny Deol ran riot in five of the seven seats.His exalted status as Deputy CM now means he will be the cynosure of all eyes when his party prepares itself for the 2022 polls.A senior SAD leader said his party had identified some seats in Punjab where they intended to put up “exceptionally strong” candidates. “Sukhjinder Randhawa’s home seat is definitely under our lens. Admittedly, he has become a thorn in our flesh,” he maintained.Randhawa retorted, “What the Akalis say is all fluff and no substance.” Sukhjinder’s father, Santokh Randhawa, too rode like a Colossus on the political firmament.

He has labelled the Gandhi siblings as “inexperienced”, who were being misguided by their advisers.The former CM, who has said he was keeping his political options open, will be in Delhi in the coming days and is expected to meet party president Sonia Gandhi, besides holding crucial meetings with other leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, relating to the central farm laws, it is learnt.An MLA from the Doaba region, considered to be a Captain loyalist, and another from Malwa said regrouping had begun but lack of clarity on the changing political equations at this juncture was delaying decision making.“We are discussing the issue. But we are lying low as of now. A clear picture will emerge by the end of next month,” said another MLA from Malwa.“After the resignation of Capt Amarinder Singh and Channi taking over, at least three power centres appear to have emerged in the party by default or have been purposely created by the party high command to keep checks and balances,” pointed out a senior party leader.A group of Doaba region MLAs, who met the PCC president yesterday, has sought removal of all tainted ministers inducted into the Channi Cabinet. Sources said SC MLAs were disturbed as no face from the community had been picked from the Doaba region.Sidhu’s associate Pargat Singh has made it to the Cabinet, but his other two choices — Amargarh MLA Surjit Dhiman and Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra — were left out.Already two former ministers — Balbir Singh Sidhu and Gurpreet Kangar — have expressed dissent over being left out. Faridkot MLA Khushaldeep Singh Dhillon has pointed out the regional imbalance in western Malwa had been disturbed in the Cabinet expansion. The western Malwa is the epicentre of sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents, he has pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/government-in-saddle-but-no-end-to-punjab-congress-rumblings-317049
28-09-2021||Anirudh Gupta||Southern Malwa Congress leaders peeved at being ‘overlooked’||Ferozepur, September 27The internal strife within the ruling Congress is seemingly far from over. While several MLAs are ecstatic over their induction into the Charanjit Singh Channi Cabinet, party leaders from this southern Malwa region, comprising border districts of Ferozepur, Fazilka, Faridkot and Moga, are feeling dismayed due to lack of representation from this area.Political analysts say this is perhaps the first time that there has been no representation from this politically sensitive area, which comprises the Ferozepur Lok Sabha segment currently being represented by Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal.Strong Akali, AAP presenceBoth Akalis and AAP have strong presence in this area, which has 69 Assembly seats. How does the high command expect us to fight without empowering us? —Kushaldeep Dhillon, Faridkot MLA“Whether it was the SAD-BJP government or the previous Congress regimes, there has always been a minister from this belt at least,” said Gurnaib Brar, a former MLA.During the SAD-BJP regime, the area was represented by a host of senior ministers, including Janmeja Singh Sekhon, Surjit Kumar Jyani, Tota Singh, among others. Even then Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal represented the Jalalabad Assembly segment, which falls in Fazilka district.Before Charanjit Singh Channi took over as the Chief Minister, Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who hailed from Guruharsahai, represented this area in the Capt Amarinder Singh Cabinet. While Sodhi was unlikely to be retained due to his proximity to the outgoing CM, residents were hoping for someone else from the region to get a ministerial berth to maintain the regional balance.The likely contenders included Parminder Singh Pinki (Ferozepur), Kulbir Singh (Zira) and Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon (Faridkot). Even former PCC chief Sunil Jakhar, who belongs to this area, was amongst the contenders for the CM’s post.Pinki said the Congress had swept the local body elections for the first time in the region despite Sukhbir camping there. Instead of giving incentive, the party chose to look the other way, he added.Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Dhillon lamented that the situation had created an “imbalance” in the region as both Deputy Chief Ministers besides several Cabinet ministers were from the Majha belt.“The fact is that both the Akalis and AAP have a strong presence in this Malwa area, which has a total of 69 Assembly seats. How does the party high command expect us to fight and beat the rivals without empowering us?” said Dhillon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/southern-malwa-congress-leaders-peeved-at-being-overlooked-317050

Following that, the party has conveyed to its leaders to hold small, indoor gatherings instead of public meetings.In the absence of public meetings, the party has asked local leaders to focus on building the organisational structure in all 117 constituencies.The constituency incharges have been asked to make booth-level committees. Each committee should have 10 members and there are roughly 200 booths in each constituency. For that purpose, the party has appointed vistharak (incharges) for all 117 constituencies and their brief is to hold one-to-one indoor meetings. The incharges have been asked to not hold any public or big meetings with more than 10 people.The party is working so minutely that the constituency incharges have been asked to prepare a list of workers who have vehicles, study voter lists at booth level; take selfies with panna parmukhs. Apart from that, the incharges have been asked to make booth-level units as per the social structure of the booth. The incharges have been asked to stay in touch with families affiliated with the RSS and make Whatsapp groups of those workers who use smart phones.Sources said data of booth-level workers is being compiled in Chandigarh and a call centre is being established.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hold-small-gatherings-in-punjab-bjps-brief-to-leaders-317052

So far, the High Court has not issued a notice of motion on the petition.In the petition against the state of Punjab and other respondents, petitioner Mahadev Enclave Pvt Ltd was seeking directions for quashing the decision dated September 20 taken by the government in its Cabinet meeting. Directions were also sought to place on record the decision before further quashing “subsequent consequential decision” by the state government for allowing unregulated and unhindered mining.Appearing before the Bench, senior advocate Gurminder Singh with counsel Ramanpreet Singh Bara had described the decision as an illegal act, a political gimmickry and an election stunt. The Bench was told the elections to legislative assembly in the state of Punjab were just about two to three months away and the dispensation within the ruling party had changed. Free sand to the general public was being offered with intent to gain political mileage, even though it was legally and practically unfeasible. It was likely to cause complete chaos in minor mineral extraction and would lead to an environmental disaster. “The ruling party, with the intent to fulfil the promise mentioned by it in the last election manifesto regarding free sand to general public, is doing this all,” it was added.The counsel argued the decision would be contrary to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, Punjab Minor Mineral Rules-2013 and Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines-2016 issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The case will now come up for further hearing on October 1 when an affidavit in the matter will be placed before the Bench.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-new-mining-policy-finalised-yet-punjab-govt-in-hc-on-cabinet-decision-317054

Apart from the contentious central agricultural laws, the failure of the Punjab Government in fulfilling its poll promises is also the reason of resentment among farmers,” said Ugrahan at Sunam.“His predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh wasted four and a half years by making big claims and did nothing. Now, the Congress has replaced Captain to fool residents with the face of Channi. But we know there is no difference between Capt Amarinder and Channi,” the BKU Ugrahan president said.

Earlier I was at New Delhi border, now I protesting in Sangrur regularly,” said Kulwinder Singh (35), raising slogan against the central government at Barnala chowk.Another farmer, Jasvir Singh (42), said the biting cold in last December created health complications for his father, but he refused to reutrn and died there.“Many said my father died of old-age health complications, but he preferred to die at the Delhi border rather than coming back. Our family has pledged to attend protests daily until the farm laws are repealed” he said.There are many families, which have several members attending protests on rotation at New Delhi and Sangrur. There are some families which are left with just one member after the death of their near and dear ones, but they are still in high spirit.“Whenever I visit the Delhi protest site, my 17-year-old son takes care of household chores with the help of our neighbours.

The decision is likely to snowball into a political controversy as Deol was the counsel for former top cop Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal, both accused in the Behbal Kalan police firing case.Also read: APS Deol's appointment as Punjab Advocate General unfortunate: BJP, AAPWhen the Punjab and Haryana High Court just over a fortnight back ruled — much to the embarrassment of the Punjab Government — that Saini’s involvement in multiple cases could be a “political ploy in the wake of the coming state Assembly elections,” there was no way anyone could have imagined that his counsel Deol would occupy the coveted post.The appointment comes as a surprise as incidents of sacrilege and subsequent police firing in Faridkot district’s Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015 have always been considered politically sensitive.His appointment also brings to the fore the issue of conflict of interest primarily on the ground that Deol, being Saini and Umranangal’s counsel, would neither be able to appear nor advise the state in their cases and related matter. Besides this, a counsel may be privy to information about a client. Under the circumstances, his role as the state’s highest law officer could be questioned.Deol’s appointment as Advocate-General by the Governor was notified this evening. He was enrolled as a lawyer in August 1984 and was designated senior advocate in April 2007. Known for his competence, consistency and perseverance, he has primarily been handling criminal and Constitutional matters. He has also appeared in several sensitive matters, including a complaint filed by Justice Ranjit Singh against former Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal and MLA Bikram Singh Majithia.The state government had earlier finalised three names in quick succession for the post. In an earlier last-minute turnaround, the government is believed to have cleared the name of senior advocate Anmol Rattan Singh Sidhu after initially promising the post to senior advocate DS Patwalia.Conflict of interest||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sumedh-sainis-counsel-aps-deol-appointed-punjab-advocate-general-317038

I can be who I am and honour both sides,” Toor said in an interview.When Toor was promoted as Captain this spring, he decided to appeal.Toor’s case is the latest in a long-running conflict between two fundamental values in the United States military: “the tradition of discipline and uniformity, and the constitutional liberties the armed forces were created to defend,” the NYT said.However, Toor, who grew up in Washington and Ohio and is the son of Indian immigrants, has been allowed to wear the Turban while on duty with limitations. He “can wear a turban in daily dress at normal duty stations, but not while deployed to a conflict zone, or when in dress uniform in a ceremonial unit, where the public could see it.”The NYT report said Toor has “appealed the restrictive decision to the Marine Corps commandant, and he says that if he does not get a full accommodation, he will sue the Corps.“We’ve come a long way, but there is still more to go,” he said in the NYT report. “The Marine Corps needs to show it really means what it has been saying about strength in diversity — that it doesn’t matter what you look like, it just matters that you can do your job.”    The Corps has maintained that “uniformity was as essential to a fighting force as well-oiled rifles”.“In order to build squads that will move forward in a combat environment where people are dying, a strong team bond is required,” Col. Kelly Frushour, a spokeswoman for Marine Headquarters, said in written responses to The Times on Toor’s case.     “Uniformity is one of the tools the Corps uses to forge that bond. What the Corps is protecting is its ability to win on the battlefield, so that the Constitution can remain the law of the land.”      Toor’s request to wear the turban went all the way to “top Marine Corps authorities”.Their initial response in June was largely a denial of his request, the report said.“In a stern response, one Marine Corps general warned that individual expression of that kind could fray the fabric of discipline and commitment that binds the Marines. It could erode the nation’s trust in the Corps. It could undermine combat effectiveness. It could cost lives,” the NYT report said.“The Corps cannot experiment with the components of mission accomplishment,” Lt. Gen. David A. Ottignon, the deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, said in the response. “Failure on the battlefield is not an acceptable risk.”                Toor said the limits meant that “I would have to either sacrifice my career or my ability to practice my religion.”                Toor appealed to the commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Corps agreed partially, allowing him to wear the turban with certain limitations, according to the report.The NYT report said that nearly 100 Sikhs currently serve in the Army and Air Force wearing full beards and turbans.Toor had joined the US Marines after college in 2017, “knowing he would at least initially have to forgo the physical symbols of his faith, but he was willing to make the sacrifice.“I felt there was a debt to be paid. My family came to this country seeking the American dream, and we got it,” he said in the report.Toor expressed worry that a tough position on beards and turbans in the Marine Corps will make Muslims, Sikhs and others less likely to serve in the force, the NYT said.“Sikh kids growing up might not be able to see themselves in uniform. Even if they want to serve, they might not think their country wants then,” he said in the NYT report.
