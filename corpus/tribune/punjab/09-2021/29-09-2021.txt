29-09-2021||---||No clean chit given to Gurmeet Ram Rahim in sacrilege cases: Punjab police||Chandigarh, September 29Official spokesperson of Punjab Police on Wednesday trashed and termed all the allegations about giving clean chit to Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim as bogus and baseless.The statement came amid the news reports referring to Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, who has been given additional charge of Director General of Police (DGP) Punjab that he gave clean chit to Gurmeet Ram Rahim while heading an SIT to investigate the Bargari sacrilege cases in 2015.Notably, ‘Angs’ of Sri Guru Granth Sahib were found scattered in Bargari village on October 12, 2015 and FIR was registered under Sections 295, 120-B of IPC at police station, Bajakhana.An SIT headed by Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, then Director Bureau of Investigation (BOI), was constituted to investigate the sacrilege case at Bargari.The spokesperson clarified that the SIT had functioned just for 20 days (from October 14 to November 2, 2015), after which the case was transferred to Central bureau of Investigation (CBI).“Entire investigation was conducted by the CBI not the SIT headed by Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota,” said the spokesperson, while adding no clean chit has been given to Gurmeet Ram Rahim or any other person.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-clean-chit-given-to-gurmeet-ram-rahim-in-sacrilege-cases-punjab-police-317917
29-09-2021||Chandigarh/Mohali September 29||Punjab Police detain SAD chief Sukhbir Badal in Mohali||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal as well as the top SAD leadership was detained in Mohali on Wednesday while marching to the chief minister’s residence in Chandigarh to protest against the extremely low awards being given to farmers to acquire their lands for various road projects under the Bharat Mala project.The march was stopped at YPS Chowk, Mohali.Earlier thousands of party workers congregated at Gurdwara Amb Sahib here from where they started the march to the chief minister’s residence on tractors as well as on foot.The protest march was stopped near the border with Chandigarh where SAD workers along with leaders of the Road Sangharsh Committee, which has been spearheading the agitation for fair compensation to farmers, held a dharna before courting arrest.The SAD president said the Congress government had stonewalled the demand for fair compensation of more than two lakh farmers whose land comprising 25,000 acres was being acquired across 19 districts in the State.He said farmers were being short changed by the Congress government which was giving them awards ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 70 lakh per acre for rural and urban land, respectively, when they should be getting awards of Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore per acre.Badal said besides acquisition of 25,000 acres, as much as 75,000 acres were rendered useless being small pockets which were left without access and irrigation facilities. He also disclosed that more than 3,000 houses would be demolished and villages would lose 100 village ponds.He claimed one crore trees would be felled under the project and hundreds of factories, shellers, poultry farms, brick kilns and dairy farms would be uprooted. Sukhbir said farmers would also lose water sources and tubewells, stating the erstwhile SAD led government had not only given fair compensation of crores per acre to farmers but also given them a free tubwell as well as facility to get further registry of land done free of cost. He assured farmers a fair compensation once the SAD forms a government in the state.Speaking about the current political situation in Punjab, Badal said “no one seems to be interested in the people or their problems. What we are witnessing in the Congress party is a fight for the top post. One person wanted to be chief minister but another got the post. One leader wanted the chief minister to be his puppet but when the latter did not oblige he submitted his resignation. Punjab cannot be run like this. This is a border state. We need a leader who can act like a unifying factor. A person who can ensure peace and communal harmony. Sadly what we are seeing right now is open loot”.Badal also spoke about the contradictions in the Charanjit Singh Channi government. He said the new chief minister had announced that anyone linked with mafias should not come to him but had chosen tainted persons including a legislator who was accused of rape as well as another who had been named in a murder case by a Faridkot based family.Sangharsh Committee members Harmanpreet Singh and Gurdial Singh also spoke on the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-detain-sad-chief-sukhbir-badal-in-mohali-317884

Piyush Kapoor, general manager of a hotel-cum-restaurant, the oldest in the city, says the weekend tourists used to sustain the hospitality industry. Room occupancy shoots up to 80 per cent during the weekend, which remains between 35 to 40 percent during the normal days. “It infused a fresh lease of life into the hospitality industry, which was struggling to revive after the Covid-induced losses.”Narinder Singh, a hotelier from the walled city, said, “Frequent agitations, road and rail blockades do not allow the long distance tourists to come here.” He hoped that they would come from the Western and Eastern parts of the country in the forthcoming season.Travel sector experts claim that since the suspension of all scheduled international commercial passenger flights till September 30, domestic tourists are the only contributors in helping it bounce back to normal.According to Paramveer Singh, general manager of Taj Swarna, “With the domestic travel resuming in the country and tourist destinations receiving a large numbers of visitors, the tourism industry is now hopeful of recovery.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tourists-back-in-amritsar-as-wagah-retreat-ceremony-resumes-317757

The memorial was also a symbol of unity.Manga Azad, general secretary of the sabha, said the Modi government and the Punjab Government had deliberately distorted the historic character of the monument and the ticket counters were opened in it to mint money.He said another door was opened in the bagh, which had deeply hit the historic character. He said the names of Muslim martyrs and their pictures were removed from the gallery and the martyrs’ well was beautified.He said the Shaheedi Smarak was shifted to another place and the embossed figures were prepared on the entry street which was the only entry and exit point of the bagh.

Getting inspiration from stalls at kisan melas, Manjit is now a successful entrepreneur and owns a nursery.“I always had attraction for fairs since my childhood days. My family’s main occupation was agriculture and I still remember it was in 1998 when I first visited a kisan mela. Our elders used to grow traditional crops to which he was averse. Stalls and exhibitions at farmer fairs kept inspiring him to do something new. By seeing others displaying their works on fair stalls, I set my goal to be one of the leading agri entrepreneurs in coming years,” Manjit said.After thorough discussions with scientists and other farmers during farmer fairs, he decided to set up a nursery venture in 2012-13. Initially, he started growing bell pepper nursery on 0.5 marla in 2012-13. His only intention at that time was to learn. Later, he expanded his area under the nursery to 1,000 sq m and with the help of PAU scientists, he fulfilled his dream of setting up his stall in the farmer fair in 2018.He earned a handsome profit of Rs 1 lakh from an area of 1,000 sq m only from his nursery venture in his first attempt. He started using his savings for further development of his farm. The KVK, Mansa, provided him with a vermi-compost unit to promote organic farming and reduce the cost of cultivation.“I also installed walking tunnel at my farm where I grow nursery of tomatoes, peppers and pumpkins in pro-tray nursery and mastered the art. My income increased by Rs 80,000 with the adoption of this technology. In addition to increasing the area under the vegetable nursery, now, I am also growing the nursery of paddy and kharif onion, besides expanding the area under Rabi onion as seed crop,” Manjit said.Inspired by his success in nursery raising, four young farmers from his village have taken up vegetable and nursery cultivation, contributing to diversification.“Farmers’ fairs have brought laurels to me. I wish that the Covid-19 situation improves soon so that farmers may take the advantage of farmer fairs like in the past. Farmer fairs are not only educative but also entertaining and we tend to enjoy delicacies from across states,” he said.Inspires young farmers from his villageInspired by the success of farmer Manjit Singh in nursery raising, four young farmers from his village have taken up vegetable and nursery cultivation, contributing to diversification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kisan-melas-turn-farmer-into-entrepreneur-317561

This is an emotional reaction by Mr Sidhu,” AICC general secretary organization KC Venugopal sufficed to say today with the party dismissing the Punjab question in the official press conference where Kanhaiya Kumar joined the AICC, indicating attempts to placate Sidhu may be on.Meanwhile Congress President Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have initiated consultations with select senior leaders on the way forward.The Tribune has learnt that views of veterans are being sought on how best to address the “royal mess,” with a section of insiders terming the developments a "blessing in disguise."A leader who was contacted said a replacement of the PCC chief could well be on the table though a last minute reconciliation, which appears difficult, may also happen.“With his public resignation, the messy fallout and subsequent resignations of supporters, Mr Sidhu appears to have made reconciliation quite difficult if not impossible. The party wants a solution but this is a typical catch 22 situation. My sense is that the search for the replacement of the PCC chief may well be on while other solutions are mulled. Views are being sought on the way forward,” said a Congress leader.The developments have particularly hit the credibility of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra who had thrown their weight behind Sidhu backing him enough for Amarinder Singh to resign as CM.Top sources said placating Sidhu, although desirable, is a tall order as it would entail replacing sitting ministers and officers chosen with the approval of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the Congress is hailing as the state's first Scheduled Caste CM.“Where would the replacements of minissters and officers chosen by the CM leave Rahul Gandhi’s conviction to back an SC chief minister? If replacements are done, which would have to be done to pacify Sidhu, what message would it send for SC empowerment? The choices for the Congress are extremely tough now. Sonia Gandhi would be the most hurt today having gone along with her children on the issue,” said an AICC functionary as the party that set out to retain Amarinder Singh and Sidhu ahead of polls runs the risk of losing both.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-fallout-sonia-consults-party-veterans-on-the-way-forward-317591

Among other things, the Bench took into consideration the fact that the SC in August upheld a coordinate Bench judgment, granting bail to an accused in a case allegedly involving recovery of 3.8-kg ‘charas’. The accused in the case had been in custody for over one year.The orders by Justice Vikas Bahl came on a bunch of two petitions filed against the state of Punjab by Bikram Singh and Aman Sharma. Justice Bahl said the petitioners had been in custody for more than a year. The challan had been presented and only one out of 25 witnesses had been examined. The trial was likely to take time, more so in view of the pandemic. All witnesses were stated to be official witnesses. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-grants-bail-to-2-in-drugs-case-317516

Harish Joshi, father of missing pilot Capt Jayant Joshi, has subsequently reached out to President Ram Nath Kovind to enhance efforts and procure high-end equipment to search his son.Rudra WSI (Weapon System Integrated) Helicopter crashed into Ranjit Sagar lake on August 3. With Lt Col AS Bath and Capt Joshi, the chopper had left from Mamun Cantt for low-level sorties around the region, before it crashed into the reservoir after a technical snag. While Bath’s body was recovered after 12 days of the crash, the co-pilot is still missing.Seeking personal intervention of the President, Harish Joshi said: “We appreciate the efforts of the Army and Navy personnel, but there is still no news about our son. We continue to hope and trust the defence forces’ capability and efforts to maintain the rigour of search so that we get our son back.”His wife Col Jiwan Tara has been serving the Army for almost 40 years in the Military Nursing Service.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/army-chopper-crash-missing-pilots-father-urges-prez-to-intensify-search-317518

They intend to return the award and seek permission of willful death from the President.As they tried to gain access to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, they were stopped at the Vijay Chowk and the President’s security personnel allowed them to submit their memorandum undersigned by Balwinder’s wife Jagdish Kaur Sandhu, also Shaurya Chakra awardee.Bhikhiwind (Tarn Taran)-based Balwinder, who had taken on militants at the height of insurgency in the 1990s, was shot dead at his house, six months after his security was withdrawn, on October 16, 2020.Jagdish condemned the Centre and the state government for not providing adequate security cover to the family. “Ours is the only family in the country whose four members were conferred with Shaurya Chakra by then President Shankar Dyal Sharma for showing unique courage and valour against militants. We were provided security by the government, which was withdrawn afterwards,” she said.While the family demanded paramilitary cover, they had been provided with a handful of security men.

The funds to buy the balers were provided by the Centre under the aspirational district programme.District magistrate Sandeep Hans said the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare was providing all assistance to the farmers for proper management of paddy straw. He said in the aspirational district programme rankings released by the NITI Aayog, Moga figured among the top five ambitious districts of the country under which an amount of Rs 3 crore was released for purchasing balers.The balers were given to the cooperative societies of 20 villages, including Ajitwal, Daala, Ghal Kalan, Khosa Pando, Manuke, Chand Nawan, Ghazeana, Badhni Kalan, Kishanpura Kalan and Kot Muhammad Khan. “After harvesting paddy in these villages, straw bales would be made and sent to the biomass plant for its efficient use,” Hans said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/moga-farmers-get-20-balers-to-check-stubble-burning-317486

Taking inspiration from Shaheed Bhagat Singh, we have vowed that our indefinite protest against the Central laws will continue till these laws are repealed and we will also oppose other anti-poor policies of the government,” said Ugrahan.BKU Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said though the British rule ended long ago, big corporate houses were now acting on the same lines and robbing the nation.During the conference, the message of Bhagat Singh was communicated to all through a play penned by Amolak Singh and presented by the People’s Art Theatre. — TNSMansa farmer dies by suicideMansa: Irked over crop loss, a farmer — Rajinder Singh (27) — of the district’s Khiala Kalan village on Tuesday allegedly died by suicide after consuming some poisonous substance.

29-09-2021||Sameer Singh||Cotton growers object to free pesticides in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, September 28Farmers in the Malwa region have vehemently opposed the Agriculture Department’s decision to provide pesticides and insecticides to cotton farmers for free.Farm union leaders said it’s already quite late and providing pesticides to cotton growers grappling with pink bollworm attack would barely serve any purpose now as the crop had already reached the ripening stage.More than 75% crop already ripeHad the Agri Dept anticipated the pest attack at an early stage, damage to the cotton crop could have been mitigated to a large extent. But it’s too late now as over 75% of the crop is already ripe. Kuldeep Singh, BKU leader Notably, the Chief Agriculture Officers of Mansa and Bathinda have announced that pesticides for approximately 5,000 hectares of cotton-cultivated area would be distributed free of cost in the two districts.Talking to The Tribune, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leader from Mansa Kuldeep Singh said: “The damage has already been done. The move is just a face-saving exercise of the government and the epartment. There was pink bollworm attack last year as well but no lessons were learnt.”Farm leaders have also termed the visits of leaders from different political parties, including that of CM Charanjit Channi and SAD chief Sukhbir Badal as a “gimmick to gain political mileage” ahead of the Assembly poll scheduled early next year.Also, as many as 46 teams in Bathinda and 16 in Mansa are working to contain the pest attack and spread awareness on preventive measures.Balkaran Brar, state president of Kul Hind Kisan Sabha, said, “Farmers have already spent thousands on pesticides and now they don’t need it for free from the government, especially at a time when the majority of the crop has already ripened. Now all the government can do is provide adequate compensation — a minimum of Rs 50,000 per acre for complete crop loss. Despite repeated pest attacks over the years, successive governments have failed to provide any permanent solution.”Punjab Kisan Union leader Balkaran Singh said, “Such circumstances are a result of sheer official and governmental apathy due to which farmers are forced to end life.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cotton-growers-object-to-free-pesticides-in-punjab-317489
29-09-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Harvesting begins, 2 Punjab districts Amritsar, Tarn Taran see 96 farm fires already||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 28As the paddy harvesting season begins, there seems to be little hope of relief from farm fires. The political instability in the state and the upcoming Assembly elections, where farmers as a vote bank are crucial, will once again lead to high incidence of farm fires.This is evident from the fact that even as paddy had been harvested selectively in just two districts of Amritsar and Tarn Taran, 96 cases of farm fire have been reported till yesterday. As the paddy harvesting begins in full swing within the next 10 days, these incidents are only going to increase further.Last year, the number of stubble-burning cases had risen by over 44 per cent (from 52,991 in 2019 to 76,590 in 2020). This was mainly because of the anger among farmers over the three farm laws and the government shutting its eyes to the farm fires for fear of aggravating and alienating the farmers from the ruling Congress.The issue of how the drive to check the farm fires “had proved to be an exercise in futility” had also come up for discussion at the Cabinet meeting last month, with at least two ministers — Brahm Mohindra and Manpreet Singh Badal — demanding to know how the money meant for in situ management was used.Officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board disagree and say that they have already challaned some miscreants and given them recovery notices for Rs 37,000, besides appointing 8,000 nodal officers to check stubble-burning. But, with the change in political guard and the farmers’ agitation continuing, it is unlikely that there would be any action on stopping farmers to burn the residual straw.What further threatens to aggravate the crisis is the inability of the balers in Punjab to get a higher price from the units that use paddy straw as raw material. Balwinder Pardhan from the Balers Association said they would not be able to operate the balers at the rates offered to them.“If the issue is not resolved, there will be a rise in pollution because of farm fires, as balers are not given proper rate for selling stubble. In 2012, bale was compensated at Rs 145 per quintal, when the rate of diesel was Rs 45, while in 2021 the rate of diesel is Rs 90 but they are compensated at Rs 125 per quintal by the biomass plants,” he said.Experts say paddy is cultivated in 30 lakh hectares in Punjab and every year 20-22 million tonnes of straw is produced. Of this, balers process around 8.8 lakh metric tonne of stubble annually and sell it to the biomass plants, which produce 97.5 MW electricity annually. “If balers are not given apt rate, they will be forced not to procure and process stubble to bales from farmers, which would force the farmer to burn stubble,” he said.Book machinery on ‘i-Khet’ app||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/harvesting-begins-2-punjab-districts-amritsar-tarn-taran-see-96-farm-fires-already-317484
29-09-2021||Balwant Garg||Liquidate wheat stock: FCI to Moga, Faridkot administrations||Tribune News ServiceFarikdot, September 28As its filled granaries are set to pose storage problem in the forthcoming rabi season, authorities of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) have approached the district administrations in Faridkot and Moga to take prompt action to liquidate the stock.The FCI has about 1.73 lakh metric tonne (LMT) wheat stock at two silos, the giant steel structures used to store grains for a longer duration, at Kotkapura town in Faridkot and Dagru village in Moga. This stock of 2017-18 seasons was procured by the FCI and stored at the silos owned by Adani Agri Logistics Limited.Since the day of passing of the farm laws, farmers are camping at the gates of these silos, allowing no movement of the food stock.In a meeting with the district authorities, the FCI officials conveyed that if the government doesn’t take prompt action to liquidate the stock, there could be severe storage crunch during the coming rabi season, when the new wheat needs sufficient space for storage in the area, said a senior functionary in the FCI.In a meeting with the FCI, the district administration also expressed its helplessness in the movement of the wheat stock from the silos.“We have conveyed our helplessness to the FCI. There would be no shifting of the stock from the silos until the farmers’ union agrees to it,” said a senior officer in the district administration.BKU (Rajewal) district chief Binder Singh Golewala said: “We don’t oppose the movement or liquidation of the stock. But as Adani is the main architect of the draconian farm laws, we won’t allow any movement from these silos till these are withdrawn.”The FCI authorities said due to a significant gap between the quantum of procurement of grains and slow movement of the stock to other states, it has resulted in us holding on to more grain stocks than needed. This has resulted in rising food subsidy expenses, as buffer carrying costs have been rising steadily.While Adani’s silo of 3 LMT capacity in Moga is working since 2007, the silo at Kotkapura with built in capacity of 30,000 MT started working three years back. Adani has a BOO (Build, Own, Operate) agreement with the FCI for providing storage space.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/liquidate-wheat-stock-fci-to-moga-faridkot-administrations-317485

He, however, chose to bring the amended Bills instead of rejecting the “draconian” farm legislations.Urging the Centre to give due recognition to the border state for its unprecedented sacrifices to uphold nation’s integrity and sovereignty, Channi said the Centre should not try to foment trouble in the state. Instead, it should sincerely resolve the ongoing crisis at the earliest in the larger interest of the country.Reiterating his commitment to stand by farmers and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha in this “hour of crisis”, the CM said he would even lead a march to Delhi either by foot or on a bicycle to support their cause if the Centre didn’t repeal the laws.Expressing solidarity with farmers, he said the laws would perish the state’s peasantry as beleaguered farmers were already reeling under debt to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore. The Centre should come forward to bail them out of this financial crisis.He, however, said the state had already provided relief up to Rs 2 lakh to small and marginal farmers, while farm labourers were being extended relief to the tune of Rs 25,000 with little resources it had.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-call-special-session-if-farm-laws-not-repealed-punjab-cm-317488

The emergence of different power centres at different times in the past four and a half years had forced officials to change loyalties with the changing times.Now, with Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa back at the helm, a certain permanence has emerged with senior officers claiming that they need “political stability” if they have to move ahead with developmental works.Tript Bajwa remained a key player in the Capt Amarinder Singh dispensation. He carried out unprecedented developmental works. His hand was visible in almost all postings and transfers. However, when he rebelled about four months ago, Captain Amarinder pulled the rug from under his feet by replacing him as the main power centre with three-time ex-MLA Ashwani Sekhri.Sekhri was given unbridled powers and officers remained at his beck and call. For good measure, he was also appointed the chairman of an important government entity. With the ex-CM at his back, he even started inaugurating government schemes, including an e-clinic at the Civil Hospital. He was the most-visible Hindu face of the Congress.In the meantime, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa announced that he would contest the polls from Batala. Accompanied by senior officers, he even embarked on a three-day tour of the constituency just to make a political statement. “When Captain Amarinder saw Sekhri getting all powerful, he set up Partap as a rival power centre. Officials were forced to follow two commanders. Partap even had the impudence to sack Tript loyalists as the chiefs of the Improvement Trust and Market Committee. He became the latest player in this game of musical chairs,” said an MLA.Loyal officers of Tript Bajwa, including an SSP and DSP, too were shifted. Politically redeemed, Tript Bajwa now has rivals on the mat. The real consolation is that bureaucrats, knowing they have just a single chain of command to follow, have finally heaved a sigh of relief.“Political equilibrium has finally been restored,” said an MLA. Tript Bajwa has brought back his men as the chiefs of the Improvement Trust and Market Committee even as several other transfers and postings are in the pipeline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/political-stability-in-batala-with-tript-rajinder-singh-bajwa-back-in-reckoning-317476

29-09-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||This is not cricket, says ex-Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Navjot Sidhu||Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said Tuesday’s political developments saw the faith that the Congress leadership had reposed in the new Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Singh Sidhu being “compromised”.Jakhar, who had remained largely silent on Tuesday as the drama unfolded in the Punjab unit of the Congress, said Sidhu’s resignation from his position was a breach of trust.“It’s just not cricket! What stands compromised in this entire ‘episode’ is the faith reposed in the (outgoing?) PCC President by the Congress Leadership. No amount of grand standing can justify this breach of trust placing his benefactors in a peculiar predicament,” Jakhar, who was the PPCC chief until Sidhu took over in July, said in a tweet.Sidhu wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday saying he was resigning as Punjab Congress chief—a position he had won after much wrangling and power tussle within the Punjab unit in July.Sidhu’s resignation letter said he could not compromise on the future of Punjab, although it did not explain what that meant. Sources in the Congress however have claimed that Sidhu was unhappy with some recent appointments in the state—including some ministers who were inducted into the newly reorganized Punjab Cabinet and the most recent appointment of APS Deol as Punjab’s advocate general.    It’s just not cricket ! What stands compromised in this entire ‘episode’ is the faith reposed in the (outgoing ?) PCC President by the Congress Leadership.

29-09-2021||Patiala||Sulking Sidhu meets aides; action shifts to Yadavindra Enclave—his Patiala home||Congress leaders close to Navjot Singh Sidhu are asking him to change his mind, a source said on Tuesday—hours after Sidhu stepped down as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief.Several senior Congress leaders, including Kuljit Nagra; Inderjit Bularia; Razia Sultana; and Kulwinder Danny, were huddled together with Sidhu at the latter’s ancestral home in Patiala, Yadavindra Enclave. Pargat Singh, an MLA from Jalandhar Cantt who was recently sworn in as a minister for the first time, is also believed to have joined the meeting.Some leaders have said that his decision could backfire.“We have asked him to rethink on his decision to quit at this juncture, if not for himself then for the Congress leaders who stood by him,” an MLA said.Some 100 senior workers of the Congress party are expected to reach his Patiala residence and submit their own resignations in support of their leader, sources said.“We back the decision of Sidhu, who has done the right thing by resigning,” they said.A source claimed Sidhu has refused to rethink “with present political changes in the government”. “I have promised the people of Punjab that I will keep their interests above everything and I will not compromise on it," Sidhu is learnt to have told his party leaders in the meeting, adding he could not be a mere “puppet in the hands of the party high command”.Close aides say he had told no one of his decision to resign.Sources say that a section of Congress MLAs have requested Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi to “strictly ask party leaders not to promote groupies”. An MLA warned of possible splinters in the party. The party could be splintered, especially since many leaders have begun to feel “politically directionless”.Some members of the PPCC who have given their resignation "verbally" are also at the meeting, sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sulking-sidhu-meets-aides-action-shifts-to-yadavindra-enclave%E2%80%94his-patiala-home-317454
29-09-2021||New Delhi||Navjot Singh Sidhu preparing ground to leave, Sonia should accept resignation: Capt Amarinder Singh||Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation as Punjab Congress chief within two months of assuming charge was “sheer drama” and a signal that he was gearing to leave the party for someplace else.“The resignation has proved beyond doubt that the cricketer-turned-politician is an unstable man who cannot be relied upon to lead the ruling party especially in a border state like Punjab. His resignation is sheer drama. The move suggests that Sidhu is preparing the ground to quit the Congress and join hands with someone other party in the run-up to the state assembly polls,” said Capt after arriving in New Delhi on a “personal visit” this evening.The former Punjab CM, who resigned recently vowing to never let Sidhu become CM, mentioned that he had been saying all along that Navjot Sidhu was “unstable and dangerous”.“He cannot be entrusted with the task of running Punjab,” Captain said adding that Sidhu had also proved to be absolutely incompetent during his stint as a minister in his government.Speaking to reporters at New Delhi airport, Amarinder Singh said Punjab was a sensitive state sharing over 600 km of border with a hostile Pakistan and Sidhu’s close links with his cricketer friend Imran Khan and ISI chief Qamar Javed Bajwa were a serious threat to India’s national security.“By resigning within two months of taking over as the state chief, Navjot had once again exhibited his shifty character. I’ve known this boy since his childhood and he has been a loner and can never be a team player,” said Amarinder,  recalling how the cricketer had deserted the Indian team in 1996 in England.“That’s his real character”, Amarinder added, in subtle warnings to the Congress high command which has been backing Sidhu against the former chief minister.Describing Sidhu as “a flamboyant speaker”, Amarinder Singh said what he speaks in public meetings or rallies may make people laugh but “it’s all froth, with no substance”.People don’t vote for buffoonery, said Capt adding that no one takes Sidhu seriously.Replying to a question that Sidhu was upset over the inclusion of some ministers in the Charanjit Singh Channi’s cabinet, Singh said “PPCC chief apparently wanted to run the government by remote control.”“What nonsense is this? Cabinet formation is the prerogative of the chief minister. Why should Sidhu interfere?” asked Capt.Reacting to Sidhu’s remarks that he had quit on principle, Amarinder said, “What principles is he talking about. He’s only making grounds to quit the Congress. You wait and see, he will join hands with some other party very soon”. Replying to a question, the former minister said that Congress high command should immediately accept Sidhu’s resignation and appoint some competent man in his place. When asked if he would back former PPCC chief, Sunil Jakhar, for the job, Amarinder said, “he (Jakhar) is very competent and had performed exceeding well as the party chief”.Scotching speculation that he was in Delhi to meet senior BJP leaders, the former Chief Minister said he had come on a personal visit, with the main intent of vacating the Kapurthala House for the new chief minister of Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-preparing-ground-to-leave-sonia-should-accept-resignation-capt-amarinder-singh-317442
29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Razia Sultana resigns from Punjab Cabinet 'in solidarity with Navjot Singh Sidhu'||Punjab Minister Razia Sultana resigned from the Cabinet on Tuesday, just hours after Navjot Singh Sidhu stepped down as Punjab Congress chief.Razia Sultana said in her resignation letter that she was quitting “in solidarity with Navjot Singh Sidhu”. Her resignation came hours after she was given water supply and sanitation, social security, women and child development, printing, and stationery departments in the new Punjab Cabinet under Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.Incidentally, Sultana’s husband Mohammed Mustafa became Sidhu's chief strategic adviser when the latter took over as Punjab Congress chief in July.Sidhu’s resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi said he could not “compromise” on the future of Punjab, although his letter did not explain this any further.Sources however said Sidhu, who took over the reins of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee in July after a prolonged power struggle with then chief minister Amarinder Singh, his political rival, was displeased with some recent political developments—including the induction of certain Members of Legislative Assembly in the newly reformed Punjab cabinet and the most recent appointment of APS Deol to the position of the state’s advocate general.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/razia-sultana-resigns-from-punjab-cabinet-in-solidarity-with-navjot-singh-sidhu-317434
29-09-2021||Rajmeet Singh||Inside track: What led to Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignation||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 28Navjot Singh Sidhu sent the Congress party into a tizzy with the announcement of his resignation on Twitter. So, was it a sudden decision or the tension between Sidhu and the party high command was simmering?Reliable party sources attribute the Sidhu resignation to five main reasons.One, the main trigger point apparently, was the induction of tainted MLA Rana Gurjit Singh and some other ministers (who face allegation of corruption). Sidhu had tried to resist the move but was overruled.Read also:Secondly, as against the recommendations of the names made to the party high command for inclusion in Cabinet, only one aide, Pargat Singh was inducted. Congress high command had started ignoring him in discussions on the Cabinet expansion.Thirdly, the appointment of Advocate General, APS Deol who had legally defended former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in Behbal Kalan police firing case. The high command had also ignored his take on top government appointments.Fourth, the allocation of Home department portfolio to Sukhjinder Randhawa. Sidhu had played a role in elevation of Channi as CM to stop Randhawa from becoming the CM. But with allocation of an important portfolio to Randhawa, Sidhu felt slighted.Fifth, Sidhu's interference in functioning of the Channi government was not allowed and he was asked to focus on party affairs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/inside-track-what-led-to-navjot-singh-sidhus-resignation-317422
29-09-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu resigns as Punjab Congress chief||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu announced his resignation from his position on Tuesday. He put up his resignation letter addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Twitter.Reacting to Sidhu's resignation as PPCC chief, AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal said, “All will be ok in Punjab Congress. Sidhu's reaction is emotional.' Punjab CM Channi defends A-G’s appointment, says every lawyer takes up different cases professionally"The collapse of a man's character stems from the compromise corner. | can never compromise on Punjab's future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab," Sidhu's letter to Sonia Gandhi said.Punjab portfolios announced; Randhawa gets home, Soni health, Mohindra local govt, Badal finance"Therefore, I hereby resign as the President of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. Will continue to serve the Congress," he said. Soon after this, Gulzar Inder Singh Chahal, who was made Treasurer of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee soon after Sidhu took over, also put in his papers, as did general secretary Yoginder Dhingra.The second significant resignation however came from Punjab Minister Razia Sultana. Sultana, whose husband is Sidhu's chief strategic adviser, said she was resigning from the cabinet only hours after she was given water supply and sanitation, social security, women and child development, printing, and stationery departments. Sidhu's resignation comes amid the furore over Deol's appointment. Deol, who has, among his various high-profile cases, represented Punjab's tainted ex-DGP, Sumedh Singh Saini, was appointed through an official notification on Monday. Chief Minister Charanjit Channi has tried to downplay the controversy saying the case was just another one taken up in the course of Deol's professional duties.  He's believed to be upset over the recent developments in the state—from the non-inclusion of some Members of Legislative Assembly in the recently-expanded cabinet of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and the appointment of Punjab's new Advocate General, Amar Preet Singh Deol.'I told you so'Former chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh,  Sidhu's arch-rival, was among the first to react, with a cheeky: "I told you so"."I told you so…he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab," his tweet said.Capt Amarinder expected to arrive in Delhi today, all eyes on who he meetsCapt Amarinder Singh has had a long-running power tussle with Sidhu, who's generally been seen as vying for the position the former once held.  After he'd resigned, Amarinder had vowed to ensure Sidhu wouldn't become chief minister, calling him a friend of Pakistan and a security threat to the entire country.   Sidhu meanwhile has refused to talk to anyone, sources say, and is currently holed up at his Patiala residence with only close aides. Navjot Singh Sidhu couldn’t stand a Dalit was made Punjab CM: AAPI told you so…he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of punjab.  'Unaware'Chief Minister Channi told the press that he was unaware of the development.Channi, whose press conference was held a short while after Sidhu’s announcement, said he would have to speak to Sidhu, whom he still “considered” Punjab Congress chief, before he commented on the development.Inside track: What lead to Navjot Singh Sidhu's resignationHe said the party would talk to Sidhu. “He is the party president. If he's upset, it will be settled," Channi said. APS Deol's appointment as Punjab Advocate General unfortunate: BJP, AAP'Reconsider'Bholnath Member of Legislative Assembly Sukhpal Khaira urged Sidhu to reconsider his decision. Khaira,  a Congressman who'd quit the party in a huff in 2015 to join the Aam Aadmi Party only to return to the Congress fold in June, also asked the party high-command to find solutions to the issues Sidhu raised.The development has put the Congress in a spot. Sidhu had replaced Sunil Jakhar as Congress in June after much power tussle between him and former chief minister Amarinder Singh. Congress leadership was preparing to project Sidhu as the chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 assembly elections before Charanjit Singh Channi was named chief minister after Amarinder Singh resigned in “humiliation” earlier this month.'Will sit and talk to Sidhu, he is party president': Punjab CM ChanniSidhu’s resignation comes hours after new ministers in Channi’s cabinet were given portfolios. It also came less than a week after  Capt Amarinder Singh resigned from the chief minister's position, spurring a change at the helm of the Congress government in Punjab. Channi, who was chosen as Amarinder Singh's successor, would head the state government for a few months until the Punjab Assembly elections early next year. It remains to be seen what effect the political turmoil within the Punjab Congress would have on the elections. pic.twitter.com/L5wdRql5t3  Complete and absolute state of anarchy in Punjab Congress.
