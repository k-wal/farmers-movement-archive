17-09-2021||New Delhi||R-day violence: Court grants anticipatory bail to gangster-activist Lakha Sidhana||A Delhi court on Friday granted anticipatory bail to gangster-turned-social activist Lakha Sidhana in a case related to allegedly attempting to kill police personnel and instigating the mob to break barricades during the farmers’ protest rally on Republic Day this year.Additional Sessions Judge Jagdish Kumar granted relief to Sidhana after noting that he has already joined the investigation and has been granted bail in a conspiracy case related to violence that ensued at the Red Fort here on January 26.Sidhana sought anticipatory bail in the case related to the clashes which took place between the farmers and police at Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar.The judge did not accept the submission of prosecution to deny him relief that even though he has joined the probe, one of the mobile phones handed over by him to the police is protected with a password and could not be opened as he refused to provide it. During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Madhukar Pandey submitted that Sidhana told the police that he has “forgotten” the password and is not co-operating in the investigation. “If, that is the situation how court can presume that he has forgotten the password or deliberately not disclosing the code for unlocking the mobile phone,” the judge said.The court further noted that Sidhana has admitted that he was part of the mob.The accused has been released on anticipatory bail on the condition that he has to join the probe as and when required and not influence the witnesses in any manner.The SPP opposed the bail plea and apprised the court that Sidhana was part of the unlawful assembly, attempted to “kill some police officials” and instigated the mob to break the barricades.The prosecutor added that the gangster even hugged some people to celebrate after breaking the barricades.He said that Sidhana is currently involved in 20 heinous cases including those related to murder and attempt to murder.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, along with advocates Jaspreet Singh and Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, who represented Sidhana, told the court that their client is not even named in the FIR and police does not have an iota of evidence against him.Sidhana moved the court saying he had grave apprehension that he may be arrested as his first cousin Gurdeep Singh was abducted and tortured by the Delhi Police and was made to forcibly sign certain blank papers, the counsel said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/r-day-violence-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-gangster-activist-lakha-sidhana-312557
17-09-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu attacks SAD, AAP over farm laws||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday slammed the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party over the Centre’s contentious farm laws, accusing them of staging a drama over the issue.Also read:  Sukhbir Badal, Harsimrat, other Akali leaders court arrest following protest outside ParliamentThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) hit back at Sidhu, calling him “Rakhi Sawant”, an actor. Sidhu on Wednesday too had attacked the Badals of the Shiromani Akali Dal, accusing them of laying the foundation of the Centre’s farm laws over which farmers are protesting for the past several months. The SAD led by its president Sukhbir Singh Badal and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal held a protest march against the laws in Delhi on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the passage of the laws, prompting police to detain both leaders. Attacking the SAD, Sidhu once again alleged that they were “creators and defenders” of the “black laws”.“The creators and defenders of the black laws are shedding crocodile tears today!!. Your drama stands exposed..#Black Day,” Sidhu tweeted.Sidhu also attacked the Aam Aadmi Party, alleging that the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi had last year notified one of the farm laws even when farmers were sitting at the borders of national capital protesting against the legislations.In a video message on his Twitter handle, Sidhu said the AAP staged a drama of tearing copies of the central farm laws in the Delhi Assembly.“Exploitation of farmers and decreasing prices even on crops where MSP is announced--@Arvind Kejriwal Ji you notified the Private Mandi’s central black law! Has it been de-notified or the masquerading is still going on..?” Sidhu said in another tweet. Hitting back, AAP leader Raghav Chadha said, “The Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics—Navjot Singh Sidhu—has received a scolding from the Congress high command for non-stop rant against Capt (Amarinder).”                “Therefore today, for a change, he went after Arvind Kejriwal. Wait till tomorrow for he shall resume his diatribe against Capt with vehemence,” Chadha tweeted.Earlier on Wednesday, Sidhu had alleged that one of the Centre’s laws is a “photostat copy” of the Punjab Contract Farming Act, 2013, enacted during the previous SAD-BJP government led by Parkash Singh Badal.The Amritsar MLA had also claimed that the Badals initially supported the Central laws and then took a U-turn after facing heat from farmers.His remarks had drawn a sharp reaction from the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which asked if Sidhu ever objected to the state Act as a minister in the Congress government or later.The SAD in a statement earlier said Sidhu is trying to “befool” people by raking up old issues to cover up his party’s failures.

The two-day mela is centred on the theme of eliminating stubble burning.“Till date, the Indian Constitution has been amended 127 times, so why can it not be amended once again to scrap the farm laws and resolve the imbroglio resulting from them,” asked the Chief Minister. “What is the problem in doing it a 128th time?” he demanded to know from the BJP-led government at the Centre.What is happening to the farmers today is extremely sad, given the immense contribution made by them to India’s development and progress, said Amarinder, calling for immediate revocation of the laws, which he said were detrimental to the interest not just of the agricultural community but the entire country.Recalling that he had been asked by the Centre to stop Punjab’s farmers from going to Delhi last November, the Chief Minister said he had refused point blank to do so, as protest is the democratic right of farmers. “Why should they not protest? How can I stop them,” he asked, making it clear that he continues to stand with the farmers in their fight against the legislations, with his government continuing to give compensation and jobs to the families of the deceased farmers.Noting the contribution of Punjab and its farmers to the country’s growth, the Chief Minister said the state, with only 1.53 per cent of total geographical area of India, produces about 18 per cent of the country’s wheat, 11 per cent paddy, 4.4 per cent cotton and 10 per cent milk. For the past many decades, Punjab has been contributing about 35-40 per cent of wheat and 25-30 per cent of rice to the central pool, he said.The Chief Minister stressed on the importance of agriculture as the lifeline of Punjab, and urged farmers to take full advantage of PAU’s advancements in technologies, seeds, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/scrap-farm-laws-talk-to-farmers-to-find-way-forward-amarinder-tells-centre-as-agri-laws-complete-one-year-312516
17-09-2021||Deepkamal Kaur||Political scene hots up in Doaba||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, September 16After the recent announcement of the candidatures of eight candidates of Shiromani Akali Dal for Doaba, six of Bahujan Samaj Party and Aam Aadmi Party declaring its constituency in-charges, political activity in the region has stepped up ahead of the forthcoming Assembly polls.The SAD-BSP alliance is clearly leading as of date in terms of starting an early campaign. The AAP, too, has started following the suit especially since the announcement of ex-hockey Olympian Surinder Sodhi as the halqa in-charge and a likely candidate from Jalandhar Cantonment.The party has been trying to create a wave by saying that it had pitted an Olympian against the sitting Congress MLA and Olympian Pargat Singh from the seat. The SAD has already announced its ex-MLA Jagbir Brar from the seat since he recently left the Congress to rejoin Akalis.Since three candidates have already been announced from this seat, hectic activity has begun here. MLA Pargat Singh, who had earlier remained busy as the general secretary (organisation) for setting up new teams for his closest confidant and PPCC chief Navjot Sidhu, too has begun focusing back on his seat. Pargat maintains: “I now stay for four days in Jalandhar, focusing on various ongoing works, meeting people and strengthening his team. For the remaining three days of the week, I have to go to Chandigarh”.Likewise, Brar too has been daily holding group meetings with sarpanches, block samiti members and the voters of his constituency. “The voters are not interested in the Olympian v/s Olympian fight. They want someone who will be available at their beck and call, work for development and fulfil all their needs,” says Brar.Other than Brar, the eight candidates that the party has sent to the battlefield in Doaba include four sitting MLAs — Baldev Khera from Phillaur, Pawan Tinu from Adampur, Gurpartap Wadala from Nakodar and Dr Sukhwinder Sukhi from Banga. The party has also trusted its ex-MLAs Surinder Singh Bhullewal Rathan from Garhshankar and Sohan Singh Thandal from Chabbewal, all of whom had already been given an indication long ago about going ahead with their campaigns.General secretary of YAD Sarabjeet Singh Sabi, who too had been nurturing political ambitions, got the Mukerian seat he had been eyeing for years. The seat was formerly with the BJP till the alliance of the two parties.Ex-president of the Safai Mazdur Union Chandan Grewal, who got allotted the general Jalandhar Central seat as a part of Sukhbir Badal’s Valmiki appeasement theory, too has been actively working on the seat. A sort of hoarding war is going in the constituency between him and AAP halqa in-charge and ENT specialist Dr Sanjeev Sharma, who is quite confident of being a go-ahead.The BSP, too, has its six candidates already in fray. These include party president Jasvir Garhi from Phagwara, Balwinder Kumar, who is getting repeated from Kartarpur seat, retired bank officer Anil Majinia from Jalandhar West, Lakhwinder Gilzian from Tanda, who hails from Gilzian village of executive president of PPCC and MLA Sangat S Gilzian, Mahinder Singh Kangra from Sham Churasi and Nachhatar Pal Singh from Nawanshahr.The party is yet to decide candidates from Jalandhar North, Kapurthala and Dasuya seats. Likewise, the SAD too has been indecisive about its candidates from Sultanpur Lodhi, Shahkot and Bholath seats. The BJP, which is set to face a huge task of fielding all candidates by itself, is yet to open its cards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/political-scene-hots-up-in-doaba-312358

The hospitality industry will also benefit from it, as once registered it will legitimise registered hotels and other establishment and past record of a visitor can be verified on the spot, this will help check illegal harbouring of anti-social elements.The system is being developed on a PPP model. It also has a unique feature to report emergencies such as theft, fire incidents and casualties in real time. In addition, it has a potential to add advanced security features as required in future. Duggal said under the project, over 2,500 customers’ entries had been recorded so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-1st-in-north-india-to-have-visitors-info-system-312246

Before this, the allottees have already paid a cumulative of Rs 2,022 per square yard while the area remained undeveloped for years.PDA officials said land acquisition collector-cum-SDM office recently raised demands of Rs 35.90 lakh from the PDA for payments to be made to farmers.

However, the office has further raised a claim for Rs 35.90 crore enhanced compensation related to landowners who filed their claims for the same in 2021. Therefore, recovery notices at the rate of Rs 430 are being issued now.”SDM Charanjit Singh said, “This recovery is being made to make payments to farmers.

Sources in the government have told The Tribune that the employees who have completed 10 years of services on contractual/ad hoc basis in various government departments, boards and corporations would be eligible for regularisation, as per the recommendations of a Cabinet sub-committee comprising Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, Rural Development Minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.It is estimated there are over 32,100 contractual employees in various departments of the state government and about 34,000 such employees in the state-owned boards and corporations. Since regularisation of services is being proposed only against sanctioned posts, only over 50 per cent of these contractual employees stand to benefit. Also, the outsourced employees are unlikely to be considered.The government has prepared “The Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill”, which will be discussed by the ministers on Friday, along with the financial implications of regularising services of such a huge number of employees. Initially, those whose services are regularised will get only the basic salary for three years, as per the policy of the state government.

As a result, many kiln owners had to shut operations permanently and switch to other alternative businesses in recent years.Up from Rs 7K to Rs 17KThe number of brick kilns has reduced from 3,600 to 2,600 in the past four yearsIn Bathinda, 250 brick kilns were operating until four years ago, but the number has come down to 140 nowBrick Kiln Owners’ Association chief Paramjit Singh Sandhu says they bought coal at Rs7,000/tonne until last year, but now the price has increased to Rs17,500As per Brick Kiln Owners’ Association representatives, owing to successive governments’ “utter disregard” for the industry, the number of brick kilns had reduced from 3,600 to 2,600 in the past four years and if the situation remained the same, many others would also be coerced to shut kilns.Association president Paramjit Singh Sandhu said: “Until last year, we were purchasing coal at Rs 7,000-7,100 per tonne, excluding all taxes, freight charges and other miscellaneous expenses, but now we are buying the same quantity for Rs 17,500 and if we add GST, freight and miscellaneous expenses, it costs us around Rs 22,000 per tonne. The rates of diesel have skyrocketed, so we have accordingly been charged more for freight. In Bathinda, 250 brick kilns were operating until four years ago, but the number has come down to 140 now.” Sandhu said: “The government, in the name of curbing pollution, told us to install expensive equipment and build kilns with specific techniques. So, many had to reconstruct kilns from the scratch.

He should make it clear whether he accepts that it was a wrong call to support the farmers’ agitation due to which traders, industry and common public suffered huge losses,” he said.In another press conference, party state general secretary Subhash Sharma alleged since the Congress had failed on all fronts, it was making Captain Amarinder a scapegoat by putting the onus on him for the failures of the past four and half years.Subhash accused PCC president Navjot Sidhu of lying on the issue of farm laws.

After Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat, during his recent visit, had tried to defuse tension while advising the Chief Minister and the PCC chief to work as a team.Already in ‘advanced stage of resolution’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cong-plans-observer-for-18-point-agenda-312202
17-09-2021||New Delhi||India expresses concern over activities by Khalistani separatist groups in US||Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US next week, India on Thursday expressed concern over reports of growing anti-India activities by Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups from American soil.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said ensuring the security of the prime minister and his delegation was an important issue when asked about reports that a banned Khalistani group is planning to hold protests in Washington and New York during Modi’s visit to the two cities.Referring to a report by leading American think-tank Hudson Institute about the Khalistani groups, he said it reflected how Pakistan was continuing efforts to undertake activities against India from the US.“I do not know about the specific call given by the banned outfit. I am not going to comment on that. But we certainly take a lot of interest in ensuring the security of the prime minister and his delegation,” Bagchi said at a media briefing.“We convey and share (this) with the host country, in this case, the US. If the organisation is banned, it should not be undertaking these kinds of activities,” he said.The external affairs ministry spokesperson said the issue is not about protest. “This issue is about security and these are organisations that have had problems in the past in terms of terrorist activities etc. I would not like to go into details,” he added.On the report by the Hudson Institute, Bagchi said it makes it clear how Pakistan has yet again continued its efforts in trying to undertake activities against India including terrorism. “It was very focused about activities they are taking in American soil. I do hope that authorities in the US will see that and understand the risks that this kind of activities pose for countries that have a shared vision against terrorism and violence,” Bagchi said.The think-tank said Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups, banned by the Indian government, are quietly gaining ground in the US and that Washington has so far remained indifferent to the appeals made by New Delhi to curb their activities.The US-based Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group, was banned by the Indian government in 2019 for its alleged anti-national activities.Modi will travel to the US next week to participate in the first in-person summit of the Quad that is expected to broadly focus on contemporary global challenges including the Afghan crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. He will attend the Quad summit on September 24 in Washington and address the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in New York the next day.Bagchi said Modi will have a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden. “We are also looking forward to bilateral meetings with other Quad leaders,” he said.The MEA spokesperson said the prime minister is likely to have some other bilateral meetings with other leaders in New York.It will be the prime minister’s first visit to the US since President Joe Biden took office.The last time Modi visited the US was in September 2019 when he and then US President Donald Trump addressed the Howdy-Modi event in Houston.The US is hosting the in-person summit of the leaders of Quad to boost practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region as well as to send a strong signal about Washington’s commitment to the grouping.People familiar with the preparations for the summit said the situation in Afghanistan following the return of the Taliban to power will be deliberated extensively at the summit.Afghanistan has been grappling with increasing poverty and hunger besides witnessing widespread violations of human rights, particularly of the women under the new dispensation, triggering massive global concerns.The Quad leaders are expected to deliberate extensively on expanding cooperation in Indo-Pacific in the face of rising Chinese military muscle-flexing in the region, the people cited above said. Asked about the possibility of a meeting among foreign ministers of the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Bagchi said there was no information on it yet.“There is no specific information whether it will take place this time or not. Nepal is the chair of SAARC and it has to convene it. If it is convened, I think we will participate,” he added. On multiple occasions, the foreign ministers of the SAARC met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.The SAARC is a regional grouping comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
