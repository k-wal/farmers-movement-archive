18-09-2021||New Delhi||Punjab: Could Amarinder's resignation be BJP's chance? Saffron party plays 'wait and watch'||The day turned out to be quite a mixed bag for the ruling BJP. In West Bengal, Asansol MP Babul Supriyo, who until July was among Prime Minister Narendra Modi council of ministers, jumped ship to join its bitter rival, the Trinamool Congress. In Punjab, the resignation of Congress’ Amarinder Singh presented what could potentially be an opportunity to capture a state that has so far resisted the saffron wave.Capt Amarinder Singh's move has opened doors for the BJP in a poll-bound year. Punjab’s a state where its stakes are low and where, with the Akalis no longer allies, its chances to make government are limited. It is also a state that’s played a major role in the ongoing farmer protests against the three controversial agriculture laws passed by the Centre.Observers see Captain’s resignation as an unexpected opportunity for the BJP to lift its head in a state where it has so far been unable to stand on its own.“Only his age and the three contentious legislations stand between the two (BJP and Amarinder) because Captain’s nationalist image works well for both the party and its ideological fountainhead RSS,” observers say.  Soon after he resigned, Captain Amarinder Singh accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of having “ties with Pakistan” and warned that his “elevation as CM will be a threat to national security”. “Pakistan PM Imran Khan is his friend. Sidhu has a relation with army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa,” Captain Amarinder Singh said on Saturday—words that would come as music to the BJP’s ears.Interestingly, the BJP which slammed the Congress as a “complete failure in all fronts”, steered clear of criticizing Capt Amarinder.The mafia raj of the Congress in Punjab will prove to be the last nail in its coffin in Punjab,” national general secretary Tarun Chugh said, adding that “replacing the CM is a panic reaction of the Congress high command to salvage the party situation after it failed to deliver in the last more than four and a half years”.At 79, Amarinder Singh is beyond the BJP’s unofficial cut-off age for a CM. Whether he is looking for the job or is open to the idea remains to be seen. However, for a party looking for a credible face to support, even if it is from outside, age is an issue that can be easily overlooked. “Punjab is a border state and needs political stability. The (75-year) rule is not cast in stone. Besides, there are always opportunities in politics,” said a BJP leader who did not wish to be named.Singh, who was quoted as saying that he will not join the Akali Dal, also said that he has not decided on “other parties”. His other options could also work well for the BJP and Congress’ other rivals such as the Aam Aadmi Party.  If not a party of his own, Singh can always sit out and act as a spoiler for the Congress. Observers feel the BJP could benefit provided it makes some sacrifices, such as on the three laws, pr perhaps enacts a law on the MSP—the latter being a demand that a sister affiliate in the Sangh, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, has been demanding.  The BKS has been demanding a “stringent law” on Minimum Support Price depending upon the actual cost of production.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-could-amarinders-resignation-be-bjps-chance-saffron-party-plays-wait-and-watch-313013
18-09-2021||---||Capt Amarinder’s resignation self admission that Cong has failed to perform in Punjab: Sukhbir Badal||Chandigarh, September 18Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday said Capt Amarinder Singh’s resignation was a self admission on the part of the Congress party as well as its high command that the party had failed to perform in the State and had nothing to show for more than four and a half years of governance.Asserting that this was a testimony to what the SAD had been stating all along, Sukhbir Badal said Capt Amarinder had been punished by nature for lying with Gutka Sahib in hand and that every member of the Congress party would suffer the same fate.Sukhbir said a mere change of guard would not save the Congress party’s sinking ship in Punjab. He said the entire State cabinet as well as the Congress MLAs were steeped in corruption and were running various kinds of mafias including sand, liquor and drug mafias. “The Congress party cannot hope to save its incompetent government and befool Punjabis with a mere change in face.”Sukhbir Badal said the devious ploy of the Congress high command to avert a backlash against the party by putting the blame on one person alone would not succeed. “Punjabis know that the entire Congress party in Punjab is known for open loot and lawlessness. Its ministers and MLAs patronized gangsters. Its ministers looted the State exchequer of thousands of crores. It failed to undertake any development or infrastructure projects in the state.”He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Gandhi siblings Rahul and Priyanka could also not escape responsibility for making Punjabis suffer for more than four and a half years. “First of all Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were the force behind the election manifesto of the Congress party for the 2017 assembly elections. The Gandhi family not only kept Capt Amarinder Singh in power but also failed to move against any of his corrupt ministers. It also failed to prevail upon Capt Amarinder to fulfill the promises made to the people. Amarinder’s failure is the failure of Sonia Ganhi and Rahul Gandhi.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinders-resignation-self-admission-that-cong-has-failed-to-perform-in-punjab-sukhbir-badal-313009

The mafia raj of the Congress in Punjab would prove to be the last nail in its coffin in Punjab, he added.Ashwani Sharma said the constant bickering between Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and Capt Amarinder Singh since Sidhu took over as Party chief in the state has led to these events. “However, Sidhu is a non-performing politician who believes in theatre than in governance.”“The central leadership first forced a humiliating exit of Sunil Jhakkar by appointing Sidhu and now has sacrificed Capt Amarinder Singh. Their entire endeavour is to mislead people in the soon to be held assembly elections but Punjabis are astute and know that Congress has miserably failed to govern the state,” Ashwani Sharma said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinder-singhs-resignation-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-congress-punjab-bjp-chief-313003
18-09-2021||Mohali||Day Capt Amarinder quit as Punjab CM, son Raninder re-elected NRAI president for fourth time||Seasoned administrator Raninder Singh was on Saturday re-elected as the president of the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) for an unprecedented fourth term after he beat BSP MP Shyam Singh Yadav 56-3 in the elections here.Kanwar Sultan Singh was elected unopposed as the secretary general of the national shooting body, while Randeep Mann has been made the treasurer.Odisha MP Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo will continue to be the federation’s senior vice-president besides the eight vice-presidents.Pawan Kumar Singh will remain the apex body’s joint secretary alongside Sheila Kanungo after both were elected unopposed to the post.Raninder is son of Capt Amarinder Singh who resigned as Punjab Chief Minister today.Capt Amarinder Singh was accompanied by his wife and MP Preneet Kaur and son Raninder Singh when he submitted his resignation to Governor Banwarilal Purohit."I am proud to accompany my father to Raj Bhawan when he submits his resignation as CM of Punjab and leads us as head of our family into a new beginning," Raninder Singh said in a tweet earlier.The general body election of the NRAI had representation from 59 of its members, out of whom 56 voted in favour of Raninder, while 3 votes were cast in favour of his opponent Yadav, who is the president of the Uttar Pradesh State Rifle Association.The NRAI decided to go ahead with the polls despite the impediments it faced after the petition filed by challenger Yadav in the Delhi High Court, followed by the sports ministry’s directive to initiate elections afresh.Yadav is a Lok Sabha MP from UP’s Jaunpur constituency.However, the NRAI went ahead with the elections as scheduled, as there was no stay order on it from the court.The matter is pending with the Delhi High Court with the next date scheduled in December.The elections were held at the IS Bindra Stadium.In his petition, Yadav cited “perceptible conflict of interest” in the appointment of the returning officer for the polls, Mehtab Singh Gill.Acting on his petition, the ministry also looked into the objections raised by Yadav regarding Raninder’s tenure but found the incumbent to have a legitimate claim at re-election.The national sports code, 2011, states: “The president of any recognised NSF, including the IOA, can hold the office for a maximum of 12 years, with or without a break.”Going by the technicalities, Raninder entered the polls as a valid candidate as he will complete 12 years in the post at the end of 2022.Raninder said, “This election was not about the chair but about its basic capability to be autonomous, yet at the same time not be violative of a National Sports Code we genuinely welcome and voluntarily follow.“Indeed, the strength the code provides us, has and will continue to support us in presenting clarity and strength to discharge our duty to the sport and its athletes. But more importantly, not allow shadowy mentors of dubious challengers to politicise.” Nonetheless, he was “honoured and humbled” that the members have “reposed faith” in his leadership.“Together we have achieved a lot for Indian shooting and the time has now come to take it to another level,” he added.A total of eight vice-presidents were elected which included Ajay H. Patel, Amit Sanghi, Ashok J.Pandit, Ashok Mittal, John Kharshiing, Putul Kumari, Sushma Singh and Verinder Kumar Dhall.For the post of honourary secretary, Susheel, Ishwar Rohal, Kumar Tripurari Singh, Meghasham Shripad Bhangle, Moirangthem R. Singh and R.Ravikrishnan were also elected unopposed.A total of 16 governing body members were also elected.The elections were conducted by Returning Officer Justice (retd) Mehtab Singh Gill as well as Additional Returning Officer Justice (retd) Inderjeet Singh Walia.Chander Mukhi Sharma, the secretary general of the Basketball Federation of India (BFI) was present as the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) observer while Athletics Federation of India president Adille J Sumariwalla was present as the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) observer.Former world No.1 trap shooter and Olympian Ronjan Sodhi was also a part of the election process as an “eminent sportsperson observer”.Speaking after the declaration of the election results, the new secretary general Kanwar Sultan Singh said, “I am thankful to the members of the NRAI general body for entrusting me with the responsibility of carrying forward the federation’s vision of taking the sport shooting to new horizons.“Our next goal is to analyse the unexpected Tokyo 2020 performances and learn from them in order to create a roadmap for Paris 2024.” Raninder became the president of the NRAI for the first time in 2010.

18-09-2021||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder: The man who put Cong back on saddle in Punjab||One of the strongest regional satraps of the Congress, Amarinder Singh was the leader who put the party back in the saddle in Punjab after an intensely fought poll battle that decimated the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and crushed the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) dream of expanding its footprint beyond Delhi.The 79-year-old widely respected and popular leader steered the Congress in 2017 to a landslide victory in the 117-member assembly to occupy the chief minister’s post for the second time.The ‘maharaja’s’ win in Punjab after 10 years had also rekindled the hopes for the revival of the grand old party.Read alsoBut now all seems not well in the party’s state unit as over 50 MLAs have written to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi seeking that Singh be replaced as chief minister, a development that comes just about four months ahead of assembly elections in the state.Singh has now decided to quit from the post of chief minister.Belonging to a very rare breed of politicians who have seen action in the Indo-Pak war, Singh tasted success in the 2017 polls after Akali Dal supremo Parkash Singh Badal foiled his previous attempts to become chief minister in 2007 and 2012.Navjot Singh Sidhu joined the Congress a few months ahead of the polls after quitting the BJP. Speculation was rife that he would be given the post of deputy chief minister, but he was made a Cabinet Minister. Relations between him and the chief minister were never warm.Just two years after the Congress came to power, Sidhu was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle in June 2019 and he then resigned from the state cabinet.Singh had divested Sidhu of the local government and tourism and cultural affairs departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio though the latter never assumed charge of his new department.Shortly afterwards, Sidhu had approached the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi and “apprised him of the situation”.The tension between Singh and Sidhu came out in the open. While Singh blamed him for the “inept handling” of the local government department, claiming that it resulted in “poor performance” of the Congress in urban areas in the (2019) Lok Sabha polls, the former cricketer, on the other hand said “(Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi is my captain...Rahul Gandhi is the captain of the captain (Singh) also.”However, things became worse and finally, Sidhu was appointed state Congress president, notwithstanding strong opposition from Singh.Once a leader of the Akali Dal, Singh, the ‘scion of Patiala’, in his short Army career, fought in the 1965 war.Son of late Maharaja Yadavindra Singh of Patiala, Singh did his initial schooling at Lawrence School, Sanawar, and Doon School in Dehradun, before joining the National Defence Academy, Kharagwasla, in 1959 and graduating from there in 1963.Commissioned in the Indian Army in 1963, he was posted in 2nd Bn. Sikh Regiment (both his father and grandfather had served the battalion), served in Field Area - Indo Tibetan border for two years and was appointed Aide-de-Camp to Lt Gen Harbaksh Singh, GOC-in-C Western Command.The political career of Singh, who was considered a close friend of late Rajiv Gandhi, began in January 1980 when he was elected an MP.But he resigned from the Congress and the Lok Sabha in protest against the entry of the army into the Golden Temple during Operation Blue Star in 1984.After joining the Akali Dal in August 1985, Singh got elected to the Punjab assembly on an Akali Dal (Longowal) ticket in the 1995 elections.During his first term as chief minister (2002-07), his government in 2004 passed the state law terminating Punjab’s water sharing pact with neighbouring states.Last year, his government brought four bills, which were later passed by the state assembly, to “counter the contentious farm legislation enacted by Parliament”.In his second term, his government also announced a waiver of crores of rupees worth of loans under the farm debt waiver scheme for labourers and the landless farming community.Singh fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar and defeated BJP’s Arun Jaitley by a margin of more than one lakh votes.He then resigned in November as MP after the Supreme Court termed Punjab’s 2004 Act terminating the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal agreement as unconstitutional.A few days later, he was appointed president of the Punjab Congress again in the run-up to the polls. A widely travelled person, Singh has penned several books including his memoirs of the 1965 Indo-Pak war.

They do not care about the welfare of Punjab, but their own personal happiness. Congress is a drowning Titanic that neither has vision nor commitment or performance," Chadha said in Punjabi."I guess it’s too much to expect the Congress to take the fight to the BJP when its state leaders are too busy fighting amongst themselves," Omar Abdullah said.In a series of tweets, Omar said, "Ordinarily I wouldn't give a toss about the fratricide in the Congress party - their party, their business. However what the Congress does has a direct fallout for every political party outside the NDA orbit because almost 200 Lok Sabha seats see a direct BJP - Cong fight," he added.

18-09-2021||Vijay Mohan||Warning of hotter and drier days in Punjab, study calls for crop contingency planning||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 18Projecting that the climate in Punjab may become hotter and drier during the 21st century, a new study by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, has said that in order to maintain the sustainability of crop production and food supply, the state has to evolve suitable crop contingency planning in view of the climatic changes.“Comparison of maximum and minimum temperatures reveals the minimum temperature increase to be more than the rise in maximum temperature. This implies that the diurnal range in temperature would decrease, which is not favorable for enhancing crop production. Punjab state economy is not only largely dependent on agriculture but it also contributes significantly to the rice and wheat reserve pool of the country,” the study states.During the mid-century period of 2020-2049, the maximum temperature annually is projected to increase from the baseline period by up to 1.5 degree Celsius while during the kharif and rabi seasons it is projected to increase between 0.3 to 1.5 degree Celsius  and 0 to 1.6 degree Celsius, respectively, the researchers said.The minimum temperature is expected to increase from the baseline period between 1.1 to 3.1 degree Celsius annually and between 0.1 to 4.8 degree Celsius and 0.3 to 1.8 degree Celsius for the kharif and rabi seasons, respectively.On the other hand, the annual decrease in rain is projected to decrease between 33 to 554 mm from the baseline period. During the kharif and rabi seasons, the decrease is expected to be between 20 to 443 mm and 20 to 110 mm, respectively.The rate of temperature increase is higher during the end-century as compared to the mid-century period. While rainfall is projected to increase at Abohar, it may decline at Amritsar, Ballowal Saunkhri, Ludhiana, Patiala, Bathinda and Faridkot regions.The study, undertaken by three experts from the Department of Climate Change and Agricultural Meteorology and the Department of Soil and Water Engineering at PAU, has been published recently by the India Meteorological Department.According to the researchers, climate change is occurring at a fast pace in recent times and footprints of these changes are becoming visible globally. Though it has been an age-old phenomenon, recently due to unprecedented increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by anthropogenic activities it has gained momentum during the 20th century.Climate change has impacted almost all parts of the world, but the Asian continent is considered to be the most vulnerable region to shocks of climate change and climate variability due to various stresses and low adaptive capacity.The researchers used data for meteorological parameters like maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall on a daily basis for the past eight years and analysis of the daily data was done on an annual basis as well as for Many—October for kharif season and November—April for rabi season.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/warning-of-hotter-and-drier-days-in-punjab-study-calls-for-crop-contingency-planning-312983

These will not be implemented in Punjab if the SAD-BSP alliance comes to power. — Sukhbir Singh Badal, SAD PresidentSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal along with several party leaders was detained as party workers thronged the Rakabganj Sahib Gurdwara. The Delhi Police had set up barricades at several roads leading to Delhi to scan all vehicles with Punjab or Chandigarh registration numbers. Key roads leading into the national capital from Gurugram, Rohtak, Chandigarh and Ghaziabad, respectively, saw snarl-ups.The SAD march started from the gurdwara towards Parliament, a distance of about 1 km, breaking through the barricading.A memorandum was submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through the Executive Magistrate on duty at the site. The memorandum chiefly sought repeal of the central farm laws, a legal and constitutional guarantee on the MSP, a legal guarantee on the assured purchase of all major crops and farmer produce, resumption of talks between the government with farmers and, a provision requiring consultation with stakeholders before bringing any legislation impacting their lives.Earlier, addressing protesters, Sukhbir said the party would fight relentlessly to ensure repeal of the three Acts. The entire senior leadership of the SAD, including Prem Singh Chandumajra, Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Harsimrat Kaur Badal condemned the “high-handed” manner in which party workers were prevented from reaching the national capital. They said some workers had to walk as far as 20 km.Sukhbir reminded that Harsimrat resigned from the Union Cabinet and the party severed ties with the NDA government in solidarity with farmers. He alleged the farm laws were first introduced in Parliament during the tenure of the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government. Subsequently, the Congress in Punjab amended the APMC Act to bring in private mandis and the same was promised nationwide in its 2019 manifesto.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/one-year-of-contentious-central-agriculture-laws-sad-black-day-march-chokes-delhi-312645

You were party to the decision of Union Cabinet in June 2020 that approved the three farm ordinances. Your drama is well known to every Punjabi. The Congress will continue to strongly stand against these laws! Scrap farm laws, talk to farmers to find way forward. It’s high time you realised your blunder and withdraw the black laws. Why can’t Constitution be amended a 128th time to do that?”Around the same time, Sidhu took on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, tweeting: “Exploitation of farmers and decreasing prices even on crops where MSP is announced — @ArvindKejriwal Ji you notified the Private Mandi’s central black law! Has it been de-notified or the masquerading is still going on?On the Badals, Sidhu said: “There are lies, white lies, then there is a bundle of lies called Sukha Gappi@officeofssbadal… The creators and defenders of the black laws are shedding crocodile tears today!! Your drama stands exposed.”Calling the BJP “a lost cause in Punjab”, Sidhu accused the party of trying to make a backdoor entry through “long-term ally” Akali Dal. “Desperate to make them heroes but they will remain zeroes in Punjab.

This evinced sharp rebuke from Congress spokesperson Alka Lamba, who linked him to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Sawant has a reputation of speaking out of turn, and on issues which are considered social taboos.Sawant of Punjab politicsThe Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics — Navjot Singh Sidhu — has received a scolding from Congress high command for non-stop rant against Capt. — Raghav Chadha, AAPMisogynistic mindset of RSSAAP has always had the misogynistic mindset of the RSS... this time also, it has dragged in a woman, thereby manifesting its despicable politics. — Alka Lamba, Congress spokespersonThe Chadha-Lamba verbal duel played out virtually on the Twitter.

Under this, the Health Dept had proposed bringing these families into govt schemes cover on a co-sharing basis, which would have required the beneficiaries to pay for part of the expense.Nod to custom milling policyThe Cabinet approved the Punjab Custom Milling Policy for kharif 2021-22 for conversion of paddy procured by state procurement agencies (Pungrain, Markfed, Punsup and PSWC) into custom milled rice and its delivery into the central pool. The Kharif Marketing Season 2021-22 will start from Oct 1 and the operations will be completed by Dec 15.Ministers Brahm Mohindra, Razia Sultana, Tript Bajwa, Balbir Sidhu besides others sought the minimum period criteria to be reduced from 10 years to three or five years. After listening the ministers, CM Capt Amarinder Singh directed the Cabinet sub-committee to put up the draft of legislation with the changes after getting it vetted from the Legal Remembrancer.With 10-year criteria, nearly 37,000 employees could be regularised. By reducing it to three to five years, more employees could be adjusted.As per the draft tabled at the Cabinet meeting, the employees who have completed 10 years of services on contractual/ad hoc basis in various government departments, boards and corporations were eligible for regularisation, under the suggestions of a Cabinet sub-committee comprising Brahm Mohindra, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal, Rural Development Minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.It is estimated there are over 32,100 contractual staff in various government departments and 34,000 such employees in state-owned boards and corporations. Since regularisation of services is being proposed only against sanctioned posts, only over 50% of these contract employees stand to benefit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/regularisation-move-deferred-as-punjab-ministers-object-to-criteria-312656

Non-teaching staff, however, may be put on such duties on any day or at any time,” the secretary added.As per the directions given by the Supreme Court and High Court, if the staff on poll duty isn’t sufficient then teachers should be deployed but not during school hours. Also, due compensation in terms of leaves shall be provided to these teachers subsequently, he wrote.As far as the non-teaching staff is concerned, they can be relieved even during school hours for booth-level officer or election duties.

18-09-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Ahead of paddy purchase, Punjab officials raid erring millers||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 17Under the Centre’s scanner over state paddy procurement far exceeding the production last year, the Punjab Government has tightened its noose around erring millers/traders who buy cheap rice and paddy from outside the state for further sale to the Food Corporation of India on higher MSP.Centre keeping strict vigilThe Centre has been keeping a strict vigil on the paddy procurement process in Punjab this year. In 2019, paddy purchase stood at 163.82 LMT while in 20202, it jumped to 202.82 LMT, though area under cultivation came down by 2 lakh hectares. This jump was attributed by the Centre to bogus billing and sale of paddy from outside the state in Punjab mandisAs part of the drive to check malpractices ahead of the paddy procurement season, a team of vigilance officials from the Food and Supplies Department conducted a search and seizure operation at a rice mill in Jalalabad and found over 23,000 tonne rice worth Rs 33 crore stocked there.Since the previous years’ rice has already been delivered and this year’s paddy procurement is yet to begin, the huge stockpile of rice at the mill has raised raiding team’s suspicion.Officials in the department said their probe had so far proven that rice was brought to the mill from another state (apparently UP) and was most likely meant to be passed on to the FCI, passing it off as rice milled from paddy grown in Punjab. The firm has reportedly been blacklisted.In another instance, the vigilance sleuths of the department intercepted two truckloads of rice coming to a mill in Bagha Purana from UP. While the mill denied the rice was meant for them, the address and name on the bills suggested otherwise. “The current accounts of the mill are being examined, and if it is found that it paid for the rice, it too will be blacklisted,” said a senior officer in the department.“The modus operandi is to buy rice meant for public distribution from either UP or Bihar at Rs 2,100 to Rs 2,200 per quintal. The paddy that would yield this quantity of rice upon milling is then shown to have been sold through a commission agent to a government agency, without any paddy being actually sold. The MSP of Rs 1,940 per quintal will be claimed for this bogus sale of paddy and then the rice will be passed off to government agencies, that will pay Rs 3,300 per quintal for this rice (at 67% upturn ratio),” a top officer in the department told The Tribune.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ahead-of-paddy-purchase-punjab-officials-raid-erring-millers-312664

Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill also made it clear that the facts “do cast a serious suspicion on the case of the prosecution”.Two granted bailThe assertion by Justice Gill came on two petitions against the State of Punjab by Balwinder Singh and Charanjit Singh through counsels Charanjit Singh Bakhshi and Ankur Jain. The petitioners were seeking regular bail in an FIR registered on August 18, 2020, at the Special Task Force police station in Mohali for attempt to murder and other offences under Sections 307, 353, 186 and427 of the IPC and provisions of the NDPS Act.Taking up the matter, Justice Gill referred to a “few facts and dates” predominantly regarding petitioner Balwinder’s involvement in some other cases. This, Justice Gill observed, was to test the contention on his false implication repeatedly on the ground that police officials, particularly ASIs Surjit Singh, Kulvir Singh and Kulwinder Singh and Head Constable Kulwant Singh, were inimical towards him.Justice Gill asserted a perusal of the cases registered against the petitioner, one after the other, did tend to show that the police were all out to involve him in one case or the other. While he was never shown to be found at the alleged place of recovery, he was shown to be nominated by the way of disclosure statements. “Very conspicuously”, he used to be involved in some other case the moment he got relieffrom the court.Justice Gill added the HC in its order dated January 12, passed in another matter, ordered the registration of case against the erring officials on finding their conduct dubious in FIR registered on August 4, 2017. “Those very police officers have actively participated in the instant case, wherein the petitioner is alleged to have caused injuries to the police officials and is also alleged to have been found in possession of 300 grams of heroin,” he observed.Referring to the petitioner’s contention that the alleged injuries were found to be in the nature of bruises and abrasions and the medical examination was conducted after about 10 hours of the occurrence, Justice Gill granted bail after adding the petitioners had been behind bars for more than a year and challanstood presented.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-indicts-punjab-police-for-trying-to-frame-accused-in-multiple-cases-312666
