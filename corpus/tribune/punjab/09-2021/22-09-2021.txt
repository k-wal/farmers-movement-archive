22-09-2021||London||UK court discharges 3 British-Sikhs arrested on suspicion of murder in India||A UK court on Wednesday discharged three British-Sikhs arrested in Britain on suspicion of “conspiracy to a murder” in India 12 years ago, with India’s appeal to extradite them dismissed due to insufficient evidence.The arrests of Piara Singh Gill, Amritivir Singh Wahiwala and Gursharanvir Singh Wahiwala followed early morning raids on Indian extradition warrants executed by the West Midlands Police in December last year.They were held in connection with the 2009 murder of Rulda Singh, a senior member of the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, who was shot in Patiala and died a week after the attack.District Judge Michael Snow presided over an appeal hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Wednesday and ruled to discharge them.“The accused have been discharged,” said the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which appears in court on behalf of the Indian authorities.The Indian government is yet to comment on its extradition bid being dismissed.Crowds of supporters of the so-called “West Midlands 3” had gathered outside the court in support of the accused. An investigation into the case by the West Midlands Police dates back to 2011, with the judge noting that the issue has been a “long running saga” for the three men.Their lawyer described the allegations against them as “wholly unjust”. The prosecution also had to concede that the evidence was “not sufficient to make out a case to answer” against them.Two men, aged 37 and 40, were arrested in Coventry and a 38-year-old man was arrested in Wolverhampton last year and were granted bail under “strict conditions”.A further hearing is now expected at a later date to consider human rights concerns related to the arrests.

22-09-2021||---||Can’t give anticipatory bail where accused jumps bail: Punjab and Haryana HC||Chandigarh, September 22The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that anticipatory bail cannot be extended to cases where an accused was apprehending arrest due to jumping bail. “The scope of 438 CrPC cannot be extended to cases where such apprehension of arrest is on account of jumping bail,” Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill ruled.Referring to the provisions of law, Justice Gill asserted a person may approach the Courts under provisions of Section 438 CrPC for grant of anticipatory bail only when there was an apprehension of arrest upon an accusation being made — upon the institution of an FIR, lodging of a complaint or being summoned by the Court for the first time to face trial.The assertion came on a petition seeking anticipatory bail regarding a criminal complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The Bench was told that his bail was cancelled following the petitioner’s absence before the trial Court on July 6, 2019, and on subsequent dates.Justice Gill added the Court could not lose sight of the fact that an accused in certain cases might not be able to appear before the trial Court on account of genuine reasons, such as incorrect noting of the date or certain reasons beyond his control.In such cases, the accused could surrender before the trial Court. It was expected that the trial Courts, in turn, would take a lenient view in genuine cases and decide the regular bail application expeditiously.“In a given set of circumstances where the trial Court is satisfied that there were valid reasons for the absence of an accused and that he has surrendered at the shortest possible time, the trial Court can, in fact, dispose of the regular bail application on the very day the same is presented by accused upon his surrender,” Justice Gill added.Before parting with the case, Justice Gill added that the trial Court, in its discretion, may also choose to grant interim bail, in fit cases, but only after the surrender of the accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cant-give-anticipatory-bail-where-accused-jumps-bail-punjab-and-haryana-hc-314761

22-09-2021||Ravneet Singh||Phulkari no longer viable option for women artisans: Punjabi University study||Tribune News ServicePatiala, September 21A study carried out by professors of Punjabi University, Patiala, has found that low remuneration has made handmade phulkari (a traditional art specific to the Patiala region) an economically unviable option for many young women who do not want to take it up as a means of livelihood. The research project report that was released on Monday highlighted that the artisans were not satisfied with their income and were worried about the diminishing demand of handmade phulkari in the local market.The research was sponsored by the Centre for Women’s Development Studies, New Delhi. Professor Ritu Lehal, Director, Women’s Studies Centre, who headed the research programme carried out primarily in villages of Patiala district said some artisans reported making eight rupees per flower and three hundred rupees from one Phulkari, which takes 12 to 15 days to complete.The university faculty members studied the working and earnings of 120 artisans divided in two groups— those from training centres and those artisans working since generations.They found that 52 per cent of the respondents were not satisfied with their income from phulkari, while 37 per cent had average satisfaction on the same.Ritu Lehal said, “About 55 per cent artisans observed fewer sales while 45 per cent reported less profit margin which is directly related to sales.” She added that machines produce more outfits per day which had lowered the price of the product and added to reduction in sale of traditional handmade phulkari.Interestingly, while machine made phulkari was found more popular among customers in India, handmade phulkari was popular among overseas customers. “Phulkari is now made for profit as a commodity. It is being sold in both local and foreign markets”, she said. Also, of 120, only 10 artisans were aware of online selling platforms.Apart from suggesting policy making and providing raw material to phulkari artists on subsidised rates, the officials said there was a need to create awareness among masses about traditional phulkari of Punjab. They said artisans should be helped to sell their products directly to the customers without the interference of middlemen. “Handicrafts museum should be set up representing phulkari culture while self-help groups should be established among artisans of villages”, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/phulkari-no-longer-viable-option-for-women-artisans-punjabi-university-study-314515

In some cases, one of the petitioners was a minor and had not attained the marriageable age in accordance with the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act. Else, the parties claimed they were in a live-in relationship.Justice Sangwan added the lawyers in such cases intentionally submitted the affidavit only of the petitioner legally competent to file the same. This was in order to avoid deposing the correct description of the marital status as well as the age of the other petitioner.Referring to the facts of the case in hand, Justice Sangwan asserted the petitioner-man was already married. By not filing an affidavit, he had managed to conceal his marital status. Justice Sangwan observed the High Court Registry, was directed to explain how the petition was passed without affidavits of both the petitioners. The Registry pointed out the relevant order before submitting the present case was passed since the affidavit of one of the petitioners was annexed.Justice Sangwan added it would be appropriate to issue a direction to the Registry in the matter. All cases in the category of criminal writ petition filed under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution or under Section 482 of the CrPC were required to be passed only when both the petitioners had filed their respective affidavits.

The decision was taken in accordance with Section 11 of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and after following the principle of natural justice, it added.“In the result, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana is unsustainable in law. The appeals are, therefore, allowed and the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dated January 25, 2019, is quashed and set aside,” it said.The verdict came on appeals challenging the HC order allowing the petitions filed by EMTA Coal Limited giving the first right of refusal in the matter of lending of coal mining lease to EMTA.“While exercising powers of judicial review, the court is not concerned with the ultimate decision but the decision-making process. The limited areas in which the court can inquire are as to whether a decision-making authority has exceeded its powers, committed an error of law or committed breach of principle of natural justice,” it said.The top court took note of the fact that PSPCL went for a competitive bidding process for the purpose of eliciting the best operator. It had also referred to its decision that held the allotment should be through a competitive bidding process. The PSEB was proposed to be allotted captive coal mines by the Centre. Following issuance of a tender inviting bids for the purpose of development of captive coal mines, ETMA Coal Limited emerged the winner. Following creation of a joint venture company, the Centre on December 26, 2001, allotted a captive coal block in Jharkhand, to the PSEB.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coal-block-sc-upholds-punjab-powercom-decision-314427

As the population falls in the eligible category for vaccination, the state has to vaccinate 21 lakh more people than its original estimates.A letter written to the state government last week by the Union Joint Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, said during review meetings, some states and UTs had raised the issue of a difference in the estimated target population communicated by the Government of India and the state estimates.Following this, the ministry had referred the issue to the Office of Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India, for inputs and corrections, if any, in the estimated population.Based on the latest report, the number of age-specific population for Punjab has been revised. Now, 18 years and above population, which needs to be vaccinated, stands at 2,27,38,000. In age-wise break-up, population falling in the 18-44 years category is 1,38,13,000; 45-59 years 50,96,000; and 60 years and above 38,29,000.So far, the state has administered 1.8 crore vaccine doses and just 42 lakh people have been fully jabbed.Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid, said the state was fully equipped to administer five lakh doses every day. “If we get regular supply of vaccine, the increased estimate won’t be a big problem,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabs-estimates-revised-now-21-lakh-more-to-be-vaccinated-314413

Earlier also, thousands of farmers marched to Parliament which sent out a message of unity and strength attracting the worldwide attention”.Asserting that the SAD held Rajewal in high esteem, the SAD leaders said “Rajewal however should not lower his dignity by making political statements. We are ready to debate political issues separately and the kisan forum should not be used for the same”. Dr Cheema rebutted the assertion of Rajewal that the SAD was defaming the ‘kisan andolan’ by releasing videos. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/keep-farmers-stir-above-politics-akalis-to-balbir-singh-rajewal-314405

This way, the state can then buy cheaper power and in turn save hundreds of crores of rupees given to the power producers as fixed charges, says a report of the Finance Department.Also on the drawing board is asset monetisation, where the government can lease out its assets to private entities for a fixed term to raise additional resources upfront and/or for periodic payments.Last night, a Cabinet meeting discussed waiver of water charges for rural domestic consumers, reduction in charges for urban domestic consumers and additional 100 units of free power to SC/ BC/economically weaker sections. Since all these measures would require increasing the revenue receipts, the CM reportedly asked the department to be ready with a detailed report by next week, when the next Cabinet is scheduled tentatively on September 29. Asset monetisation?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-looks-for-ways-to-raise-resources-314394
