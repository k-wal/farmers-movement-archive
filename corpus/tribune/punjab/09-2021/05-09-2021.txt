The Akalis neither deserve nor can expect farmers’ forgiveness. — Capt Amarinder Singh, CMThe Akalis’ apathy towards the farmers was evident from the fact that even now, instead of understanding and relating with the pain of the farmers, SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal was refusing to recognise the protesters as farmers and insulting them by alleging they owed allegiance to other political parties, including the Congress, said the CM.“If you (Sukhbir) cannot even recognise a farmer when you see one, how can you ever hope to gain their trust and confidence,” asked the Chief Minister, adding only a “true son of Punjab’s soil” could empathise with its people and their pain.Captain Amarinder termed Sukhbir’s announcement of suspension of SAD’s election outreach programme and formation of the panel to engage with farmers as a “desperate measure” to woo Punjab’s voters ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections.“But farmers and people of Punjab are not fools, and your attempts to fool them with lies will backfire on you,” he warned the SAD president. He claimed the state had rejected the Akalis, who had first “looted” them for 10 years in coalition with the BJP and then worked hand in glove with them to impose the farm laws on the farmers.AAP sees conspiracyThe AAP on Saturday accused the Badals and Akali Dal of conspiring against farmers at PM Narendra Modi’s behest so that President’s rule could be imposed in Punjab. AAP kisan wing state president Kultar Singh Sandhwan said Sukhbir should desist from defaming the SKM and accusing AAP workers of opposing SAD rallies.

The PSPCL accuses Faridkot MC of using ‘kundi’ connections to operate the lighting system of many streets, roads and residential localities in the town.PSPCL SDO Balwinder Singh said there were repeated reminders to the MC to pay the pending bills. “Even warnings to snap the power supply to these ‘kundi’ connections did not elicit any response,” he said.MC president Narinder Pal Singh said the delay in paying the bills was due to requirement of necessary permission from the local bodies department. “We are ready to pay the bills but snapping the supply to the streetlights is causing discomfort to residents,” he said.“Using a ‘kundi’ connection to get power supply is a criminal offence, which invites punishment for the offence of theft under the IPC, but the PSPCL restrained itself only to snapping the supply,” the SDO said.The PSPCL has already offered all government departments to settle their pending bills with 30-40 per cent ‘rebate’ in the bill amounts under ‘One Time Settlement Scheme’.The MC had recently spent a huge amount of funds on installing high mast light towers in the town, but there was no provision to provide power supply to these towers other than the ‘kundi’ connections.On the same lines, the Improvement Trust in Faridkot spent over Rs 50 lakh to install fountain with lights on a bridge on Rajasthan and Sirhind Feeder canals in the town recently, but there was no power supply to operate those and were lying defunct just after two weeks of installation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/faridkot-mc-defaults-on-paying-bill-pspcl-snaps-power-supply-306738

Once appointed, the number of High Court judges will go up to 49 against the sanctioned strength of 85, provided the process is completed before the retirement of sitting judges.Available information suggests the names of advocates Vikas Suri, Vinod Sharma Bhardwaj, Pankaj Jain and Jasjit Singh Bedi were cleared by the Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on September 1. The names were finalised and forwarded by the High Court collegium in August last year. These were further forwarded by the Centre to the Supreme Court as late as in April this year.Cleared at Sept 1 meetingThe process of appointing judges is lengthy and time consuming. Once cleared by the states and Governors, the file containing the names with Intelligence Bureau reports is placed before the Supreme Court when it meets. The names cleared for elevation are then sent to the Union Law Ministry before their warrants of appointment are signed by the President. The process can take several months, if not taken up on a priority basis. Already seven judges have retired this year and another judge is scheduled to retire in December. Another five judges are retiring next year.The problem of plenty continues to be a matter of concern for the High Court. The National Judicial Data Grid — the monitoring tool to identify, manage and reduce pendency of cases — indicates the pendency of 4,51,237 cases in the High Court. Of the total pendency cases in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, 1,68,028 are criminal matters, predominantly involving life and liberty.Otherwise, 77,282 or 17.13 per cent of the total pending cases are up to a year old; 11,4694 or 25.42 per cent are pending between one and three years; 86,130 or 19.09 per cent are pending between 10 and 20 years, and 9,905 or 2.2 per cases are awaiting adjudication for last 20 to 30 years.To make matters worse, the High Court is expected to witness an unmanageable flood of litigation once it reopens for normal “physical” operations. Available information suggests a substantial number of cases, filed but yet to be numbered, are lying in the High Court registry to be taken up upon the resumption of physical hearing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/supreme-court-collegium-recommends-four-names-for-elevation-as-hc-judges-306740

Even amid pandemic, it was thriving on the basis of trade with Afghanistan.In the present scenario, Afghanistan and Dubai are the major buyers of sewing machines but in Dubai, China is ruling, while in Afghanistan, the local industry is sending material.Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said Afghanistan was a bulk buyer of sewing machines and its parts as the Muslim community, who have expertise in embroidery, lives there and a sewing machine is their basic need.“The trade became stagnant in the past due to demonetisation and then the pandemic struck. We were sailing through tough times due to our trade with Afghanistan. But after the unrest in Afghanistan, the trade has come to a standstill and the production has come down drastically as there is hardly any demand in the market. Before Covid-19, 5 lakh sewing machines were exported monthly and now the figure has come down to just 1.5 lakh. The days ahead are going to be tough,” Sokhi said.Kulwant Singh, club general secretary, said at present no orders were being dispatched and everything was on standby. “We are only waiting for things to normalise. Of all the things exported to Afghanistan, sewing machines constitute a major part,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/afghan-crisis-hits-ludhiana-sewing-machine-industry-306744
