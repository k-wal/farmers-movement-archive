The trial Court, in all, convicted 22 accused.Justice Sangwan‚Äôs Bench was told that the appellant was not convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act in the present case, but only under Sections 420 and 120-B of the IPC and was sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 20,000.Narwana added the applicant/appellant was elected MLA in 2007. In case the judgment of conviction and order of sentence was not stayed, it would affect his political career as he was denied the party ticket in 2017 but wanted to contest the Punjab Assembly election in February 2022.After hearing counsel for the parties and going through the facts, Justice Sangwan observed that it was clear that the Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, CBI, Patiala, on a complaint given by the applicant-appellant faced departmental inquiry. As per the report, he was found guilty of the charge. A law officer in the department of Legal and Legislative Affairs Sushil Kumar, who acted as a mediator, also stood dismissed from service.Allowing the application, Justice Sangwan added that the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence would remain stayed during the pendency of the appeal and would not affect the civil rights of the applicant/appellant, who intended to contest the Punjab Assembly in February 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/4-years-after-additional-district-and-sessions-judge-was-suspended-hc-yet-to-pass-final-order-307891

Amid the pandemic, rural medical officers (RMOs) were on Covid duties but now that Covid cases have subsided in the state, RMOs have started returning to their places of posting. Now, the major problem faced by them is there is no supply of essential medicines.The trust that was built over the years between the rural population and doctors has been completely gone during the pandemic. Firstly, the residents accused the RMOs of leaving them alone amid Covid (RMOs were assigned Covid duties) and now, as per them, they have returned but they are not giving them medicines.‚ÄòHow can we treat patients sans medicines‚ÄôAs the Covid situation has improved, we are returning to rural dispensaries but it has not solved any purpose as we are without medicines. How can we treat patients in the absence of medicines? ‚ÄîDr JP Narula, state president, Rural Medical Services AssociationRural dispensaries are considered the first line of treatment for rural population.Dr JP Narula, state president of the Rural Medical Services Association, said rural dispensaries had not received medicines since the past one-and-a-half year. The main reason being given was that RMOs are on Covid duty and not at dispensaries.‚ÄúAs the Covid situation has improved, we are returning to the dispensaries but that has not solved any purpose as there are no medicines. How can we treat patients in the absence of medicines,‚Äù he said.Dr Narula said villagers had lost trust in them. ‚ÄúWhen Covid was on its peak, residents of villages asked us to meet them as they were reluctant to go to hospitals. Now, when they come to us, we are unable to give them medicines. The bridge that was built over the years seem to be crumbling,‚Äù he said.Another RMO working at Maachiwara said the department seems to have abandoned the dispensaries as it had 18 months since they received the medicines.‚ÄúHow can we give consultation without providing medicines to patients. People in rural areas completely depend on doctors,‚Äù he said.Bhajan Singh from Lopon village said the villagers were waiting for doctors to return.‚ÄúNow when the dispensaries have started opening, doctors are unable to give us medicines. What was the use of opening them. It is better to send the doctors back to the city on duty,‚Äù he said.Minister for Rural Development and Panchayats Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said rural dispensaries were being shifted to the Health Department and the problem would be resolved soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-rural-dispensaries-without-medicines-for-18-months-307659

They returned from the brick kiln where they were working as labourers and went off to sleep after taking dinner. In the morning, to our utter grief, we found them both dead.‚ÄùThe heartbroken father Bhinder Singh said: ‚ÄúI have lost my sons at the prime of their youth. I do not want any compensation. I just want that no other parent should bear such loss due to drugs. The government should take concrete steps to curb this menace.‚Äù The two deaths are not isolated cases in Mehraj village. Three months ago, 22-year-old kabaddi player, who lived near Bhinder‚Äôs family, died of overdose. More recently, another youth from the village was found lying unconscious with a needle injected in his arm. Another youth from Rampura was found dead due to overdose just two days ago.A senior nagar panchayat member, requesting anonymity, said nearly 30 to 40 per cent of the village youth were addicts, mostly hooked to heroin. ‚ÄúThe police inaction can be attributed to political patronage enjoyed by peddlers and their handlers,‚Äù he alleged.Villagers rued that Capt Amarinder Singh had done nothing to keep his pre-poll promise of ending the menace. ‚ÄúThe menace has only grown manifold at his ancestral village in the past four and a half years,‚Äù said a Mehraj resident.Members of the Naujwan Ekta Mehraj, a social service group, said: ‚ÄúThe population of our village is around 42,000 and it has 200 to 225 active peddlers. You can find used syringes and related material in secluded areas near the cremation ground, public toilets, grain market, etc.‚ÄùA senior member of the group said, ‚ÄúWe had been been actively working against the menace but some of our members started getting threats from peddlers and associates of gangsters. They boasted about their links with police officials and influential political leaders, and threatened us with dire consequences.‚Äù‚ÄúSince heroin is an expensive drug and not many can afford it, incidents of chain-snatching and stealing have gone up in the village,‚Äù said another member.SSP, Bathinda, Ajay Maluja did not respond to the numerous attempts made to contact him.Deputy Commissioner, Bathinda, B Srinivasan said: ‚ÄúEven though the police administration is taking the required steps to curb the drug menace, I will call a special meeting soon to review the situation and take a decision accordingly.‚Äù||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-punjab-chief-ministers-ancestral-village-mehraj-an-old-man-loses-2-sons-to-drug-menace-307749

They have been asked to file reply on December 1.The case was registered at the Sector 3 police station on the complaint of a woman constable. In her complaint, constable Manpreet Kaur claimed a large number of AAP workers had assembled in the ground of the MLA hostel and the 10 leaders led them towards the official residence of the Punjab Chief Minister. SP City Vineet Kumar and other senior police officers were present at a barricading outside the hostels. The AAP leaders were asked to stop as gatherings of over five persons were not barred in the city.She alleged the party workers led by the leaders started pushing policemen and tried to break through the barricading, prompting the police to use water cannons. They then allegedly pelted the police with stones, causing injuries to several cops, including her. The injured were taken to the General Hospital where their medical examination was conducted. ‚Äî TNSArrest warrant against SanjayLudhiana: The Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Harsimranjit Singh on Monday ordered issuance of arrest warrant against AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh as he failed to appear in a defamation case filed by SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia.

Pronouncing it the next day, the High Court granted interim anticipatory bail to the petitioner. The matter would now come up for hearing on October 7.Why no contempt action: Mohali courtAppearing for the State, special public prosecutor SS Narula contended that Saini had to appear before the investigating officer within seven days. Instead of joining the investigation, he preferred another application before the High Court. It came up for hearing on August 17. Realising that the court was not inclined to entertain the application, it was dismissed as withdrawn.Narula added that the Bench, during the course of hearing, categorically asked the counsel if the petitioner had joined the investigation pursuant to the order passed by the court. The petitioner chose to intentionally exhaust the seven-day period during which he was to join the investigation. It was only late in the evening on the seventh day after the Punjab Vigilance Bureau office in Sector 48, Mohali, had closed that the petitioner arrived at 8 pm on August 18.‚ÄúThe malicious object of the petitioner was only to create evidence of his having gone to join investigation, although he had no intention to join the investigation in letter and spirit,‚Äù Narula said.Appearing before Justice Avneesh Jhingan, he added that the petitioner had fulfilled the formality of coming to the police station and was throwing tantrums.Taking up the matter, Justice Jhingan asserted an application had been moved by the petitioner, too, pleading that he had joined the investigation.

07-09-2021||SS Chahal||Empower, incentivise farmers to curb farm fires||IN the process of producing more foodgrains, there has been corresponding and linear increase in biomass production in the country. Much of this biomass turns up as agricultural crop residue (CR) and is left to go waste, though agricultural organic residue is not waste but wealth. Some surveys estimate a higher quantity, but according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, on an average, more than 500 MT (million tonnes) of CR is generated every year ‚Äî from rice (122 MT), wheat (100 MT), maize (71 MT), millets (26 MT), sugarcane (141 MT), fibre crops (8 MT) and pulses (28 MT). Uttar Pradesh (60 MT), Punjab (51 MT) and Maharashtra (46 MT) are major CR-generating states. Out of 140 MT surplus CR, 92 MT (18%) is burnt, whereas the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that it is over 25% of the total CR which is burnt in India, most of which is in UP, Punjab, Maharashtra and Haryana. With machine harvesting, a large quantity of CR is left in the field, the clearing of which becomes a labour-intensive operation, needed to be completed within a short time frame between the harvesting of the ripened crop and the sowing of the next crop. The problem has become more severe after the promulgation of the Preservation of Subsoil Water Acts by Punjab and Haryana governments in 2009, prohibiting the transplanting of rice seedlings before June 10, squeezing the time period to about three weeks only to complete rice harvesting, managing a huge quantity of leftover straw in the field and the sowing of wheat.As estimated by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), about 57.7 MT of surplus CR is expected to be utilised under ex situ management options under various government policies. The Punjab Government‚Äôs policy on renewable sources of energy, formulated in 2012, was set to achieve a capacity target of 600 MW from biomass and 500 MW from cogeneration (both bagasse and non-bagasse) within 10 years. However, only seven power projects have been commissioned so far with far less use of paddy straw as well as power generation. The Haryana government‚Äôs bio-energy policy, brought out in 2018, planned to achieve a target of 150 MW biomass-based power generation within four years; it, too, is far away from achieving its target.Besides energy generation, there is a need to accelerate the implementation of other measures like in situ management, biochar making, composting, addressing limitations of assured market of the end products and reducing additional cost incurred on logistics and transportation of material to longer distances. The procedures for carrying out in situ CR management need special machinery and equipment which is normally beyond the capacity to procure as well as short of full utility for the farmers with small holdings. Despite hefty subsidies, the main concern of the farmers is investment on such machines that can be used only once during the season rather than the others required to be used round the year. Hence, the availability of this machinery and equipment through cooperatives, farmer producer companies, groups of farmers, village panchayats by subletting/renting at affordable rates, can be a game-changer to address the burning issue of CR management. The development of low-cost, affordable machinery is the need of the hour.In March 2018, the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs approved Rs 1,151.80 crore for the ‚Äòpromotion of agricultural mechanisation for in situ management of CR in states falling in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Rajasthan‚Äô to sensitise farmers with different variants of required farm machineries. However, during the same year, of the total paddy straw residue, about 17% in Haryana and 50% in Punjab was burnt, indicating low implementation of the scheme. Turbo happy seeder and harvester combine fitted with super straw management system are the primary machines for in situ management of paddy straw residue. As per studies, including one by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the available machines are not sufficient to manage the existing CR within the limited intervening time between paddy harvesting and the sowing of wheat.The interventions for successful management of CR and eliminating its burning are largely disintegrated. Under such a situation, reportedly even machinery worth Rs 650 crore could not douse farm fires in Punjab in 2019, according to a news report, and 76,626 machines given to Punjab by the Centre over three years have not produced the desired results. In the small-scale Indian farming system, the resource-poor farmers individually lack capacity and means; they should be supported in establishing an organised network, associations and community organisations for establishing services to manage CR. Offering services like collecting and transferring CR from the fields to the places of its utilisation as raw material and renting the machinery and equipment by government agencies should be centric to such arrangements operating at the doorstep of the framers. There should be an enabling system for efficient and effective CR collection, aggregation and viable models for the CR supply chain for the establishments involved in CR valorisation.The new law passed by Parliament in the recent monsoon session says that the Commission on Air Quality Management ‚Äúmay impose and collect environmental compensation from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning.‚Äù However, penalising CR burning is an erroneous application of the ‚Äòpolluter pays‚Äô notion because this pollution is not the outcome of any industrial or business venture. It‚Äôs better to dispense with it, considering the complexities of the problems and compulsions of the farmers who go for it. It is important to extend a helping hand and run awareness campaigns for technical and economical empowerment of people involved in farming activities.More importantly, CR management must not be viewed as an issue under the domain of the agriculture sector only but related to other sectors as well, hence requiring integrated approaches for devising and implementing practical solutions. Considering crop residue as a commodity and a useful asset, instead of waste, will result in its successful and beneficial management. However, due to its large volume, the capacities to manage it need to be scaled up.The author is ex-VC, Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology, UdaipurSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/empower-incentivise-farmers-to-curb-farm-fires-307378
07-09-2021||Navdeep Suri||The Jallianwala Bagh makeover||It is grotesque, this thoughtless desecration of one of the most poignant memorials of our Independence struggle ‚Äî the anger being expressed on social media and by some of the leading Indian and international historians who have worked on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre is legitimate and I‚Äôve been straining to join the fray. But first, I wanted to see it for myself.Jallianwala Bagh: Kin of 1919 martyrs hold candle march, want original character restoredAlso read:Jallianwala Bagh: History massacred or restored?Jallianwala Bagh: Facelift has erased massacre memories, say historians‚ÄòInsult to martyrs‚Äô, Rahul Gandhi slams govt‚Äôs Jallianwala Bagh memorial revampLooks nice: Punjab CM contradicts Rahul Gandhi on Jallianwala remakeI went to the Bagh and here‚Äôs the good news first. The undulating, landscaped lawns look lovely; there are a lot of young people taking pictures and selfies, most of them in a cheerful, out-for-a-picnic kind of mood. The museum and galleries are kind of interesting to the extent that they provide easy-to-digest information for the uninitiated tourist. I haven‚Äôt seen the light-and-sound show and can‚Äôt comment on the basis of personal experience. But educated citizens of Amritsar who have seen it are near-unanimous in decrying its tackiness. Overall, the place has a happy feel to it ‚Äî if that‚Äôs how you want to feel at the site of the most egregious massacre committed by the British Raj in India.For me, the visit to the newly beautified environs of the memorial and to search for traces of the place we knew was a gut-wrenching experience.I was born in Gali Punjab Singh, a short distance from the Bagh. As a kid, I remember going to the Bagh whenever we had relatives visiting Amritsar for the customary pilgrimage to the Golden Temple. We would make our way through the nondescript wrought iron gate and down the narrow passage which dramatically opened into a mostly barren maidan. The pink sandstone memorial stood in front and a footpath took us to that red-brick wall, unplastered and pockmarked with bullet holes from the Vaisakhi day massacre. My mother would show the visitors around, making it a point to take a detour to the left and stop near the ancient martyrs‚Äô well as she painted a vivid image of helpless men jumping into its bottomless depths, some to escape the hail of bullets and others after they had been shot. Peering over the ledge into the darkness below, I would try to see if the water was still tinged red with all the blood. There were times when I thought I could hear the screams of the victims echo dimly as I stood transfixed by the darkness.That infamous well, alas, has been enclosed in a brick-and-glass wall. Peer through the glass and you see the nicely backlit interior of the well, its walls painted an alluring pink. It makes a great spot for selfies, as we saw one couple after another make a beeline for the backdrop. With the song ‚ÄòPagdi Sambhaal Jatta‚Äô streaming from the outdoor speakers, it also provides a somewhat curious ambience for video enthusiasts.But there is a more important reason for my anguish. My grandfather Nanak Singh was one of the fortunate survivors of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. In the stories we often heard from our grandmother, he had gone to the rally to protest against the Rowlatt Act with two of his friends. Both friends fell victim to Brig Gen Dyer‚Äôs bullets, while my grandfather was knocked unconscious in the stampede and left for dead. He paints an intense picture of that ghastly afternoon of April 13, 1919 in ‚ÄòKhooni Vaisakhi‚Äô, a ballad that was first published in May 1920 and banned soon thereafter by the Raj.This was a 22-year-old youth who had no formal education beyond fourth grade in school. And yet, he had the sensibility to recognise that the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh must be remembered for posterity. In his opening verses that are an invocation to Guru Gobind Singh, Nanak Singh writes:To pen a portrait of those departed onesGrant me the strength, my Divine Guru.To remind my people across IndiaLest we forget their sacrifice, my Divine Guru.Do help me complete this mission of mineNanak Singh beseeches, O my Divine Guru.I will fall back on his words to give us a description of the Bagh and the mood of Amritsar city as he saw it a century ago.That narrow lane to enter the BaghSealed off on Dyer‚Äôs command, my friends.No exit, no escape, no way out was leftMaking Bagh a deathly trap, my friends.A fortunate few somehow survived,While most died then and there, my friends.Some ran with bullets ripping their chestStumbling to their painful end, my friends.Others caught the bullet while running awayDropping lifeless in awkward heaps, my friends.That narrowness of the passage, that absence of an exit were critical factors in making the Bagh a death trap for Dyer‚Äôs savagery. There is enough historical research to suggest that Dyer chose the Bagh for this very reason, to inflict maximum casualties, to teach a lesson and to instil fear. Going through that dingy passage was enough to put you in a sombre frame as you silently made your way towards the memorial.After the renovation, the passage is brightly lit and lined with murals depicting an improbably cheerful set of persons making their way into the Bagh. The visitor‚Äôs mood is influenced by the martial beats of ‚ÄòAye Watan, Aye Watan, Hum Ko Teri Kasam‚Ä¶‚Äô as she goes through the passage. And yes, the murals are also great for selfies. Sombre reflection be damned.We could argue over the interpretation of the murals. One explanation is that they portray ordinary people coming to celebrate Vaisakhi at the Bagh that fateful day. But the facts are different. Amritsar was already under tight restrictions following the police firing near the railway bridge on April 10. As Nanak Singh tells us, the people of Amritsar came to the Bagh in defiance of martial law, not to celebrate Vaisakhi.As the clock struck five on thirteenth AprilThey all gather in the Bagh, my friends.Seeking justice fair and honour, they standSikhs, Hindus, Muslims together, my friends.They went to speak, to share their griefPlace lives at stake without fear, my friends.With their own blood they wanted to bloomThe parched soil of the Bagh, my friends.Let me make one final point about the renovation. As we dragged our despondent feet back towards the passage to leave the Bagh, we were told off by the security guard. The passage was only meant for entering the Bagh. Hadn‚Äôt we seen the sign for an exit lane on the other side? An exit? Sure, what‚Äôs wrong with that, you may ask. Except for the inconvenient fact that there wasn‚Äôt an exit from the Bagh. And now there is. That‚Äôs how we treat history. And memory.Nanak Singh, perhaps, was prescient when he employed a dose of sarcasm to echo the voices of our martyrs:Make time to visit this Bagh of oursEchoes tales of gallant souls, O friends.With heavy heart, they mock our nationThanks so much for your love, O friends.Look closely at our bodies sievedA thousand wounds you‚Äôll see, O friends.You stayed at home, reveling in your lifeAnd exiled us from your hearts, O friends.How could you promise, and forget?What a way to honour your words, O friends.Unfortunately, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done to the Bagh. Somewhere in our technology-driven vision of modernity, we forgot that this was about preserving the soul of a place that we have held sacred. The scepticism of my grandfather has been justified. And it hurts.It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. I had made several visits to Jallianwala Bagh while working on the English translation of ‚ÄòKhooni Vaisakhi‚Äô and always came away with a profound sense of disappointment over the way we abuse our heritage. The dusty bookcases, the plaster peeling in the visitors‚Äô centre, the stinking toilets and the general air of apathy and neglect was all too visible. The need for a makeover was palpable and we were promised that it would be in place to mark the centenary of the massacre in April 2019.The Jallianwala Bagh Trust had shared its extensive research on the period with the Ministry of Culture. Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar has strong departments of history and architecture to provide the requisite intellectual and technical backup for a project of this nature. But the task was assigned to Vama Communications of Ahmedabad, working in tandem with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the NBCC (India) Limited (formerly National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited), and the results are there to see.It reflects both a missed opportunity and a deficit of imagination. Over the course of conversations with friends in Amritsar, I heard several suggestions that showed both ambition and vision. A senior professor at the university said that he had proposed making the Bagh a designated place for peaceful protests, like Jantar Mantar in Delhi. That might have been a balm for the martyrs who were asserting their right to assembly. Another friend, an eminent writer, suggested that the Bagh could become a place that embodies free speech, a bit of the Hyde Park Speakers‚Äô Corner in Amritsar. That would consecrate the fact that the martyrs were protesting against the curtailment of civil liberties codified in the Rowlatt Act.Or maybe that‚Äôs too idealistic. A bit like the martyrs who died for their country.‚Äî The writer is a former diplomat.
