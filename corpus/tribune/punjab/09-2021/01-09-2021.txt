A case was registered by Punjab Police on the same day, which was later taken over by the NIA on January 26, 2021.“The investigation in the case revealed that the charge sheeted accused were part of the conspiracy hatched by Pakistan based leadership of the proscribed terrorist outfit KLF for assassinating comrade Balwinder Singh, who was awarded Shaurya Chakra for his brave fight against terrorists at the peak of militancy in Punjab,” the NIA said.“KLF chief Lakhvir Singh Rode and his Canada based deputy Sunny Toronto had tasked Sukhmeet Pal Singh, a gangster-turned-terrorist to arrange shooters and execute the plan. Sukhmeet had instructed Sukhdeep Singh and Gurjit Singh to undertake the killing of Comrade Balwinder Singh. Inderjit Singh was involved in the reconnaissance of the target,” the NIA said.After investigation, NIA had filed a charge sheet against the above eight accused persons for their roles in the conspiracy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/charges-framed-against-8-klf-terrorists-in-balwinder-singh-sandhu-killing-case-nia-305113
01-09-2021||New Delhi||Jallianwala Bagh complex restored with utmost respect: Culture Ministry||Amid allegations the government was “glamourising” the Jallianwala Bagh complex, the Culture Ministry Wednesday said it has been “restored” by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the agency that has restored World Heritage sites in the country, to conserve it for posterity.It also said a “poignant” soundtrack has been chosen as part of the sound and light show describing the event on the day of the massacre.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated four new galleries and opened the renovated memorial virtually, a year-and-a-half after it was closed for the revamp.The well into which the people jumped when forces led by Reginald Dyer opened fire on them has been covered with a transparent barrier. The narrow entrance has been adorned with sculptures. A daily sound and light show explaining the events has been started.Ministry of Culture Secretary Raghvendra Singh argued the complex was in dire need of conservation.“It has been restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) which is the agency that restored World Heritage sites in the country. Instead of letting a derelict structure to fall, we have restored it to conserve it for posterity,” he told PTI, but refused to comment on the political storm brewing over the restoration.On the criticism over the light and sound show, Singh said that the show existed but it became defunct over time.“The soundtrack is so poignant. It has been very sensitively done and is informative as well. Anyone coming to this place will leave better informed. The galleries too have been improved, technology has been improved to bring out the poignancy of the killings of innocents and how the incident influenced other bravehearts,” said Singh.He said the work has been done with “utmost respect”.Slamming the revamp, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said only a person who does not know the “meaning of martyrdom can inflict such an insult on the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh”.“I am the son of a martyr — I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost…We are against this indecent cruelty,” he had earlier this week.Some historians have also criticised the work terming it an “insult towards the martyrs”.“This is corporatisation of monuments, where they end up as modern structures, losing the heritage value. Look after them without meddling with the flavours of the period these memorials represent,” tweeted historian S Irfan Habib.Officials, however, say that these allegations are “untrue”. They said the accusation that the bullet marks have even “hidden” was false. The bullet marks have been conserved, they said.They said the earlier structure was “filthy” with defunct fountains which have now been restored, cleaned and a lily pond installed. The entire area has been landscaped, officials said, making the place visually appealing.Officials involved in the process said the well was covered with rubbish, now it has been restored and even lit from inside.In terms of tourist footfall too, the restoration will bring rich dividends for the city, officials said.Near to the Golden Temple, the renovated complex is expected to draw in tourists with its moesha halls, laser show and galleries, the ministry hopes.The Golden Temple received a footfall of around one lakh per day during the week and 1.5 lakh during weekends and special day before the coronavirus crisis forced its closure.Over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds wounded on April 13, 1919 when British troops fired indiscriminately on an unarmed gathering of thousands who had assembled in Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab amid nationwide protests against the Rowlatt Act which had extended wartime repressive measures.

It has been incubated at IIT Ropar, which is a designated iHub -- AWaDH (Agriculture and Water Technology Development Hub) by the Department of Science and Technology.The technology works through the air-purifying natural leafy plants including Peace Lily, Snake Plant and Spider plants. The room air interacts with leaves and goes to the soil-root zone where maximum pollutants are purified.The developers claimed that ‘Ubreathe Life’ improves indoor air quality by removing particulate, gaseous and biological contaminants while increasing the oxygen levels in the indoor space through specific plants, UV disinfection and a stack of pre-filter, charcoal filter and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter fitted in a specially designed wooden box.There is a centrifugal fan that creates a suction pressure inside the purifier, and releases purified air, formed at the roots, through the outlet in a 360 degree direction.They said the indoor air spaces are five times more polluted than outdoor air space. That is a cause of concern especially in the present Covid pandemic times. A research, which has recently been published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), calls upon the governments to alter building designs by fixing air changes per hour (a measure of room ventilation with outdoor air). The ‘Ubreathe Life’ can be a solution to this concern, claimed the scientists.IIT Ropar director Prof Rajeev Ahuja claimed that the results of testing, conducted by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories and the Laboratory of IIT Ropar maintained that the AQI (Air Quality Index) for a room size of 150 sq ft dropped from 311 to 39 in 15 minutes after using ‘Ubreathe Life’.Sanjay Maurya, CEO, Ubreathe, said the consumer need not water the plant regularly as there is a built-in water reservoir with a capacity of 150ml which acts as a buffer for plant requirements. He says that the device supplies water to the roots whenever it gets too dry.Prof Ahuja assured that IIT is capable of producing the product in large quantity to market it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/iit-ropar-develops-plant-based-air-purifier-machine-305084

01-09-2021||---||Harish Rawat apologises for comparing PPCC working presidents with Panj Pyare||Chandigarh, September 1A day after comparing the working presidents of the PPCC with Panj Pyare, Punjab Affairs incharge Harish Rawat has apologised.Rawat said he had no intention to hurt the Sikh sentiments and it was wrong on his part to compare the working presidents with Panj Pyare.He said he held the Panj Pyare in high esteem and had worked for the betterment of the places related to Sikhism in Uttarakhand.He said that during his tenure as chief minister of Uttarakhand, he was instrumental in providing a road link between Nanakmata Sahib and Ritha Sahib gurdwaras, besides providing a smooth and safe journey for those visiting Hemkunt Sahib.In Sikh tradition, ‘Panj Pyare’ is the term used for five beloved of the Guru. In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh, the last of the ten Gurus, initiated five men into the order of ‘Khalsa’ (pure).‘Panj Pyare’ is the name given to five baptised Sikhs who perform a baptism ceremony to initiate Sikhs into the order of the ‘Khalsa’.On his Facebook page on Wednesday, Rawat acknowledged his “mistake” for his ‘Panj Pyare’ remark.“Sometimes by expressing respect, you use such words which are objectionable. I too have made a mistake of using the word ‘Panj Pyare’ for my honourable president and four working presidents,” wrote Rawat.He said he was a student of the country’s history and the leading position of ‘Panj Pyare’ could not be compared with any other.“I have committed a mistake. I apologise for hurting the sentiments of people,” he said.Rawat, who is party’s Punjab affairs in-charge, said he will clean a gurdwara in his state with a broom as atonement.He said that he always had a sense of dedication and respect to Sikh religion and its great traditions.The Shiromani Akali Dal had taken exception to Rawat’s remarks and had sought an apology for the same.SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema had slammed Rawat for his remark and had demanded that the state government should book him for hurting sentiments.

01-09-2021||Sanjiv Bakshi & Deepkamal Kaur||No ponytails while in uniform, tie a bun: Hoshiarpur SSP Amneet Kondal to women cops||Tribune news serviceHoshiarpur, August 31Perhaps with an intention to bring in more professionalism and discipline in the women cops of the district, SSP Amneet Kondal, who recently got posted here, has issued orders asking them not to opt for varied hairstyles and instead maintain a bun with a mesh on it.The IPS officer has directed the women police personnel to follow a uniform code in letter and in spirit. The women employees have been directed in this regard by issuing an official order issued by the district police chief’s office (vide order No. 57438 dated August 28).The order reads, “The women police personnel of the district are not wearing uniforms as per the pattern and along with the uniform. They have different types of hairstyles, which do not look good. So everyone is instructed to wear the uniform according to the prescribed pattern and not to make different hairstyles. Tie a hair bun and wear mesh on it. Ensure strict compliance of the orders.” The last line of the order reads that if any woman cop violates these instructions, departmental action could be initiated against her.”Even as her orders are being seen with both criticism and appreciation, Kondal maintains, “My orders are only for the time when these women are in uniform and on police duty. While in uniform, we have to maintain a particular look as per the prescribed norms. We cannot be adopting different hairstyles. We have got this training in the National Police Academy, Hyderabad, as well as the Punjab Police Academy, Phillaur.”She says once the women cops are off duty, they can don any civil dress as per their choice and may even let their hair loose, do a ponytail or take to any kind of hairstyle. “On duty, a uniform style and pattern has to be maintained. This is a basic norm but I fail to understand the hype being created over the order,” she seemed a bit upset over the media reports about her orders today.Kondal added, “So far, no woman cop has come to me about her reservations about my order. Even if they come to me for any discussion about it, I am open to it. Interestingly, today every policewoman whom I saw was donning a neat bun.”An SP-rank officer in the district too seemed happy with the order. “We used to notice young women constables often doing ponytails. We were finding it odd telling them to tie a proper bun. It is good that the new SSP has formally issued the instructions.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-ponytails-while-in-uniform-tie-a-bun-hoshiarpur-ssp-amneet-kondal-to-women-cops-304964

The accused have been identified as Charanpreet Singh Dalli, a resident of Bhogpur, Amit Talwad, a resident of Radio Colony, and Manoj Kumar Madhukar, a resident of Zirakpur.They had reportedly taken Rs 2.24 crore from the complainants — Rashpal Singh Sachdeva, a resident of Guru Gobind Singh Nagar, his partner Jaswinder Singh, resident of Leeview Green Apartment, Mithapur Road, and Mehakpreet Singh, a resident of Green Model Town — in return for refundable investment and sale of stake in the company, but they used it for their personal use.The investigation of the matter was allegedly first suppressed by the Commissionerate Police. As the case was reported to higher officials in Chandigarh, a case under Sections 406, 420 and 120-B, IPC, has been registered against them.The complainants have also blamed the local police for not taking appropriate action against the culprits for the past two years.“The accused filed false complaints against us through their partners to put pressure on us for not filing a case against them. They are deliberately pressurising us not to make any complaints against them and the police are also not acting on our complaints.“It is, therefore, requested to transfer the case and take appropriate action against the accused. We also want the case to be probed by some other higher authorities other than the Jalandhar (city) police,” said Rashpal Singh Sachdeva, in his appeal to the state police department.The complainants alleged that despite making complaints against the accused, the police were not taking any action against them. Rather they were favouring them in the enquiries and had been pressurising us to withdraw the complaints. They also threatened to implicate us in false criminal cases,” added the complainants.Business deal goes sour?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/adcps-son-among-3-booked-for-fraud-in-jalandhar-304960
01-09-2021||---||Karnal lathicharge: Farmers to head for Delhi in hordes||Amritsar, August 31In an apparent reaction to the recent incident of lathicharge on farmers in Haryana, the farmers’ associations have now announced to increase the participation of farmers in the ongoing protest at the Delhi borders.Taking the lead, Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC) has announced to send two large groups to the Delhi border on September 5 and September 15.KSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said: “During the last few days, we have held meetings in around 300 villages of the district to mobilise farmers for the Delhi protest. We will be covering the remaining villages in the next few days.”He said Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar and other BJP leaders were making politically motivated statements by holding Punjab farmers responsible for the protests in Haryana.“Haryana CM is accusing the Punjab Government and the Punjab Government is blaming the Haryana Government. This all is politics aimed at diverting the public attention from the main issue,” he said. He said duties have been assigned to village units of the committee to prepare the roster of farmers, who would be joining the protest. Pandher said the government was trying to frighten farmers with violence. He said the state-level protest in Punjab would be initiated from September 28.Pandher said the Punjab Government claims that all arrangements for the procurement of paddy crop have been made and farmers would not have to face any problem. “We want Capt Amarinder Singh to clarify whether he has accepted the conditions laid down by the Centre for procurement, especially regarding ‘fard’ or not,” he said, adding that other stricter conditions, too, were against farmers and would pose problem at the time of procurement.The KSC leaders said lowering the permissible limit for moisture, discoloration and broken grains were too harsh a condition and impossible to achieve. “The government by putting in tough conditions for procurement is trying to run away from procurement and is leaving the market open for private players,” he said.AAP burns effigies of PM modi & Haryana CMAmritsar: Members of Aam Aadmi Party burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday to protest against the lathicharge of peacefully protesting farmers at Karnal. AAP city president Jeevan Jot Kaur said citizens have the right to protest peacefully and the Haryana Government’s action is clear violation of the rights of citizens. She said Haryana CM and Prime Minister are directly responsible for the violence on fathers, after which a farmer had succumbed to his injuries and died. Lok Sabha constituency in-charge Iqbal Singh Bhullar said the government’s attitude was dictatorial and it was using unfair means to muzzle the voices of dissent. He said AAP supports farmers’ cause and would stand with them in every situation. He said action should be taken against officials who tried to please their political bosses by unleashing violence on farmers, so that such incidents do not arise in future. Party workers gathered outside the Hall Gate also and raised slogans against the Centre and demanded that three agriculture laws be repealed. Party leaders also demanded that the SDM and police officials responsible for the violence on farmers should be dismissed and strict action should be initiated against them. District general secretary Prabhbir Singh Brar, Amritsar Rural president Harwant Singh Umranangal, Seema Sodhi, state joint secretary Ashok Talwar and others also addressed the protesters.Protest held in Tarn Taran tooHundreds of Aam Admi Party volunteers (pic below) lodged their strong protest against the brutal cane-charging on farmers by the Haryana Police. The protesting AAP volunteers burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar. Party’s district president Gurwinder Singh Baharwal led the protesters, while leaders of the party from different parts of the district addressed on the occasion. The leaders condemned the Union Government for not resolving farmers’ issue. The leaders called the police and the Haryana Government a dictatorial act and demanded apology from CM Khattar and adequate compensation to the families of the deceased families.

But the deceptive exercise does not correspond with the expectations of the people of Punjab, rather it sounds like a sham,” Bir Devinder Singh said in a release issued here.The government may use the session for the remembrance of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji on his 400th birth anniversary, “but why scuttle the legitimate deliberation on other important issues expected to be discussed in the House”, questioned the former Deputy Speaker.“The one-day session of the Punjab Assembly must be extended in deference to the expectations of the people and also as demanded by the collective opposition, including the PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/extend-punjab-assembly-session-bir-devinder-singh-304900

They are being forced to shift to the new site. We will also get in touch with the Hindu Mahasabha over the issue,” said Joshi.Joshi said they had raised a number of issues with the Municipal Corporation in a previously sent legal notice, including that there was only minor development at the new site and high tension wires crossed the area.“At the same time, part of the land belongs to a graveyard. This information came to light at the time of the allotment of plots,” said Joshi. “It is really baffling as the MC had been carrying out the works for the dairy shifting project since years.”Joshi said they had written to the Akal Takht seeking its intervention as religious activities of Sikhs could not be carried out on such land.MC Commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur said: “The land for the project was identified over 15 years ago.”The matter is being raised after a court order has already been delivered in relation to the shifting. The issue was not raised in the legal notice as well, she said.‘Protect our rights’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/shifting-of-dairies-patiala-farmers-approach-akal-takht-304880

Does Punjab pay interest on delayed payment? — ML Khattar, Haryana CMDirect transfer, no need for interestFarmers in Punjab are getting their payment directly into their accounts within 72 hours, eliminating the need to pay interest. — Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab CMTerming the lathicharge on farmers by the Haryana Police “unacceptable”, the CM said: “Khattar is trying to avoid the core issue of the central farm laws.” Instead of apologising for the “unprovoked” attack, Khattar had been defending the police action and had even tried to vindicate the Karnal SDM’s instructions to the police, which the world had seen and condemned, said the CM. Rebutting assertions that the Haryana Government had done more for farmers than Punjab, Capt Amarinder asked Khattar “if that is the case, then why are your state’s farmers angry with you and your BJP?”Far from ensuring farmers’ welfare, Capt Amarinder said the Khattar government had done more harm, countering claims with a list of pro-farmer initiatives taken by his government despite the “fiscal mess” he inherited from the BJP-SAD government in 2017.“Your party left us without money even to pay our employees, and yet, we have successfully waived Rs 4,624.38 crore debt of 5,64,143 small and marginal farmers to date, with another Rs 590 crore sanctioned for loan waiver of 2.85 lakh landless farmers and labourers,” he said.Pointing out that Haryana did not give a single paisa to its farmers in power subsidy, the CM said in Punjab, power subsidy of Rs 7,200 crore was being provided every year for agriculture pump-sets. Ridiculing Khattar’s assertion that his government was paying 12% interest against delay in payment, Capt Amarinder said in contrast, farmers in Punjab were getting their payment directly into their accounts within 72 hours, eliminating the need to pay interest.“It is your government’s shoddy management and apathetic attitude that delays payment in the first place,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/karnal-lathicharge-punjab-cm-refutes-khattars-farm-welfare-claim-304698

In the past, we faced the force and are ready to stand up for our rights now also. Sticks cannot scare us away,” says he.Nirmal, whose both hands and arms were chopped off in 1982 after they got stuck in a fodder preparation machine, believes the lathicharge incident will motivate more farmers to reach Delhi borders.Kuldeep Singh (63), the younger brother of Nirmal, says they are three brothers and own six acres of land. He has been with Nirmal since he joined the Tikri stir last year and helps him perform daily chores. “We are already under debt and the central farm laws will only add to our problems,” says he.Avtar Singh, another farmer, says the strong determination of Nirmal and his brother is a big motivation for all. “Whenever we feel demoralised due the long agitation, Nirmal Singh shares his tales of earlier agitations and how he fought for the famers’ rights to bring our focus back on the larger goal,” stresses Avtar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/canecharge-will-only-unite-us-tikri-protester-304700

This has evoked sharp reactions not just from tourists but also from experts and research scholars of international repute.Also read:‘Insult to martyrs’, Rahul Gandhi slams govt’s Jallianwala Bagh memorial revampLooks nice: Punjab CM contradicts Rahul GAndhi on Jallianwala remakeBritish historian Kim A Wagner, who has penned the book ‘Jallianwala Bagh: An Empire of Fear and the Making of A Massacre’, tweeted: “Devastated to hear that Jallianwala Bagh, site of the Amritsar massacre of 1919, has been revamped, which means that the last traces of the event have effectively been erased. This is what I wrote of the memorial in my book, describing a space that has now itself become history.” He even tweeted a pair of old and new pictures of the narrow street, from where the British Indian troops led by General Dyer had gained access to the Bagh on April 13, 1919. ‘Beautification, not conservation’Historian Irfan Habib and conservationist Gurmeet Rai defined the recent works in the Bagh as beautification and not conservation or restoration. Netizens are also voicing their concerns over the “modernisation” of the historic Bagh.Endorsing her view, MP from UK Preet Kaur Gill tweeted, “Our history being erased! Why?” Noted historian Irfan Habib and conservationist Gurmeet Rai also defined the recent works in the Bagh as beautification and not conservation or restoration. Netizens are also voicing their concerns over the “modernisation” of the historic Bagh.Sunil Kapoor, whose great-grandfather Vasu Mal Kapoor was killed in the Bagh, expressed his astonishment at repeated beautification drives involving crores of rupees. Pointing at the well, he said its façade has been redone with small bricks. Its erstwhile crown-like structure was built with the donation collected from the families of martyrs, he said, adding that he had heard from his grandmother that the martyrs’ families had themselves contributed Re 1 and Rs 2, as per one’s financial capacity, to construct its exterior.He demanded that the antiquity of the historic place be maintained and money should be spent for the betterment of the families of martyrs. Photographs of five martyrs, including that of his grandfather, used to be displayed in the martyrs’ gallery, but these were no longer there, he said.Kamal Poddar, whose 34-year old grandfather Lakshmi Chand was killed in the massacre, said the present government had a lot of resources and was lavishly spending on enhancing its beauty. “But when it comes to giving anything to the family members of the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh, it has nothing to offer, except felicitations.”A visitor from Lucknow, Lajwanti, whose grandparents had migrated from Sindh during the Partition, said she was surprised to see a beautified park. “It is entirely different from the one I had seen during my previous visit in 1973. That park was more earthy and simple. The present oneis swanky,” she said.Another tourist Neha Dariyani said the beautified park gave the impression of one being in a garden with aesthetic environment where costly stones have been used on pedestrian paths and walls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jallianwala-bagh-facelift-has-erased-massacre-memories-say-historians-304701
01-09-2021||Saurabh Malik||Sumedh Saini case: Cops toe line of politicians in power, says HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 31The Punjab and Haryana High Court today asserted it was aware of the fact that police officers had to toe the line of politicians in power. It was also conscious of the fact the police officials suffered if they did follow the dictates and ran the risk of being victimised when the rival politicians came to power.The assertion came as Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi ruled reference for initiation of contempt of court proceedings was not required to be made against investigating officer in “Saini case” Harvinder Pal Singh.“The majesty of this court is preserved and upheld not by initiation of contempt proceedings, but by the manner in which it protects fundamental rights of the citizens and extends equal protection of laws and equality before law and justice to all who approach this court and that is with what I would like this matter of initiation of contempt proceedings to end,” Justice Tyagi asserted.The Bench, during the hearing of a habeas corpus petition filed for release of Punjab’s former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, had taken exception to an email received on the HC’s official ID purportedly sent by Harvinder Pal Singh.Addressed to the Chief Justice, it was regarding transfer of Saini cases from the Bench to any other coordinate Bench on account of undue hurry being shown.Justice Tyagi had asserted the court reserved the right to take appropriate action regarding the email casting aspersion about hurry in hearing of the matter without realising that any habeas corpus petition raised serious issue of unlawful detention requiring to be heard on an urgent basis. As the issue came up for resumed hearing, Justice Tyagi asserted the email appeared to have been sent by an over-energetic police officer. But the same could not be a matter of his own choice and he appeared to have been ill-advised regarding the same by someone from behind the scene.“I am not only conscious of the harsh reality that the police officers work under tremendous pressure and even risk their lives in their fight against crime, but also aware of the fact that unfortunately one feature of our polity is that the police officers have to toe the line of politicians in power being under double-edged sword where they suffer if they do not abide by the dictates and also run the risk of being victimised later on when rival politicians come to power,” Justice Tyagi added. The court dismissed as withdrawn Saini’s plea for advancing the date of hearing his case fixed for September 9.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sumedh-saini-case-cops-toe-line-of-politicians-in-power-says-hc-304702
01-09-2021||---||FCI gets court rap for ‘illegal, unjust’ denial of paddy to mill||Chandigarh, August 31The Punjab and Haryana High Court has rapped the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for “illegal, arbitrary, unjust, irrational and capricious” action after holding that a mill could not have been debarred from allotment of paddy for milling.The caseThe respondent-mill, vide letter dated September 30, 2020, issued by the Amritsar FCI Divisional Manager, was directed not to be allotted paddy on the grounds that its name appeared in a CBI report regarding misappropriation of foodgrain stock.The Bench of Justices Augustine George Masih and Ashok Kumar Verma also admonished the FCI for acting in “sheer violation of the principles of natural justice” after observing that the mill was condemned unheard.The Bench was told that the respondent-mill was established in 1970 and had milling capacity of 3.5 tonne. It was allotted paddy for milling every year for the past two decades. The respondent-mill, vide letter dated September 30, 2020, issued by the Amritsar FCI Divisional Manager, was “surprisingly” directed not to be allotted paddy for milling on the ground that its name appeared in a CBI report regarding misappropriation of foodgrain stock dispatched from FCI godowns in Punjab to Jammu and Kashmir. The respondent-mill refuted the allegations.After hearing rival contentions, the Bench asserted it found nothing on record to show at the current stage that the respondent-mill was involved in the CBI case and it could not be debarred from allotment of paddy in the absence of cogent and convincing evidence and any incriminating material.The Bench added the FCI also acted in utter violation of its own policy. A clause in the Punjab Custom Milling Policy for Kharif 2020-21 clearly stipulated that all orders under any of its provisions would be passed after the miller had been given a written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity of personal hearing before proceeding against him.In the present case, the FCI straightaway passed a punitive order dated September 30, 2020, stopping the respondent-mill from allotment of paddy for government milling without any show-cause notice and an opportunity of personal hearing||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fci-gets-court-rap-for-illegal-unjust-denial-of-paddy-to-mill-304703

He is seeking a ticket for himself from Maur and for his son Gurpreet Singh Maluka from Rampura Phul. However, the party has announced Maluka as candidate from Rampura Phul. The core committee members reportedly avoided a discussion on the issue. A party spokesperson said the committee primarily discussed the farmers’ agitation and “appreciated the categorical statements of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders against attempts by disruptive elements to sabotage peaceful activity of farmer-friendly political parties and weaken the cause of the farmers”.The committee members felt “mischievous elements are working towards imposing President’s rule in Punjab and inflicting an unrepresentative, anti-Punjab and anti-farmer establishment on people”. The party stated it would continue to stand by any programme announced by the farm unions to get the three central laws repealed. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sikander-singh-maluka-skips-sad-panel-meeting-amid-ticket-row-304704

While there were those who felt Indian soldiers’ “significant contribution” had been ignored, there were others who felt there wasn’t much to show in the first place. British historian Ghee Bowman’s book seeks to set the record straight and he says most of these soldiers were from United Punjab.To be released todayTo be released in India on September 1, ‘The Indian Contingent: The Forgotten Muslim Soldiers of Dunkirk’, published by Pan Macmillan, puts the spotlight on the Indian soldiers at the World War-II evacuation site in May 1940. Fighting for the British, there were around 600 Indians at Dunkirk in two companies — 25th Animal Transport Company and 32nd Animal Transport Company.To be released in India on September 1, ‘The Indian Contingent: The Forgotten Muslim Soldiers of Dunkirk’, published by Pan Macmillan, puts the spotlight on the Indian soldiers at the World War II evacuation site in May 1940. Fighting for the British, there were around 600 Indians at Dunkirk in two companies — 25th Animal Transport Company and 32nd Animal Transport Company. They were part of a wider group known as Force K6, which was initially 1,723 strong, and eventually included over 4,000 men. Bowman says: “About 97 per cent of the men were Muslims and a chunk of them came from Northern Punjab, Jhelum and Rawalpindi to be precise. Some were from NWFP and Kashmir and some from other parts of India. Most of them would have become citizens of Pakistan in 1947.”Bowman says the British army had no animal transport in 1939. When they sent the British Expeditionary Force to France in autumn that year, they relied on rail transport and lorries to transport the massive amount of food, ammunition and other supplies. “But they quickly realised they would need animals for two types of situation: Transport at railway stations and ports, and at the frontline where conditions were muddy, frozen, or when silence was needed. They looked to the Empire to fill the gap. The Indian Army had 36 animal transport companies; four of them were requested for France.” During the war, one company of 320 men was captured by the Germans. They were the first Indians to be taken prisoner by the Germans, and spent up to five years in POW camps. Around 10 escaped from the camps, 20 joined the German Army after Subhas Chandra Bose set up an Indian Legion from Indian POWs, but the majority waited in POW camps until the end of the war. However, the country’s contribution to WW II has remained unknown. Over 2.5 million Indian men and 11,500 Indian women had served in the war; 28 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Indians and Nepalis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-soldiers-too-were-at-dunkirk-book-304712

Another 52 were nearing progress and work was on to fulfil another 59. “I have asked my officers to prepare a report card of their department on poll promises,” the CM said.Hold 15-day session, demands cheemaAAP senior leader and Leader of Opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema demanded that the one-day Assembly session on September 3 be extended for at least 15 days so that all key issues, including the agricultural crisis, expensive power, can be discussed.“Punjab needs 14,000 MWs of electricity and only 7,000 MWs could be purchased from the national grid, so all PPAs could not be cancelled. We have asked some of them to reduce the power tariff like the PPA signed at higher rates with Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), which was charging Rs 12.50 paise per unit,” said Captain Amarinder while talking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a function here.The CM’s reply comes a day after PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu sought extension of the Punjab Assembly session to bring legislation to scarp the “faulty” PPAs with private thermal plants.The PCC chief had sought immediate directions to the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) to revise tariff being paid to private power plants making the “faulty” PPAs null and void, besides new legislation to terminate the PPAs.The CM also sought to clarify that the one-day September 3 session was a special event to commemoration of the 400th Prakash Purb of Guru Tegh Bahadur.“Otherwise, the regular monsoon session would be called to discuss the legislative business. We will not adjourn the House sine dine so that the session could be held after a week or 10 days,” he said in reply to a query on the PCC chief and other leaders seeking extension of the one-day session.Denying that recovery of drugs and weapons, as part of narco-terrorism being fuelled by Pakistan, had anything to do with the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the central farm laws, the CM said: “The farmers are not involved in any way with the radicals. “The recovery of weapons, including ‘tiffin bombs’, had more to do with evil designs to foment trouble in the region.

We have put 46,000 persons involved in drugs cases in jails,” said the CM, avoiding a direct reply to queries raised by Sidhu.The PCC president, in a statement, said people of the state were eagerly awaiting the report of the special task force (STF) on Bikramjit Majithia, former Akali minister and brother-in-law of former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal.The STF report on Majithia in the Rs 6,000-crore Bhola drug racket is likely to be opened by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on September 2.The PCC chief said as the date was approaching, all eyes were on the High Court, and people, especially those who had lost innocent children to the drug menace, had high hopes that stern action would be taken against the accused. Questioning “inaction” by successive governments, Sidhu said despite the High Court directions, both dispensations failed to extradite the 13 drug smugglers, who peddled and smuggled contraband, to India. “These drug smugglers operated under the cover of government security using VIP vehicles,” he alleged.The state Congress chief said even a common man could sense why drug smugglers had not been extradited for the past five years. “Because had they been brought to book, they would have spilled the beans and exposed the unholy nexus of drug peddlers and politicians,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-questions-punjab-govt-inaction-on-drugs-304661

Only one old building within the Bagh remained which stood “forlorn and out of place among the 20th century structures of the memorial”, Wagner wrote.Gill tweeted, “Let’s hope they retain images of what it was before changing it and have them displayed for the public to see.”Eyebrows are being raised in the way the renovation work was handled.“A heritage site is renovated to strengthen the original structure for longevity. To make any change in the appearance of structure and make it glamorous for attracting people is a distortion of history,” Chaman Lal, retired professor of JNU, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/looks-nice-punjab-cm-contradicts-rahul-gandhi-on-jallianwala-remake-304723
