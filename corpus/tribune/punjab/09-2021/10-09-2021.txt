As the Samyukt Kisan Morcha summoned leaders from across the political spectrum in Punjab, the politicians toed their line and queued up outside the venue to meet the union representatives.It was a rare sight to watch farm union leaders calling the shots and the politicians of varied hues waiting patiently for their turn.Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu along with other party leaders waited for almost an hour to meet the leaders of 30 unions at People’s Convention Centre. Sidhu came to the meeting with a heavy police security cover, which was objected to by many.The Dhindsas—Sukhdev Singh and son Parminder Singh, representing Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt)—who came to meet the leaders at 11 am were asked to come after lunch.Satnam Singh, president, Kisan Ekta, Chandigarh, said this was the power of democracy. “Khu aap chal ke pyase kol aaya hai (the mighty are themselves coming to meet the downtrodden),” he said.The representatives of Samyukt Kisan Morcha have assembled here on Friday to meet the representatives of all political parties other than the BJP. “We are asking political parties not to hold any rallies till elections in the state are announced. It not only diverts people from the morcha to rallies, but also divides the people along political lines and could threaten the morcha of farmers against the three agriculture laws. We also want to know what their (parties) views on free power to farmers are,” Veerpal of Kisan Union (Qadian) told The Tribune.Till the filing of this report, leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal had met the farm leaders, while the meeting with Congress leaders led by Sidhu was under way. The Akali leaders said that though they listened to the farm leaders patiently, they also put across their point of view that in a democracy it was important that all should be allowed their political space.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-dhindsas-among-mighty-politicians-waiting-for-their-turn-to-meet-farmer-leaders-309254

He says YFC’s goal is to empower the under-privileged children and youth to have a sustainable lifestyle rather than getting drawn towards drugs.The club has not just brushed away gender discrimination but also provided a productive channel to vulnerable youth of the region.

It has different features such as facial recognition, gang analysis and phonetic search among other things. At present, it has a database of over 90,000 criminals.“Just by clicking a picture of the suspicious elements and uploading these on the system, you will get the entire details if he had had any criminal record,” he said, adding that the Punjab Police had even received the FICCI Smart Policing Awards in 2018 for this.Deputy Commissioner of Police (investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said it was true that it was not being used on field at the ground level, but the city police have now made sure that it is used by cops at checkpoints to identify suspects. The police have managed to nab vehicle lifters leading to the recovery of stolen vehicles.Police Commissioner Vikram Jeet Duggal said since he joined as the Police Commissioner in the holy city, his endeavour was to use technology to their advantage. “The criminal elements are using technology to hoodwink the innocent people and making crime detection a little difficult. It is time we used technology to our advantage,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/smart-policing-nailing-criminals-not-a-handicap-anymore-309154

Now that the elections are inching closer, the Congress hiked the price to woo voters. However, Haryana is still offering the highest sugarcane price in the country. —  JP Dalal, Agri ministerHike in rabi crops’ MSP a lollipop: SKMKarnal: Leaders of the SKM termed the hike in MSP for rabi crops as a lollipop and said the hike was shameful. “Except mustard and lentil (masoor), which had a hike of around 8 per cent, the remaining crops were given very less hike, which is not appropriate with the rising inflation,” said Gurnam Singh Charuni, BKU president and SKM member.In a clear case of one-upmanship against Punjab, Haryana announced a hike of Rs 12 per quintal over its existing price of Rs 350 (for early variety), making it the highest in the country. Eyeing the upcoming Assembly elections, the Punjab Government recently announced a massive hike of Rs 50 per quintal, taking the state’s sugarcane price to Rs 360 per quintal.Since then, the Khattar government was on the edge over the quantum of increase in the sugarcane price as the state was already paying Rs 350 per quintal, the highest in the country, before Punjab increased it to Rs 360.Agriculture Minister JP Dalal said: “The sugarcane price has been stable at Rs 310 per quintal in Punjab for the past four years. Now that the elections are inching closer, the Congress hiked the price to woo voters. However, Haryana is still offering the highest price in the country,” Dalal asserted.Sources said in the wake of the farmers’ agitation, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar wanted to retain the top position regarding the sugarcane price in the country. “The announcement of Rs 362 per quintal as the sugarcane price has been made on the directions of the Chief Minister, after an approval from the Sugarcane Control Board,” said Cooperation Minister Banwari Lal.Khattar had publicly expressed displeasure over Punjab farmer leaders, who were spearheading the farm stir at the Singhu and Tikri borders, offering “ladoos” to Capt Amarinder Singh after the announcement of Rs 360 as the sugarcane price by the Punjab Government. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/haryana-increases-sugarcane-price-to-rs-362-per-quintal-309075

Each of the 21 of soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, then the highest gallantry award authorised to Indian soldiers.Stating that this year would mark the battle's 125th anniversary, Brig Kahlon appealed to the Prime Minister to issue a special stamp and coin to commemorate the heroic deeds of the Saragarhi martyrs.He also appealed to CM Capt Amarinder Singh to assign the task of strengthening and activating village defence platoons, particularly in the border districts, to the Guardian of Governance functionaries so as to plug loopholes in the internal security. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/battle-of-saragarhi-discussed-309111

The move comes even as five OSDs are already present at the CM’s residence.Kushaldeep Dhillon, Faridkot MLA, was earlier appointed one of the six advisers to the CM in the rank of Cabinet Minister, but the appointment could not come through after then Governor VP Singh Badnore returned the Punjab State Legislature (Prevention of Disqualification) Amendment Bill, 2019, to the government, raising 13 queries pertainingto duties and responsibilities, financial implications, legality and accountability of political appointees.In the changed political equations amid the tussle between the CM and Navjot Singh Sidhu, Lal Singh, Dawar and Chabbewal have been siding with the CM, but Kushaldeep Dhillon has maintained a neutral approach.One of the senior party leaders and a confidant of the CM, Lal Singh, who is also the chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board, has been asked to coordinate the work and assign duties to MLAs.

After they failed to pay, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) disconnected supply to many.But local BJP leaders, led by Sangrur chief Randeep Deol, have announced to restore the electricity supply. “We have two bulbs and two fans in our shanty, but have received a monthly electricity bill of Rs 50,590.

None of the thermal plants in the state have the requisite buffer stocks of coal. Data available with The Tribune shows that all plants have coal stocks ranging from two to eight days only, even as the supply has been restricted because of the regulation in coal supply by the Centre.As per new norms, affected due to severe coal shortage, the supply is being given on priority to only those plants where the stocks have dropped to less than 14-day requirement. Since Punjab has been running its plants on a much less Plant Load Factor (because of outages of thermal units at Talwandi Sabo plant and Ropar), the government is accordingly calculating the state’s coal stocks, maintaining that coal supplies in plants need not be replenished immediately.“But now, the demand of power is at the peak because of paddy cultivation. We require 12,000-13,000 MW daily, and for that the two thermal power plants at Rajpura and Mansa need to run to their full capacity. Moreover, the thermal units at Ropar and Mansa have again started generation, thus requiring more coal than the Centre calculated, based on the initial limited functioning of these plants. Since the coal supply to these plants has been stopped, it poses a threat,” said PSPCL Chairman A Venu Prasad.It may be noted that at this time, when the paddy crop is maturing, water requirement is high, necessitating running of power-operated tubewells for long hours. Alarmed, the state has now shot off a letter to the union coal secretary, urging him to immediately restore coal supply to Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/outage-threat-looms-as-coal-stocks-deplete-in-punjab-308913

In Sangrur, there are families, whose members are equally participating in local protests at Moonak for crop loss compensation and also at Delhi borders.“I had to sow paddy twice. Hit by power scarcity and rainwater flooding, I had to plough the fields. I have been under huge debt but, crop failure and debts are no excuse for me and my family to stay away from the protests,” said Bakhshish Singh of Rampura Gujran village, who had stayed at New Delhi protest for five months.Demanding the release of financial aid for crop failure due to rainwater, farmers of many villages have been staging a protest before the Moonak SDM’s office for the past 13 days.“Both the protests, at Moonak and New Delhi, are for different demands. Many farmers are even taking more debt to contribute to the protests,” said Tek Singh, another farmer from Moonak.A Sangrur farmer, Surjan Singh, said more protests would be launched in the coming days against the politicians coming to their villages, as all parties had failed to come up as per their expectations.“After I returned from Delhi, my son joined the protest in my place. Though we are already under debt, we still are contributing to keep both the protests — in Delhi and Sangrur — on for better future of our generations,” he said.Some farmers said they were preparing for a bigger fight at village levels. Special committees were being formed to prevent the entry of politicians of all parties while in other places, farmers had already made WhatsApp groups to mobilise support against politicians.“No doubt, NRIs, NGOs and religious organisations are helping us, but our protests are not totally financed by them. In fact, farmers themselves are spending lakhs to keep the protests alive,” said Gurmukh Singh, an elderly farmer. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/crop-loss-mounting-debt-fail-to-dampen-protesters-spirit-308914

The police groped in the dark for the past many years to find out these “ghost” drug smugglers from whom drugs were reportedly seized.Now, after registering fresh cases against them, the local police were still in the dark. “They still don’t know their whereabouts,” a source said.Parmod Paswan of Hajipur district in Bihar was booked under Sections 20, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act at the City-I police station in Moga on August 29, 2010. He was not arrested at that time though drugs were shown seized from him. The sessions court declared him PO on June 9, 2012.

The court, while dealing with the protection plea, need not go into other aspects such as registration of a criminal case. In case it was registered against any of the parties, the law should take its own course, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled.The ruling by Bench of Justices Augustine George Masih and Ashok Kumar Verma came on an appeal filed by a couple against a single Bench order, vide which their plea was dismissed with Rs 1 lakh costs. The single Judge observed the petition was nothing but a ploy to seek “a seal of this court” regarding lustful and adulterous life of woman-petitioner with the other petitioner and the court could not be a party to the same. The man’s arguments that he had a right to perform second marriage under Muslim Law was misconceived as the court, instead of taking an academic view, was more concerned about the welfare of two minor girls as it was clear that he had intentionally failed to maintain them and his first wife.Appearing before the Division Bench, the counsel for the appellants stated their only prayer before the court was for protection of their life and liberty and they had nothing to say with regard “to the aspect of criminal cases registered against them, for which the law will take its own course and the appellants would avail of the remedy accordingly.Taking up the matter, the Bench asserted the aspect it was considering and dealing with was regarding the threat to the life and liberty to the appellants as claimed. No person could be permitted or allowed to take law in his hands. As such, the appeal was being disposed of by directing Malerkotla SSP to take into consideration a representation submitted by the appellants. He was also asked to take appropriate steps in accordance with law for ensuring that the life and liberty of the appellants was not jeopardised at the hands of the private respondents, if some substance was found in the representation.Directions issuedThe court, while dealing with the protection plea, need not go into other aspects such as registration of a criminal case.
