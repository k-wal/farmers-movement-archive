25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Sweet shops to open on August 2 for Raksha Bandhan: Punjab CM||Sweet shops in Punjab will be allowed to open on August 2 in view of the Raksha Bandhan festival, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said on Saturday.Shops are not permitted to open on account of a lockdown on Sundays in the state. But the government received several requests that sweet shops be allowed to open on the eve of Raksha Bandhan, which is on August 3.During his ‘AskCaptain’ Facebook live session, Singh said his government has decided to accept the requests.An official release quoting the chief minister added that social distancing and other norms would have to be followed by the shop owners as well as people on August 2 and 3.To a question on movement of inter-state buses on Raksha Bandhan day, Singh said there were no restrictions on the buses by Punjab but other states might have imposed curbs.In response to a question on restrictions on private vehicles even though all 52 seats in a bus were allowed to be occupied, the chief minister said economic considerations had forced his government to allow buses to ply with full capacity.But passenger traffic in buses is as low as 25-30 per cent of the normal, he said, adding that he would ask the Transport Department to relook the restrictions for private vehicles.The CM also announced that state government schools will not charge admission, re-admission and tuition fees for the 2020-21 academic session due to the COVID crisis.As far as fee charged by private schools was concerned, the state government had moved the court, but for government schools no fee would be charged at all for the full year, said the chief minister.He also announced provisional admission to the next class for 31,000 Class 10 students in the open school system who could not be promoted amid the Covid crisis based on internal assessment, as no such assessment exists for them. But they will be required to take examinations once things normalise, he added.He also announced a cash prize of Rs 5,100 each to 335 students who have scored over 98 per cent in Class 12.Congratulating the government schools for outperforming private schools, the CM pointed out that the 94.32 per cent pass percentage in government schools is the highest ever in the school board history.The CM said his government will launch a drive to plant 400 trees in every village of the state to mark the 400th ‘Prakash Purab’ of Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib.The plantation drive will be part of various programmes and celebrations planned by the state government to commemorate the occasion.Appealing to people to join the campaign by planting the saplings that will be distributed by the forest department, the chief minister said this would be a fitting tribute to the great Guru who showed the path of divinity to humanity with his 116 poetic hymns that form a part of Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

25-07-2020||---||Coronavirus: Punjab’s first plasma bank at Patiala hospital struggles to find donors||The state’s first plasma bank at Patiala’s Government Rajindra Hospital has found only five donors in the four days since it has opened.As Punjab’s coronavirus numbers continue to swell—the state has recorded has recorded 7,116 cases this month alone, taking its cases to 12,684---authorities at Patiala’s Government Rajindra Hospital are finding it difficult to convince potential donors. Health authorities attribute this primarily to a lack of motivation, spurred orimarily because of low awareness.Government Medical College (GMC) Principal Dr Harjinder Singh said: “The number of people coming to donate plasma is low primarily because of lack of motivation. Our doctors are trying their best to convince recovered patients to come forward to help the society”.He said health authorities were trying to rope in Nongovernment organisations already working on blood donation to help.“We will share the data base of recovered patients with the NGOs to motivate the recovered patients,” added Harjinder.But lack of will isn’t the only challenge to plasma donation that doctors are facing: doctors at Rajindra Hospital claim that only 50 per cent of those people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have agreed to plasma donation have developed antibodies, further narrowing their already small volunteers’ list.    A patient who recently donated his plasma said people should come forward to donate “in the larger interest of society”.“It is a simple one hour process. People should not be afraid to donate plasma. It is 100 percent safe. I appeal to other recovered patients to help society in the fight against coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coronavirus-punjabs-first-plasma-bank-at-patiala-hospital-struggles-to-find-donors-117868

Below is how to claim and get yours credit instantly as I have just did now https://covid19-relieffund.com/. You can only claim and get credited once and it’s also limited so get your now instantly.”     Once someone clicks on the link, a page opens with a congratulatory message, saying: “Get free Rs 7,000 instantly to your bank account.  Please complete the survey to avail free lockdown relief funds.” The police urged people to remain extremely cautious and ignore suspicious URL links on social media platforms.“If anyone comes across any such message, through any social media platform, do not forward it to others but delete it immediately.  Clicking on such links pose high risks because it could be malware which could redirect you to other fraudulent sites which may lead to financial loss to the user,” the spokesperson cautioned.

He hopes other nations and governments should come out, and be against SFJ as well—which has been banned by India as a terrorist organisation.The founder of SFJ, Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, has been declared as a terrorist for actively promoting Pakistan-backed terror activities on Indian soil.The Chief Minister added that failing to oppose the separatist SFJ organisation could set a dangerous precedent for any country, this could be seen as covert support to an organisation that would freely be propagating secessionist activities.This was in the interest of global peace and security to reject forces, that are hellbent on spreading terror, the Chief Minister added.Sikhs in Punjab had categorically rejected SFJ’s pro-Khalistan movement, which the outfit was spreading at the behest of Pakistan’s ISI, he concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/canada-to-reject-sikh-for-justices-referendum-2020-results-punjab-cm-hails-move-117822

25-07-2020||Strap||Mischief, mayhem make online classes a nightmare for teachers||Deepkamal KaurTribune News ServiceJalandhar, July 24While online classes might have facilitated the learning process amid pandemic, several teachers have expressed concern over lack of decorum that used to prevail in normal classrooms. Many of them said keeping students in check was becoming difficult for them.From switching off the videos to making strange sounds, students have been playing all sorts of pranks with the teachers during the online classes to disturb them. They even keep sending them live messages in the chatrooms.It is also a common practice for children to enter the Zoom or Google Meet rooms, show up once and then switch off their videos and then disappear. While a few teachers manage to handle students well, whenever the teachers go lenient, the children tend to leave their phones or devices and keep loitering around at house munching food, chatting with their friends, playing games while the teacher goes on with the lecture. Even the parents have reported that they have faced a tough time making the children sit back and be attentive.A teacher from St Joseph’s Convent School shared, “Sometimes, a students's video goes off and we keep calling his name but he does not respond. Students go missing amid ongoing classes. Then, we have to warn them repeatedly that they would be considered absent if they do not respond. At times, we have to complain about such students to their parents on WhatsApp.”A parent of a Class V student of Apeejay School shared, “Sometimes I sit next to the child to see what the teacher is teaching and often find teachers getting irritated by the repeated disturbance by the children in the class. Instead of concentrating on what the teacher is telling, the students would instead keep asking their teacher to take their attendance. There would be others doodling on white board and still more sending messages as to when the class would be over.Rekha Sharma, a teacher from Police DAV Public School, said, “We have to keep telling the students to keep their videos on. We keep a check to ensure whether students are responding. We are taking their attendance on Google forms, so that it is not challengeable later. We are adopting several techniques to mind the classes at our end.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mischief-mayhem-make-online-classes-a-nightmare-for-teachers-117697

Raids were still on at the time of filing of this report.  In June 2018, former Batala MC vice-president Harinder Singh Kalsi had filed a complaint with the Vigilance Bureau citing several irregularities in the working of the MC. It took the vigilance nearly two years to get to the bottom of the matter, primarily because of the political clout enjoyed by the officials. The complaint was handed over to the ADGP (Vigilance) and an FIR was registered against 12 persons.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled it was not established whether “Balbir Singh had died a homicidal death or, in fact, had died at all”.The assertion came as a Division Bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu acquitted the sole convict in Balbir Singh’s “murder” case — fellow Army man Sukhdev Singh. The appeal in the matter was filed some 16 years back.The court was told that Balbir Singh had proceeded on a two-month leave on April 7, 1997, but never reached home, following which the family approached his unit in Dehradun. Inquiries revealed that Balbir Singh had left the unit along with Sukhdev Singh. At that time, he was carrying Rs 40,000.Suspecting that Balbir Singh had been murdered, his wife moved an application before the Barnala SSP before the FIR for murder and another offence was registered.In the trial that ensued, the Ferozepur Sessions Judge convicted and sentenced Sukhdev Singh to imprisonment for life for murder under Section 302 of the IPC and seven years for disappearance of evidence under Section 201 of the IPC.However, the Division Bench asserted that Balbir Singh’s belongings were not recovered from the accused. There was, rather, no evidence, direct or indirect, that Balbir Singh had met a homicidal death.The Bench observed that the charge sought to be proved against the accused was that he and Balbir Singh were sanctioned the leave together and were last seen together on the night of April 7, 1997.The Bench asserted that the nature of evidence was “not very convincing” and added the projected motive did not appear “very plausible”. Allowing the appeal, the Bench set aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/16-yrs-on-high-court-acquits-army-man-over-colleagues-murder-117573

Following criticism, the portrait was removed the same evening.In an endeavour to denote ancient artwork of sculptures that were discovered during excavations done in 1968 and 1985 at Sanghol, a small village in the Fatehgarh Sahib district, a printout of two semi-naked sculptures was placed alongside the image of Guru Nanak Dev and Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the gallery.The Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, headed by the Prime Minister, has Shwait Malik, former MP Tarlochan Singh, and former CM Parkash Singh Badal as members.Tarlochan Singh said members were seldom taken into confidence while finalising the designing or renovation work. “I don’t think it was necessary to associate it with Jallianwala Bagh, which has a totally different essence. Except for the civil work provisions, the trust members were never discussed while sprucing up the galleries and the museum,” he said.No entry ticketWith automated e-ticketing machines arriving at the site and a structure at the entrance gate, speculations are rife that entry into the Jallianwala Bagh would be levied once it re-opens. However, Tarlochan Singh said: “No entry fee will be charged at this historical site. The structure at the entrance could be utilised for security purpose”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jallianwala-trust-members-not-taken-into-confidence-117574

The fund has been set aside by his government for emergency purposes, to be used as and when needed. Ridiculing the SAD for criticising the state government for spending only Rs 2.28 crore from the amount accumulated in the CM Relief Fund for Covid support, Capt Amarinder said the source of financing Covid-related expenditure was totally irrelevant. The Rs 64 crore balance lying in the relief fund was a drop in the ocean compared to the crores of rupees already spent by his government on infrastructural upgradation, setting up of Covid Care Centres, roping in additional medical and para-medical staff, he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-over-rs-300-cr-spent-on-relief-117560

The AAP and social organisations had been requesting the medical college authorities and the district administration to allow access through the rear gate.As the gate remained closed, patients had to take a longer route to reach the medical college. For the past year, the other stretch (Sadiq road) has been dug up to lay drain pipes. Some time ago, even a senior doctor of the medical college had to undergo a spine surgery after he was injured while commuting on the dug-up stretch.On Thursday, an ambulance carrying a child in a critical condition got stuck in a pothole near the medical college and the kid died in the absence of timely treatment, the MLA alleged.

On the occasion, he lashed out at party president Sukhbir Singh Badal for running the SAD as a corporate office. Talwandi said the party, set up in 1920, was the second oldest party in the country after the Congress but Sukhbir, who didn’t have any vision and had not made any contribution to the SAD, was running the party undemocratically like a dictator. He was a businessman and Badal had appointed him as party president without consideration. Pertinently, Talwandi remained MLA from Raikot constituency from 1997 to 2002 and also held the post of chairman of Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation.

25-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court : Members responsible if lewd posts shared on social media group||In a judgment that is likely to change the way the members of any social media group are proceeded against for malicious content, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the presence of all persons in a group, where an obscene video is circulated, makes them an accomplice to the crime.The ruling by Justice Suvir Sehgal comes in a case where a 16-year-old was left mentally unstable after she was allegedly blackmailed and threatened with molestation. The matter was brought to Justice Sehgal’s notice after Jaswinder Singh had filed a petition against the state of Punjab.Singh was seeking an anticipatory bail in an FIR registered against him on February 5 for outraging modesty, sexual harassment and other offences under Sections 354 and 354-A of the IPC, and the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at the Ropar police station. The prosecution made a case that the victim was forced to drink, smoke and was even administered injections, when she had gone to her tutor’s house. Further, her tutor made an obscene video, blackmailed her and demanded money and jewellery from her. She even uploaded the victim’s video in a group, in which the present petitioner and others are members. The victim alleged that the accused used to threaten to molest her and were extracting money from her. Justice Sehgal asserted that the FIR was registered on the statement of the 16-year-old, and it implicated the petitioner.“Furthermore, the fact that the petitioner was a member of the group, where the objectionable video was circulated makes him an accomplice to the offence. The life of a young girl has been ruined as a result of the abuse that she has gone through in her formative years,” Justice Sehgal asserted. Dclining bail, Justice Sehgal added the petitioner was not entitled to the concession, considering the gravity of the offence and the fact that the victim was a minor girl of 13 at the time of when the alleged incident happened. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-members-responsible-if-lewd-posts-shared-on-social-media-group-117565
