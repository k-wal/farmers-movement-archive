31-01-2022||---||Punjab polls: Capt Amarinder predicts abysmal defeat for Navjot Sidhu from Amritsar east, says 'I'm not Majithia's uncle'||Patiala, January 31Even as he dubbed as farce Rahul Gandhi’s claims of deciding the CM face with inputs from the ground, Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) chief Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday predicted an abysmal defeat for Navjot Singh Sidhu from Amritsar East, which he had won in the past only with the support of the BJP.Addressing the media after filing his nomination papers from Patiala Urban and inaugurating his party office in the city, the former chief minister termed as ridiculous Sidhu’s charge of his hand in him (Captain Amarinder) in Bikram Singh Majithia being pitted against him by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). “I’m not Majithia’s uncle,” quipped the PLC leader, adding that with 38% of the voters in Amritsar East being Hindus and 32% SCs, Sidhu’s defeat was certain.The BJP, as part of alliance with PLC and SAD Sanyukt, has fielded a strong candidate from the constituency, he added.On Rahul Gandhi’s statement that the Congress would announce its chief ministerial candidate in the state after taking inputs from the ground, Captain Amarinder said this was just theatrics. He pointed out that as per procedure, the people elect their MLAs and then the CLP elects the chief minister. `` all this talk is just drama,'' remarked Capt.Asked to comment on the decision of the farmers to contest the polls, the former chief minister said it was their right to do so. He personally had always supported them, said Captain Amarinder, pointing out that his government had announced jobs and Rs 5 lakhs to the kin of each of the farmers who died during the agitation against the Farm Laws.Exuding confidence of the PLC-BJP-SAD Sanyukt alliance forming the next government in Punjab, Captain Amarinder said, in response to a question, that the decision to allow some of the PLC candidates to contest on BJP symbol was taken keeping in mind the voter demographics. While four PLC candidates will contest on BJP symbol in urban segments, two of their candidates will fight on PLC symbol in the rural constituencies, he explained.                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-polls-capt-amarinder-predicts-abysmal-defeat-for-navjot-sidhu-from-amritsar-east-says-im-not-majithias-uncle-365848
31-01-2022||Patiala||Capt Amarinder files nomination papers from Patiala Urban; inaugurates party office||Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) chief Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday set the ball rolling for his party’s electoral debut with an aggressive call to party workers to take on the mantle to save the state’s future from nefarious interests, while accusing the Congress of fighting these Assembly elections on his government’s achievements of four and a half years.Addressing PLC workers after filing his nomination papers from Patiala Urban, the former chief minister trashed Charanjit Channi’s tall claims of delivering on the Congress promises in 111 days, pointing out that everything that he was claiming as his personal achievement “was accomplished by my government, including creation of jobs, action social welfare schemes, free bus travel for women and farmers’ debt waiver”.Even in the sacrilege and drugs cases, in which he was accused of failing to take action as a pretext to remove him from chief ministership, it was his government that had initiated strong steps to take matters head on, pointed out Capt Amarinder.His government, he noted, had fought hard, right up to the Supreme Court, to get the sacrilege cases back from the CBI, leading to 19 officers, including ex-DGP Sumedh Saini, being booked.As for the drugs cases, the PLC leader declared that it was his government that successfully broke the backbone of the drugs mafia, leading to the arrest of more than 40,000, including many big fish.But it would be naïve to believe that drugs can be completely wiped out anywhere in the world, and more so in a border state like Punjab where Pakistan was pushing in drugs almost every day, he added.Pointing to the unequivocal support he had extended to the farmers during their agitation, the former chief minister said despite blockades at 137 places across the state, his government had taken no action as he was cognisant of the concerns of the farmers.Lauding the eventual revocation of the farm laws, he noted that never had it happened before that the prime minister of a country hadapologised for any policy decision, as was done by Modi while withdrawing the legislations.Promising to change the face of Punjab with the support of the government at the Centre, led by PLC ally – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the former chief minister said with the Narendra Modi government set to remain at the Centre for at least another seven years, PLC could transform the state with their support if voted to power.“Punjab’s economy is in a bad shape, it is reeling under huge debt, and needs financial support from the Centre,” he stressed, adding that the future of the state’s students, youth, farmers and others was at stake and need close Centre-state coordination to save.Inaugurating his party office in Patiala, Capt Amarinder said, as in the past, he was leaving the fight for this seat to the workers here, while he would go into battle for PLC and its allies in other parts of the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-files-nomination-papers-from-patiala-urban-inaugurates-party-office-365840
31-01-2022||Satya PrakashNew Delhi||Supreme Court gives protection from arrest to SAD leader Bikram Majithia till February 23||In a major relief to SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, The Supreme Court on Monday gave him protection from arrest till February 23 in a criminal case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, in view of the February 20 assembly polls in Punjab.As a SAD candidate from Amritsar East assembly constituency in the Majha region of the state, Majithia—a former minister—is pitted against Punjab Congress Chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana—which had earlier restrained the State of Punjab from taking any coercive action against Majithia till January 31—asked the SAD leader to surrender before the trial court on February 23. It directed the trial court to decide his bail plea expeditiously.The top court wondered how several criminal cases were suddenly coming out on the eve of the assembly elections in Punjab. It also talked about a case registered against Simarjit Singh Bains that has landed in the top court.”Sorry to say this, suddenly these cases are coming up before elections and everybody has reasons to suspect some motives... We are in a democracy…We are not saying hold your hands and not control drug mafias. But let the elections take place on February 20…At least allow the candidates to file nominations and contest elections”, a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana told senior counsel P Chidambaram, representing the Punjab Government.The court’s observation came after Chidambaram described it as a gross case of international drug trafficking that required custodial interrogation of the accused.“Punjab is sinking under drug trial…We have to send across a message that drug trafficking will not be taken lightly. Else, the future of Punjab youth is damned…I am not saying he should be thrown into a dark hole. But custodial interrogation is needed,” Chidambaram told the Bench, denying any political motive.”Mr. Chidambaram, please advise your state that it should not look like you are taking motivated actions,” the CJI said adding that a bail plea of another political leader from Punjab would come up for hearing on Tuesday.“I know political vendetta exists…but as far as this matter is concerned, this was under the monitoring of the high court for long.  But the investigation got delayed when the other party was in power till 2017…With respect to other matters, I will advise the government not to take any vindictive action, Chidambaram told the Bench.”Earlier, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, representing Majithia, termed it a “classic case of political vendetta” as the FIR was registered on December 20 last year on the directions of the acting DGP with respect to offences during 2004-2015.“I don’t know if this is election fever or election virus. Everyone is rushing to the court now… Is this fair, Mr Chidambaram?” the CJI had asked last week.Apprehending his arrest in connection with a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act registered at Mohali on December 20, 2021, Majithia had moved the Supreme Court challenging the Punjab and Haryana High Court’s January 24 order rejecting his anticipatory bail plea. The HC had, however, granted him protection from coercive action for three days to enable him to approach the Supreme Court.”The present case is blatantly political in nature and has been registered with a mala fide objective to target the petitioner, who is a mainstream leader of opposition party, one month prior to polls in the State,” Majithia had submitted.                                      #BikramMajithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-directs-punjab-police-not-to-arrest-sad-leader-bikram-singh-majithia-in-drugs-case-till-february-23-365826

The demand letter was given to an officer of the Punjab’s Election Commission during a meeting in Chandigarh. On the occasion, the Election Commission Officer said he would send it to the Chief Election Commissioner of India and would ask him to consider the letter seriously.Balbir Singh Seechewal said, “Punjab is the land of five rivers and nature had blessed it with unlimited and invaluable resources, but at present this land of five rivers is becoming valueless and poisonous. Now Punjab’s air, water and earth have been badly polluted.” He said, “In a democracy like India where political will could bring about massive constructive changes it was regrettable that political parties, in the name of social service, get into power but always keep mum on this key issue which is vital to sustain lives and health of the populace.He said for the success of democracy the people must become aware of their rights. Seechewal said until people were granted basic rights, the electoral process would not fufill its true meaning.Seechewal said every time issues like environment, education, health, employment and pathetic condition of farmers were not taken in the election manifestos, and even if present, they were not being solved after the formation of the government.Punjab Lok Chetna Lehar convener Kahan Singh Pannu said till now successive governments had failed to provide the basic fundamental right to living standard. The political parties have been making false promises. Now during the election, it’s a common thing to lure helpless and ignorant people with money, liquor and with false promises.On the occasion, he made an appeal to officials of the Election Commission to stop false promises of the political parties and to make the election manifesto of the political parties a legal document so that the people could vote without any fear for their right to adequate living.                                     #BalbirSinghSeechewal                                     #KahanSinghPannu                                     #PunjabLokChetnaLehar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/make-election-manifesto-of-parties-a-legal-document-365766

For instance, Warring inaugurated the election offices of other three candidates of the party — Karan Kaur Brar in Muktsar, Rupinder Kaur Ruby in Malout and Jagpal Singh Abulkhurana in Lambi. Besides, Warring has assured the three that he would campaign in their areas whenever called.Adapting to pandemicDinanagar: Congress candidate Aruna Chaudhury has found a unique way to reach out to people amid Covid restrictions.

These posters have been handed over to a special team of volunteers who fan out in every nook and cranny of the seat almost every morning. Even her detractors admit that the minister was engaging in a needless exercise as she was a sure winner keeping in view the weak opposition she faced.

It is indeed a one-horse race in Dinanagar.Joblessness & drug abuseJalandhar: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday linked the issue of unemployment with the increasing drug menace among the state youths. While peace and harmony had remained the key issues highlighted by him until his ‘Tiranga March’, Kejriwal has now started speaking openly about the drugs menace. Claiming that the AAP, if voted to power, would nab all drug suppliers in the state, during his Adampur speech, he also said ending unemployment was key to counter drug abuse among youth.Actors take centre stageMoga: Bollywood actor and philanthropist Sonu Sood has actively started campaigning for his younger sister Malvika Sachar Sood, who is contesting the Assembly election on the Congress ticket from Moga.

31-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Punjab Congress banking on Charanjit Channi to counter AAP in Malwa||Chandigarh, January 30Ahead of announcing the CM face for the forthcoming elections, the Congress high command has sent out a clear message that it is counting on Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi to take on the Aam Aadmi Party in Malwa that has 19 reserved seats.Besides Chamkaur Sahib, Channi, a Dalit Sikh face, will also fight from the Bhadaur (reserved) constituency. The decision is expected to have an impact in central Malwa, especially Mehal Kalan (SC), Barnala, Dhuri and other seats in the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency represented by AAP’s CM candidate Bhagwant Mann. In 2017, AAP had won 18 seats in Malwa — five of these in the Sangrur parliamentary seat.“Mann had recently dared the CM to fight from Dhuri. We have accepted his challenge and fielded him from neighbouring Bhadaur. Taking on AAP’s CM face in his stronghold will reinvigorate the Congress workers across the state,” observed a senior leader. The party has chosen not to field Pradesh Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu from two seats as the SAD, Punjab Lok Congress and BJP are all trying to contain him in Amritsar (East).Just as Sidhu fighting Bikram Majithia will have an impact in Majha, the party believes Channi contesting from Bhadaur will have a similar effect in Malwa that has a sizeable Dera Sacha Sauda followers, most of whom are SCs. However, the party has failed to field strong candidates against Capt Amarinder Singh in Patiala Urban and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal in Jalalabad.The party, insiders say, believes it is comfortably placed in Doaba that has the highest concentration of SC votes. The incumbent Chief Minister is expected to swing the votes in favour of the ruling party in this region.                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #Malwa                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/party-banking-on-channi-to-counter-aap-in-malwa-365630

31-01-2022||Anirudh Gupta||In Ferozepur, border reopening no more a priority for parties||Ferozepur, January 30For decades, ahead of every polling season, leaders across party lines used to promise to get the border re-opened to allure the electorate in this border constituency, which shares its border with Pakistan.The Hussainiwala-Lahore border was open for trade till hostilities began in 1971. However, it was closed in the aftermath of the war, leaving the thriving export-import trading community in the lurch.Consequently, the entire economy was shattered and the investments became shy. Since then, almost every drawing room conversation and political rhetoric has been centred on the dire need for the reopening of this border.“Over the years, politicians have been making statements, promising to get this border reopened which can usher a new era of prosperity and generate unprecedented employment opportunities for lakhs of people in the Malwa belt. However, nothing has been done on the ground,” said KC Sharma, a retired professor, adding that it was ironical that no one was talking about it this time.However, the local populace still believes this issue is more important than anything else to them. “Politicians probably think that talking about good relations with Pakistan or the revival of confidence-building measures can be counter-productive in this scenario,” said Harish Monga, a veteran writer.“As both India and Pakistan took a leap towards restoring people-to-people relations by opening the Kartarpur Corridor, the government should initiate the process for opening of this border too,” said Jaswinder Sandhu, a social worker.Shalindera Laroia, another social worker, said if opened, the border could change the entire economic landscape of the area. “The parties should certainly include this vital issue in their election manifesto,” he added.Traders in lurch||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-ferozepur-border-reopening-no-more-a-priority-for-parties-365673

Whenever there is a medical treatment required, patients have to be ferried on motorcycles passing through rugged roads for over 5 km to reach the nearest hospital. The worst situation is of the school and college students in Covid days as they do no get Internet connectivity at their places. They have to climb a hilltop and stay there for five-six hours braving the weather to get the signal and stay connected.Residents of kandi belt in Sham Churasi have been facing such hardship even at a time when there are talks of Digital India. “There are no roads in our area. There is no bus service either. We have to walk through stony passages across khuds to reach various places. The plight of women, elderly and children is especially pitiable,” said Shweta of Kukanet village, adding residents of Himachal Pradesh just a few kilometres from them were much better off.Gurbachan Singh, a resident of Dehrian village, “The main occupation of people here is agriculture but we are all fed up of the animals, including wild boars that damage our crops.

Jhikki had yesterday announced that he would return the Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) ticket.Angad is married to UP’s Rae Bareilli Sadar MLA Aditi Singh, who rebelled against the Congress high command and moved to the BJP. This is being seen as one of the reasons for the denial of ticket. The Congress had also reportedly got a survey conducted before announcing the decision.With the PLC candidate giving up the ticket, chances of Angad fighting from its alliance partner cannot be ruled out. Sources close to the family said the plans to contest had already been chalked out, but whether it would be with the BJP or as Independent was yet to be finalised.Asked if he could go the wife’s way, Angad maintained: “It is not my decision. I have called a meeting of workers tomorrow. I am taking feedback from everyone and will announce my final decision tomorrow.”Hundreds of workers and party office-bearers gathered at his residence to show solidarity with Angad and threatened to tender mass resignations.Having been elected at the age of 26, Angad was the youngest MLA in the 2017 elections. This is the first time in over 60 years that the family has been denied the ticket. In 2012, Angad’s mother Guriqbal Kaur was the MLA. His father Parkash Singh had contested twice — winning in 2002 and losing in 2007. His father’s cousin Charanjit Channi was the MLA in 1997, while his grandfather’s brother, Dilbagh Singh, contested from the seat between 1962 and 1992.Called workers’ meeting todayI have called a workers’ meeting.

Addressing public gatherings in favour of party candidate Kulwant Singh Kanta, said the Congress government had played a fraud on the poor by dispossessing lakhs of them of the blue card facility, which entitled them to subsidised ration under the atta-dal scheme.“It is equally shocking that CM Channi has not corrected the injustice meted out to the community as well as the poor. Channi also refused to come to the aid of SC students who were robbed of their scholarship fee and has done nothing to fill up the backlog in government vacancies for the candidates of the community.

But the candidates of other parties have landed here now and they will leave the constituency after the Assembly elections. Apart from me, residents themselves have started raising the issue of outsiders as they know that only Goldy is their real son and brother,” the Congress candidate said.Sharing his views, Gurmeet Singh, a senior citizen, said: “I have heard the outsider chorus being raised by Goldy and some other residents.

Sharma, who left the Congress and joined the SAD following differences with Capt Amarinder Singh and his MP wife Preneet Kaur, rejoined the party last week.He is the second Hindu face in fray from Patiala after SAD named Harpal Juneja as its official candidate. A few minutes after his name was mentioned in the official list, Sharma said he would work for the people of the constituency and would ensure the Congress’ victory.“This seat is a traditionally a Congress seat and I would ensure that the party continues to keep this seat”, said Sharma, who has been holding meetings with his supporters in the walled city. “Congress workers have been meeting me in the past over a month, and my decision to rejoin my old party was taken in consultation with all of them,” says Sharma, adding that he would ensure a win.In 2017, Capt Amarinder won the seat on Congress ticket by defeating AAP’s Dr Balbir Singh by a huge margin of 52,407 votes. “We will work closely with Vishnu who is a good acceptable Hindu face of the city. Our workers are united and we are hopeful that the Congress will again win this seat,” said Narinder Lalli, District Congress Committee, Patiala Urban president.With a five-way contest among the Congress, SAD-BSP, BJP-PLC-SAD(S), Sanyukt Samaj Morcha and AAP on the cards, the victory margins are likely to shrink.Prominent Hindu faceA prominent Hindu leader from Patiala, ex-Mayor Vishnu Sharma rejoined the Congress in the presence of PCC chief Navjot Sidhu a fortnight back. He had quit the party following differences with Capt Amarinder Singh and his wife Preneet Kaur in 2014.

Earlier AAP used phone calling to claim the majority voted for their CM candidate Bhagwant Mann.Rahul Gandhi announced in his virtual rally at Jalandhar that the party would seek worker inputs before declaring the CM face in the state.After AAP named Mann, the Congress has been under pressure to declare its CM candidate.                                     #PunjabElections2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-face-cong-begins-discussion-feedback-sought-on-internal-app-365605
