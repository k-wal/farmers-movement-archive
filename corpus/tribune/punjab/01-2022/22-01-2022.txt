Gopakumar on January 14, whose verdict enabled Franco to walk out free.Incidentally, soon after the verdict came, the former Kottayam SP Harisankar, who oversaw the probe, said he was supremely confident that the verdict would be against the accused."This was the least expected as the witnesses did a very clean job. An appeal should be filed," said Harisankar, then.The trial in the case extended over 105 days with 39 witnesses being examined and 122 documents produced before the court. While serving as Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, he was accused of raping a nun, who belonged to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation.During his visits between 2014 and 2016 to Kerala, he was accused of raping the 43-year old nun on 13 occasions. Later, he was removed from the charge of the Jalandhar diocese.A complaint was filed against him in June 2018 in Kerala and Mulakkal was arrested on September 21, 2018 on rape charges.He secured bail on October 16, 2018.The charge sheet names 83 witnesses, including the Cardinal of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Mar George Alencherry, three bishops, 11 priests and 22 nuns.Of the 83 witnesses, 39 were called and they were heard.Franco had approached the Kerala High Court and also the Supreme Court to quash the FIR against him, but both the courts refused to do so and the trial began.--IANS                                     #BishopFrancoMulakkal                                     #KeralaNunRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-nun-rape-case-prosecution-to-appeal-acquittal-of-mulakkal-363532

The bitter truth is that Punjab’s debt is increasing every subsequent year. The state’s outstanding debt has increased to Rs 77,000 crore, with Rs 30,000 crore accumulating in the present financial year itself,” the PIL pointed out.“Political parties are prioritising their self-interest over national interest and the public fund, which should have been properly utilized to secure fundamental rights of citizens, is being used to lure voters,” Upadhyay said, urging the top court to direct the Election Commission to seize election symbols and deregister political parties that promised to distribute irrational freebies to voters from public funds.“Unless some mechanism is put in place, political parties would try to buy out the voters by hook or crook as their aim is only to ascend to power,” he submitted.                                     #assemblyelections                                     #PollFreebies                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-urges-sc-to-declare-poll-eve-freebies-unconstitutional-363529

An international arbitration centre to take up matters of industry would be set up here.He said that while pointing fingers at others on sand mining, Bikram Majitha should introspect 10 years of Akali rule. “A person accused of drug trafficking cannot point fingers at others,” he said.He said the list of 31 names would be released in a day or two. When asked about the rebellion in the party against him, he said he was not like Capt Amarinder Singh who threatened to take action against those who challenged him.

Such vans are being deployed in rural constituencies such as Fatehgarh Churain.Generally, it is stationed in a village for two to four hours and plays documentary movies on the development work conducted during the Congress regime, the attitude of BJP and SAD during the farm agitation and poll manifesto. Rural people are showing interest in the movies being displayed on the LEDs.“After the Covid-19 restriction, the candidates and political leaders are not able to conduct public meetings. These vans are good to share their message. Villagers have been showing interest in these videos as it provides interesting political insights,” said Raju, a resident of Kala Afgana.As the political parties are well aware that a large section of rural society does not have smartphones and without political rallies and public meetings, those voters, especially from economically weaker section, cannot be approached. These publicity vans are stationed in the localities of the weaker sections so that they also get information about the ongoing political discourse.“Well-off sections of society read newspapers, watch TV channels and are active on social media platforms. Most of the time they don’t attend any political rally or meeting to support any leader of the party. But people from economically weaker section don’t have time and privilege to get these modes so the political party contact them physically.The LED-equipped vans may help political parties to express their views in front of voters,” said Navdeep Singh, a political activist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amid-infections-cong-devises-novel-way-to-reach-poor-voters-363461

He is wanted in cases of arms smuggling, conspiracy to attack government leaders in Delhi and spreading religious hatred in Punjab.The SSP said the explosives could be either RDX or PETN explosives. “We have sent the explosives for testing and whether it is RDX or PETN will be known only after the report is received,” he added.Earlier, on January 13, the police had recovered 2.5kg of RDX, a detonator, five explosive fuses, 12 live cartridges of AK-47 rifle from a terror module of the International Sikh Youth Federation.On December 1, 1 kg of RDX was seized from an undisclosed location in Dinanagar. Two days before the seizure, the Gurdaspur police had arrested one Sukhwinder Singh from a check post. In July, 2015, the cops had seized 5.7 kg of RDX from near the Dinanagar-Pathankot railway line. Four Lashkar-e-Taiba militants had planted the explosive on the track before making their way to the Dinanagar police station.UBGL, 2 live hand grenades seizedThe police have recovered one under-barrel grenade launcher (UBGL), two live hand grenades, 3.7 kg of explosives, nine detonators and codex wires. A UBGL is a weapon that fires a specially designed large caliber projectile often with explosive, smoke or gas warhead.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/explosives-found-pak-based-lakhbir-singh-rode-booked-363371

The complainant alleged that fake orders for the promotion of some police officers were issued under the name of the DGP.Anil K Sagar, counsel for the accused, argued before the court that custodial interrogation of the applicant is not required and no useful purpose will be served by sending him in judicial custody. Further, he has been falsely implicated in this case and he has nothing to do with the alleged orders. The applicant is not aware of the entire matter.Opposing the bail application, additional public prosecutor Atul Sethi said the applicant had been shown as one of the beneficiaries in the orders. In one of the orders, he had been shown to have been promoted. In another order, his son, Paramvir Singh, had been shown to have been recruited as a constable in the Punjab Police. Custodial interrogation of the applicant was required to know about his role, modus operandi and his connection with other co-accused.After hearing the arguments, Additional Sessions Judge Narender dismissed the anticipatory bail application.The court, in its orders, said: “The investigating agency requires custodial interrogation of the applicant to know about the role of the applicant and his modus operandi in the present case. In these circumstances, where the custodial interrogation of the accused is required, the relief of anticipatory bail sought by the applicant through the application under adjudication cannot be allowed. Accordingly, in the light of the above referred facts and circumstances, the application in hand is dismissed finding no merits therein. However, it is made clear that the above observations will have no bearing on the merits of the case as these have been given only for the purpose to decide the application under adjudication.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/fake-promotion-orders-punjab-cops-anticipatory-bail-application-dismissed-363370
22-01-2022||---||Punjab and Haryana High Court sets aside appointment of 98 Assistant District Attorneys||Chandigarh, January 21More than eight years after the services of 98 Assistant District Attorneys (ADA) appointed on a contract basis were regularised, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday set aside an order appointing them against the public posts by “a mode not envisaged by the rules framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution”.Justice Sudhir Mittal, at the same time, made it clear that the state may continue with them as contractual employees, subject to the initiation of the direct appointment process within six months. The respondents-ADAs will also be eligible to apply for the posts. “Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case, it is directed that stipulation of the upper age limit shall be relaxed for them,” Justice Mittal added, while fixing a year’s deadline for the completion of the process.The matter was placed before Justice Mittal after a bunch of petitions were filed against the state of Punjab and other respondents by Gurinder Singh and other petitioners through counsels Kapil Kakkar, Shivam Malik, Anurag Goyal, Parth Goyal and Amarjit Kaur. They were seeking the quashing of orders dated October 8, 2013, regularising the services of the respondents.The Bench was told that the Punjab Government issued an advertisement dated October 17, 2009, inviting applications for 98 posts of ADA on a contract basis. While the process of selection was underway, order dated October 8, 2013, was passed regularising the services of the respondents.Justice Mittal observed that the policy dated March 18, 2011, was framed for the employees of seven different departments. It was extended only for the ADAs belonging to the Prosecution and Litigation Department — a part of the Department of Home Affairs and Justice. It included the Jail Department and the Advocate General’s office.Justice Mittal asserted: “The policy was framed for the benefit of employees of the said departments as well, but the ADAs were singled out for preferential treatment. Nothing has been brought on record to show that there was a necessity to extend the policy for granting permanent employment.”Justice Mittal added the direct appointment process had already been initiated and the posts occupied by the contractual employees could also have been filled up through the direct recruitment, maybe in a staggered fashion to ensure that the subordinate courts’ working was not adversely affected. “The preferential treatment, thus, given to the private respondents and that too on the basis of their own request is patently arbitrary,” Justice Mittal added.GIVES A YEAR FOR DIRECT RECRUITMENTJustice Sudhir Mittal of the High Court made it clear that the state may continue with the Assistant District Attorneys as contractual staff, subject to the initiation of the direct appointment process within six months. Justice Mittal fixed a year’s deadline for the completion of the process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-sets-aside-appointment-of-98-adas-363367

This rural segment is plagued with multiple problems. Potholed roads, poor civic amenities, no industry and inadequate higher education facilities have been its bane for long.Residents rue that no concrete steps have been taken to deal with the perennial problem of waterlogging. The area also doesn’t have its own fire brigade. During any major incident, fire officials called from Mansa or Bathinda, which are located far away from Budhlada. Similarly, health facilities, too, leave much to be desired as government hospitals don’t have specialist doctors.Gurmeet Singh, a resident, says: “A short spell of rain is enough to flood the roads here. The waterlogging problem has remained unresolved for years. Moreover, there is a shortage of specialist doctors and medical staff in the government hospitals.” Villagers also complain that since Budhlada is located along the border with Haryana, it is the favourite route of liquor traffickers from the neighbouring state, where it is available at a low price as compared to Punjab.In the 1930s, Budhlada was popular for its superfine sugar. A factory owned by Muslims was located near the railway station; consignments were sent to Lahore and Karachi.

22-01-2022||Vijay C Roy||RAGING ISSUES: Rising debt burden of Punjab hits growth||Chandigarh, January 21While presenting the first budget of the Congress government in 2017, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal had stressed on gradually reducing the debt burden on the state. However, like in the previous regime, the debt swelled over the years.According to the budget document, by the end of the current fiscal year, the state’s outstanding debt is estimated to reach Rs 2,73,703 crore, an increase of Rs 91,000 crore since the current government took over in March 2017. The rising debt, means a hefty outgo on interest payments.The burgeoning debt and increasing committed liabilities have cast a shadow on the state’s economy and are proving to be a huge drain on the state exchequer, eating into the bulk of its revenue.A major part of the state government earnings and borrowings goes into servicing its debt and meeting committed liabilities such as salaries, pensions, power subsidies and debt waivers instead of capital formation.According to the government data, Punjab is among the most indebted states with a debt-gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio of over 40%. The outstanding debt as a percentage of the GSDP will further increase in 2021-22.The projected revenue deficit and fiscal deficit for the current fiscal are Rs 8,622 crore (1.42% of the GSDP) and Rs 24,240 crore (3.69%), respectively. However, experts feel the outstanding debt will surpass the budget estimates, so will the fiscal and revenue deficit due to freebies doled out by the current regime to woo voters.What is more worrisome is the state government’s failure to explore new avenues to generate its own revenue and plug loopholes in collection.As far industrialisation is concerned, the state government recently said it attracted investments worth Rs 1.02 lakh crore, which are under various stages of implementation with more than 52% of these projects having achieved commercial production and another 36% are in various stages of construction.However, the industry is of the view that high land prices and procedural delay have been acting as a stumbling block in attracting new investment. They feel the MSMEs have been completely ignored.What was promisedWhat has been deliveredAttracted investmentWe have taken landmark decisions to attract fresh investments and boost the existing industry. — Charanjit Singh Channi, CMGSDP hasn’t grownThe govt claims to have drawn Rs1L crore investment, but the GSDP hasn’t increased.
