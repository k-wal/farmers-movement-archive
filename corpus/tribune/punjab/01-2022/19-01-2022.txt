However, even during such a situation, the people of Punjab did not receive any medical help from the government,” he pointed out.Mann said Punjab needed an honest government and only the AAP was capable of delivering it.The party had already prepared a roadmap for the development of every sector in the state, he mentioned.Mann said his AAP government will implement a ‘pro-Punjab Financial Model’, which according to him, will take the state towards prosperity, again.The money, which would otherwise be leaked through corruption, will be used to impart better education, provide medical facilities, electricity, generate employment opportunities and provide financial aid to women, he said. —                                     #AAP                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #PunjabElections                                     #Punjabpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/traditional-parties-looted-punjab-only-aap-can-ensure-prosperity-says-mann-362683
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Celebrated drama critic CL Ahuja passes away at 88||Celebrated drama critic CL Ahuja passed away at a New Delhi hospital on Tuesday night.He was 88.The researcher spent his life dedicated to teaching English drama and appreciating Indian theatre. He was associated with the daily ‘The Tribune’ as drama critic for more than 20 years.‘Contemporary Theatre of India’ and ‘Theatre Thinking in India’ are his well-known books on the subject.For the past 15 years he was engaged in writing Urdu poetry. He was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for his overall contribution to the art of drama and theatre.Renowned Punjabi playwright and theatre director Atamjit says, “He was an honest and dedicated person, without any agenda except his academic integrity, who writing on theatre. He was a hardworking man. For two of the books he has written, he might have approached about 400 theatre writers, directors and actors across the country visiting them, recording their interviews and making notes. It was a laborious work to be done by organisations but he could individually do it, which speaks volumes about his dedication.”Playwright and theatre director Kewal Dhaliwal remembers Ahuja as one of the first few who worked on Punjabi theatre post Partition. “He treasured Punjabi theatre through his articles and registered its presence at the national level, contributing significantly to treasure it,” says Dhaliwal.Theatre actor and director Sudesh Sharma remembers Ahuja as the foremost critic from the region. “At that time the only main newspaper in the region was ‘The Tribune’. Every Friday theatre artistes would wait for Ahuja’s column in which he would have reviewed all the plays of the week. Each play would get only two to three lines but it was so significant, people would be opening dictionaries to understand it.”Sharma says Ahuja’s feedback meant the world to artistes. “We would carry the newspaper cuttings in our pocket gloating over the fact that Ahuja had written about us.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/celebrated-drama-critic-cl-ahuja-passes-away-at-88-362608

The names of two former MLAs of Baba Bakala — Manjit Singh Manna and Baljit Singh Jalal Usma — are doing the rounds. SAD leaders will have to avoid a possible rebellion before announcing the candidate’s name.PARTY CANDIDATE IN FRAYCONG Santokh Singh Bhalaipur (sitting MLA) AAP Dalbir Singh TongSAD Yet to announce nameAJNALASitting Congress MLA Harpartap Singh Ajnala will contest election from the seat for the third team. He will fight a triangular contest with SAD and AAP. Once a rebel, Amarpal Singh Bonny again joined his parent party — Akali Dal — and will be testing his fate for the third time from the seat. Earlier, he had been elected twice from the seat in 2007 and 2012.

Keeping in view the popularity of the segment, as it houses the Attari-Wagah Joint Checkpost and the Integrated Checkpost, the AAP has fielded Jaswinder Singh Ramdas, a retired ADC.PARTY CANDIDATE IN FRAYCONG Yet to announce nameAAP Jaswinder Singh Ramdas, ADC (retd)SAD Gulzar Singh RanikeJANDIALA GURUCongress repeated its sitting MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala with the hope that he will retain his seat.

SAD is yet to take a final call on its candidates from the seat, which is situated close to the holy city. Since Dr Dalbir Singh, SAD candidate from the seat in the 2017 Assembly election moved to Amritsar West, his predecessor Malkiat Singh AR is being considered by senior SAD leaders. He had successfully contested the election in 2007. Since he is not keeping well, his son Sandeep Singh, who has been looking after the party affairs in the constituency, is likely to be fielded from the seat.PARTY CANDIDATE IN FRAYCONG Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala (sitting MLA)AAP Harbhajan Singh ETO (retd)SAD Yet to announce nameMAJITHAThe important seat is represented by senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia. Despite opposition, the Congress high command has fielded Jagwinder Pal Singh, alias Jagga Majithia, 60, from the seat. According to political pundits, the party fielded Jagga Majithia, younger brother of its old guard Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia, who had switched over to the Aam Aadmi Party, to prevent split in party votes. The deft move to field brother against brother is aimed at sending a message that the rest of the family stands with the party. Jagga Majithia, who had won an election of councillor in 1992 and remained the general secretary of the Punjab Youth Congress, claimed that he had support of the entire party workers in the Assembly segment. Dismayed Congress rural president Bhagwantpal Singh Sachar, who had been campaigning and distributing even grants in the Assembly segment, was brought back to the party fold within 24 hours after he switched over to the BJP.PARTY CANDIDATE IN FRAY CONG Jagwinder Pal SinghAAP Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli MajithiaSAD Bikram Majithia (sitting MLA)Even as the Union Government repealed all three laws on farming after nearly a year-long peaceful protest, issues related to agriculture are likely to be a dominant factor.Stagnation in crop output, limited returns, inadequate steps to realise diversification and complete loan waiver would be tough questions to be answered by leaders, especially coming from conventional ruling parties such as SAD and Congress. In addition, there are several matters unique to the constituency that require separate attention.Parties contesting elections and their candidates have to deftly walk through heterogeneous framework of society without disturbing its age-old unity.Meanwhile, the election officials will have to keep a close watch on remote areas of the district that extraneous factors such as money, booze and muscle power should not influence the voting pattern.Out of the six Assembly segments, the Congress announced candidates for five seats in its first list containing 86 names. It is yet to develop consensus on a candidate from Attari. The SAD has not announced candidates for Baba Bakala and Jandiala Guru. Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badala and former deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal are likely to announce candidates for these two constituencies during their visit to the city tomorrow.                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/farming-desecration-issues-likely-to-dominate-in-6-rural-assembly-segments-362583

19-01-2022||Chandigarh||Unravelling truth behind events surrounding sacrilege incidents||More than five years have elapsed since the incidents of sacrilege, subsequent protests by people and police firing tore apart the social fabric in the state, leaving two persons dead and several injured. The wounds refuse to heal even with time. Bringing out the truth behind the events before and after the incidents is “The Sacrilege” — a non-fiction by Justice Ranjit Singh.“The book presents the results of the investigation, sparing none, including powerful politicians, and is an eye-opener with startling revelations presented with facts. It is written in lucid and simple language unfolding the tragedy of events that occurred,” says Justice Ranjit Singh, a former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, who headed the commission of inquiry set up to look into the incidents of sacrilege.The book, having the potential to affect the fate of the impending Assembly elections in the state, is scheduled to be released on Wednesday by two former Chief Justices, Justice SS Sodhi and Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, along with a former Supreme Court judge, Justice HS Bedi, and a Punjab and Haryana High Court judge, Justice Nawab Singh.Justice Ranjit Singh says the book dwells deep into the circumstances leading to the incidents of sacrilege and the events that unfolded after it, including the affixing of posters and scattering of “holy angs of ‘saroop’ of Guru Granth Sahib”. “It hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community and the entire nation, leaving indelible scars, which are impossible to heal. Not only was blatant sacrilege committed, it was unfortunately followed by the firing of police personnel on innocent protesters leading to loss of human life. Various investigations by a special investigating team and a former judge into these cases made little headway, leaving the public clamouring for justice,” says Justice Ranjit Singh.Talking about the commission and its report, he says it carried out the investigation without bias.The firing at Kotkapura took place on October 14, 2015, after sacrilege. In his report tabled before the Vidhan Sabha, Justice Ranjit Singh asserted the responsibility of action at Kotkapura to forcefully evict the protesters sitting on peaceful dharna squarely lied with the police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unravelling-truth-behind-events-surrounding-sacrilege-incidents-362455

Punjab, meanwhile, told the court that Majithia had not extended full cooperation during the investigation.The case would now come up for “final arguments” on January 24. Majithia’s interim anticipatory bail would, at least, continue till then. The direction on joining the investigation by Justice Lisa Gill came after advocate Arshdeep Singh Cheema on Majithia’s behalf requested for an adjournment after submitting that senior advocate RS Cheema had contracted Covid-19. Representing the state of Punjab, senior advocate P Chidambaram did not oppose the adjournment request, while submitting that the petitioner had joined the investigation, but not extended full cooperation.Justice Gill asserted the court was not inclined to adjourn the matter. But keeping in view the circumstance and with consent of counsel for the parties, the matter was being adjourned. “Needless to say, the petitioner shall, in the meantime, continue to join investigation as and when required and in terms of conditions contained in order dated January 10 and extend full cooperation to the investigating agency.”Among other things, Majithia was asked to keep his mobile phone constantly on and share with the investigating agency his live location through WhatsApp. He was further directed not leave the country till the next date of hearing. He was also asked not to directly or indirectly try contacting any of the witnesses or anyone connected with the case in any manner.Majithia was apprehending arrest after a case under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at Mohali on December 20, last year. He moved the High Court after a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition.                                     #BikramMajithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/drugs-case-hc-tells-majithia-to-join-probe-when-required-362448

They are aware of the fact that we have joined politics for the welfare of farmers. — Dr Amarjit Mann, SSM Sunam CandidateThe campaign of the BKU Ugrahan has once again started sensitising farmers, who have started coming in large numbers to listen to their leaders against the policies of various governments.Special teams of the BKU Ugrahan have started organising meetings and circulating pamphlets containing detailed information about their pending demands and how politicians have caused losses to farmers, triggering a fresh wave of anger against politicians.“All our members are free to vote for any political party. The sole purpose of the awareness campaign is to make the farmers aware of the divisive policies of politicians and to motivate them to further strengthen our unity to launch agitation against the government for the fulfilment of our long pending demands,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, BKU Ugrahan general secretary. The impact of the awareness campaign can already be seen on farmers as many of them have decided not to attend any political rally.“The repeal of central farm laws has proved that united farmers could get all their demands fulfilled.

Such transfers are often termed as “dummy” postings as these do not require any additional manpower and are not directly related to the poll process.Will seek reportI will seek a report on all postings. Those posted outside cannot miss their duty and go to the place of their choice. All rules will be strictly implemented. — Ishwar Singh, ADGP and EC's Nodal OfficerSample this: An SHO, who served for almost over three years in a Cabinet minister’s constituency and was transferred out of the district, continues to skip his new posting and remain in the constituency where the minister’s son is now contesting. Another SHO who served for over three years, under an MLA, was posted in the Special Branch. He continues to play truant from the office to help the MLA.Besides, a number of cops are these days “missing” from the place of postings and are reportedly helping their political masters. When a similar attempt was made ahead of the polls in 2017, the state EC had issued a notice to the then DGP, to explain the transfer of policemen on “dummy” postings.Documents in possession of The Tribune revealed that many transfers had been made against “dummy” postings. Since these don’t come under the poll panel’s ambit, these officials get a free hand to serve interests of their favourites.“I have made the postings based on recommendation of the SSPs concerned. We will keep a watch on their actual work on the ground,” said Mukhwinder Singh Chhina, IG, Patiala Range.“A number of officers from different branches, specially the police, are helping their political masters. We have reported the matter,” said SAD leader Daljit Cheema.The EC guidelines, issued before polls, say: “No officer connected directly with elections shall be allowed to continue in the home district. If he/she has completed three years in respective district, then he/she will not be able to continue with the present posting.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/to-outwit-poll-panel-cops-given-dummy-postings-362440

After his demise, the Congress wrested the seat back in the 2018 bypolls.

Illegal mining is rampant in Baghela, Chak Bahmania, Rame and Pipli Miani among other villages. Another key grouse almost all residents complain about is the registration of false cases.A resident of the Dhandowal village, which is 3 km from the Sutlej, says: “Those peddling drugs aren’t booked, but false cases are lodged against the poor. River banks are also ravaged. No lessons have been learnt from the 2019 floods. Most of the Dhussi bundhs are weak and pose threats.” Villagers credit environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal for making efforts to strengthen bundhs.

Whatever it decides, would be in favour of Punjab. I have a firm belief on the people of Punjab that they would vote for Punjab model. Sidhu stands for a roadmap. If agenda is there, Sidhu is there. If the motive is just to grab the power, then Sidhu would not be there,” he said.Giving a glimpse of the Punjab model in respect of illegal sand mining, he categorically advocated for sole control of the government over the sand mining. He stressed the government-oriented mining corporation be formed by disbanding the existing thekedari system.“Disbandment of the thekedari system on the lines of Telangana Government has to be adopted here. The sand is the resource of the government and it has to be sold at fixed rate, weight and date,” he said. He said it would be the transport mafia that misappropriated the sand. “That has to be curbed by making state-owned stock yards, online booking at fixed rate,” he said.                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #NavjotSidhu                                     #PunjabCM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/people-will-decide-their-cm-says-sidhu-362428
19-01-2022||Chandigarh January 18||SAD dubs AAP exercise to pick CM nominee 'phoney'||The SAD today dismissed as “phoney puppet show” the AAP exercise of staging a “mock tele-poll” to elect its chief ministerial face in Bhagwant Mann.Celebrations break out in Sangrur“AAP has elected its first phoney CM face. Now, let Punjab elect its real CM. As Arvind Kejriwal had always wanted to remote-control Punjabis from Delhi, one must say this phone idea was brilliant, but only for controlling the AAP’s internal circus,” tweeted Harcharan Bains, principal adviser to SAD chief Sukhbir Badal.Bains said the AAP convener had confessed that 2.23 crore of the 2.41 crore phone users in Punjab remained indifferent to the “AAP hoax”, and only 21 lakh responded, that too if Kejriwal’s claims were to be believed. “And even more shameful and humbling must have been the revelation that many of these AAP supporters also rejected all AAP leaders and opted for someone from another party,” he added. —                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #SAD||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-dubs-aap-exercise-to-pick-cm-nominee-phoney-362429
19-01-2022||Vishav Bharti||Health infra takes centre stage in Punjab polls||Chandigarh, January 18Just before the 2017 Assembly elections, the Congress in its manifesto promised to develop all primary and community health centres as independent multi-specialty hospitals. However, the government failed to initiate steps in this direction over the past 58 months.Key achievementsMajor failuresGave universal coverWe have upgraded PHCs and CHCs. We handled the Covid waves successfully. Our biggest achievement was universal insurance scheme, covering almost the entire state. — Om Parkash Soni, Deputy CM and minister for healthBasic healthcare missingThe government failed to provide even basic healthcare. District hospitals were acting as referral centres. The insurance scheme is in fact a central initiative poorly implemented in Punjab. — Surjit Kumar Jayani, BJP leader and ex-health ministerHit new low in 5 yearsOur healthcare system was the best in the country, but it was left to rot under a conspiracy over the past two decades. The system’s failure was exposed during Covid wave. — Bhagwant Mann, State AAP PresidentLet alone upgrading rural primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs) to multi-speciality hospitals, the government went on to tinker with the existing infrastructure by withdrawing doctors posted in rural areas.The government claims to have opened more than 3,000 health wellness centres in the rural areas. But in reality, the government has not built even a single new building, conveniently withdrawing doctors from PHCs and CHCs and replacing these with nurses and designating them as community health officers.Besides, the government had made another promise of opening five new medical colleges to provide tertiary care services. However, not even a single college had been opened properly.In one of the first Cabinet decisions, the idea of establishing Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, SAS Nagar, was conceived but it remained a non-starter. The institute may admit its first batch next year. The other four colleges could not go beyond laying of foundation stones and photo ops even as the term of the Congress government nears its end.The sorry state of tertiary care was exposed during the first two Covid-19 waves when the government was found helpless in the face of crumbling infrastructure and untrained manpower asked to handle critical care, including ventilators. As per official estimates, there were over 16,000 deaths due to Covid, but going by the Death and Birth Registrar record, the number is four times higher.The state government had also been boasting about the Ayushman Bharat-Mukh Mantri Sehat Bima Yojana (AB-MMSBY), which covers around 40 lakh families and under which the government claims to have offered free treatment worth Rs 1,112.41 crore to 9.63 lakh beneficiaries.However, health experts feel the scheme is nothing but an escape route from its constitutional responsibility of providing healthcare to every citizen. The scheme shows how the government assumed the role of a facilitator from that of a service provider.The government remained under fire from Opposition parties over poor healthcare in the state. Terming the government’s performance as poor, AAP president Bhagwant Mann said in the past five years, state’s healthcare had hit a new low. Karnail Singh Peer Mohammad, SAD general secretary and spokesperson, accused the government of using Covid-19 to mint money by ordering vaccines for further supply to private hospitals.LEADERSPEAKRuling party now a sinking shipThe Congress is now a sinking ship.

It won’t be easy for the Congress this time.— Harjot Kamal, BJPPoll NuggetsGen JJ Singh joins saffron partyChandigarh: Former Chief of Army Staff General JJ Singh (retd) today joined the BJP ahead of the Assembly elections. In the 2017 elections, General Singh had contested as an SAD candidate from Patiala against Congress nominee Capt Amarinder Singh, but suffered a crushing defeat. He finished third and could muster just 11,677 votes, thereby forfeiting his security deposit.

19-01-2022||Jalandhar||3 MLAs write to Sonia Gandhi seeking Rana's ouster||Day after Cabinet Minister Rana Gurjeet Singh announced he would support his son Rana Inder Partap Singh’s decision to contest from the Sultanpur Lodhi seat as an Independent after being denied the Congress ticket, three sitting MLAs and a former legislator have written to party chief Sonia Gandhi, seeking his expulsion from the party.Allegations baselessIf they think I am interfering in their constituencies, they too can come to Kapurthala and make an attempt to trounce me. — Rana Gurjeet Singh, Cabinet MinisterIn the letter, copies of which have also been forwarded to party leader Rahul Gandhi, PCC chief Navjot Sidhu and state incharge Harish Chaudhary, the Congress leaders have demanded that the “nomination of Rana Gurjeet from Kapurthala constituency be immediately withdrawn and that he be removed from the party’s membership so as to send across a strong message to the leaders, who are weakening the party”.Among those who have come out in support of Sultanpur Lodhi legislator Navtej Singh Cheema are Phagwara MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, Jalandhar North MLA Bawa Henry and and former MLA Bholath Sukhpal Singh Khaira. Claiming that they too had been facing similar interference in their constituencies, the party leaders said: “Rana Gurjeet is weakening the Congress by interfering in other constituencies of the Doaba region, especially Sultanpur Lodhi, Phagwara, Bholath, Jalandhar North and Banga... Rana is doing this because he is playing into the hands of Opposition, especially the BJP... he was using his ties with ex-CM Capt Amarinder Singh to adjust close aides in the Punjab Lok Congress.Terming the allegations as baseless, Rana Gurjeet said: “Instead of levelling allegations, these leaders should fight it out together.” —                                     #RanaGurjeetSingh                                     #SoniaGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-mlas-write-to-sonia-seeking-ranas-ouster-362436
19-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Assembly poll 2022 : Some new faces in Doaba belt||Jalandhar, January 18Even as the traditional parties are largely trusting old horses again this time for the Assembly poll, there are some new faces in the fray in some constituencies of the Doaba belt.Inderjit Kaur Mann, AAP candidate, NakodarThe Aam Aadmi Party has fielded some new faces in Jalandhar, retaining only one last-time Shahkot candidate, Rattan Singh Kakkar Kalan, for the Assembly poll. Of the remaining eight, Sheetal Angural from Jalandhar West and Dinesh Dhall from Jalandhar North are new entrants to the party, but have remained councillors with other parties in Jalandhar.Those completely new in the field are Principal Prem Kumar, former district education officer from Phillaur, retired PPS officer Balkar Singh from Kartarpur, Raman Arora from Jalandhar Central and Inderjit Kaur Mann, former sarpanch from Nakodar.A graduate, Mann (53) has been a role model for women of the region for the past two decades. When her husband was settled abroad, she kept on handling agriculture work by herself. She had even then made headlines as she used to operate tractors in the fields by herself and rode horses. Her political career started in 2002 when she was a Block Samiti member. Later, she remained the sarpanch of Bir Pind for three consecutive terms ending in 2019 and was instrumental in starting various innovative works in her village.She is credited with setting up a panchayat federation for guiding and training panches and sarpanches, besides making them aware of their rights and duties. She had launched a massive eco drive and planted 5 lakh trees.She had started a project to track the sex ratio in villages and honour those villages that improved the girl ratio. As many as 6,000 women from the area had been part of her massive campaign that was very active in 2006.Mann says that she now wants to further expand her area of work and has opted for being an MLA. “In 20 years, work on laying the sewer line has not been completed in Nurmahal and is still underway. My concern is also the fact that there is no good government school in Nurmahal. There is just a single doctor in the government hospital there, which caters to 70 villages. There are no medicines available for the patients.I wish to work on new projects like beautifying the entry points in Nakodar and streamlining traffic by getting the lights installed. Setting up a ring road in Bilga town too would be on my priority,” she listed works on her mind for her constituency.Capt Harminder Singh, SAD, Sultanpur LodhiAmong the Akali Dal contestants, a new face in the Doaba this time is Capt Harminder Singh (69), who is contesting from the panthic seat of Sultanpur Lodhi. He had earlier been with the Congress and was even appointed as the Chairman of Milkfed, Punjab. His father Capt Sujan Singh was a freedom fighter and he himself served the Army from 1972-77. He had organised several ex-servicemen rallies for former CM Capt Amarinder Singh. Though his family is settled in Jalandhar, his native village Nasirpur is in Sultanpur Lodhi. He has the advantage of hailing from the Kamboj community which predominates the area. Outlining his agenda, he says, “My main aim would be to instil a sense of confidence and security in those people who live in fear and have no faith in the law-enforcing agencies. Law and order remains the main issue here. Congress leaders are themselves openly targeting the MLA over the issue of false FIRs. The area has been neglected in terms of medical facilities. I wish to prioritise on this front too”.Anil Kumar Meenia, BSP, Jalandhar WestOf the BSP candidates in the fray this time, Jalandhar West candidate Anil Kumar Meenia (55) is a fresh face. An MBA passout, he has served in National Insurance Company as the Senior Divisional Manager.He had been associated with BAMCEF movement of Kanshi Ram for 20 years and quit his job last year, six years prior to his retirement age to join the BSP and serve as the halqa in-charge here. A resident of Deol Nagar here, he says that he wants to build an equalitarian society as envisioned by Dr BR Ambedkar and make a change in the lives of people.“My main priority would be to keep a check on illegal drugs and liquor in the area. There are at least 130 shops of illegal lottery in my constituency which need to be checked. The sewerage and drainage systems in my area cry for attention. On a rainy day, one cannot reach the 120-feet road,” he enumerated problems and priorities.Amarpreet Lally, Garhshankar, CongressAmong the Congress candidates announced so far, Amarpreet Lally (39) is the youngest among the new lot. He is BA, PGDCA-qualified and hails from Kot Fatuhi village in Garhshankar, the constituency from which he is set to fight. He entered into politics as a youth leader getting elected in 2008.A good orator having leadership skills, he rose to become the Punjab Youth Congress chief and is now the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress. He recently became the co-chairman of the campaign committee of the party. Lally says that though his area is quite backward in terms of facilities, his priority areas would not just be roads, sewer lanes and drinking water, but also other issues like bringing in new industry, providing employment opportunities to youth and good education in schools and colleges.“My agenda will also include setting up a bypass in Garhshankar and carry forward work on laying kandi canal which is lying stalled at the moment,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/assembly-poll-2022-aap-bets-on-new-faces-in-doaba-362469

19-01-2022||Ruchika M Khanna||Confident of big win, will build vibrant Punjab: Bhagwant Mann||Chandigarh, January 18In 11 years of his political career, 48-year-old Bhagwant Mann has come a long way. Beginning with the now-defunct People’s Party of Punjab and then switching to the Aam Aadmi Party, Mann has experienced two electoral defeats and as many victories.Drinking issue blown out of proportionIt was all in the past. Even then, things were blown out of proportion. They have nothing else to target me with... no ED or income tax cases. Bhagwant Mann, AAP Sangrur MPMann lost the Assembly elections in 2012 and 2017, but made it to the Lok Sabha in 2014 and 2019. “That’s why I’m so grounded... Poll loss or victory is beyond anyone’s control, but what I can try is winning people’s hearts. Born in an ordinary family, I understand what problems common people face. For me, politics is a platform to espouse their cause,” the AAP leader said after being nominated the party’s chief ministerial candidate following a “tele-vote”.The two-term MP from Sangrur said he was “grateful for the love and affection bestowed on him by the people of Punjab”. “Living up to their expectations is a big responsibility as well,” he remarked. One of the most popular faces of the party in the state, Mann’s political satire and wit have endeared him to the masses. He was the lone AAP candidate from across the country who made it to the Lok Sabha in 2019. In 2014, Punjab elected four AAP MPs, but all barring him rebelled against the party. The “loyalty”, too, seems to have paid off.“I am confident of heralding a big win for the AAP as the election is being fought on issues concerning governance such as education, health, unemployment and industrial development. The Congress and Akali Dal-BJP governments in the past have ignored these issues... Nearly 22 lakh people have voted in my favour,” he told The Tribune, jokingly calling himself as having come from “public quota”.On his political opponents targeting him over his “drinking issues”, Mann asserted that it was all in the past and even then, “things were blown out of proportion”. “They have nothing else to target me... no ED or income tax cases. For, I am an ordinary man living in a rented accommodation,” he said.Though Mann declined to comment on the constituency he would be contesting from, speculation is rife he may choose Dhuri. “My dream and aim is to rebuild a vibrant Punjab. I will work full throttle to achieve that. Former President APJ Abdul Kalam had said ‘real dreams are those that do not allow you to sleep’… my dream is to make Punjab great again. It’s my driving force,” he said.Sources said declaring Mann as the chief ministerial candidate was a mere formality as his name had been cleared by the party’s top brass earlier this month. After the alliance with Sanyukt Samaj Morcha failed to fructify, he was the sole choice left, they said.Mann said he was pulled into politics after his political satires attracted the common people. “Punjab is plagued by several problems and each of these is threatening the state’s future. Issues like unemployment, youth migration, drug addiction and unviable agriculture haunt me all the time. If we win, we will ensure our government works for the poor and underprivileged,” he said.                                     #Bhagwantmann||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/confident-of-big-win-will-build-vibrant-punjab-362395
19-01-2022||Chandigarh||PUNJAB POLL 2022: AAP picks Bhagwant Mann as CM candidate in Punjab||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) today named Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann as the party’s chief ministerial candidate in Punjab. With this, AAP becomes the first political party to declare its CM face in the multi-cornered contest.Also, the party has put to rest speculations that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is vying to be the Punjab CM. The move also consolidates the party cadre behind one leader and allays fears of the party brining a political “parachuter”.AAP had started televoting to choose the party’s CM face on January 13. The voting lines closed yesterday. Announcing the result, Kejriwal said some persons had even voted for him as the CM face, even though he had declared that he was not a candidate. “An astounding 93.3 per cent of the voters favoured my younger brother Bhagwant Mann,”he said. Soon after his name was announced, Mann’s supporters started rejoicing and dancing to the beat of dhols. Mann thanked Kejriwal for reposing faith in him. His sister Manpreet Kaur and mother Harpal Kaur, who were present on the occasion, thanked the people of Punjab.                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #PunjabAAP                                     #PunjabCM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-poll-2022-aap-picks-bhagwant-mann-as-cm-candidate-in-punjab-362394
19-01-2022||Saurabh Malik||‘The Sacrilege’— Book ‘sparing none, including powerful politicians,’ to be released on Wednesday||Chandigarh, January 18Nearly five years have lapsed since the incidents of sacrilege, subsequent protests by the people and police firing tore apart the social fabric in Punjab, leaving two persons dead, several injured and wounds that refuse to heal even with time. Bringing out the truth behind the events before and after the incidents of sacrilege in the State is “The Sacrilege” — a non-fiction by Justice Ranjit Singh.“This book presents the results of the investigation sparing none, including powerful politicians, and is an eye-opener with startling revelations presented with facts. It is written in lucid and simple language unfolding the tragedy of events that occurred,” says Justice Ranjit Singh — a former Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, who headed the commission of inquiry set up to look into the incidents of sacrilege.The book, having the potential to affect the fate of the impending assembly elections in the State, is scheduled to be released on Wednesday noon at the Chandigarh Press Club by former Chief Justices, Justice S.S. Sodhi and Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, along with former Supreme Court Judge, Justice HS Bedi and Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge Justice Nawab Singh.Justice Ranjit Singh says the book dwells deep into the circumstances leading to the incidents of sacrilege and the events that unfolded after it, including the affixing of posters and scattering of “holy angs of Saroop of Guru Granth Sahib ji”.“It hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community and the entire nation, leaving indelible scars, which are impossible to heal. Not only was blatant sacrilege committed, it was unfortunately followed by the firing of police personnel on innocent protesters leading to loss of human life. Various investigations by a special investigating team and a former Judge into these cases made little headway, leaving the public clamouring for justice,” says Justice Ranjit Singh.Talking about the commission and its report, Justice Ranjit Singh says it carried out the investigation without bias. “The book, for the first time, has brought out the complete truth in the public domain,” Justice Ranjit Singh adds.The firing at Kotkapura took place on October 14, 2015, after sacrilege. In his report tabled before the Vidhan Sabha, Justice Ranjit Singh asserted the responsibility of action at Kotkapura to forcefully evict the protestors sitting on peaceful dharna squarely lied with the police.Justice Ranjit Singh had added the incident of sacrilege was such that the public was bound to react in the manner it did. In any case, it was not unusual for the public to sit on dharna to protest. The compulsion on the part of the police to act was due to pressure from the then government.                                     #GuruGranthSahib                                     #JusticeRanjitSingh                                     #sacrilege||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/the-sacrilege%E2%80%94-book-sparing-none-including-powerful-politicians-to-be-released-on-wednesday-362378
19-01-2022||Ruchika M Khanna||Bhagwant Mann is AAP's CM candidate for Punjab polls||Chandigarh, January 18Bhagwant Mann is the Punjab chief ministerial face of Aam Aadmi Party.His name was declared by party’s national convenor Arvind Kejriwal at Mohali on Tuesday.Though the declaration of Mann’s name for the chief ministerial candidate was a mere formality, as his name had been okayed by the party’s top brass last month, Kejriwal announced the decision based on a telephonic poll initiated by the party to allow voters to choose their CM candidate.Announcing the results, Kejriwal said some people had voted for him even, though he had declared that he was not a candidate and these votes were declared invalid. “Everywhere I went, people would ask me about the party’s CM face. I would say that the party would choose a face that everyone will be proud of. We decided to conduct a poll so as to allow the people to choose their CM candidate. An astounding 93 per cent voters voted in favour of Bhagwant Mann,” he said, declaring him as the party’s CM face.Mann, while thanking people for choosing him and the party for reposing faith in him, said that he was pulled into politics after his political satires gelled with the common man and they wanted him to help them. “Punjab is plagued by too many problems threatening the state’s future as well as future of its people. Unemployment, drug addiction, unviable agriculture - these issues do not allow me to sleep at night. If we win, we will ensure that we work only for the poor, underprivileged and deserving, not the kin of rich and powerful,” he said.On this occasion, his sister, Manpreet Kaur and mother, Harpal Kaur, too, spoke and thanked the people of Punjab for choosing him.                                     #AAP                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #CMcandidate                                     #Punjab||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-to-announce-its-cm-candidate-for-punjab-polls-in-hours-from-now-issues-detailed-schedule-362293
