Punjab received 2 mm rain against the normal of 1.8 mm, while Haryana recorded 0.5 mm against the normal of 1.8 mm.As far as precipitation during the past 24 hours is concerned, IMD data showed that there has been a massive surplus in the aforementioned three states. Rain has been above normal by 650 percent in Himachal, 283 percent in Punjab and 73 percent in Haryana, IMD data showed.According to IMD, the minimum temperatures remained above normal by 2 to 5 degree Celsius over most parts of north India during the past 24 hours. The weatherman does not expect any significant change in minimum temperatures during the next 4-5 days and nor is there any prediction of a cold wave over north India in this period.The wet spell over northwest India is expected to continue till January 9 due to two consecutive active western disturbances. A western disturbance lies over Afghanistan and its neighbourhood while an induced cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Pakistan, with moisture feeding from Arabian Sea over northwest India. This will result in widespread light to moderate rain or snow continuing over many parts of north India on January 5.Thereafter, an intense western disturbance is very likely to affect northwest India from the night of January 6 onwards, leading to widespread rain or snow over the western Himalayan region as well as plains of Punjab and Haryana during January 7-9, the IMD has predicted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-india-gets-surplus-rain-but-temperature-remains-above-normal-358460

Action would be initiated against those roaming around without masks. Individuals carrying certificates issued by their counsels regarding their “required presence” would be allowed to enter.  “The court should not insist upon the personal appearance of the complainants in routine cases rather the personal appearance of the complainant should be insisted upon if he is supposed to make statement before the court”, it said.The readers have also been directed to furnish list of witnesses supposed to appear in the court before the date.Amritsar district and sessions judge Harpreet Kaur also came out with a new roster for all the judicial officers in the District Courts and Sub-Divisional Courts at Ajnala and Baba Bakala.

05-01-2022||New Delhi||Security lapse: Congress tried to physically harm PM Modi, alleges BJP||The BJP on Wednesday launched an all-out attack on the Congress over the breach in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab, alleging it wanted to physically harm him as repeated defeats in elections have taken the party on the path of “insanity”.Top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda, lashed out at the Congress, which is in power in the state, over the incident.Nadda accused the Congress of trying “all possible tricks to scuttle” Modi’s programmes, including a rally, in the state. Union Minister Smriti Irani asked whether the Congress leaders were “happy that the prime minister was on the verge of death”.Hitting out at the state government after Modi’s rally was called off and another programme disrupted as protesters blocked his route breaching the security protocol, Nadda said what is extremely worrisome is that the incident was also a big security lapse.In his tweets, Shah said, what was witnessed in the state is “Congress-made” and a trailer of how this party thinks and functions.“Repeated rejections by the people have taken them on the path of insanity. The topmost echelons of the Congress owe an apology to the people of India for what they have done,” he said.Noting that his ministry has sought a detailed report on the security breach in Punjab, Shah said such dereliction of security procedure in the prime minister’s visit is totally unacceptable and that accountability will be fixed.Modi’s Punjab visit was cut short as he was stranded on a flyover for 20 minutes due to a blockade by protesters.According to a Home Ministry statement, after the serious lapse in security, Modi’s convoy decided to return without attending an event at a martyrs’ memorial at Hussainiwala. The prime minister also could not attend a rally in Ferozepur.Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Union Minister Smriti Irani blasted the Congress alleging planted political instruments were given political patronage by the party’s government in Punjab to breach Modi’s security.“Never before in the history of our country has a state government knowingly constructed a scenario where the prime minister of the country will be brought in harm’s way,” she said.“The Congress failed in its murderous intentions on the holy land of Punjab... Congress leaders were expressing joy over the prime minister’s security breach. Were they happy that Prime Minister Modi was on the verge of death?” Irani posed.Hitting out at the Punjab government, she alleged police functionaries in a state were “directed to breach the security of the Prime Minister of India and cause him physical harm”.In a series of tweets, Nadda sought to put the state government in a dock over its alleged lapses.“Protestors were given access to the Prime Minister’s route while the Punjab CS (chief secretary) and DGP gave assurances to SPG that the route is clear. To make matters worse, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi refused to get on the phone to either address the matter or solve it. The tactics used by the Congress government in Punjab would pain anyone who believes in democratic principles,” he said.Nadda alleged that the state police was instructed to prevent people from attending Modi’s rally and a large number of buses were stranded because of the high-handedness of the police in connivance with the protesters.In doing so, they did not bother that the prime minister was to pay tributes to Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters, and lay the foundation stone for key development works, the BJP president said.“By their cheap antics, Congress government in Punjab has shown that they are anti-development and have no respect for freedom fighters too,” he said, alleging it was done as the ruling party in the state fears a resounding defeat in the upcoming Assembly polls.“It is sad that the prime minister’s visit to launch development projects worth thousands of crores for Punjab was disrupted. But we will not let such cheap mentality hinder the progress of Punjab and will continue the effort for the development of Punjab,” Nadda said.Chief Minister Channi on Wednesday expressed regret after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to cut short his visit to the state, but asserted that there was no security lapse.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Nadda should stop indulging in blame game and the BJP should instead introspect its “anti-farmer” attitude. He alleged that lack of crowd at Modi’s rally was a factor being the prime minister calling off his trip.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh, who is from Punjab, said what happened in the state was a matter of shame for the Channi government.He alleged that Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu had joined hands with subversive and anti-national forces to foil the democratic right of the prime minister and the BJP to address public meetings.Lashing out at the Congress, BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh said, “Politicisation of administration and police reaches new low under Congress in Punjab today. After the Emergency in 1975, it has committed the second grave mistake today. Hon’ble PM’s security was compromised. Congress and the leadership will pay for this heavily in days to come.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/security-lapse-congress-tried-to-physically-harm-pm-modi-alleges-bjp-358457
05-01-2022||New Delhi||No security breach in PM Modi's convoy, BJP should introspect its 'anti-farmer attitude': Surjewala||There was no security breach in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security, the BJP should stop blaming Punjab government for failing to get crowds for PM’s rally and should introspect on its “anti-farmer attitude”, Congress chief spokesman Randeep Surjewala said on Wednesday.“We reject the remarks of IYC chief on PM Modi’s rally, and we also take strong exception to Union Minister Smriti Irani’s highly intemperate remarks bordering on political instability. PM Modi changing programme at the last minute is not in our domain, he’s the PM but if you change route at the last minute you need time to deploy security along the roads. The SPG should’ve advised PM not to travel by road when there was no advance arrangement made and if 400 farmers came to protest should we have shot them?” asked Surjewala.Farmers are not terrorists who had come, there was no breach of security, these were people protesting anti farmer attitude of the PM and the BJP, he said.“They’re neither terrorists nor naxals and therefore they were being physically removed. There was a lag of 15 minutes in them being physically removed. The PM saw this as an opportunity to cancel the rally in which there was no one to hear him,” Surjewala said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-security-breach-in-pm-modis-convoy-bjp-should-introspect-its-anti-farmer-attitude-surjewala-358444
05-01-2022||Chandigarh||BJP, SAD, Capt Amarinder slam Punjab govt for PM Modi's 'security breach'||BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Wednesday blasted the Congress government in Punjab for engineering a security threat for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was going to address a public meeting in Ferozepur. Chugh said it’s a matter of shame for the Channi government for not allowing the prime minister to address the public meeting.  Chugh squarely blamed Channi and Punjab PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu for joining hands with subversive and anti-national forces to foil the democratic right of the prime minister and the BJP to address public meetings. Chugh said it was the responsibility of the Congress government to ensure law and order for the PM’s visit but entire Punjab is hanging its head in shame today. The prime minister, he said, had always been thinking of welfare of farmers and it was with due respect to them that he decided to repeal the agriculture laws. “But Channi and Sidhu are dancing to the tune of Pakistan ISI. Time has come for Punjab to wake up to nefarious designs of the two,” Chugh added. Meanwhile, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma blamed the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government for the security lapse.He claimed that the Congress got scared of the event and tried all possible tricks to scuttle Modi’s visit.Sharma alleged that the Punjab Police was instructed to prevent people from attending the rally.He said a large number of buses and other vehicles carrying BJP workers and other people were stranded.He claimed that the police connived with protesters blocking the movement of those headed for the rally.Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday said the major security lapse which occurred en route Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Hussainiwala was reflective of the total collapse of the law and order machinery in Punjab and that Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi was solely to blame for this crisis.In a statement in Chandigarh, the SAD president said “the incident makes it clear that there is no government whatsoever in the state. The infighting in the Punjab Congress has made the chief minister totally ineffective and the situation has become such that there is no clear command over the law and order machinery. This was witnessed today also with the chief minister and Home Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa speaking in two different voices over the same incident”.Sukhbir Badal said the situation was of the Punjab Congress party’s own making.Amarinder Singh calls for President's rule in PunjabFormer Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday called for President’s rule in the state after a breach was reported in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security.Amarinder said Channi government had utterly failed in ensuring law and order in the state.Modi on Wednesday returned without addressing a rally in the poll-bound state after his convoy got stuck in a road blockade near Hussainiwala.“If we have to keep our state safe and keep law and order system here, then I think President’s rule should be imposed,” the Punjab Lok Congress chief told the media after addressing a rally here, which was also scheduled to be addressed by Modi.Amarinder, who left Congress to form his own party, has allied with BJP to contest the upcoming polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/channi-sidhu-caused-security-threat-to-pm-modi-%C2%A0both-playing-in-isi-hands-chugh-358435

It claimed that the High Court had not imposed any stay on the trial of the case.“Keeping in view our submission, the court has dismissed the application of Sharma and adjourned the case for January 18 for arguments on the framing of charges,” said Pankaj Taneja, public prosecutor, appearing for the SIT. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/plea-to-defer-proceedings-in-behbal-firing-case-dismissed-358225

Bhullar’s predecessor Ashwani Kapur, too, had a short term lasting less than two months. There are four ruling party MLAs, including two Cabinet ministers, who have an interest in the affairs of the Police Department. They are ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa (Dera Baba Nanak) and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa (Fatehgarh Churian), and legislators Fateh Jung Bajwa (Qadian) and Balwinder Laddi (Sri Hargobindpur).At one time, Batala ex-MLA Ashwani Sekhri, too, had been given unbridled powers. “Batala is a perfect case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. It should actually be run from a single command and without interference,” said a former SSP. Last week’s bank robbery at Bahadur Hussian proved to be decisive for Bhullar. Heads were bound to roll and the hammer fell on him. Officers say every time there is a spurt in crime, instead of backing the incumbent officers, the political class brings in replacements loyal to it.“With an officer of the SSP rank being reduced to a lame duck, lower-level officials rarely obey orders of seniors.

The Bench also made it clear that living together was not a compulsory exercise and marriage was a “tie between two parties”.The ruling by the Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri came in a case where the respondent-wife was not staying with the appellant-husband for the last 18 years and was not ready to give mutual divorce to him.The Bench asserted respondent-wife was financially secure as she was working as a permanent lecturer. The parties were staying separately for the last around 18 years and the high court made several attempts to settle the dispute amicably, but in vain.The respondent-wife was insisting on staying with the appellant-husband, but he was not ready to take her back. “She does not want to move ahead and she is adamant that even appellant should not move ahead in his life,” the Bench observed.The matter was brought to the high court’s notice after the husband filed an appeal against a family court’s order dismissing his petition under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955, for dissolution of marriage between the parties by a decree of divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion. The Bench was assisted in the matter by counsel Jagmohan Singh Ghuman and Saurabh Arora.The Bench observed the issue for consideration was whether the wife’s disinclination to give mutual divorce to the appellant-husband would amount to cruelty towards him and whether the relationship between them had come to an end.“In the present case, firstly efforts were made to resolve the matrimonial dispute through the process of mediation, which is one of the effective modes of an alternative mechanism in resolving the personal disputes, but the mediation failed between the parties,” the Bench observed.Applying the ratio of the SC judgments, the Bench allowed the appeal and ordered the setting aside of the family court’s judgment, while granting decree of divorce to the parties. “However, we direct the appellant-husband to make an FD of Rs 10 lakh in the name of the respondent-wife,” the Bench concluded. — TNSCouple not staying together for 18 yrsThe ruling by the Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri came in a case where the respondent-wife was not staying with the appellant-husband for the last 18 years and was not ready to give mutual divorce to him||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-granting-divorce-disastrous-if-no-chance-of-living-together-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-358219

The High Court collegium had last met almost three years back for recommending the names of sessions judges for elevation and nearly one-and-a-half years back for advocates. The HC will reopen on Wednesday after a short winter break with a shortage of 36 judges and a pendency of over 4,47,890 cases.Collegium suggested elevation of judicial officers in ’19Available information suggests that the last time the collegium recommended the names of judicial officers for elevation as High Court judges was on March 14, 2019. As many as seven judicial officers were recommended for elevation by the then Chief Justice in consultation with his two senior colleagues.The Supreme Court collegium finally recommended the elevation of six judicial officers in September 2019 and they were administered the oath in November 2019. It is believed that at least six senior District and Sessions Judges in Haryana have retired since the collegium last finalised and forwarded the names for elevation. The number is believed to be almost the same in Punjab.Even if the names are finalised now for elevation, it will take a long time for the completion of process. A testimony to this effect is provided by the fact that five advocates recommended for elevation in August 2020 were administered oath as the High Court judges only in October last year.The process of appointing judges is, in fact, lengthy and time consuming. Once cleared by the states and the Governors after recommendations of the High Court collegium, the file containing the names with intelligence bureau reports is placed before the SC collegium when it meets. The names cleared for elevation are then sent to the Union Law Ministry before their warrants of appointment are signed by the President. The entire exercise can take several months, if not taken up on priority basis.Justice Ajay Tewari and Justice Sant Parkash are retiring in April this year, followed by Justice Fateh Deep Singh in July and Justice Amol Rattan Singh in August. Justice Rajan Gupta of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, posted as a judge of the Patna High Court, too, retires in September 22.The Judges retiring next year are Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa, Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu, Justice BS Walia, Justice Jaishree Thakur, Justice Harminder Singh Madaan, Justice Sudhir Mittal, Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma.Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sabina, Judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court but transferred out, also retire next year. The tenure of the Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Justice Rajesh Bindal, whose parent High Court is the Punjab and Haryana, will end in April 2023, if not elevated to the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/16-judges-retiring-in-2-yrs-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-stares-at-crisis-358218

Feeling so many emotions right now. I knew nothing about the polar world three years ago and it feels so surreal to finally be here. It was tough getting here and I want to thank everybody for their support,” she wrote. “This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves, and I want you to be able to do it without being labelled a rebel. I have been told no on many occasions and told to ‘just do the normal thing', but we create our own normal," Chandi said.A post shared by Preet Chandi (@polarpreet)  She uploaded a live tracking map of her trek and also posted regular blogs of her journey to the snow-capped region. “Day 40 – Finished. Preet has just made history becoming the first woman of colour to complete a solo expedition in Antarctica,” reads the final entry of her blog."You are capable of anything you want. No matter where you are from or where your start line is, everybody starts somewhere. I don't want to just break the glass ceiling; I want to smash it into a million pieces,” she said.A post shared by Preet Chandi (@polarpreet)  As part of a Medical Regiment in the northwest of England, Chandi's primary role is to organise and validate training for medics in the Army as Clinical Training Officer.Currently based in London, she is completing her masters degree in Sports and Exercise Medicine, part-time, at Queen Mary's University in London and had dragged around two large tyres over the past few months for her polar training as a substitute for the heavy sledge she has been dragging along in Antarctica. “It definitely feels colder in the last degree where I'm at higher altitude. I haven't seen anyone here in the last degree and now I'm 15 nautical miles from the South Pole. I can't believe I'm almost there,” read her entry from Sunday, a day before her milestone.She also used her time in the cold to think about wedding plans for when she returns to England, having been engaged to Army reservist fiance David Jarman before setting off on her expedition.The couple are expected to be reunited in Chile when she returns from the South Pole later this month. “I read somewhere that when you ask people to be your bridesmaids it's nice to do it in a special way, so all the way from Antarctica I would love nothing more than for you to be my bridesmaids. Sonia Chandi, Rachel Tucker-Norton, Kamal Dhamrait, Tig Bridge, Hannah Sawford (or Hannah Smith now) and Collette Davey,” Chandi wrote. “I love you all and would love you to be my bridesmaids. I think at least three hen do's are required. That's normal right? But even if it's not normal that's never been anything to stop me,” she added.Chandi says she has always been keen to push the human body to its limits and sees her latest mission as part of this wider research.As an "endurance athlete", she has run marathons and ultra-marathons and, as an Army officer, completed large-scale exercises and deployments in Nepal, Kenya and most recently a six-month United Nations peacekeeping tour to South Sudan. “Anything ambitious can feel out of reach at the beginning but every bit of training I complete brings me closer to my goal. My training expeditions in Greenland and Norway have helped prepare me and my goal is now in reach,” she declared before setting off for the South Pole in November.
