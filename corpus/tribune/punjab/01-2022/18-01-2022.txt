18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Bhagwant Mann: Politics no laughing matter for former comedian||Earlier, when people saw his face, they laughed. Now, AAP’s Punjab unit president Bhagwant Singh Mann says, they weep when they see him and narrate the problems they face.The Punjab president of Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party made the observation at a press meet on Tuesday, soon after his party declared him its CM face for next month’s assembly polls. Mann was contrasting his past as a comedian with his present role.Mann, 48, remains a crowd-puller even as a politician, winning twice from the Sangrur Lok Sabha seat. In the AAP poll to pick the party’s chief ministerial candidate, 93 per cent of those who called or sent messages to a party number chose him.Born in Sangrur’s Satoj village in October, 1973, Mann enrolled for a BCom degree from Shaheed Udham Singh government college in Sunam in the same district. He didn’t complete the course, but took part in several youth festivals.Later, he brought out comedy videos and music albums. He went on to perform in Punjabi movies, including ‘22g Tusi Ghaint Ho’ and ‘Police in Pollywood’.The Great Indian Laughter Challenge, a TV show on which Navjot Singh Sidhu—now the state unit chief of the rival Congress—also made many appearances, was a high point in his career as an entertainer.At the Mohali press conference, Mann said people don’t laugh when they see his face now.“Now, it is completely reverse. When I go to any public meeting or any meeting, people now cry when they look at my face while narrating their problems and saying save us, we are ruined, our children are in bad company…,” he said.Mann’s political career began when he joined the Manpreet Singh Badal-led People’s Party of Punjab in 2011. Badal had floated the outfit after leaving the Shiromani Akali Dal. Later, the PPP merged with the Congress.Mann fought from the Lehra assembly constituency in Sangrur as a PPP candidate in 2012 and lost to senior Congress leader Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.In 2014, Mann joined the AAP and was pitted against Akali heavyweight Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa for the Sangrur Lok Sabha seat. He won by over two lakh votes. The AAP itself went on to win four Lok Sabha seats in Punjab.Mann unsuccessfully contested the 2017 assembly polls against SAD’s Sukhbir Singh Badal for the Jalalabad seat. But Arvind Kejriwal’s won 20 seats in the 117-member Punjab Assembly, ending up as the state’s main opposition party. Mann was made its state unit chief.He resigned from the post in 2018 after Arvind Kejriwal apologised to Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia in a defamation case. He was back in the post next year.Mann won the Sangrur seat again in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with a margin over one lakh votes.During his political career, Mann has been hounded by accusations that he has a “drinking problem”.In 2016, the then AAP MP Harinder Singh Khalsa complained against him to the Lok Sabha Speaker, seeking a change in his seat. He alleged that Mann, who sat next to him, reeked of liquor.At a 2019 rally in Barnala, in the presence of Kejriwal and his mother, Mann vowed to give up liquor. Mann had then accused his political rivals’ of defaming him by portraying him as a “born drunkard”.The charge came up again in a TV interview on Tuesday.“I have countered this. The public has also given its response,” he said, referring to his re-election from Sangrur. The opposition keeps hurling this baseless charge as it doesn’t have anything else to say against him, Mann claimed.                                      #AAP                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #Kejriwal                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhagwant-mann-politics-no-laughing-matter-for-former-comedian-362367
18-01-2022||GS Paul||Navjot Sidhu congratulates AAP for declaring 'CM' candidate||Amritsar, January 18Reacting to A declaring Bhagwant Mann as its CM face in the ensuing Punjab polls, PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu said that the ‘groom’ could be there, yet it would be prerogative of the people of Punjab to accept him or not.Sidhu who visited East constituency today, showed a glimpse of the ‘Punjab model’, focussing on illegal sand mining that has been rampant in the state.While the Congress was still lagging behind in projecting its CM candidate for 2022, AAP has taken the lead in declaring Mann as its official CM candidate.“If ‘groom’ has been decided, I congratulate them. But, the people of Punjab will take a call on whether they would also like to marry this groom or not. ‘abhi Dilli badi door hai’”, he said.Sidhu also made it clear that the next elections would be fought on a specific pro-Punjab ‘agenda’ and that he stood by the welfare of the state.“Our high command (Congress) is intelligent. Whatever it decide, would be in favour of Punjab. I have a firm belief on the people of Punjab that they would vote for Punjab model, on an agenda. Sidhu stands for a roadmap. If agenda is there, Sidhu is there. If the motive is just to grab the power, then Sidhu would not be there,” he said.Giving a glimpse of Punjab model in respect of illegal sand mining, he categorically advocated for sole control of the government over sand mining.He viewed that the Punjab government-oriented mining corporation be formed by disbanding the existing thekedari system.“Disbandment of thekedari system on the lines of Telangana government has to be adopted here. The sand is the resource of the government and it has to be sold at fixed rate, weight and date. As long as thekedari system exists people won’t have access to cheaper sand,” he said.Sidhu added that it would be the transport mafia that misappropriated sand. “That has to be curbed by making state owned stock yards, online booking at fixed rate, delivery by specific colour trucks and charging them GST. The rates of sand have to be fixed to be offered to the end consumer at cheaper rate. This will also generate around Rs 2000-Rs 3000 crore revenue to the state annually and at least 60,000 jobs,” he said.On Enforcement Directorate conducting raids on those allegedly involved in illegal sand mining, including one of relatives of CM Charanjit Singh Channi, he whiled away by saying that no one could be held guilty until unless it was proved and the wrongdoers would be liable to answer.                                     #AAP                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #NavjotSidhu                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-congratulates-aap-for-declaring-cm-candidate-362363

18-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||3 Cong MLAs, ex-MLA seek Rana Gurjeet’s expulsion from party over son standing as rebel||Jalandhar, January 18A day after Punjab minister Rana Gurjeet Singh openly announced that he would support his son Rana Inder Partap Singh, who has announced to stand as a rebel candidate from Sultanpur Lodhi seat after being denied the party ticket, three sitting Congress MLAs and a former legislator have written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking the minister’s expulsion from the party.While also sending across the same copy to party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, PPCC chief Navjot Sidhu and Punjab incharge Harish Chaudhary, the Congress leaders have demanded that the “nomination of Rana Gurjeet Singh from Kapurthala constituency be immediately withdrawn and that he should be removed from the party’s membership so as to send across a strong message to the leaders, who are weakening the party”.Among those who have come in the support of Sultanpur Lodhi legislator Navtej Singh Cheema are Phagwara MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, Jalandhar North MLA Bawa Henry and Bholath ex-MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira.Alleging interference not just in Sultanpur Lodhi, all the complaining party leaders have said that they too have been feeling the heat, “Rana Gurjeet Singh is trying his best to destroy the winnability of the Congress party in the forthcoming elections. He is weakening the Congress by deliberately interfering in various constituencies of Doaba region such as Sultanpur Lodhi, Phagwara, Bholath, Jalandhar North, Banga etc.We had apprised the state leadership of the party about his anti-party activities but unfortunately he was re-instated in the Punjab Cabinet, post his resignation in 2018.”The Congress leaders have alleged that fielding of his son from Sultanpur Lodhi is nothing but a “gross violation of party discipline as well as equal to stabbing the party in the back in the crucial moment”. They have also blamed him of being pally with the rivals, “Rana is doing this because he is playing into the hands of opposition parties especially the BJP. He has close ties with the BJP due to his liquor business and sugar mills situated in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and other states.”The leaders have also alleged that Rana is using his ties with ex-CM Capt Amarinder Singh. “Rana recently helped his confidante Amandeep Singh alias Gora Gill in joining Punjab Lok Congress. With Rana’s support, Gora Gill is all set to contest from Bholath constituency. Rana has conspired with the BJP and Capt Amarinder Singh to destroy the Congress party in Punjab. Under this conspiracy, he is publicly making baseless allegations against PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu, which is also a violation of party discipline. Such indiscipline activities are damaging the party situation. Even the think tanks of Punjab are expressing worry over Congress’s situation. It is being predicted that going with the current indiscipline activities, Congress may repeat its history of 2012 election,” they alleged.                                     #Congress                                     #PunjabAssemblypolls                                     #RanaGurjeet                                     #SoniaGandhi                                     #SultanpurLodhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-cong-mlas-ex-mla-seek-rana-gurjeets-expulsion-from-party-over-son-standing-as-rebel-362342
18-01-2022||---||Not the Q today: Harish Choudhary on whether Channi is Cong CM face||Aditi TandonNew Delhi, January 18The Congress on Tuesday again skipped questions on whether it would project Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi as the party's face in the February 20 Punjab elections.Moments after alleging that the ruling BJP was targetingChanni with ED raids because he was the most popular leader of Punjab, AICC in-charge of the state Harish Choudhary went on to steer clear of whether the party, in that case, would project Channi as the CM face in the forthcoming elections."That is not the question today. The question is whether the ED raids can muzzle CM Channi or Punjabis and Punjab. Who will be CM is a secondary issue. The history of the state is testimony to the fact that Punjabis cannot be suppressed. It is a mistake of BJP to think they can pressurize CM Channi with intimidation and fear," Choudhary said.Earlier he had said all the surveys in Punjab were saying that CM Channi was the most popular in Punjab."Punjabis were maligned during the farmers' agitation. But Punjabiyat stood strong. The BJP is forgetting that Channi is not Capt Amarinder. The attempt to muzzle CS Channi is a mistake and will fail. He will keep standing tall. The BJP is anxious about the good governance of CM Channi. During the PM's tour to Punjab Punjabis were held responsible. It was not the responsibility of CM Channi to fill BJP's empty chairs. The CM stood with the Punjabis and did not agree to lathi charge them even when a situation was created."The Congress continues to struggle with the issue of leadership in Punjab, with PCC chief Navjot Sidhu and CM Channi both taking public stands in their own respective favour as CM faces.While Channi has said on the record that projecting a CM face would benefit the party electorally as it had done when Amarinder Singh was earlier projected, Sidhu has been vocal about his eligibility to lead Punjab Congress on more occasions than one.The Congress is so far going with the collective leadership of CM Channi, Sidhu and former state chief Sunil Jakhar to expand its pan community appeal in the state.                                     #Channi                                     #CongCMface                                     #harishchoudhary||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-the-q-today-harish-choudhary-on-whether-channi-is-cong-cm-face-362332
18-01-2022||New Delhi||ED raids on CM's kin an assault on Punjabiyat, voters will answer: Congress||The Congress on Tuesday said the Enforcement Directorate raids on the distant kin of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi were an assault on Punjab and Punjabiyat and people of the state would give a befitting reply to the ruling BJP for using ED as its "election department".Addressing a press conference here, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and AICC in charge for Punjab Harish Choudhary accused the BJP and Aam Aadmi Party of being in cahoots in the state, with Surjewala saying, "The AAP and BJP are working together in the state. When the PM's security was stalled briefly, who jumped to his defence? It was AAP and Arvind Kejriwal. Today neither CM Channi nor the media knew about the ED raids. Who gave the first statement on the issue? It was AAP. In Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa, AAP and BJP are working together. One party commits a wrong. The other jumps to defence."The Congress said Channi is not Capt Amarinder Singh who could be suppressed."All your surveys say CM Channi is most popular in Punjab. Punjabis were maligned during the farmers’ agitation also but Punjabiyat stood strong. The BJP is forgetting that Channi is not Capt Amarinder Singh. He is Charanjit Singh Channi. The attempt to muzzle him is a mistake. He will keep standing tall. The BJP is anxious about the good governance by Channi. During the PM's tour to Punjab, Punjabis were blamed. It was not the responsibility of CM Channi to fill the BJP's empty chairs. Even in that event, the CM stood with Punjabis and withstood the pressure to lathi-charge local farmers. This was not his mistake. Fake raids of ED cannot deter Congress leaders," Choudhary said.He said Arvind Kejriwal was working as BJP's B team in Punjab. "Kejriwal unfortunately did not stand with Punjab during the PM's tour of the state. The ED raid is a weapon being used. It was earlier used against Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav. Punjabis are intelligent. They will answer the BJP in the upcoming elections," the AICC in-charge said, with the Congress accusing the BJP of going after the Scheduled Castes and poor people of Punjab by way of ED raids.Surjewala said the Union government is "burning in the fire of revenge and is attacking farmers, Dalits and backward classes because they defeated the BJP in the recent bypolls.""The BJP's election department ED is at work again. Today we saw the limit of the BJP's vindictiveness. To seek revenge on SCs, they have unleashed the ED on the SC chief minister even when the CM and his family have nothing to do with the case," Surjewala said.The Congress cited the March 7, 2018 FIR lodged in a mining case at Rahon police station to say that none of the CM's relatives had been named in the case."One Kudratdeep is named among the accused. The case is ongoing. Kudratdeep's role in the case has not been established. Now, the ED has raided Bhupinder Singh Honey for being friends with Kudratdeep. Honey is the nephew of CM's sister-in-law but his name is not there in the FIR. How is the ED raiding him? When the ED found nothing against an SC chief minister and his family, the BJP has come into the electoral field with baseless charges," said Surjewala, terming the ED raids an assault on the dignity of Punjab and Punjabiyat which, he said, the poor and SCs of the state would avenge in the forthcoming polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ed-raids-on-cms-kin-an-assault-on-punjabiyat-voters-will-answer-congress-362331
18-01-2022||Jalandhar||Bhagwant Mann a compromise candidate for AAP: Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday said Bhgwant Mann is a compromise CM candidate for Punjab for the Aam Aadmi Party as no one was ready to lead the party in Punjab.Terming the nomination of Mann a stage-managed non-event, the SAD President said Kejriwal never wanted to make Mann the face of the party in Punjab. “He has been saying this in Mann’s presence that the party is looking for a capable candidate. It is a fact that AAP sounded out a number of prospective candidates but they all refused to lead the party. This is why the responsibility has been thrust on Mann after a make-believe survey.”Asserting that making Mann the face of the party reflected AAP’s bankruptcy, Badal said, “A desperate public relations exercise is under way to wash away Mann’s omissions and commissions and project him as a leader who can take on the mantle of the chief minister though his wayward behaviour is well-known.”Badal also asked Kejriwal to tell Punjabis in whom they should repose their trust now.“AAP has led a public campaign urging Punjabis to repose their trust in Kejriwal for more than a year. During the same period, Kejriwal has asserted that Mann is not capable of holding this post. Now when AAP has exhausted all options and chosen Mann to lead the party, it needs to explain why Punjabis should trust a leader who Kejriwal refused to endorse for more than a year.“Kejriwal cannot take Punjabis to be so naive as to approve his rubber-stamped candidate. They need a strong and decisive leadership as well a leader with a proven track record of conducting swift development as well as ensuring law and order and communal harmony in this border state. Bhagwant Mann does not fit the bill,” Badal said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhagwant-mann-a-compromise-candidate-for-aap-sukhbir-badal-362330
18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court extends interim anticipatory bail of Bikram Majithia; asks him to join probe when required||The Punjab and Haryana High Court directed senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Tuesday to continue to join the investigation as and when required in a drug case while making it clear that interim anticipatory bail granted to him would automatically stand vacated if arguments in the matter were not addressed on the next date of hearing. Punjab, meanwhile, told the court that Majithia had not extended full cooperation during the investigation.The case would now come up for “final arguments” on January 24. Majithia’s interim anticipatory bail would, at least, continue till then. The direction on joining investigation by Justice Lisa Gill came after advocate Arshdeep Singh Cheema on Majithia’s behalf requested for an adjournment after submitting that senior advocate RS Cheema had contracted Covid-19. Representing the State of Punjab, senior advocate P. Chidambaram did not oppose the adjournment request while submitting that the petitioner had joined the investigation but not extended full cooperation.Justice Gill asserted the court was not inclined to adjourn the matter. But keeping in view the circumstance and with the consent of counsel for the parties, the matter was being adjourned. “Needless to say, the petitioner shall, in the meantime, continue to join the investigation as and when required and in terms of conditions contained in the order dated January 10 and extend full cooperation to the investigating agency.Among other things, Majithia was asked to keep his mobile phone constantly on and share with the investigating agency his live location through WhatsApp. He was also directed to fully cooperate in the investigation and abide by the conditions, including an appearance before the investigating agency as and when required.He was further directed not to leave the country till the next date of hearing and provide his mobile number to the investigating agency. He was also asked not to directly or indirectly try contacting any of the witnesses or anyone connected with the case in any manner.Majithia was apprehending arrest after a case under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at Mohali on December 20, last year. He moved the high court after a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition. The case had attained political proportions, with Majithia claiming that the registration of the FIR was vitiated by political and ulterior motives.                                     #anticipatorybail                                     #BikramSinghMajithia                                     #drugcase                                     #HC                                     #investigation                                     #Majithia                                     #PunjabHaryanaHC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-extends-interim-anticipatory-bail-to-bikram-majithia-362325

It is clear that he (CM) and his family are involved in illegal sand mining. What can be expected for Punjab's future from a person whose family is involved in illegal mining,” he said.“We have been repeatedly saying that in his (Channi) cabinet, there are people who are involved in illegal sand mining and Channi sahab himself is giving patronage to them,” alleged Kejriwal.“Why Channi sahab did not throw them out? Why did he keep them in the cabinet,” he asked.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday raided multiple locations in poll-bound Punjab as part of a money laundering probe against the 'sand mafia' and companies linked to alleged illegal sand mining in the border state, officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/arvind-kejriwal-targets-charanjit-channi-over-illegal-sand-mining-following-ed-raids-362317
18-01-2022||New Delhi/Chandigarh||'Illegal' sand mining: Enforcement Directorate raids Punjab CM Channi’s relative, others||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday raided multiple locations in poll-bound Punjab, including those linked to a relative of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, as part of a money laundering probe against the ‘sand mafia’ and companies linked to alleged illegal sand mining in the border state, officials said.It seized about Rs 6 crore in cash during the action out of which around Rs 4 crore was recovered from a Ludhiana located premises linked to Bhupinder Singh alias Honey, the nephew of Channi’s sister-in-law.In all, a dozen locations in the state including Chandigarh, Mohali, Ludhiana and Pathankot were covered by the officials of the federal agency.The action that continued till late evening was being carried out with an armed escort of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel.Official sources said the raids are being undertaken under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Reacting to the raids, Channi told reporters that relatives of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee were raided during the assembly polls in that state and the “same pattern” is being followed by the ED in Punjab to “pressure” him, his ministers and Congress party members.“We are ready to handle the pressure...,” he said, adding he had no links with the case.The sources said Honey’s links with a person identified as Kudratdeep Singh are being investigated by the agency and the latter is the focus of their action. They said Honey and Singh are partners in a firm.Opposition parties have earlier linked Channi with the dealings of Honey which the former had denied.The ED action, the sources said, has been initiated after taking cognisance of a 2018 FIR of the Nawanshahr (Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district) Police and some other such police complaints against some companies and individuals alleged to be involved in the business of illegal sand mining in the state.A number of truck drivers and other operatives involved in the extraction and transportation of sand were named as accused in these police FIRs.The sources said the police FIR is only the start of an investigation and once the ED takes over a case under the PMLA, it is empowered to enlarge its probe to verify the role of all those who are linked to the alleged illegal activity including those giving “protection” to the sand mining mafia.The ED, the sources said, found that mining was being carried out at non-notified areas and the ‘sand mafia’ was diverting and laundering the illegally earned monies into creating personal and benami assets.Voting for 117 assembly seats in Punjab is slated on February 20.

18-01-2022||With the Congress choosing not to project any CM face for the forthcoming Assembly poll in the state||Charanjit Channi, Navjot Sidhu, Sunil Jakhar are Cong's poster boys||The hoardings with three big faces of the party and slogan ‘Navin soch-Nawan Punjab’ and a one-liner ‘Punjab di chardi kala, Congress mange sarbat da bhala’ (Positive attitude of Punjab, Congress seeks blessings for everyone) are being installed in various cities of Punjab. Surprisingly, the pictures of the senior AICC leaders or even Punjab in-charge Harish Chaudhary are not seen in the backdrop. Instead caricatures of common Punjabis, people from different religions, age and sections, including a farmer have been put up.Since the party does not want to annoy anyone at this crucial stage and take everyone along, Harish Chaudhary has been stressing that the Vidhan Sabha elections would be fought collectively with CM Channi as the Dalit face, Sidhu as the Jat face and Jakhar as the Hindu face. Sidhu had been objecting to Channi’s hoardings put up across the state. But today Punjab minister Rana Gurjeet Singh said putting up such hoardings implied raising a question mark on the working of the ‘tried and tested CM’ Charanjit Singh Channi. He said such an attempt would be suicidal to the party.The party leaders are learnt to have finalised the format of more new hoardings, which would focus on issues related to power tariff reduction, cut in fuel prices, starting new bus routes, offering free bus service to Kartarpur Sahib, making Punjabi compulsory in school education till Class X and introducing 6th Pay Commission for government employees, the recently taken decisions on which it is banking for the coming elections.                                     #CharanjitChanni,                                     #NavjotSidhu,                                     #SunilJakhar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/channi-sidhu-jakhar-are-congs-poster-boys-362279

The Bench was also told that a special team has been constituted. He further submitted that “Jagraj Singh, head warden in the jail, managed the entire show for providing mobile phone facility to the inmates. A sum of Rs 15, 000 to 50,000 was being charged”.The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after three petitions were filed for anticipatory bail in an FIR registered on July 5, 2021, for cheating and other offences under Sections 420 and 120-B of the IPC, besides the provisions of the Prisons Act, and the Prevention of Corruption Act in Kapurthala district.“The allegations against the petitioners are serious.

18-01-2022||Ravi Dhaliwal||Congress in dilemma over Batala Assembly seat||Batala, January 17The Batala Assembly seat has become the bone of contention among various stakeholders, with senior Congress leaders failing to arrive at a consensus on the name of its candidate.In the past seven elections held since 1985, this seat was always the last one to be announced by the party. Interestingly, on all these seven occasions the final nod has always gone in favour of ex-MLA Ashwani Sekhri, considered to be the party’s most prominent Hindu face in Gurdaspur district. This time, too, he is in contention and his name was expected to be on the first list of 86 nominees. Observers term the seat as the Achilles’ heel of the Congress as every time it is with much difficulty that the party arrives at a consensus.Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa was eyeing the territory. However, once his name was finalised from his old constituency, Sekhri should have been an automatic choice. However, his detractors have ensured he will have to fight every inch if he has to be re-nominated for the eighth successive time.Tripat’s son and Gurdaspur Zila Parishad Chairman, Ravi Nandan Bajwa, is also in the fray. In between this tug of war, the name of Rajinder Kumar Pappu Jaintipuria has cropped up. He was a close aide of Bikram Majithia before last month Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa pulled him to his side.In fact, Randhawa had accompanied him to Chandigarh where he was made to join the party in the presence of CM Charanjit Singh Channi. It is believed the CM is strongly backing Jaintipuria at the insistence of a US-based NRI.“Sekhri’s name was almost cleared but for the last minute push by the CM in favour of Jaintipuria,” said a leader engaged in distribution of tickets. Caste configurations have now come into play. A strong section of the leadership claims that like in the past, this time too Sekhri should be the candidate because “Batala is a predominantly a Hindu seat”.On December 27, PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu at a rally held in Batala had openly declared the candidature of Sekhri.Tug of war: Many claimants                                     #AshwaniSekhri                                     #Batala||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-in-dilemma-over-batala-362105

The person should not have to tell everyone he should be the CM.” As the actor speaks, a montage of CM Charanjit Channi’s visuals plays in the background.

18-01-2022||---||Punjab Congress firefights ahead of second list||Chandigarh, January 17Ahead of announcing the remaining 31 seats, the Punjab Congress has stepped up efforts to mollify leaders who have been denied the ticket in its first list of 86 candidates announced a few days ago.On Monday, senior party leader from Majitha, Bhagwant Singh Sachar, returned to the Congress fold hours after joining the BJP. He has been denied a ticket from Majha. Only yesterday, the party prevailed upon another senior party leader Mohinder Kaypee, who had been denied the ticket from the Adampur seat. The party has assured Kaypee of being allotted the Adampur seat in its review of seats already given.Regarding the announcement by Dr Manohar Singh, brother of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, to contest as an Independent candidate from Bassi Pathana, the CM said he would make his brother and party nominee Gurpreet Singh GP sit together and resolve the issue. The CM clarified there were no differences in his family on the issue. Sources said on seats where it wanted to replace the sitting MLA or had no candidate, the party was poaching suitable candidates.In case of Ferozepur Rural seat, the party has brought in AAP candidate Amandeep Singh Ashu Banger for the seat, as sitting MLA Satkar Kaur is likely to be denied the ticket. A party leader said more such candidates may be brought in at other places also.Phillaur, son switch to SAD(S)With the Congress fielding Vikramjeet Chaudhary from Phillaur, former minister Sarwan Singh Phillaur and his son Damanvir joined the SAD (Sanyukt) on Monday. Phillaur, a six-time MLA, was minister in the SAD-BJP govt (2012-17) but had quit in 2014 after his son’s name figured in a multi-crore drug scam.

18-01-2022||Ruchika M Khanna||Illegal mining hollows Punjab govt claims||Chandigarh, January 17The cartelisation of the business of mining minor minerals from riverbeds, leading to high prices of sand and gravel, had cost the previous Akali Dal-BJP dispensation a near rout in the 2014 General Election and was one of the reasons for their humiliating defeat in the 2017 Assembly polls.The Congress had stormed to power on the promise of doing away with the “mining mafia” and bring the rates of sand and gravel down. But the lure of this “gold” is something that the political class seems unable to ignore.Charanjit Singh Channi, CMBrought in policy, Fixed ratesMy govt has controlled mining mafia with efficient monitoring and introducing new policy which suites consumers. We fixed the rates at the pithead, the orders of which were implemented strictly.No wonder then that the mining business continues to be controlled by the political class, spread across the political spectrum. The only difference in the mining business that happened was that the shareholding changed hands — those owing allegiance to the party in power gets 70 per cent share of the proceeds, while the “outgoing” political dispensation’s share is reduced to 30 per cent. Also, most of the mining sites are now in control of big mining contractors from outside the state who have formed syndicates as is prevalent in the liquor trade.Daljit Singh Cheema, Akali DalGovt hand in gloveThe gov t has been hand in glove with mining mafia. Not only have they monopolised sand mining, but have also plundered environment, with the Sutlej changing its course and many hillocks in Nurpurbedi area being levelled.Not only has the syndication of the mining business led to monopolistic practices in the sale of these minor minerals, but rampant and excess mining have proved to be detrimental to the ecology. There have been instances of illegal mining from deep earth by using submersible pumps causing erosion of hills in the Nurpur Bedi area.It is because of dabbling in this business that the Congress government suffered its first major blow within the first year in power — minister Rana Gurjeet Singh was eased out after he was found allegedly involved in getting contracts for mining of sand and gravel in the name of his employees (he secured a Cabinet berth again later).Kultar Singh Sandhwan, AAPDrain on coffersThe Congress government has patronised mining mafia. Under their rule, the mafia has been ruling the roost and doesn’t care about law or environment. Illegal mining has drained the state’s coffers.The then Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, had also reportedly claimed to be in possession of a list of 40 MLAs of his own party allegedly involved in illegal mining. Even after stepping down, the former CM has been threatening to release this list and “expose” his former party colleagues.His bête noire and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has also been raising the issues of rampant illegal mining in the state and government efforts to make the sand and gravel cheaper failing to yield results. Recently, principal Opposition party Aam Aadmi Party, too, exposed the rampant illegal mining in the constituency of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, and even demanded his resignation on the issue, while accusing him of being in cahoots with the “mining mafia”. In the past four and a half years, attempts have been made twice to cap the prices at which sand and gravel can be sold, but to little avail. All this goes on to prove how rampant the menace is and how difficult it has been to find the political will to break the hold of “mining mafia”.Cong’s past assuranceThe Congress had promised to root out mining mafia and bring down the prices of sand and gravel for common man. Former minister and PCC chief Navjot Sidhu has been pushing for setting up a government corporation to run mining business.Action taken so farCaught on back foot                                     #IllegalMining                                     #MiningMafia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illegal-mining-hollows-punjab-govt-claims-362100

18-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi to talk to his brother over denial of party ticket to him||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday said he would talk to his brother Manohar Singh over the denial of the Congress ticket to him.Channi made the remark after his brother said he will contest as an independent from the Bassi Pathana assembly seat against the sitting Congress MLA.Channi also indicated that he may try to prevail upon his brother not to jump in the fray against the sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP from the constituency.Channi’s brother Manohar Singh, who was eyeing a Congress ticket from the Bassi Pathana assembly seat, had on Sunday said he will contest as an independent from the constituency after the ruling party fielded its sitting legislator Gurpreet Singh GP.“He sought ticket but party denied it. GP (the sitting MLA) too is our brother. Will make them sit and talk and issue will be resolved,” Channi told reporters here.In its first list of 86 candidates, the Congress party on Saturday gave the ticket to party MLA Gurpreet Singh GP from Bassi Pathana (SC) seat.Manohar Singh had dubbed the decision of the Congress giving ticket to Gurpreet Singh GP as “injustice” to the people of the constituency and alleged that the sitting legislator was “incapable and ineffective.”Singh had said he took the decision to contest as an independent after meeting several councillors, village sarpanch and panch who asked him to fight the polls.Singh, an MBBS and MD, had in August last year resigned as a senior medical officer from Kharar Civil Hospital.Replying to a question on his brother saying he will contest as an independent, Channi said, “As far as my brother is concerned, we live in a joint family. My brother became a doctor after doing MD. He was employed as a government doctor and was posted in the Bassi Pathana as SMO.”“The MLA of the area GP got him transferred. He (Manohar) also told the MLA that he is the brother of the minister (Channi was a Minister then in the Amarinder Singh-led Cabinet). At this (after the MLA got him transferred), my brother took the decision to quit the job and later people of the area told him that he should contest the election.”Asked why had the MLA got his brother transferred, Channi replied, “Maybe he thought at that time that he may fight election.”Replying to another question, Channi said senior Punjab Congress leader and former MP Mohinder Singh Kaypee’s displeasure over denial of the ticket from the Adampur assembly seat was justified and added party will definitely think about this.“He is our tall leader, he has been our state unit president,” Channi said.Kaypee had on Sunday expressed his displeasure over denial of the ticket from the Adampur assembly seat, saying his family is targeted by the party every election.Earlier in the day, AAP leader Raghav Chadha had alleged that by denying tickets to the brother and another relative of Punjab Chief Minister Channi, the Congress has proved that it had made him CM merely for “using him as a tool” to get the Scheduled Caste votes.Apart from Channi’s brother, the CM’s relative Mohinder Singh Kaypee, who wanted the ticket from the Adampur seat in Jalandhar, was also denied it, said Chadha, alleging that Kaypee was denied the ticket because he was Channi’s relative.Chadha, however, had said the ruling party gave tickets to the sons of Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh and minister Brahm Mohindra.Chadha further alleged that the Congress in the past had appointed Sushil Kumar Shinde as the chief minister of Maharashtra for a few months to woo votes of a particular community and later after the elections, Shinde was removed.                                     #BassiPathana                                     #CMChanni                                     #Congress                                     #ManoharSingh                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-channi-to-talk-to-his-brother-over-denial-of-party-ticket-to-him-362070
