16-01-2022||Chandigarh||After CM Channi, BJP and SAD (Sanyukt) seek postponement of Punjab polls in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti||The BJP and its ally SAD (Sanyukt) have appealed to the Election Commission to postpone the February 14 assembly election in Punjab in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti, after the BSP and Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi made similar requests to the poll panel.The birth anniversary of Guru Ravidas falls on February 16.In a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner on Sunday seeking postponement of the election, Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said, “The state has substantial population of followers of Guru Ravidas ji, including the Scheduled Caste (SC) community which is about 32 per cent of the population of Punjab.”“On this pious occasion, millions of the devotees would visit Banaras in Uttar Pradesh to celebrate the gurparb. So it would not be possible for them to participate in the voting process. It is therefore requested to your goodself that the date of voting may be postponed so that these voters of Punjab could participate in the election process,” he wrote.Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) chief Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, in a letter to the poll panel, also sought that the date of voting be postponed.On January 13, Chief Minister Channi had urged the Election Commission to postpone the polling date by six days “for enabling around 20 lakh SC devotees to utilise their right to vote for the state legislative assembly”.A large number of SC devotees from the state are likely to visit Banaras in Uttar Pradesh from February 10 to 16. In such a situation, many people from this community would not be able to cast their votes for the state assembly, said Channi who belong to the SC community.Bahujan Samaj Party’s Punjab chief Jasvir Singh Garhi was the first to demand postponement of the polling.He requested the Election Commission to hold the polls on February 20, instead of February 14.Voting for Punjab’s 117 assembly seats is scheduled for February 14 and the counting of votes will take place on March 10.                                      #BJP                                     #ElectionCommission                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #SADSanyukt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-cm-channi-bjp-and-sad-sanyukt-seek-postponement-of-punjab-polls-in-view-of-guru-ravidas-jayanti-361823

16-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Channi's brother says will fight as independent from Bassi Pathana after Congress fields sitting MLA||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s brother Manohar Singh, who was eyeing a Congress ticket from Bassi Pathana assembly seat, on Sunday said he will contest as an independent from the constituency after the ruling party fielded its sitting legislator.In its first list of 86 candidates, the Congress on Saturday gave the ticket to party MLA Gurpreet Singh GP from Bassi Pathana (SC) seat.Manohar Singh dubbed the decision of the Congress giving ticket to Gurpreet Singh GP as “injustice” with the people of the constituency and alleged that the sitting legislator was “incapable and ineffective”.“Several prominent people of Bassi Pathana area have asked me to fight as an independent and I will go by what they have said. There is no chance of going back and I will surely fight the polls,” Manohar Singh told PTI over the phone.Singh had in August last year resigned as a senior medical officer from Kharar civil hospital. Singh has done his MBBS and MD. He also holds a postgraduate degree in journalism and has also studied law.He said he took the decision of contesting as an independent after meeting several councillors, village sarpanch and panch who asked him to fight the polls.“People told me it was wrong to give the ticket to him (Gurpreet Singh GP). He had earlier not done anything and now he has again been foisted upon,” said Singh.Singh said he will talk to his brother Channi and convince him about his decision.On the ‘one family-one ticket’ formula of the Congress for the upcoming assembly polls, Channi said the party fielded Vikramjit Singh Chaudhary, who is the son of Jalandhar MP Santokh Singh Chaudhary, from Phillaur seat.Similarly, Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh’s son Kamil Amar Singh has been given the ticket from the Raikot seat, he said.Last year, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu had inaugurated the poll office of Gurpreet Singh GP at Bassi Pathana constituency.Voting for Punjab’s 117 assembly seats will be held on February 14 and the counting of votes will take place on March 10.                                     #assemblypolls                                     #BassiPathana                                     #Channi                                     #Congress                                     #Punjab                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-channis-brother-says-will-fight-as-independent-from-bassi-pathana-after-congress-fields-sitting-mla-361807

The counting of votes will take place on March 10.According to sources, the circular issued from the Beas headquarters headed by Gurinder Singh Dhillon to all Radha Soami Satsang centres across the nation says the sect has “respect for all political parties as all are equal for us.” “To cast vote is the personal right of each individual. So, here we all should exercise our voting right after the application of mind and keeping in view the wellbeing of the entire society," said the circular.In the past too, the sect has refrained from asking its followers to exercise their vote in favour of a particular party.Meanwhile, sources said Dhillon is going abroad in a couple of days and is expected to return after a few weeks.Dera Radha Soami, also known as Dera Baba Jaimal Singh, is situated in Beas town -- nearly 45 kilometres from Amritsar city. It has a number of followers in Punjab, Haryana and many other states and is usually visited by political leaders before elections.Punjab goes to polls in a single phase of voting on February 14.                                      #Punjabpolls                                     #Radhasoami||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/assembly-polls-vote-as-you-see-fit-radha-soami-beas-sect-to-followers-361790

16-01-2022||---||Empowering women has always been on top of my agenda, says Punjab CM Charanjit Channi||Chandigarh, January 16Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday said empowering women has always been on top of his agenda as their empowerment is vital for the development of any society. "Empowering women is vital for the development of any society & it has always been on top of my agenda. No society can prosper without giving due respect to women. Have taken several path-breaking initiatives to empower them & I, their brother, shall always stand by their side," he tweeted. Channi also said for the short time (of 111 days) that he got as the chief minister before the model code of conduct came into force with the poll announcement, he did his best for the welfare of all."I have always stood for equal opportunities and worked for the progress and prosperity of the state and its people. With the little time I had, I did my best for the welfare of all. With your continuous support, we will soon restore the pristine glory of the State," he said in another tweet.A few days ago, the Punjab chief minister had claimed that "it will be a one-sided sweep" by the Congress. "We will win the election with an overwhelming majority," he had said, exuding confidence that the Congress will retain power with a big majority.He had also said he received a lot of love and respect from the people of the state.Channi had said the people are happy with the decisions taken by his government, which he said were aimed at the welfare of various sections. He had said that during the short time which he got, he has worked hard to ensure that decisions of his government make a difference in the lives of common people. Notably, the multi-corner fight this time is between the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal-BSP combine, BJP, which has stitched an alliance with the Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led SAD (Sanyukt), and the Punjab Lok Congress (PLC), led by Amarinder Singh, and the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha, a political front launched by various farmer bodies.   Amarinder Singh floated his party PLC after he quit the Congress following his unceremonious exit as the chief minister last year. The state will vote on February 14 and the counting will take place on March 10.                                      #CharanjitChanni                                     #Congress                                     #Punjabpolls                                     #womenempowerment||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/empowering-women-has-always-been-on-top-of-my-agenda-says-punjab-cm%C2%A0charanjit-channi-361777

However, many senior AAP leaders are projecting the decision as a big pro-democracy move of their party.Sangrur-based RTI activist Kamal Anand, who called on the AAP number released to take the feedback, said the AAP leadership had not learnt any lesson from its past mistakes. “Many see it a ploy to project a dummy candidate for CM face. AAP must make all call records public to prove the authenticity of its feedback taking exercise,” said Anand.Fake calls can create confusionSAD, Congress and even BJP leaders may also make calls on AAP number to give wrong feedback and cause confusion. How will party differentiate between genuine and fake calls? —Karamjit Singh, AAP Ex-workerWE know how to deal with theseWe have received over 4 lakh WhatsApp messages, 5.5 lakh calls and 1.2 lakh voice notes. We know how to differentiate between fake and genuine calls. —Harpal Cheema, AAP leaderPolitical analysts believe the AAP’s move could boomerang as it did not have many leaders who had pan-Punjab reach. In the past too, whenever there was any chorus about the CM face, the AAP leadership failed to act quickly and to the satisfaction of Punjab residents.“SAD, Congress and even BJP leaders would also make calls on AAP number to cause confusion. How the party will differentiate between genuine and fake calls? If Kejriwal sees any other having Mann-like reach, he should announce the name of that leader,” said Karamjit Singh from Mehal Kalan. He remained in AAP from 2014 to 2019 and worked hard for party.“Kejriwal wants to remove Bhagwant Mann from the list of CM contenders and ultimately occupy the chair. Mann would face the same fate as other Punjab AAP presidents had in past,” Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, SAD Sanyukt president told The Tribune.However, Leader of Opposition and AAP’s Dirba MLA Harpal Singh Cheema said Kejriwal had given Punjab residents a say in selecting their CM face. “To date, we have received around 4 lakh Whatsapp messages, 5.5 lakh calls, 1. 20 lakh voice notes and 750,00 messages. Our party has a mechanism and our leaders would announce the name of CM face after the end our campaign on January 17 to take the feedback.

In case of Jalalabad, currently represented by Congress MLA Raminder Awla, the party is also weighing its options. Awla is likely to get the ticket from Guruharshai.The party is also brainstorming on the Batala seat, from where former MLA Ashwani Sekhri is seeking the ticket. Qadian MLA Fateh Bajwa, who recently shifted to the BJP, has dismissed reports of returning back to the Congress fold. Sources say so far, the party has stuck to the ‘one family, one ticket’ criterion, but it remains to be seen whether it sticks to the formula while deciding on the remaining 38 seats.In the eventuality of the party allowing two candidates from a family, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s brother Dr Manohar Singh may contest from another reserved seat, as Bassi Pathana has been given to sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP.New faces are likely to be fielded from the Ferozepur Rural, Fazilka, Jalalabad, Gill, Sahnewal, Banga and Nawanshahr seats.Channi’s brother fails to make cutIn the eventuality of the party allowing two candidates from a family, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi's brother Dr Manohar Singh may contest from another reserved seat, as Bassi Pathana has been given to sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP.Channi: Put off polls for Ravidass JayantiChandigarh: Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, in a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner, Sushil Chandra, has sought postponement of the February 14 Assembly elections in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti that falls on February 16.

Non-inclusion of sitting MLA Tarsem Singh DC from the seat is being seen as a surprise move. Party insiders say the name of singer Lakhwinder Wadali is doing the rounds, while Navneet Kaur, a Youth Congress leader, and Tarsem Singh Sialka, a Punjab State SC Commission member, have also applied for a ticket from the seat.Jagwinder Pal Singh aka Jagga Majithia, 60, who has been fielded from the Majitha seat is the lone new face. Jagga Majithia is the younger brother of Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia, who had switched over to the Aam Aadmi Party recently. Political experts are of the view the move is aimed at stopping the split of party votes in the rural segment by fielding brother against brother.Jagga Majithia, who had won the election of councillor in 1992 and remained general secretary of the Punjab Youth Congress, claimed he enjoyed support of top leaders, including MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla. Only two Congress leaders from Mahitha went with his brother Lalli Majithia, he maintained.Those re-nominated included Navjot Singh Sidhu (Amritsar East), Deputy CM OP Soni (Amritsar Central), Raj Kumar Verka (Amritsar West), Harpratap Singh Ajnala (Ajnala), Sukhwinder Singh Sarkaria (Rajasansi), Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala (Jandiala), Santokh Singh Bhalaipur (Baba Bakala), Inderbir Singh Bolaria (Amritsar South) and Sunil Dutti (Amritsar North).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-dist-9-retained-no-word-on-attari-361588

16-01-2022||Ravi Dhaliwal||Bajwa, Puri new faces; 5 MLAs secure ticket from Gurdaspur||Gurdaspur, January 15In the Gurdaspur parliamentary constituency, which comprises nine Assembly seats, the Congress has re-nominated candidates on five seats, while Batala and Bhoa have been kept in abeyance. The two new faces are Partap Singh Bajwa (Qadian) and Naresh Puri (Sujanpur).Puri has replaced Amit Mantu. In the 2017 polls, Puri, the son of former minister Raghunath Sahai Puri, contested as an Independent and bagged impressive 28,000 votes. Ex-Union minister Ashwani Kumar’s son Ashish Kumar was also in contention.In Qadian, Partap Singh Bajwa, whose Rajya Sabha term ends in April next year, has been nominated. High drama had prevailed on this seat as Partap’s brother and sitting MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa were involved in a do-or-die battle to get the ticket. A fortnight ago, when it became clear Fateh could be sidelined, he was quick to join the BJP, leaving the field open for his elder sibling.The five others who have been selected are Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa (Dera Baba Nanak), Amit Vij (Pathankot), Aruna Chaudhary (Dinanagar), Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa (Fatehgarh Churian) and Barindermeet Singh Pahra (Gurdaspur).Tript had in fact been eyeing Batala. Even his detractors admit the city has seen unprecedented development in the last five years with Tript bringing in one project after the other. “With Tript being re-nominated from Fatehgarh Churian, it is widely believed three-time MLA Ashwani Sekhri will be asked to contest from Batala. We fail to comprehend as to why Batala has been kept in abeyance.

16-01-2022||Ropar||YC prez in fray from Ropar once again||The Congress is once again betting on youth leader Barinder Singh Dhillon in an attempt to wrest the Ropar Assembly seat, which the party lost 15 years ago to the SAD.Congress’ former minister of state Ramesh Dutt Sharma had lost to SAD candidate Sant Ajit Singh in 2007. That time, the Assembly was known as Anandpur Sahib-Ropar. The Ropar Assembly seat was carved out after delimitation in 2012 and the SAD fielded Daljit Singh Cheema, who won the seat defeating Sharma.In the last Assembly elections, Dhillon, who is currently president of the Punjab Youth Congress, gave a though fight but had to content with the second spot as voters chose taxi driver Amarjeet Singh Sandoa fielded by AAP. This time, while the Congress and SAD have once again given chance to Cheema and Dhillon, respectively, the AAP has dropped Sandoa and fielded RTI activist Dinesh Chadha.In Anandpur Sahib, Congress’ sitting MLA and Punjab Speaker Rana KP Singh has once again been fielded by the party. He will face AAP and SAD-BSP candidates Harjot Bains, an advocate, and Nitin Nanda, businessman, respectively. The BJP is yet to announce its candidate.In Chamkaur Sahib, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, after achieving a hat-trick, will take on his political rivals for the fourth time. The AAP has once again showed confidence in Dr Charanjit Singh, who contested on the party ticket and finished second in the last polls. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/yc-prez-in-fray-from-ropar-once-again-361591

16-01-2022||Sanjiv Kumar Bakshi||Illegal mining, drugs major issues||Traditionally a Congress bastion, Mukerian has been grappling with the problems related to irrigation, higher education, sports facilities, unemployment and governance for a long time. However, drug abuse and Illegal mining are major issues in this constituency.The mining started in the semi-hilly terrain here in 2007. With crushers gaining a foothold, the whole business soon started turning ugly. Illegal mining led to digging up of land and drain beds deeper and deeper. At some places, the land is excavated as much as 100 feet deep. The political patronage to the illegal mining mafia has been a major electoral issue for long in past many elections.Drug trade is also flourishing in the areas bordering Himachal Pradesh. Whenever there’s police action, drug peddlers flee to Himachal. Irrigation is also an issue with small and marginal farmers mostly dependent on canals and public tubewells. While canal tributaries remain non-functional most of the time, more than 100 irrigation tubewells are insufficient to meet the requirement.“Stray cattle and wild animals add to the woes of farmers. Residents want a stadium, which is promised in every election but never announced. Similar is the story of a government college in the area,” says Jodh Singh, a retired teacher.Past trendIt has largely been a Congress’ bastionsince 1969. In 1997, BJP won the seat, but Cong’s Dr Kewal Krishan got it back in 2002. In 2007, BJP won again. In 2012 and 2017, Dr Krishan’s son registered a win.

Riding the exalted promises, the same group of leaders are elected on rotation, but there is no change in the situation on the ground,” says Kulwinder Singh, a resident.A combination of bad roads inundated by overflowing sewage makes the street unusable, particularly for pedestrians and two-wheelers, rue residents.“Politicians are in the habit of failing to deliver on any of their campaign promises once we put them in office. We believe these candidates will say anything to garner voters,” he said. Voters in this reserved constituency voted for a new face, Master Baldev Singh of AAP, in 2017, hoping he would bring about change. “Like other MLAs, Baldev Singh also kept shifting his loyalties during the past five years, even submitting his resignation to the Vidhan Sabha Speaker, thus leaving the voters disenchanted again,” rues Hartosh Singh, a resident.Past trendAfter delimitation, Jaito came into existence as a new reserved constituency in 2012.

He further argued that the court or the “arresting officer” should give a choice to the accused to either furnish surety bonds or give a fixed deposit, given the advent of online identification.The Bench observed that comprehensive data on the role of sureties in bringing the accused to justice was absent.

16-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Nun's inconsistent versions led to Bishop's acquittal: Court||Jalandhar, January 15Lack of evidences put forth by the prosecution and contradictory versions given by the complainant nun to various persons, led to the acquittal of Bishop Franco Mulakkal by the Kerala court on Friday.In the 289-page judgment passed by Kottayam Additional Sessions Judge G Gopakumar, he has concluded that there is no consistency in the statement of the victim. “The grievance projected by her to the companion sisters was that the accused was taking retaliatory steps for not yielding to his sexual desires, whereas her version before the court was that she was forced to do sexual intercourse with the accused on 13 occasions. The prosecution has failed to give proper explanation for the inconsistent version,” said the judge.The court also observed: “This is a case in which the grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up. There are exaggerations and embellishments in the version of the victim. She has also made every attempt to hide certain facts. It is also evident that the victim was swayed under the influence of others who had other vested interest in the matter. The infighting, rivalry and group fights of the nuns, and the desire for power, position and control over the congregation is evident.”The court has taken a serious view of the fact that the prosecution had failed to produce the mobile phones of the accused as the order says: “The police could not seize the mobile phone used by the victim, which would have provided some input into the alleged vulgar messages sent by the accused. The laptop was also not subjected to scientific analysis, as it is claimed that the hard disk got damaged.”On the medical examination of the victim, the order reads: “It is true that the hymen of the victim was found torn in her medical examination. But defence contends that there was a complaint against the victim, of ebing indulged in sexual intercourse with her cousin’s husband.” The court is unable to place reliance on the solitary testimony of the complainant nun and to hold the accused guilty of the offences charged against him and accordingly acquitted the accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nuns-inconsistent-versions-led-to-bishops-acquittal-court-361609

Both are contesting the February 14 elections in an alliance. Twentytwo of the 32 farm unions from Punjab that comprised the SKM regrouped under Rajewal to float the political outfit. Rajewal and Charuni were core committee members of the SKM.The decision to expel their outfits was taken today during a general house meeting organised by the SKM at the ‘Kisan Andolan’ office at Singhu border. Farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, Yogendra Yadav and Yudhvir Singh were among those present.Opposing 2 partiesThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha isn’t opposing any farm organisation, but only the two political parties (floated by Rajewal and Charuni). Joginder Singh Ugrahan, BKU-Ekta presidentUgrahan, BKU-Ekta president, said any farm outfit or leader taking the poll plunge or getting indirectly involved in electoral politics couldn’t be part of the SKM. “The SKM isn’t opposing any farm organisation, but only the two political parties (floated by Rajewal and Charuni),” he maintained. If needed, said Ugrahan, the decision may be reviewed after three months.The SKM said their organisation was apolitical and no politician was allowed on any stage during the over 12 months of their agitation. Yudhvir said Tikait would visit Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh for three days from January 21 to press for the sacking of Union Minister Ajay Mishra whose son Ashish is accused of mowing down protesting farmers last year. “Tikait will meet victims, jailed farmers and officials. If there is no progress, a siege may be laid in Lakhimpur by farmer organisations. A ‘pucca morcha’ may be started there,” he said.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha leadership also warned of launching ‘Mission UP’ (against the BJP) from February 1 if the Union Government failed to fulfil its promises, including formation of a committee on MSP and cancellation of police cases against protesters. “We will observe January 31 as ‘Vishwasghat Diwas’ (betrayal day) and hold nationwide protests at block and district headquarters’ level,” the SKM said.

16-01-2022||Archit Watts||Key constituency Lambi: Congress fields Jagpal Singh Abul Khurana in Badal stronghold Lambi||Lambi (Muktsar), January 15The Congress has fielded Jagpal Singh Abul Khurana in the Badal family stronghold, Lambi. This constituency has picked Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal for five consecutive times (1997 to 2017). Jagpal Singh is son of Gurnam Singh Abul Khurana, a former minister, who died last year.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already announced the candidature of Gurmeet Singh Khudian, son of the late MP Jagdev Singh Khudian, from the constituency. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is yet to make any announcement, even though the indefatigable 94-year-old Badal has been campaigning door to door. Punjab Congress general secretary Jagpal Singh, although considered close to Capt Amarinder Singh, did not switch to the Punjab Lok Congress, which is why the party seems to have rewarded him with the ticket. He is a resident of Abul Khurana village, once part of the Lambi constituency. It now falls in the Malout constituency.It is yet unclear whether Congress leader Maheshinder Singh Badal’s supporters would go with AAP’s Khudian, their old associate, or the party nominee, Jagpal Singh. Maheshinder’s son Fateh Badal too had applied for the party ticket, said sources. A former president of the District Congress Committee, Khudian joined AAP in July last year. His family played an active role in the ‘Kisan Andolan’ on Delhi borders. His nephew, Randhir Singh Dhira, is a well-known figure in the area.Lambi has witnessed several high-profile electoral battles. In 2017, it saw a triangular fight with then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Capt Amarinder Singh (Congress) and former Delhi-based journalist Jarnail Singh (AAP) in the fray. Badal won by 22,770 votes.In 2012, it was a fight between three Badals – Parkash Singh Badal (SAD), his younger brother Gurdas Singh Badal (PPP) and estranged cousin Maheshinder Singh Badal (Congress). Badal Senior won by 24,739 votes.Loyalty rewardedSeen close to Capt Amarinder, did not switch to Punjab Lok Congress. He has now been rewarded with party ticket. Jagpal is son of late Gurnam Singh Abul Khurana, a former minister.His father won in ’92Parkash Badal has been winning from Lambi since 1997. The Congress won from the seat just thrice (1962, 1967 and 1992). In 1992, when the SAD had boycotted the polls, Congress’ Gurnam Singh Abul Khurana had won from here.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/key-constituency-lambi-congress-fields-jagpal-singh-abul-khurana-in-badal-stronghold-lambi-361579
16-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Punjab Assembly poll: Dropped ministers on list, Congress keeps its flock together||Chandigarh, January 15By allotting the party ticket to 61 of the total 79 MLAs, the Congress has clearly tried to keep its flock together and prevent poaching by other parties. Four ministers in Capt Amarinder Singh’s Cabinet, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Sunder Sham Arora and Gurpreet Singh Kangar, who were dropped, have been selected. So have 14 legislators from reserved seats.On certain seats, factors going against the MLAs have been ignored by the AICC-appointed screening committee and the “winnability” criterion dropped to prevent intra-party feud and loss of votes. Of the total 34 reserved seats in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, 23 are held by the Congress. In the first list, three MLAs from these seats — Ajaib Singh Bhatti (Malout), Nathu Ram (Balluana) and Balwinder Laddi (Sri Hargobindpur) — have been dropped.The party high command has done a fine balancing act, keeping in view the difference of opinion between Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Pradesh Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu over some seats. Amarpreet Lally (Garhshankar) and Brinder Dhillon (Ropar) have been allotted the ticket reportedly on the intervention of the top leadership. That Punjab affairs in-charge, Harish Chaudhary, who handled the Punjab Assembly elections in 2017, and Rahul Gandhi aide Krishna Allavaru have had their way is evident.With CM Channi batting for Sukhwinder Kotli (Adampur) and Sidhu Brinder Singh Dhillon (Ropar), a senior leader told The Tribune that both had been adjusted where factors, such as caste and region, favoured them. Four candidates from the Youth Congress — Barinder Dhillon, Mohit Mohindra, son of Brahm Mohindra, Amarpreet Lally and Sandeep Jakhar, nephew of Sunil Jakhar, ex-chief of Pradesh Congress Committee, have been given the ticket. Sons of two MPs, Dr Amar Singh and Chaudhary Santokh Singh, too have made it to the list.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dropped-ministers-on-list-congress-keeps-its-flock-together-361578

Bajwa’s brother Fateh Jung, sitting MLA from Qadian, recently defected to the BJP after reports that he would be dropped.Deputy Chief Ministers Om Parkash Soni and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa will contest from their respective Amritsar Central and Dera Baba Nanak seats.The Congress has by and large stuck to the “one family, one ticket” rule, with senior minister Brahm Mohindra making way for his son Mohit Mohindra in Patiala Rural and Punjab Congress campaign chief Sunil Jakhar stepping aside in favour of his nephew Sandeep Jakhar in Abohar. Two sitting Lok Sabha MPs, Amar Singh of Fatehgarh Sahib and Santokh Chaudhary of Jalandhar, have, however, succeeded in managing ticket for their sons, Kamil Amar Singh (Rajkot reserved) and Vikram Chaudhary (Phillaur SC seat).“The idea was to avoid fielding two MLA candidates from the same immediate family. That has been achieved in the first list,” an AICC source said, adding some senior leaders were keen on getting ticket for immediate family members, including CM Channi. He wanted to field his brother from Bassi Pathana, but the party settled for sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP.Interesting inclusions in the list are actor Sonu Sood’s sister Malvika Sood from Moga and controversial singer Sidhu Moosewala from Mansa.The first list shows the Congress has played largely safe denying ticket to four sitting MLAs, but fielding the CM and the entire state Cabinet. The party has, however, fielded only 10.4 per cent women candidates in the first list as compared to 40 per cent in the first UP list of 125 contestants. Importantly, Punjab Youth Congress leader Amarpreet Lally prevailed as the party’s choice in the hotly contested Garhshankar seat where the Chief Minister was batting for Nimisha Mehta. The Congress leadership is yet to field a candidate from former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s Patiala constituency. Among the Members of the Legislative Assembly who have been dropped are Ajaib Singh Bhatti, Balwinder Laddi, Harjot Kamal and Nathu Ram.Meanwhile, the Election Commission on Saturday extended the ban on physical rallies and roadshows until January 22.

16-01-2022||Sonepat||Samyukta Kisan Morcha says farmer bodies contesting Punjab polls are not part of it||Samyukta Kisan Morcha said on Saturday that farmer organisations that are planning to contest next month’s elections will no longer be part of the joint front.SKM leaders said at a press conference after their meeting at Kondli on the Singhu border also said that BKU leader Rakesh Tikait will visit Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh for three days in January to push to have Union Minister Ajay Mishra sacked from the central council of ministers. Mishra's son faces criminal charges for mowing down protesting farmers last year. "Tikait will meet victims, jailed farmers, and officials. If there is no progress, a siege may be laid in Lakhimpur by farmer organisations," said Yudhvir Singh.Singh also said that the SKM does not agree with farmer organisations participating in the election in Punjab and they will not be part of it."Those organisations taking part in polls are not part of SKM. We will decide about our relationship with them in a meeting of SKM four months later," he said.SKM leader Joginder Singh Ugrhan said, "SKM has nothing to do with them". The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a joint front of over farmers' unions that spearheaded protests against three controversial agriculture laws that the Parliament passed in 2020, has maintained that it wants to remain an apolitical movement.Twenty-two farmer unions in Punjab announced last month that they would contest next month’s assembly elections under the name Sanyukt Samaj Morcha. Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Balbir Singh Rajewal, both of who were part of the farmers' protests at Delhi borders, have announced they would contest elections. Rajewal, president of a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, is among those whose candidature SSM has announced.On the other hand, Chaduni, who'd hinted at his intention to contest the Punjab assembly elections in July 2021 and faced a week's from the Samyukta Kisan Morcha over his remarks, announced his own party, the Samyukta Sangharsh Party, last month. More recently, there have been talks of an alliance between the two farmers' parties for the elections.  Punjab votes on February 14 in the second phase of the seven-phase assembly elections. Votes will be counted on March 10.                                      #farmerunions                                     #Punjabpolls                                     #SKM                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/samyukta-kisan-morcha-says-farmer-bodies-contesting-punjab-polls-are-not-part-of-it-361541
