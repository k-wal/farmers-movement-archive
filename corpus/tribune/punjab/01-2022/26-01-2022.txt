She said her family sought the strictest punishment for anyone connected with drug smuggling cases in the state.“ Today, I prayed at Sachkhand Sri Harmandar Sahib that if my brother Bikram (Majithia) has indulged in trading or spreading even a pinch of drugs in any manner, Guru Sahib may inflict the most horrible punishment on each and every member of our family. Conversely, those who resort to brazen lies over the drug issue as well as on the issue of sacrilege of Shri Guru Granth Sahib may also be made to face the fate that any ‘Guru ghar da dokhi’ (offender against Guru’s holy abode) deserves,” she said.She also accused rivals Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party of engaging in the “worst and the filthiestlies of the lowest kind on both the sacrilege and the drug issues, just for political gains”.“In these last seven years, they played sinful politics over the most sensitive and profoundly painful issue of sacrilege and accused us without any evidence,” she said. “But I have full faith in the divine justice of Guru Sahib (Almighty). I am sure that truth will come out and those really guilty of these sins and crimes as well as those who allowed these culprits to escape just to promote their conspiratorial narrative against SAD will face punishment one day”.Her remarks come on a day when Majithia, who faces drug charges and who recently got a temporary respite from arrest from the Punjab and Haryana high court, was announced to be SAD’s candidate from Amritsar East against Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently agreed to extend Majithia’s protection against arrest for three days, although making it clear that the respite was only temporary to enable him to appeal its rejection of his anticipatory bail application in the Supreme Court.                                     #Amritsar                                     #BikramSinghMajithia                                     #drugcharges                                     #Harsimrat                                     #HarsimratKaurBadal                                     #Majithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/may-we-be-inflicted-with-horrible-punishment-if-theres-any-truth-says-harsimrat-kaur-badal-about-majithias-drug-charges-364646
26-01-2022||---||Bikram Majithia appeals to EC to hold Punjab govt accountable for violating HC directives, conducting raids on his residence||Chandigarh, January 26Senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Wednesday appealed to the Election Commission of India to hold the Congress government accountable for violating high court directives and conducting raids on his residence and harassing his family members even before the court passed its final verdict on his anticipatory bail plea.He also demanded a National Investigation Agency (NIA) inquiry into the audio-tape expose of DGP S Chatttopadhay saying the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab could have even resulted in an assassination bid on the PM.Majithia, who was addressing the media here, said attempts were being made to prevent him from contesting the assembly elections and this was why the police force was pressed into service to raid his residences even before the high court passed its verdict on his anticipatory bail plea application.The Akali leader said, “It seems the law is different for me and the same rules are not applied to Congressmen be it Sukhpal Khaira who is accused of drug smuggling or Sidhu Moosewala who is accused to firing an AK -47 or even Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leader Simarjit Singh Bains against whom non bailable warrants have been issued. No raids have been conducted at either of their houses. Sukhpal Khaira’s residence was not raided even though he failed to get any relief from the high court. The Congress government has not even proceeded against Bhupinder Honey, from whom Rs 10 crore was recovered by the ED, for illegally using the security cover of the chief minister.”Stating that there were two sets of laws for him and others accused of serious crimes, Majthia said the Congress government was yet to proceed against DGP S Chattopadhyay who was caught on tape addressing a proclaimed offender as his son and even discussing sharing of drug money and fake encounters.“The proclaimed offender in the Jagdish Bhola drug case even talked about recovering RDX and bombs during the Prime Minister’s visit. Only a NIA probe can get to the bottom of this case as well as the subsequent security breach during the PM’s visit which could have even resulted in an assassination bid on the PM”, Mr Majithia added.Mr Majithia demanded that all CCTV camera footage of the DGP’s residence as well as his phone and phones of chief minister Charanjit Channi, home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa and Vigilance head Harpreet Sidhu be examined to uncover the entire conspiracy to register a false case against him as well as compromise the PM’s security. He said the NIA inquiry in this context should not be delayed at any cost.Majithia said his legal team was also considering moving a contempt petition against Congress government functionaries for violating court directions as well as harassing his family members. He said this was done despite the fact that his family members were Covid positive. “I want to ask BOI Director B Chandra Shekhar whether he was under pressure from the DGP or my relative Harpreet Sidhu who has an axe to grind against me.”Speaking about home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa, Majithia said the former did not have any moral right to speak about ethics in public life. “Randhawa’s father Santokh Singh Randhawa was accused of having links with the ISI agency of Pakistan and had to resign as PCC President and even minister due to this. Everyone also knows how Santokh Randhawa defended and even praised Indira Gandhi for the attack on Sri Darbar Sahib. The minister himself is also known for his various scams including the seed scam as well as patronizing dreaded gangsters like Mukhtiar Ansari and Jaggu Bhagwanpuria.”                                     #BikramMajithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bikram-majithia-appeals-to-ec-to-hold-punjab-govt-accountable-for-violating-hc-directives-conducting-raids-on-his-residence-364636

I bow my head in reverence to these great stalwarts imbued with patriotism from the sacred land of Jalandhar,” Channi said.The people of Punjab made the maximum sacrifices in the fight to throw off the foreign yoke, he said.Calling Doaba the heartland of martyrs, Channi said this region was the epicentre of the 'Ghadar and Babbar' movements against British imperialism, according to an official release.He also pointed out the service rendered by Punjabis, especially the resilient farmers, for the overall development of the country in the aftermath of Independence. He said the state contributed more than 60 per cent towards the national food bowl in making the country self-reliant in food production.Recalling the contribution made by Bhim Rao Ambedkar in drafting the Constitution, Channi said, “It was a humongous task to frame the Constitution for a country as diverse as ours, but Baba Saheb made strenuous efforts and accomplished the gigantic work with aplomb.” Earlier, the chief minister inspected the parade and took salute from the march past comprising contingents from the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), commissionerate police (men and women) and Home Guard wing of the commissionerate police.                                     #CharanjitSinghChanni                                     #Republicday||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-chief-minister-charanjit-singh-channi-recalls-sacrifices-of-freedom-fighters-during-independence-movement-364624

The poor condition of roads remained the biggest concern for years. However, in the past few months, much stress was laid on recarpeting of existing roads and construction of new ones. The work had barely started when the elections were declared and the code of conduct came into force.Many roads are awaiting completion. The stretch linking Phagwara road to Sahri village that was built five years ago is in a bad shape. The link road from Bajrawar to Sisoli is also in a shambles.Rural health centres, too, need attention as most of them have just a nurse or two, but no permanent doctors. At health centres in Jandoli, Sahri, Bathulla, Bichhohi, Sanrangwal, Lalwan, Rampur and other areas, the doctor visits once or twice a week. If the doctor concerned is deployed on some other duty, patients’ wait prolongs. “At Chabbewal, there’s only one doctor. There’s no one to provide medical help during the night. During any emergency, people have to rush to Civil Hospital, Hoshiarpur, or private hospitals,” says Satinderjit Singh of Chabbewal.While some villages have sewerage facility, Chabbewal and several others lack it.

The administration urged residents to get themselves inoculated or stay indoors.The District Magistrate has asked owners of hotels, pubs, malls, retail chains, movie halls and gyms and fitness centres to only allow those fully-vaccinated individuals to enter their premises. A similar advisory also applies to banks, besides government, non-government offices, factories and educational institutes.At one of the special nakas, a partially vaccinated youth was asked to receive his second shot by the health team, however, the youngster preferred to get challaned, said a police officer.“It’s a big challenge. The residents must understand the grave situation and get themselves vaccinated. It’s for the betterment of all of us,” said Nayyar and added that their intention was not to challan residents, but urge beneficiaries to get themselves jabbed. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/moga-bans-partially-jabbed-in-public-areas-364467

They say it is the first time that they don’t have any bookings during the election season and are left out of work.“Usually, we do good business during elections, but due to the EC ban on organising physical rallies, we have got no customers. If the ban continues, we will be left with no income,” said Amrik Singh, owner of a tent house in Malerkotla.While talking to The Tribune, some tent house owners said Covid had already caused huge losses to them as due to the surge in cases, the government had repeatedly been banning social gatherings. Now, many had expected good business during elections, but the pandemic again played the spoilsport for them.“I had recently added more items to my store as I was hopeful of getting huge orders due to polls. But since the EC has banned physical rallies, I will not be able to recover my input cost and thus suffer losses,” said another owner of a tent house in Sangrur. There are many, who had also taken bank loans to boost their business but now stare at massive losses.“Everyone should be cautious and contribute to prevent the further spread of virus but the government should also think about the plight of tent house owners, who are hit hard due the restrictions on holding events,” said a Sangrur tent house owner.Candidates of almost all political parties too have been waiting eagerly to hold physical rallies and are waiting for the EC orders in this regard.“We are hopeful that in the coming days, something positive will happen,” said a politician requesting anonymity.In financial crisisUsually, we do good business during elections, but due to the EC ban on organising physical rallies, we have got no customers.

Gujarat Frontier and Kashmir Frontier reported two and one sighting, respectively.A senior BSF officer revealed that last year, there were 62 incidents where enemy drones operating in the vicinity of the border were fired upon by BSF personnel. These included 43 in the area of Punjab Frontier and 17 in Jammu Frontier, followed by two in Rajasthan Frontier.BSF data also showed there have been 58 incidents of hostile drones crossing over into the Indian territory, out of which 45 were in Punjab alone. There have also been instances of drones being recovered after being shot down by the BSF.BSF officers said the use of drones by adversaries as well as criminals in the border belt has increased over the past two years, posing new challenges. Extensive use of drones is being made by adversaries for surveillance of border areas and intelligence gathering. Similarly, this technology is being used by criminals indulging in smuggling of drugs, arms and other contraband items from Pakistan into India.India, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, shares 3,323 km of its land border with Pakistan along the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.While BSF is responsible for the peace time management of the border from the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat to Akhnoor in Jammu, some of its battalions are also co-deployed with the Army along the Line of Control up to Kargil in Kashmir and Ladakh sectors.The length of the border with Pakistan in Punjab is around 553 km, comprising Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tara Taran and Ferozepur districts. While most of this border is fenced and flood-lit, riverine stretches along the course of the Ravi and Sutlej are vulnerable and difficult to guard. This came into focus during the recent terror attacks in Gurdaspur and Pathankot.Punjab also topped in the number of arms being recovered. The BSF seized 54 weapons, including AK series rifles and pistols along with 3,322 rounds of ammunition in the area of responsibility of Punjab Frontier, followed by 17 weapons and 1,170 rounds in Jammu Frontier. No weapons were seized in Gujarat and Rajasthan frontiers.As far as narcotics are concerned, BSF data shows around 80 per cent of seizure along the western border in 2021 was in Punjab. Out of the total of 599.220 kg of heroin seized, 485.165 kg was in Punjab, followed by 57.670 kg in Rajasthan and 37.935 kg in Jammu.Last year, the BSF apprehended 38 Pakistan nationals, including criminals and inadvertent crossers, out of whom 28 were in Punjab. Four Pakistan nationals were held in Rajasthan and three each in Jammu and Gujarat. In addition, six intruders were shot by the BSF in Punjab and Jammu, two in Rajasthan and one in Kashmir.67 intrusions in 2021||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-tops-in-cross-border-drone-sightings-drug-recovery-364457

Justice Gill made it clear that the court did not find any ground to afford a week’s time for the purpose, as prayed for in view of Assembly elections in the state.Justice Gill added: “In case an effort is now being made by the state to break the nexus between the state machinery and drug traffickers, I find no ground to scuttle the same at this stage.… It is further relevant to note that in this political slugfest, a complete and thorough investigation should not be the casualty, especially keeping in view the grave and serious charges levelled under the NDPS Act.”Justice Gill said it was vehemently argued that the petitioner joined the investigation pursuant to the interim order dated January 10 and was fully cooperating with the investigating agency. But, it was denied and opposed by counsel for the state. He argued the petitioner was non-cooperative and refused to hand over photographs/videos of his wedding, “necessary in view of the allegations of the co-accused having close relations with the petitioner and some of them having been introduced to each other on the occasion”. Justice Gill also took note of the counsel’s submission that the petitioner gave evasive replies by terming some questions as outrageous and claiming some matters to be personal.                                     #BikramMajithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/majithia-gets-three-day-protection-from-arrest-364429

He will hold a virtual ‘Punjab Fateh’ rally at Mithapur in Jalandhar, before flying back to Delhi.As per the schedule released by the All-India Congress Committee, Rahul will fly from Delhi to Amritsar. From Amritsar to Jalandhar, he will travel by road, before heading back to Delhi by a special flight. Party leaders are anxiously waiting to see whether Rahul announces the chief ministerial face, though the party has this time maintained it will go into the elections under the leadership of three — Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, a Dalit Sikh; PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, a Jat; and Sunil Jakhar, a Hindu leader.Barely a week before the 2017 Assembly elections, Rahul had during a party gathering in Majitha on January 28 announced Capt Amarinder Singh as the chief ministerial candidate of the party. He had then played the ‘son of the soil’ card for Capt Amarinder, saying only a Punjabi can be the chief minister of the state while projecting the AAP as a party of “outsiders” trying to wrest control of the state from Punjabis.With changed political scenario in the state five years on and AAP having announced Bhagwant Mann as its chief ministerial face, all eyes will be on the political line the Gandhi scion will adopt while kicking off the party’s campaign. The visit happens amid an ongoing tussle between Channi and Sidhu, with both projecting themselves as best suited to be the CM face. There have been differences of opinion among Channi, Sidhu and Jakhar over the choice of candidates.Party leaders are hopeful that Rahul’s visit will end the friction among the top state leaders and the party will put up a united front in run-up to the elections.To interact with 1L peopleChanni turns ‘Thor’ in Cong memePressure to name chief ministerial faceThere is pressure within the party to announce the party’s chief ministerial face, with CM Charanjit Singh Channi being the front-runner. Party insiders say by naming Capt Amarinder Singh as the CM face in 2017, the party’s campaign got a major boost. The same line should be adopted this time for edge over the rivals, it has been pointed out.                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #RahulGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rahul-gandhi-kicks-off-congress-drive-on-january-27-in-punjab-364437

Sample this: Rs 1,000 per woman (over 18 years of age) dole promised by the AAP and Rs 2,000 per woman promised by the Congress will cost Rs 10 billion and Rs 20 billion per month, respectively, to the state exchequer. Eight free LPG cylinders a year to the 55.10 lakh households will cost over Rs 3,200 crore per annum!Any party that gets the reins of the state on March 10 will have to deal with an outstanding debt of Rs 2.82 lakh crore, unpaid arrears of salaries of employees and arrears of pensions. A debt of Rs 16,248.68 crore has been added to the state till December 2021, with Rs 1,500 crore estimated to have been borrowed last month.Unpaid bills worth hundreds of crores are pending with the treasury, which will also have to be cleared by the next government. Most of the market borrowings (Rs 10,418.40 crore of Rs 16,248.68 crore) have been used to pay interest on the outstanding debt.Besides, the next government will also have to clear Rs 9,600 crore dues towards Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for the unpaid power subsidy amount of this year and the new sops (waiver of arrears and pending power bills announced by the government). By the time the new government settles in, the power subsidy of the next fiscal (2022-23) will also be added (from April 1 onwards).To make matters worse, the state will also lose the GST compensation it gets from the Centre, as the relief to states (for subsuming of indirect state taxes upon roll out of GST) will no longer be paid beyond June 2022.This financial year, Punjab is to receive GST compensation of Rs 16,871 crore, of which Rs 10,672.13 crore has been received till November 2021. Though Punjab and several other states, including the BJP-ruled ones, have demanded that this compensation be continued for another five years, the Centre has so far not acceded to the demand.What has been promisedCongress: 300 units of free power; Rs2K/month to women; eight free LPG cylinder each year to every householdSAD: 400 units of free power; Rs2K/month to women heads families having blue card; interest-free loan for studentsAAP: 300 units of free power; Rs1K/month to women over 18; free healthcare for allState borrowing moreEach day the state needs Rs106.40 crore only to repay interest and return the principal loan amount. When the state is borrowing more to repay interest on acquired debt, can it afford the doles being promised to voters? It is for the voters to decide whether they want to fall in to these sops. — Dr M S Sidhu, economist from LudhianaTax machinery not proficientThe problem is not dearth of revenue, but the tax machinery is not geared up to collect taxes. The loopholes in tax collection need to be plugged. But political class uses state’s resources to benefit their own enterprises. As a result, the state remains in poor fiscal health. — Dr Lakhwinder Singh, economist from Patiala                                     #PunjabDebt                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/meeting-poll-promises-a-tall-order-in-punjab-364431
