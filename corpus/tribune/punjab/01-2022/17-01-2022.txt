17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Political parties welcome EC’s decision to postpone Punjab polls||Political parties in Punjab on Monday welcomed the Election Commission’s decision to postpone the state Assembly polls to February 20 in view of Guru Ravidas Jayanti, saying it will enable his followers to visit UP’s Varanasi for festivities.Read also:Punjab Assembly polls postponed to February 20Earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and political parties in the state had urged the poll panel to postpone the date of voting as lakhs of followers of Guru Ravidas travel to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to celebrate his birth anniversary on February 16.Channi had said as members of the Scheduled Castes community are likely to visit Varanasi from February 10 to 16, they won’t be able to vote in the elections.Accepting the demand, the Election Commission decided on Monday to hold the polls in Punjab on February 20 instead of February 14.The Punjab CM said he welcomes decision as it will enable a large number of followers from the state, especially its Doaba region, to travel to Varanasi to celebrate the Guru’s birth anniversary.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “We had urged the Election Commission to postpone the date and we welcome the EC decision.”Badal’s party is contesting next month’s polls in alliance with the BSP.Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu also welcomed the decision.Union Minister and BJP leader Som Prakash said they had also urged the poll panel to postpone the elections and the party welcomes the decision.Aam Aadmi Party’s senior leader Harpal Singh Cheema, who is Leader of the Opposition in Punjab, said, “AAP had demanded that election date should be postponed and we are happy that the EC has taken this decision.”On January 13, Chief Minister Channi had urged the Election Commission to postpone the polling date by six days “for enabling around 20 lakh SC devotees to utilise their right to vote for the state Legislative Assembly”.“A large number of SC devotees from the state are likely to visit Benares in Uttar Pradesh from February 10 to 16. In such a situation, many people from this community would not be able to cast their votes for the state Assembly,” said Channi who belongs to the community.Bahujan Samaj Party’s Punjab chief Jasvir Singh Garhi was the first to demand postponement of the polling.He requested the Election Commission to hold the polls on February 20, instead of February 14.                                     #assemblypolls                                     #ElectionCommission                                     #GuruRavidasJayanti                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/political-parties-welcome-ecs-decision-to-postpone-punjab-polls-362058
17-01-2022||Chandigarh||Ticket denial to Charanjit Channi's brother proves Congress used him to get SC votes: Raghav Chadha||By denying tickets to the brother and another relative of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the Congress has proved that it had made him CM merely for “using him as a tool" to get the Scheduled Caste votes, AAP leader Raghav Chadha alleged on Monday.In its first list of 86 candidates, the Congress on Saturday had given the ticket to sitting legislator Gurpreet Singh GP from Bassi Pathana (SC) seat which was being eyed by Channi's brother Manohar Singh.Singh on Sunday announced to fight as an independent from this seat.Channi's brother had been demanding the Congress ticket for contesting from the Bassi Pathana seat, Chadha told reporters here, adding, “But he was denied the ticket.”Similarly, Channi's relative Mohinder Singh Kaypee, who wanted the ticket from Adampur seat in Jalandhar, was also denied it, said Chadha, alleging Kaypee was denied the ticket because he was Channi's relative.Chadha, however, said the ruling party gave tickets to the sons of Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh and minister Brahm Mohindra.“Manohar Singh was not given the ticket because he was Channi's brother. The Congress has proved that the party used Channi saab. We could say that Channi saab was made the chief minister only for using him to take votes of the Dalit community,” he said.“Channi saab does not have any say in the party that he could take two tickets for his family,” he said in a dig at the ruling party.“It appears Channi was used as a tool by the Congress to appease people of a particular community,” he alleged.The Congress appointed Channi as the Punjab chief minister last year after Amarinder Singh was made to resign. Channi is Punjab's first Dalit CM.Chadha alleged that the Congress in the past had appointed Sushilkumar Shinde as the chief minister of Maharashtra for a few months to woo votes of a particular community and later after the elections, Shinde was removed.Chadha said party leader Arvind Kejriwal would announce the name of the party's chief ministerial face on Tuesday.“The official announcement of the name of AAP's CM face for the 2022 state assembly polls will be made by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday,” said Chadha, who is the party co-in-charge of Punjab affairs.Chadha said it would be only the Aam Aadmi Party which would go to the state assembly polls with the chief ministerial face.He said none of the other political parties including the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP had announced the name of their chief ministerial candidate.Around 15 lakh people responded to the AAP's 'Janta Chunegi Apna CM' drive in which the party is asking the people to name the party candidate who will be their choice for the CM face for the February 20 Punjab assembly polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ticket-denial-to-charanjit-channis-brother-proves-congress-used-him-to-get-sc-votes-raghav-chadha-362039

17-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Denied ticket, Punjab CM Channi's brother to fight as Independent, aide Nimisha joins BJP||Chandigarh, January 16A day after the Congress announced the first list of 86 candidates for the Punjab Assembly poll, the party struggled to contain rebellion as one of its ticket aspirants switched to the BJP while another jumped into the poll fray as an Independent.Sulking kaypee may get adampur seatHectic parleys continued throughout the day to placate the rebels even as the Congress screening committee held discussions to finalise names for the remaining 31 seats for the February 14 poll. CM  ’s brother Dr Manohar Singh, who has been denied the ticket from Bassi Pathana reserved segment, announced his candidature as an Independent. Channi is learnt to have supported his brother’s candidature.Dr Manohar, who recently quit as a Senior Medical Officer, accused sitting MLA Gurpreet Singh GP, PPCC chief Navjot Sidhu and a few others of conspiring against him.Nimisha Mehta, whose candidature was supported by Channi from Garhshankar, joined the BJP today. Moga MLA Dr Harjot Kamal had switched to the BJP last evening. Spelling more trouble for the party, PPCC ex-chief Mohinder Kaypee warned of taking “harsh steps” if Adampur candidate Sukhwinder Kotli wasn’t replaced.Kaypee is related to Channi and the CM is learnt to have batted for his candidature as well. There are reports that Kaypee too may join the BJP. Senior Dalit leader Dr Raj Kumar Verka, Channi, Sidhu and Congress state incharge Harish Chaudhary are learnt to met Kaypee at his residence to mollify him. Sources said Kaypee may replace Kotli from Adampur as the screening committee members are learnt to have reached a consensus on the matter.In case of Bassi Pathana and Adampur, the allocation of ticket is being seen as the outcome of rivalry between Channi and Sidhu, though the party has been citing “winnability surveys” as the reason for selection of candidates. “With pressure building, the Congress could be forced to review ticket allocation in a few seats, especially in Doaba,” said a senior leader.More so, the party is yet to announce the contentious seats of Bhoa, Phagwara, Banga, Jalalabad, Patiala (Urban) and Fazilka.                                     #Channi                                     #CharanjitSinghChanni                                     #DrManoharSingh                                     #PunjabCM                                     #Punjabpoll2022                                     #PunjabpollwithTribune||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/denied-ticket-channis-brother-to-fight-as-ind-aide-nimisha-joins-bjp-361912
17-01-2022||Mandi Ahmedgarh||Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa predicts hung Assembly in Punjab||Veteran leader and president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has predicted a hung Assembly in the state following the ensuing Assembly elections, polling for which is scheduled to take place on February 14.“Unfortunately, people of the already distressed state will have to face vagaries of a hung government as none of the political parties seems to be in position of winning absolute majority,” said Dhindsa while talking to The Tribune during the sidelines of a social function here.Dhindsa regretted that he had not seen such an unpredictable political scenario when top leaders of even national parties are changing loyalties when only four weeks are left for the polling.“I fail to understand that even those political bigwigs are claiming to be ready to sacrifice their lives for the welfare of the state and its people who are shifting boats for the sake of the party ticket from a safe segment,” argued Dhindsa, maintaining that his party had joined hands with the BJP and the Punjab Lok Congress for the sake of communal harmony and bright future of the youth.Scorning the trend of announcing freebies by almost all political parties, Dhindsa dared all claimers of constituting government in the debt-ridden state, to pay interest on loans totaling over Rs 3 lakh crore.He urged the Election Commission to declare the election manifesto as a legal document and debar those parties from contesting elections which fail to keep promises made during earlier elections. Dhindsa said the crusade launched by his party for freeing the SAD from anti-Panthik forces would continue in future too. — OC                                     #SukhdevSinghDhindsa||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/dhindsa-predicts-hung-assembly-in-punjab-361925
17-01-2022||Jupinderjit Singh||Sacrilege cases back in Punjab poll debate||Chandigarh, January 16Seven years and several police investigations and inquiry commissions later, sacrilege incidents continue to remain a contentious issue in the political discourse ahead of the Assembly elections slated in February.For the Congress, sacrilege has been a staple issue to hit out at arch-rivals SAD, in whose tenure the incidents occurred. After the first incident was reported at Burj Jawahar Wala village in Faridkot on June 1, 2015, seven investigations have taken place, but the final word on who was responsible for the conspiracy is not out.A couple of similar incidents, including one at the Golden Temple last month, have further accentuated the sentiment on the subject.The acts mainly include stealing and desecration of the holy book besides circulation of blasphemous posters. A fallout of which were the two incidents of police firing at mobs protesting the sacrilege incidents.Probe nearing endWe are very serious in ensuring justice in sacrilege and related cases. We have taken the probe further and it is close to its logical conclusion. — Sukhjinder S Randhawa, deputy CMDirty politicsReal culprits should be punished. Dirty politics is being played. It will not make much impact as people see through Congress and AAP’s designs. — Daljeet S Cheema, SADWhy no justice yet?It is a tragedy that cases have still not been solved. The Congress promised justice. It is going to suffer in people’s court like the Akalis did in 2017. — Harpal Cheema, leader of oppnWant stern punishmentWe seek stringent punishment. We refrain from speaking much about it as it has become a sensitive issue. Akalis and Congress are playing dirty politics. — Tarun Chugh, BJPIt is believed the Congress came to power in March 2017 riding on the anti-Akali wave because of the sacrilege incidents, besides drugs. Capt Amarinder Singh had during the campaign (in)famously taken a religious oath promising justice in the cases.Towards the end of his tenure, his own party men turned against him for ‘failing’ to fulfil his promise. His successor, Charanjit Singh Channi, and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu regularly raised the issue on different fora. They also visited the main sacrilege sites, again promising justice.Even the office of the Advocate General has been involved in the controversy for allegedly not being able to fight the legal battle well. Police officials lost their posts and one of the key investigators — IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap — resigned in protest against the government for not supporting him in court. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had dismissed his investigation.The Akalis, on their part, have been aggressively defending as well as counter-attacking the Congress and AAP alleging conspiracy to defame them. They cite the High Court order trashing the police investigation.For the AAP, the issue is a potent weapon to take on both the Congress and Akalis over “misgovernance”, “poor handling” of the investigation and “conspiracy” for vote politics.THREE KEY INCIDENTSNearly 170 cases have been reported between 2015 and 2017, of which 3 remain unsolvedJune 1, 2015: A ‘saroop’ of Guru Granth Sahib is stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in FaridkotSept 24-25: Derogatory posters are found pasted at Bargari, FaridkotOct 12: Nearly 110 pages are found strewn near Bargari gurdwara; later 800 more found at Kohrian, Mishriwala, Sarai Naga and Bath in Tarn TaranTHE INVESTIGATIONDIG Khatra-led SIT: It claimed two youths from Australia funded the conspiracy to trigger riots between Sikhs and Sirsa-based dera followers. But claims fell flat when the youths took to social media, explaining money transfer. In 2018, the SIT announced arrest of 10 persons, all dera followers. One of them was later killed in Nabha jailJustice Zora panel: In its June 2016 report, it blamed police for ‘unwarranted’ firing and failure to investigate case properly. It did not state who ordered firing or who was responsible for sacrilege.CBI: After being handed over the probe by the SAD-BJP government in Nov 2015, it dismissed the DIG’s report. In 2018, it closed the case, saying it could not find proof against the 10 persons. The Congress government in 2018 withdrew the probe from agency, but the CBI later filed a closure report.Justice Ranjit Singh Commission: In its August 2018 report, it blamed Akal Takht’s pardon to dera head for disturbance. It said there were enough suggestions of dera’s involvement but the Home Dept and police “lacked seriousness” to probe. The Akalis called it politically motivated.Five-member SIT: The state formed SIT under Prabodh Kumar with IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap and 3 other members to probe Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan cases. The state formed another SIT under IG Surinder Parmar.POLICE FIRING & FIRsWhile police and protesters clashed at various places, two main incidents remain at the centre of probeOct 14, 2015: Police open fire at protesting mobs at Behbal Kalan and Kotkpaura. Two died at Behbal Kalan, 150 protesters and 21 cops were injured at both placesOct 15: Police lodge FIR of rioting and arson against protesters. Then Deputy CM Sukhbir Badal ordered setting up of Justice Zora Singh probe panelOct 21: After public protests, another FIR registered against police personnel for firing at protestersHC RULING & FRESH SITOn April 9, 2021, the HC quashed the five-member SIT probe and ordered formation of a new team without IG Pratap as member. The IG resigned on April 14In May, government formed a new SIT under ADGP LK Yadav to probe the police firing incidents. The SIT missed the deadline of six months to submit its report by November 7.

However, incumbent MLAs Sushil Kumar Rinku and Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal got the ticket from Jalandhar West and Phagwara, respectively, while the party fielded former BSP leader Sukhwinder Singh Kotli, who joined the Congress just recently, from Adampur. Kaypee, whose daughter is married to Channi’s nephew, had won the Jalandhar seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, but lost from Adampur in 2017.Speaking to The Tribune, Kaypee said: “The denial of ticket is very unfortunate.

Mann said earlier young people used to do direct jobs or their own business after getting their degrees from colleges and universities. But, today due to the lack of employment young people were falling victims to depression and drugs. Both money and talented people of Punjab were moving abroad because of the incompetent governments. “For the all-around progress of Punjab, it is most important to stop migration and this drain of talent and energy,” he said, criticising the Congress for failing to give employment to every household of Punjab as promised during the run up to the last elections. “After the formation of their government, instead of giving jobs to unemployed youth, the Congress started giving jobs to the children and families of their MLAs, ministers, and leaders,” he said.Will stop migrationCanada has now become another Punjab due to excessive migration.

Singer Sidhu Moosewala is contesting on the Congress ticket, scrap businessman Prem Arora on the SAD ticket and Dr Vijay Singla on the AAP ticket.All of them are promising to perform better than the sitting MLAs and claiming that earlier, candidates promised many things and disappeared after elections.Moosewala’s mother Charan Kaur is the sarpanch of Musa village in Mansa district, while both Prem Arora and Dr Vijay Singla are from non-political families.Congress leader Manoj Bala, who contested from Mansa in the last polls, have been adjusted and given ticket from the Maur Assembly segment and Sidhu Moosewala has been fielded from Mansa.Sidhu Moosewala (Cong):His songs are quite popular among youth. The singer belongs to a political family. His mother Charan Kaur is the sarpanch of Musa village in Mansa district.Dr Vijay Singla (AAP):He is a dentist by profession. He was also a contender for the Aam Aadmi Party ticket in the 2017 Assembly elections, but was ignored.Prem Arora (SAD):He is a scrap dealer-turned-politician. In the 2014 General Election, it was alleged Sukhbir Singh Badal had harassed the Arora family for political funding.In the past, Moosewala remained in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, especially for glorifying the gun culture and violence in his songs. Moosewala, who writes his own lyrics, also glorifies caste and the rawness of village life, which has made him popular among village boys who take pride in their identity.Jagdeep Singh Nakai who had contested the last elections on the SAD ticket from here, refused to contest this time. Subsequently, the party fielded Prem Arora. However, Nakai joined the BJP recently and is likely to contest from the Maur.Arora, a scrap dealer-turned-politician, was in the news during the 2014 General Election when Manpreet Badal and Bhagwant Mann had alleged that Sukhbir Badal was harassing the Arora family for political funding and the former had even moved to Haryana.Later, after the elections, Arora joined the SAD and was elected the urban president of the party in Mansa, which many saw as a damage-control move by the party to shun allegations of harassment.Dr Vijay Singla is a dentist. He was also a contender for the AAP ticket in the last polls, but was ignored then.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-parties-bet-on-new-entrants-in-mansa-361857

A meeting of the SSM was held in Ludhiana today to discuss on the second list of candidates, and also the outcome of the decision taken by the SKM.The issue of safeguarding the SSM’s image was also reportedly discussed, post the allegations levelled by AAP about the BJP-led Centre being at the back of a recent decision of the EC that would help the SSM register as a political party.The AAP has accused the BJP of trying to divide voters through this decision of tweaking the number of days required to register a political party from 30 days to seven.With the farmer unions being in the fray, 20 per cent Jat Sikh votes will get divided among the SSM, AAP and SAD. Since other parties are banking on the consolidation of Hindu and Dalit votes to work to their advantage, a fragmented Jat Sikh vote will only work to their advantage.Sources in the SSM say a few of the farmer union leaders, who have not joined the SSM, tried to intervene on their behalf with the SKM, requesting them to reconsider their decision of expelling the SSM for four months, but the SKM has refused to relent.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president, BKU Ekta Ugrahan, told The Tribune the decision would not be rolled back, as the mandate was given to all members of the SKM at its launch that they would not use the platform for any political purpose. “All unions who have decided to contest will have to leave the SKM,” he added.                                     #Rajewal                                     #SamyuktKisanMorcha                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/on-back-foot-ssm-sticks-to-decision-on-contesting-polls-361863

Before the 2012 elections, the foundation stone of Gian Sagar Institute and the Punjab Technical University’s Punjab Institute of Technology was laid, but the institutes were never established. The land acquired for the two institutes became a bone of contention between a local dera and the Khalsa Society.A girls’ college did come up in Mansa town in 2012, but it was not sufficient to cater to the needs of the youth. Nehru Memorial Government College, Mansa, doesn’t have a regular faculty. It is solely dependent on guest faculty.Farm distress and drugs have been the bane of this segment for long. Besides, sewerage overflow, waterlogging during monsoon, menace of stray animals and no bus service in villages are other problems the electorate faces.Healthcare facilities are no better. During the second wave of Covid, hospitals in Mansa were ill-equipped to treat critical patients. No government or private hospital had an ICU bed with a ventilator. As a result, patients went to Bathinda or Faridkot for better treatment.Past trendThe Akalis have won the seat twice (1997 and 2012). Sher Singh, who contested as an Independent, won in 2002.

Besides, the number of vaccination sites have been increased. Dr Rajesh Bhasker, state nodal officer, said every district had been asked to expedite the vaccination process to achieve the target.Meanwhile, many district election officers, in their letter to the heads of various government departments, have warned of an FIR against those who fail to get themselves vaccinated.To ramp up the pace of vaccination, the Health Department is understood to have requested the Union Government to reduce the time lag between the two doses of Covishield vaccine from 84 days to 28 for the staff on election duty.Both doses given to 46% populationAs of now, the state has administered the first dose to around 78 per cent of the eligible population and both doses to 46 per cent people. The EC, however, has asked the state to attain the mark of 92 per cent of the targeted population with the first dose and 69 per cent with the second dose in 10 days.                                     #PunjabCovid                                     #PunjabVaccination||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/attain-vax-target-in-10-days-ec-to-state-361872
17-01-2022||Saurabh Malik||High Court: Don't defer challan for long if anticipatory bail plea pending||Chandigarh, January 16In a significant judgment liable to change the way a challan or a final investigation report is filed by an investigating agency against an accused in a criminal case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the submission of the same should not be deferred for inordinate period merely because of pendency of anticipatory bail plea. The only exception would be “specific and genuine reason”.Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill has also asked the Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh’s Directors General of Police to consider the feasibility of issuing appropriate directions “to ensure that merely on account of pendency of an anticipatory bail application, the filing of report under Section 173 of the CrPC/supplementary challan against such accused is not deferred for long period”.Elaborating upon “specific and genuine reasons”, Justice Gill asserted it could be, for instance, in a case where the modus operandi was not completely known. The investigating officer was of the opinion that custodial interrogation was absolutely necessary to unravel the details of crime and it would only be possible if the anticipatory bail was dismissed.Justice Gill also directed the forwarding of the order’s copy to the police chiefs of the two states and the UT for necessary compliance. In his detailed order, Justice Gill added the court had noticed “some kind of tendency” with the investigating agency/prosecution to not present the report under Section 173 of the CrPC/supplementary challan during the pendency of an application for grant of anticipatory bail even though the accused may have joined the investigation and there was no bar on the same.Justice Gill added the court could visualise certain situations where the investigating agency/prosecution, keen to subject the accused to custodial interrogation, would be hoping for dismissal of the anticipatory bail plea. It would, as such, prefer to wait for pending petition’s outcome. But an accused was not required to be subjected to custodial interrogation in every case. In several cases, the prosecution was able to complete its investigation upon the accused joining the probe without the necessity to subject him/her to custodial interrogation.Justice Gill added a large number of instances had come to the court’s notice where the investigating agency/prosecution chose not to present report/supplementary challan during the pendency of anticipatory bail application. “It will be desirable that before taking such a decision for deferring the filing of the report, the investigating agency/prosecution thoroughly examines the matter to consider as to whether the case is such where custodial interrogation would be required in case anticipatory bail application is dismissed despite the fact that the accused on the basis of interim directions may have joined investigation,” Justice Gill added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-dont-defer-challan-for-long-if-anticipatory-bail-plea-pending-361880

17-01-2022||Batala||Punjab Diary: Unique bus service||Fallen flagQadian: Days after Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa’s sibling Fateh Jung Bajwa left the Congress and joined the BJP in a huff, he positioned the saffron party’s flag atop his Qadian house. Incidentally, both estranged brothers live in the same house, with Partap occupying the first floor and Fateh the ground floor. There were many doubting Thomases who claimed the flag would not stay for long because “a Congress man also lived in the same house”. As luck would have it, a burst of rain coupled with high-velocity winds flatted the flag. Fateh, with due respect, carefully rolled the flag and kept it in a corner of his house. Nobody for sure knows when it will be restored to its original glory.Shifting base twiceFerozepur: After four-time MLA Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who was earlier dropped from the Cabinet ostensibly due to his proximity to former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, left the Congress to join the saffron bandwagon, Jalalabad MLA Raminder Awla overnight shifted base to Guruharsahai with lock, stock and barrel, hoping to secure party nomination from his native town. However, within a few days, the Congress leadership asked him to move back to Jalalabad. Though it’s still not clear whether this “rich” legislator who earlier defeated SAD in Sukhbir Badal’s bastion will be fielded or not, the “no entry” approach of the party has left the MLA and his supporters “guessing” as to what went wrong.Star-struck votersMansa: There is a rush among youngsters these days to meet and get clicked with Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, who is busy campaigning in the Mansa Assembly segment. Moosewala is contesting on the Congress ticket. At each of his meetings, youngsters wait patiently for his address to finish and later swarm him for a selfie. The singer is often seen obliging them before heading off to his next public meeting.Seeking divine interventionMoga: With polls round the corner, candidates and ticket aspirants from various parties are looking for divine intervention as they make a beeline for places of worship and even sects. From ‘ardaas’ to ‘havans’, they are pulling out all the stops to ensure success in the polls. Actor Sonu Sood’s sister and Congress nominee Malvika Sood is no exception as she visited a local shrine as well as Gita Bhawan recently. SAD candidate Barjinder Singh, alias Makhan Brar, has also been visiting gurdwaras lately. AAP nominee Dr Amandeep Kaur Arora too paid obeisance at Salasar Dham and a few other local shrines recently.

17-01-2022||Ajay Vir Jakhar||Nation's nutrition security hinges on Punjab||Renowned agriculture economist Dr SS Johl presented two reports on the need for crop diversification in Punjab in 1986 and 2002. After over three decades, overflowing cereal granaries and large budget deficits have finally compelled a serious policy rethink at the level of the Union Government on the open-ended public procurement system limited to paddy and wheat. These two staple crops were favoured for the Green Revolution because with assured irrigation the yields are less prone to erratic weather, can be cheaply stored for long periods of time and are thus more suitable for food security purposes. Punjab provided the ideal conditions for growing these crops and was chosen as the Green Revolution state. When India gained Independence, Punjab had a diversified agriculture landscape. But, under the Union Government’s directives, policies and incentives to ensure India’s food security during its most difficult decades, it turned to specialised agriculture.Expecting a financially constrained Punjab to share the cost of crop diversification will be unrealistic. The process becomes even more complicated when one also seeks to secure dignified livelihoods for those dependent on agriculture while transitioning to regenerative alternatives. Solving the maze of the state’s policy of free power for tubewells will require political will, which is sadly lacking. Such challenges make the task of diversification too daunting for the administration to even contemplate.Unarguably, a critical need for crop diversification is to address the depleting groundwater. Two-crop monoculture is obliterating biodiversity, but most remain ignorant of it as an existential crisis. There is also a direct correlation between areas of the two-crop monoculture and farmer suicides. The man-days of work created by the paddy-wheat cycle are possibly 130 days a year or less. Spending days without work in a state of unemployed ‘worklessness’ leads to depression that is rampant in such communities. Creating diversity of rural occupation is just as important as creating off-farm jobs to improve rural livelihoods. Reduction in paddy cultivation is also essential to solve the vexed issue of crop burning.People wallow in satisfaction as India habitually celebrates its ‘self-sufficiency’ in food amidst continued massive malnutrition. The misperception crops up only because the majority of the people cannot afford nutritious meals and demand remains subdued. Consumption patterns change as economies grow, with people able to afford and demand more nutritious and diverse foods. Even as demand of diversified food increases, climate change will adversely impact food production targets, leading to erratic production on a regular basis. Across India, the groundwater table is depleting to a point where even access to drinking water has become a problem in tens of thousands of villages. In light of these challenges, Punjab, uniquely endowed with natural resources, is the key to helping attain India’s nutrition security.The question may well be asked: if crop diversification is so important, why has we failed so miserably for decades? The answer is simple enough: irrespective of the noise, the Union Government has always been wary of diversifying cultivation in Punjab. India’s priorities change with rising international commodity prices and occasional droughts across the land. Assured procurement of paddy and wheat at good prices from village market yards, coupled with prompt payment, has created the scourge. It is impossible to replace or replicate it for other cropping systems. The public procurement by the Central procurement agencies infuses about Rs 60,000 crore annually into financially strained Punjab. The state is not in a position to offset the inflow and revenue accruing to the state, and has therefore too opted to maintain the status quo. Globally, most trade across the world takes place with neighbouring nations as in the Americas or in the European Union. In the case of Punjab, landlocked far from seaports and neighbouring hostile Pakistan, trade is strangulated, resulting in loss of opportunities for agricultural export and creation of off-farm employment. In the process, Punjab has lost export markets of Afghanistan and Pakistan, its traditional trading partners. It is also denied road access to Central Asian markets that are closer to Punjab than Mumbai or Bengaluru.Financially strapped Punjab Agricultural University, too, failed to meet expectations and ‘agriculture research and extension’ are in desperate need of a reboot. An agriculturally rich state like Punjab has ironically become a net importer of fruits and vegetables, growing which would provide nutrition and on-farm work. Crops to replace paddy such as maize, groundnut, moong, cotton, bajra, arhar and soybean just do not yield comparative profits. Profit is not the only reason for farmers to choose to grow a particular crop. Comparative weather-induced production risks in other crops makes paddy a favoured crop. The late Dr GS Kalkat had observed that small and marginal farmers won’t adopt new crops unless they are assured of marketing of their produce. Diversifying crop production will require a myriad of actions, including creating regulated space for private traders, helping farmer producer organisations become aggregators, futures and options, warehouse receipts, risk insurance and dismantling trader monopolies in APMC market yards. But governance remains the biggest challenge in debt-ridden Punjab’s struggle to regain its glory. Much of what is required for successful diversification also lies outside the state boundaries. For example, Punjab dairy industry’s demand for maize is met from Bihar, where it sells for half the value of the MSP. This subdues farmgate prices in Punjab and hinders crop diversification. The food processing industry is essential for crop diversification, but policies of the Union Government haven’t delivered. The regularity of arbitrary import-export restrictions hurts more.The way forwardPunjab secured India’s first 50 years of food security; the time is ripe for the Union Government to fund crop diversification in Punjab for securing the next 50 years of India’s nutrition security. What should work is for the Centre to allocate Rs 5,000 crore per year for a six-year period. This should be over and above the current procurement payouts to Punjab farmers. Regretfully, the establishment in Punjab cannot be trusted to use the money for the intended purposes, ensuring a just transformation; nor can the Union Government be expected to address the pain of diversification in perpetuity. To make the transition permanent, we have to go beyond just bridging the profitability gap between paddy and the diversification crops. Therefore, a Niti Aayog-headed ‘Transition Commission’ should be constituted and be responsible for assessing the states’ plans and allocate resources conditionally.Expecting a financially constrained Punjab to share the cost of crop diversification will be unrealistic. The process becomes even more complicated when one also seeks to secure dignified livelihoods for those dependent on agriculture while transitioning to regenerative alternatives. Solving the maze of the state’s policy of free power for tubewells will require political will, which is sadly lacking. Both politicians and leaders of farmer unions root for populist, short-term economic benefits for farmers by consciously sacrificing livelihoods of future generations. Such challenges make the task of diversification too daunting for the administration to even contemplate. Consequently, even when something seems logical or even when resources are available, it does not mean that transformation will be accomplished. Let’s not lose hope, let’s pray.Five suggestions for Budget-2022 1 Seek assessment of government programmes by organisations of beneficiaries to enable various departments to ensure delivery of objectives and optimum utilisation of budgetary allocations.2 Statutory imposition of import duties on crops/ food where landing cost is below MSP (where declared) or below remunerative prices (where no MSP) so that these don’t enter Indian markets below a threshold price.3 Double funding for agricultural research institutions and farm extension services.4 Finance a consortium of farmer organisations for developing a metric for measuring what matters: true cost of food; and payment for farm ecosystem services.5 Establishing an autonomous body under the aegis of Ministry of Agriculture, mandated to provide real-time market intelligence and a nationally consistent database of food systems to all stakeholders, including the states.The author is ex-Chairman, Punjab State Farmers’ & Farm Workers’ CommissionSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com                                      #CropDiversification                                     #PunjabAgriculture||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/features/nations-nutrition-security-hinges-on-punjab-361848
