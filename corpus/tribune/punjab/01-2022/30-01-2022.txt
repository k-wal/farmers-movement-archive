Nawanshahr MLA Angad Saini to decide after being dropped by Congress||Jalandhar, January 30As sitting Congress MLA from Nawanshahr Angad Singh Saini was on Sunday denied ticket for the forthcoming Assembly elections, he is likely to file his papers either as the BJP candidate or as an Independent.In the third list declared this evening, the party announced the candidature of Satvir Palli Jhikki, who was the District Planning Committee chairman and had yesterday announced to return the Punjab Lok Congress ticket.Angad’s marriage with Aditi Singh, who is MLA Rae Bareilli Sadar (UP), rebelled against the Congress high command and moved to BJP is one of the reasons for denial of ticket to him. The Congress had also reportedly got a survey conducted before announcing the decision.Since the PLC candidate has left the ticket, chances of Angad fighting on its alliance partner BJP’s ticket cannot be ruled out. Sources close to the family too said the plans to contest had already been chalked out but whether it will be with the BJP or as Independent it was yet to be finalised. Asked if he could go his wife’s way, Angad maintained, “It is not my decision. I have called a meeting of the workers tomorrow at 10 am. I am taking my feedback from everyone and will announce my final decision tomorrow.”Hundreds of workers and party office-bearers gathered at his place to show solidarity with Angad. They announced to give mass resignations from the party in his support. They raised slogans, “Angad ji tum aage badho, hum tumhare saath hain.”Becoming an MLA at the age of 26, Angad was the youngest legislator in 2017 Assembly elections. His family has been denied ticket after over 60 years. In 2012, his mother Guriqbal Kaur was the MLA. His father Parkash Singh had contested twice - winning in 2002 and losing in 2007. Angad’s father’s cousin Charanjit S Channi was the MLA from the seat in 1997. Angad’s grandfather’s brother Dilbagh Singh contested here from 1962 to 1992.Interestingly, AAP candidate from the seat Lalit Mohan Pathak too has been councillor with Congress. With both Angad and Pathak set to contest against Congress candidate Jhikki, the cadre votes of the party are set to get split among three candidates.The MLA’s estranged uncle Charanjit Channi, who had contested as AAP candidate last time from the seat, said, “Angad was going too fast for his age. He could not somehow retain the ticket in the family. But I am happy with the decision of the party.”                                     #PunjabElections2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/to-go-solo-or-with-bjp-nawanshahr-mla-angad-saini-to-decide-after-being-dropped-by-congress-365597
30-01-2022||Amritsar||Photos of only Ambedkar, Bhagat Singh in government offices if AAP comes to power in Punjab: Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday if his party comes to power in Punjab after the February 20 Assembly polls, photographs of BR Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh will be put up in all government offices in the state.He further said there will be no photograph of any politician in these offices.The Delhi chief minister hit out at Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia for indulging in a verbal spat and ignoring the issues plaguing people in the Amritsar East Assembly segment, calling them “political elephants”.He alleged that Sidhu is not fighting against corruption rather his fight is only for becoming the next chief minister of the state.Talking to reporters here, Kejriwal said he had announced a few days ago that in every Delhi government office, there will be photographs of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh.“Today, we announce that after the formation of the (AAP) government in Punjab, there will be no photo of the chief minister or any other political leader in any government office.”“Photos of Babasaheb Ambedkar and Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh will be put up in all government offices, so that by looking at these photos, we and the next generation can draw inspiration from them,” he said.Recounting the struggles of Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh, Kejriwal said both wanted good education and health for everyone and that the country should progress after independence.Replying to a question on Amritsar East MLA Sidhu and Majithia, who has been pitted against the cricketer-turned-politician from the seat, he said the public issues of the Assembly segment are getting buried because of their verbal spat.“Both them are abusing each other and the public issues are getting buried because of it. Nobody is talking about the public issues. Both of them are kind of very big political elephants under whose feet the public gets crushed,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor said.He said the voters of Amritsar East have nothing to do with the verbal duel between Sidhu and Majithia, they are concerned about basic issues concerning electricity, drinking water, roads, and schools.Kejriwal alleged that Sidhu does not answer phone calls nor does he meet people personally.He also alleged that the Congress leader has done nothing for his constituency.On the other hand, Majithia is contesting the polls from Amritsar East only to defeat Sidhu, Kejriwal claimed.“What do people have to do with all this?” he asked.Kejriwal said AAP candidate from Amritsar East Jeevanjot Kaur is carrying out door-to-door campaigning and she will always be available to listen to people’s problems.The voters of Amritsar East should ensure that Kaur wins the electoral contest, defeating Sidhu and Majithia, he added.Replying to a question, Kejriwal said when he describes his party colleague Bhagwant Mann as “kattar imaandar” (fiercely honest), his political rivals feel that they are “kattar bhrashtachari” (corrupt) and it makes the difference very clear.Targeting the AAP’s political rivals, he said they only think about “looting” people, whereas Mann thinks about Punjab.Mann is the AAP’s chief ministerial candidate in Punjab.To another question on ordering a probe into alleged “loot” of money, Kejriwal said an account of every single penny will be taken. “Whatever money has been looted will be taken back,” he added.Mann wondered how the state had accrued a debt of Rs 3 lakh crore when no new schools, hospitals or roads were built in the last several years.He also took a dig at Sidhu, saying the cricketer-turned-politician was a part of the government for over 14 years and he still talks about politics of change.Mann said when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited Punjab a few days ago, Sidhu had said in his presence that he wanted power in order to take decisions and did not want to be a “darshani ghoda” (showpiece).Kejriwal said Sidhu’s fight is not against corruption or for reforming Punjab, but it is for becoming the next chief minister of the state.To another question, the AAP supremo alleged that raids were conducted at his premises by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the Income Tax department at the behest of the Centre.The 117-member Punjab Assembly will go to the polls on February 20 and the counting of votes will be taken up on March 10.                                     #Punjabpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/photos-of-only-ambedkar-bhagat-singh-in-government-offices-if-aap-comes-to-power-in-punjab-kejriwal-365568

He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In-charge of the Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools, which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.There were only five students in his one-room school called ‘Akal Academy’ at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur. Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the school building and managed it for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve the problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993.By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector. He was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care, including free surgeries, to poor people.Under a women empowerment programme, underprivileged young women are rehabilitated by way of education and jobs. — TNSPlayed significant role in edu sector                                     #BaruSahib                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/working-for-poor-padma-shri-iqbal-singh-passes-away-at-96-365402

She was more of a painter and home-maker till the pressure exerted by her family to become an MLA became irresistible. In 2002, the daughter-in-law of former Dinanagar legislator Jai Munni successfully tested the political waters for the first time. She went on to do an encore in the 2012 and 2017 elections. She is again in fray from Dinanagar again.Banking on goodwillHow come MP Sunny Deol is involved when the Rs 40-crore railway overbridge is financed by the Punjab Government? The MP is spreading falsehoods. I build bridges, not walls like my rivals do. Aruna Chaudhary, Congress nomineeWith the sun out after a week of gloom, Chaudhary visits Megian village, the home turf of SAD-BSP candidate Kamaljit Chawla. She tells the audience that her rival is a turncoat having changed four parties in five years. She takes a sarcastic swipe at him by claiming “his wife requested me for an anganwadi job which I managed”. “Can you trust a man who changes colours faster than a chameleon?” The lady has indeed developed all traits needed to be a politician and even more.Back in Dinanagar, she tells residents that Rs 40-crore railway overbridge coming up in the city is her pet project and adds that MP Sunny Deol has nothing to do with it. “How come Deol is involved when the project is financed by the Punjab Government? The MP is spreading falsehoods. I build bridges, not walls like my rivals do,” the Congress nominee says. Minutes later, she demolishes the defenses of her BJP rival Renu Kashyap by saying, “She is a political greenhorn. The less said about her, the better.” She is back to discussing the benefits of the 1-km-long railway bridge. “It will be completed before April 30. A new dawn will usher in the area once the project is inaugurated,” she says.Interestingly, somebody standing near Chaudhary rings up Kashyap to tell her what “Aruna ma’am thinks of her”. She knows what is happening, but the politician in her tells her to keep quiet. Chaudhary claims development is visible in all 247 villages of her segment. Her supporters remain busy distributing pamphlets, highlighting projects she has ushered in the segment in five years, including getting the sub-divisional status for Dinanagar town.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/campaign-trail-building-bridges-not-walls-like-rivals-365378

Talking to media after filing papers, Sidhu challenged Akali leader Bikram Majithia to fight only from Amritsar East. “If you have guts and have faith in people then leave Majitha and fight from one seat here,” he said.Accusing the SAD of diverting the attention of people from the pressing issues of the state, Sidhu alleged they “mortgaged” the state and it was under the debt burden of Rs 3 lakh crore.On former CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s comment that he would not let Sidhu win, the PPCC chief dared him to leave Patiala and contest from Amritsar East.As per Sidhu’s affidavit, his income came down to Rs 22.58 lakh against Rs 2.35 crore in 2017. He possesses a range of vehicles, including two Land Cruisers and a Toyota Fortuner. Mann, who was accompanied by his mother Harpal Kaur, said, “Dhuri residents have always supported me. I am confident of a huge win.”He claimed, “Residents of not only Dhuri, but the entire state want change. They are fed up with corruption and lack of development. AAP has offered them hope and will form the next government.”On the charge of his rivals that he remained absent from his constituency, Mann said he stayed in Dhuri and regularly visited villages of this constituency.                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #NavjotSidhu                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-set-for-multi-cornered-fight-sidhu-mann-file-nominations-365345

30-01-2022||Sukhbir Singh Badal||Navjot Sidhu and company will have to pay for false case against Bikram Majithia, says Sukhbir Badal||Will set up commission of inquiryWe will set up a commission of inquiry and the guilty police officers, be it 10 or 20 or 30 or 100 or even 200, will face dismissal from service. We have to set an example otherwise the system will continue to rot.The Congress has done nothing except highlighting drugs and sacrilege. They want to hide their failures. They don’t mention they had promised ‘ghar ghar naukri’, cellphones and a debt waiver to farmers but did nothing. They want to divert people’s attention. We have always had the welfare of people as our top priority. We need to talk about the Majithia case as it is totally false. We have to defend him as he is innocent.Arrogant Sidhu has gone overboard. He has been accusing Majithia of wrongdoings without any basis. So we have decided to fight against him in his home constituency. Let the voters decide who is right.Channi is just a small pawn. He makes noise only to make his presence felt when he sees someone else gaining more importance. Sidhu has been boasting that it was on his directions that the police registered a case against Majithia.Registering a false case is a crime. The government changed two DGPs and two chiefs of the Bureau of Investigation. They ignored written orders. In fact, I am not talking about Majithia’s case alone. There are a number of cases in which innocent persons have been framed.We will set up a commission of inquiry and the guilty police officers will face dismissal from service. We have to set an example. We will dismiss those found guilty, be it 10 or 20 or 30 or 100 or even 200. We will ensure nobody registers a false case in future.The Congress will not be able to cross 15 seats. In fact, there is a close fight between AAP and the Congress for the second position. Both will get between 10 and 15 seats. The AAP has no credibility. They have projected Bhagwant Mann as the CM face but actually it’s a mirage. Look at the posters. Kejriwal is omnipresent. Why so? I have never seen the Congress saying ‘Rahul Gandhi ko mauka do’. Bhagwant Mann is a dummy CM face, and I can give you in writing that if they get majority, Kejriwal will organise another bogus voting to capture the CM’s chair.This category of protesters are Leftist labour unions, not kisans. Most of them are associated with the CPI and CPM. These parties were controlling the agitation. Our cadre consists of genuine farmers. They are with us.These are paid surveys. Delhi Government’s funds are being used for the elections in Punjab by AAP to manage poll surveys. The party is giving advertisements asking them to do surveys in their favour. Last time, they did the same. One survey had given them 100 seats and they got only 20.The BJP will get no seat, so where is the question of a tie-up. If at all, they may win a seat or two. Last time it was a triangular contest, so people thought there would be a hung Assembly. But the Congress won with a big majority. This time we are sure it will not be a hung Assembly. We will win because our workers are committed.This time the elections are very frustrating. We are not meeting people. There seems no election mood. Neither the people, nor the politicians are enjoying.Punjabis always move to greener pastures. We will educate them before they go so that they are better placed. We have envisaged a student card scheme. Our kids will be able to study anywhere they want in the world. They will be given interest-free loans. Last time, we worked on improving roads and the power sector. The results on the ground showed that we were successful. This time, we will work on improving education and health sectors.                                     #BikramMajithia                                     #SukhbirBadal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/they-will-have-to-pay-for-framing-majithia-365347

30-01-2022||Jalandhar||AAP promises mohalla clinics, doorstep delivery services in Punjab's cities||Santisation, healthcare, and education figure big on Aam Aadmi Party’s plans for Punjab’s cities.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal addressed a press conference in Jalandhar to announce AAP’s plans for Punjab’s cities along with chief ministerial candidate Bhagwant Mann. The 10-point agenda was tailored for urban areas, Kejriwal said.“There were only two types of politics going on in Punjab,” Kejriwal, who’s on a three-day visit to Punjab, told the congregation. “One is filled with corruption and mafia involvements. The other is where the Aam Aadmi Party stands, presenting an agenda for the development and progress of Punjab.”His party, he said, had a proven track record in several areas, including healthcare services and education.“In order to solve the problems of Punjab, Bhagwant Mann and I, met people of all sections, traders, businessmen, farmers and employees to know their problems and announced different guarantees accordingly. All our guarantees were highly appreciated and supported by the people of Punjab.”The agenda, he said, made keeping urban problems in mind.“People in Punjab’s urban said you made promises for but didn’t announce anything for cities. That’s why today we have come up with guarantees for cities. We will make the cities of Punjab No. 1 in the country and make all the cities beautiful and clean by prioritizing cleanliness,” said Kejriwal.CleanlinessKejriwal said that like the cities of developed countries, the cities of Punjab will also have improved sanitation system and all the cities will be made clean and beautiful.Doorstep delivery servicesKejriwal said that his government would implement “Doorstep Delivery Services”, a system that his government first introduced in Delhi. Under the Delhi government’s Doorstep delivery scheme, his government promised home delivery of 40 essential public services, including caste and marriage certificates, driving licence, and new water connections, and set up a special helpline number for the purpose.“People will get freedom from middlemen-brokers and long queues. All government work, be it electricity connection or getting a ration card, government employees will go to the houses of the people,” Kejriwal said in Jalandhar. “People won’t have to go to knock on the government’s door—the government will come to you.”Underground cablesThe third agenda on AAP’s list was introducing underground cables in Punjab cities. His government, he said, would make all overhead electricity wires underground.“Hanging wires of electricity and other cables make the city look ugly,” he said. “AAP government has initiated undergrounding in Delhi’s densely populated areas.”Mohalla clinicsThe fourth promise he made was another one of Kejriwal government’s pet projects in Delhi—the Mohalla clinics. The mohalla clinic is a primary healthcare facility that his government first introduced in Delhi in 2015. The facility offers primary healthcare services, medicines and diagnostics free of charge.Aam Aadmi Party promised 16,000 village and mohalla clinics in Punjab. In addition, he promised his government would improve healthcare services in the state.“We will repair the government hospitals. Under the AAP government, the people of Punjab will not have to go to expensive private hospitals for treatment. All kinds of health facilities will be provided to them free of cost in government hospitals,” he said.Government schoolsThis is another one of AAP’s pet projects in Delhi: rejuvenation of government schools in cities. Real-nation building means giving good education to the children of our country, said Kejriwal.“In Delhi, we have made government schools world-class. While the condition of government schools in different states of the country has worsened, the result of government schools in Delhi this year has been 99.6 per cent, and more than 2.5 lakh children have opted out of private schools to enroll in government schools,” he said. “Today, students of government schools in Delhi are scoring good marks in IIT and NEET exams. Last year, more than 350 students from government schools in Delhi got admission in IITs.Electricity, water, roads, and toiletsFree electricity and water supply for 24 hours, better roads and parking, and better public toilets were other items on AAP’s agenda.“Roads in market areas are in poor condition,” he said. “Parking facilities in cities are inadequate and there aren’t enough public conveniences.”Women’s safetyThe ninth item on AAP’s agenda is safety and security. Women’s safety, said Kejriwal, would especially be prioritised.In Delhi, we’ve installed a large number of CCTV cameras in Delhi,” he claimed. “If we’re voted to power in Punjab, we’ll have CCTVs installed in every city to ensure the safety of women.”TaxesKejriwal promised that the AAP government will neither impose any new taxes nor increase current tax rates.“The previous governments didn’t lack money,” he claimed “They lacked the intention to get development work done. Good intentions make everything possible.”Also on the agenda was the eradication of corruption and rooting out the mafia.“For traditional parties, power is like a business. Corruption and mafia are just part of their politics. are parts of their politics. Electing them won’t change a thing. They’ve done nothing for so many years, and they’re not about to start now.”On the agenda—Cleanliness and better santisation, better roads, public toilets.
