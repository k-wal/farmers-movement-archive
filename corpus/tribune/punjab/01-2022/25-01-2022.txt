25-01-2022||Vijay MohanChandigarh||Punjab had highest number of drone incidents, recovery of arms and narcotics along Indo-Pak border||The international border in Punjab remains the most vulnerable stretch along the entire western front with Pakistan, with the highest number of drone sightings, apprehensions of intruders and recovery of arms as well as narcotics in the past year being reported in this sector.Of the 100 odd drone sightings reported by the Border Security Force (BSF) in 2021, as many as 67 have been in Punjab Frontier, followed by 24 in Jammu Frontier and six in Rajasthan Frontier, according to BSF sources. Gujarat Frontier and Kashmir Frontier reported two and one sighting, respectively.A senior BSF officer revealed that last year, there were 62 instances where enemy drones operating in the vicinity of the international border were fired upon by BSF personnel. These included 43 in the area of Punjab Frontier and 17 in Jammu Frontier, followed by two in Rajasthan Frontier.BSF data also showed that there have been 58 incidents of hostile drones crossing over into Indian territory, out of which 45 were in Punjab alone. There have also been instances of shot down drones being recovered by the BSF.BSF officers said the use of drones by adversaries as well as criminals in the border belt has increased over the past two years, posing new challenges.Extensive use of drones is being made by adversaries for surveillance of border areas and intelligence gathering. Similarly, this technology is being used by criminals indulging in smuggling of drugs, arms and other contraband items from Pakistan into India. BSF has been devising various strategies to counter the threat from drones.India, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, shares 3,323 kms of its land border with Pakistan along the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.While the BSF is responsible for the peace time management of the international border from the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat to Akhnoor in Jammu, some of its battalions are also co-deployed with the Army along the Line of Control up to Kargil in Kashmir and Ladakh sectors.The length of the international border in Punjab is approximately 553 kms of international borders with Pakistan, comprising the districts of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tara Taran and Ferozepur.While most of this border is fenced and flood-lit, riverine stretches along the course of the Ravi and Sutlej are vulnerable and difficult to guard. This came into focus during the recent terror attacks in Gurdaspur and Pathankot.Among states sharing the international border with Pakistan, Punjab also topped in the number of arms being recovered. The BSF seized 54 weapons, including AK series rifles and pistols along with 3,322 rounds of ammunition in the area of responsibility of Punjab Frontier, followed by 17 weapons and 1,170 rounds in Jammu Frontier. No weapons were seized in Gujarat and Rajasthan frontiers.As far as narcotics are concerned, BSF data shows that about 80 per cent of seizures along the western border in 2021 were in Punjab. Out of the total of 599.220 kgs of heroin seized, 485.165 kgs was in Punjab, followed by 57.670 kgs in Rajasthan and 37.935 kgs in Jammu.Last year, the BSF apprehended 38 Pakistani nationals, including criminals and inadvertent crossers, out of which 28 were in Punjab. Four Pakistani nationals were apprehended in Rajasthan and three each in Jammu and Gujarat. In addition, six Pakistani intruders each were shot by the BSF in Punjab and Jammu, two in Rajasthan and one in Kashmir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-had-highest-number-of-drone-incidents-recovery-of-arms-and-narcotics-along-indo-pak-border-364361
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC stays Bikram Singh Majithia's arrest for three days||The matter calls for in-depth investigation without being coloured by political overtones, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted in its detailed order dismissing Bikram Singh Majithia’s anticipatory bail in a drugs-related case.The order, released on Tuesday, makes it clear that State has made out a case for the senior Akali leader’s custodial interrogation, but was being granted three days protection against arrest for enabling him to approach the Supreme Court for challenging the order dismissing his plea.Justice Lisa Gill asserted the protection would remain in force only for three days from January 24 and was being granted keeping in view the peculiar circumstances of this case. Justice Gill made it clear that the Court did not find any ground to afford a week’s time for the purpose as prayed for in view of the elections being declared.Justice Gill added: “In case an effort is now being made by the State to break the nexus between the State machinery and the drug traffickers, I find no ground to scuttle the same at this stage…. It is further relevant to note that in this political slugfest, a complete and thorough investigation should not be the casualty, especially keeping in view the grave and serious charges levelled under the NDPS Act”.Justice Gill added it was vehemently argued that the petitioner has joined the investigation pursuant to an interim order dated January 10 and has cooperated fully with the investigating agency. But this fact has been denied and opposed by counsel for the State. He argued the petitioner was non-cooperative and refused to hand over the photographs/videos of his wedding, “necessary in view of the allegations of the co-accused having close relations with the petitioner and some of them having been introduced to each other on the occasion”.Justice Gill also took note of the counsel’s submission that the petitioner gave evasive replies by terming the question as outrageous and claiming some matters to be personal. “I have perused a note circulated on the petitioner’s behalf wherein it is stated that he found some of the questions to be unwarranted, offensive, unnecessary, with the investigating agency needlessly going around in circles and trying to enlarge the scope of the investigation beyond reasonable limits and not addressing itself to the allegations in the FIR…. I do not deem it appropriate to go into the details into the same or express any opinion thereon lest there be prejudice to any side, except to conclude the State has successfully made out a case of custodial interrogation of the petitioner in the face of his conduct”.The State was represented by senior advocate P. Chidambaram, Advocate-General Deepinder Singh Patwalia, and Senior Deputy AG Gaurav Garg Dhuriwala. Observations at a glance*The petitioner was admittedly holding a powerful position in the State government at the relevant time and is still a sitting MLA. Allegations against him are of having close association and relationship with persons admittedly engaged in drug trafficking.*Petitioner is alleged to have facilitated and abetted (drug trafficking) specifically by permitting the use of government machinery, including vehicles, security personnel and other facilities.*There is no embargo or bar upon the State government to register an FIR against the petitioner, in case it found there was sufficient material to proceed against him. “I do not find any irregularity, infirmity or illegality in the opinion rendered by the Advocate-General, Punjab, as detailed in the FIR dated December 20, 2021.  *Allegations of mala fides and political rivalry are not considered to be substantial enough to be a ground to afford anticipatory bail. It cannot be denied that the petitioner was at the helm of affairs at the time of occurrence of alleged offence(s). He was a cabinet minister for some part of the time and admittedly closely related to then Deputy Chief Minister.*The petitioner is not entitled to relief merely on the ground that action was not taken by the State government for these long years.*A report in the matter was duly handed over to the State. In case delay has occurred due to tardiness of the State machinery for any reasons whatsoever, it cannot provide a sufficient ground to the petitioner for grant of anticipatory bail.Justice Gill added the Court did not find ground to afford one week as prayed for.                                     #anctipatorybail                                     #arrest                                     #BikramSinghMajithia                                     #drugcase                                     #Majithia                                     #PunjabHC                                     #stay||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-hc-stays-bikram-singh-majithias-arrest-for-three-days-364343

He said the problems being faced by the people are common in every region be it Malwa, Majha or Doaba.“The people are suffering with rampant drug abuse, poverty, rising inflation and unemployment and unfortunately no traditional party is speaking on this issue. They were busying in mudslinging at each other,” Sisodia said.“We had accepted the mandate given by people in 2017 but now is time for them to ask questions to the representatives of the government who are approaching them for seeking votes,” he added.Answering queries regarding PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s statement terming the televote for declaring Bhagwant Mann as the CM face as fake, he said Sidhu’s party leaders were not getting any response and therefore he sees everything as fake.On ED raid at Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s relative, he said the money recovered from the residence of his relative was tax payers’ money.Dr Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, addressing the people said that former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had sweared on Gutka Sahib and promised to end drug abuse and provide employment to every house. However, neither of the two promises were fulfilled during five-year rule of the Congress government.Politicians were sheltering drug peddlers and notorious criminals. They were behind the sixth river of drugs in pious land of Punjab. He said during elections they lure voters by drugs, liquor and money. He said if AAP comes to power, it would expose all drug peddlers and politicians sheltering them besides breaking the back of the drug cartel and criminals.                                     #KunwarVijayPratap                                     #ManishSisodia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/manish-sisodia-holds-door-to-door-campaign-for-kunwar-vijay-pratap-364187

Interestingly, PLC’s poll symbol is hockey stick and ball.“I never intended to join politics in my life. I am told that I am a fit case to fight the elections this time. So why not?” he said, adding his concern for the youth of Punjab and the plight of the present day sports also helped him in his decision.Ajit Pal remained part of the Indian hockey team during three World Cups and a host of international championships. He was also part of the 1968 Mexico and 1972 Munich bronze winning Olympic teams. He was conferred upon the Arjuna Award in 1970.He said, “The state’s youth need the right direction.

25-01-2022||---||Bikram Singh Majithia's bail petition dismissed by Punjab and Haryana High Court||Chandigarh, January 24Just about a fortnight after senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia was granted interim anticipatory bail in a drugs-related case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today dismissed his plea. The setback for Majithia comes a day before the filing of nominations is scheduled to begin for the Punjab Assembly elections.The order was passed by Justice Lisa Gill after hearing rival contentions during the final arguments on his bail plea this afternoon. The detailed order was yet to be uploaded on the High Court’s official website. The case status on the website said “dismissed”. His counsel, during the course of hearing, asked for a week’s time for Majithia to surrender. Justice Gill said the court would consider the request. Majithia was earlier granted interim anticipatory bail and directed to join the investigation.The Punjab Government’s stand before Justice Gill’s Bench, on the previous date of hearing, was that Majithia had not extended full cooperation during the investigation. Majithia now has the option to move the Supreme Court following the dismissal of his plea. Else, he can surrender before the police or the court.Among other things, Majithia was — at the time of being granted interim anticipatory bail—asked to keep his mobile phone constantly on and share with the investigation agency his live location through WhatsApp. He was also directed to fully cooperate in the investigation and abide by the conditions, including appearance before the investigation agency as and when required.Majithia was apprehending arrest after a case under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at Mohali on December 20 last year. He moved the High Court after a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition. Majithia had claimed that the registration of the FIR was the result of political and ulterior motives.The Bench was also told that the petitioner had no criminal record. He was a “mainstream politician” and undertook to join investigation, fully cooperate with the investigation agency and abide by any conditions imposed by the court.Counsel seeks week’s time to surrender                                     #BikramMajithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bikram-singh-majithias-bail-petition-dismissed-by-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-364156
25-01-2022||---||Punjab polls 2022:  Alliance must for Punjab's stability, says BJP||New Delhi, January 24The BJP will contest 65 seats, Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress 37 and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) 15 seats in the Punjab Assembly elections, BJP president JP Nadda said here today.Announcing the seat-sharing formula for the NDA alliance, Nadda, however, said there could be minor readjustments. “This is the broad figure that I am giving,” he added. Flanked by allies Amarinder Singh and Dhindsa at the BJP headquarters, he said the forthcoming elections were not only for “satta parivartan” (change in regime), but also to ensure safety and stability in the border state.Referring to the 600-km border India shares with Pakistan and its relationship with the neighbour, Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, “If Punjab remains safe, the country remains safe.”“For the sake of stability and security of the country, the alliance is important,” BJP leaders said, building the case around the need for a “stable and safe government” in Punjab given its close proximity to Pakistan and issues like terrorism, drugs and arms smuggling.Nadda said, “Punjab needs special attention. It needs a double-engine government and a better coordination between the Centre and the state.” Hailing the state as a “leader”, especially in defence and food security of the country, he highlighted steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonstrating his “love” for Punjab.“The NDA government will bring stability and security in Punjab. The state is in massive debt and needs special attention. Our aim is to bring it back on track,” the Bharatiya Janata Party president said, promising “zero tolerance” towards terrorism and activities like drugs and arms smuggling. Amarinder Singh and Dhindsa said Punjab would need fresh investment for progress, which could happen only under the National Democratic Alliance regime.                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-alliance-must-for-punjabs-stability-364147

The party has so far declared 86 candidates for the February 20 polls.With Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi skipping the meeting, a sub-committee consisting of veteran leader Ambika Soni, AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal and Punjab screening panel chairman Ajay Maken was asked to hold discussions with the CM on the pending seats and submit the list to the high command for approval. Sources said the CEC would not meet again on the Punjab list as the sub-committee had been empowered to finalise the pending names.The sources said sharp differences between the CM and Punjab Congress campaign in-charge Sunil Jakhar persisted on renominating sitting MLAs Joginder Pal from the Bhoa SC segment and Sukhpal Bhullar from Khem Karan. While CM Channi is backing both, Jakhar is learnt to have opposed them citing their “interests in sand mining business”.Also, while the Congress is wanting to shift sitting Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid to Jagraon citing anti-incumbency, he is insistent on re-contesting the seat. In Ferozepur Rural, the Congress appears to be inclined to field former AAP leader Ashu Banger, who recently switched over. This means sitting MLA Satkar Kaur could be dropped.The Tribune has learnt that the name of former Punjab CM Harcharan Brar’s daughter-in-law Karan Brar as a candidate from Muktsar is too on the table. “The party appears to have made up its mind to field her,” a source said. Discussions on Patiala, Jalalabad and Batala are still on. Rahul Gandhi will kickstart Punjab’s election campaign virtually on January 27, the sources said.Nominations start in Punjab from today                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/differences-stall-congress-2nd-list-of-punjab-candidates-364141

These original doors, 118 inch in height, 110 inch wide and with a thickness of 4 inch, have a sandalwood base with a silver sheet studded with carved ivory and assembled with golden screws.A special glass display case has been installed at the entrance of Central Sikh Museum, located adjacent to ‘parikrama’. The original doors carved by Yaar Mohammed Khan were installed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1800 AD.In the backdrop, these doors decayed with time and were unhooked for repairs in 2010, but the restoration work could not be executed due to several hiccups. The wooden base was found beyond repair and non-availability of ivory that was to be engraved on the doors’ borders proved a major task. As the sale of ivory is banned in the country, the SGPC had decided to leave the original doors “untouched”. Hence, the original doors were replaced with its replica in October 2018.SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami said the original doors have been showcased in a special glass enclosure for the pilgrims. “The purpose is to preserve them as a part of the Sikh history and apprise the visitors about it. We had to remove them from ‘Darshani Deori’ as they decayed with time and a replica was the only way out. Every minute detail was clicked through micro-digital photography technique to observe its pattern to prepare its copy. Craftsmen from Agra were engaged for carving work,” he said.Barring the ivory work (which was replaced with seashells to have desired effect), the new doors were an error-free copy and were installed at the designated place on “Darshani Deori”.The craftsmen took eight months to prepare the replica. At least six quintals of black sheesham and 65 kg of silver was used for the job that was completed under the supervision of Kar Sewa Baba Kashmir Singh Bhurewale.Muslim craftsman                                     #GoldenTemple                                     #MaharajaRanjitSingh                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/200-yr-old-doors-on-display-in-amritsar-364134

Fateh, being a Sikh face, is certain to pull in a large chunk of the Jat Sikh vote to his side. It is going to be a win-win situation for us,” he maintained.Fateh is a Congress MLA but recently switched sides to the BJP when it became clear he would not be re-nominated by the Congress to the Qadian seat despite PCC president Najvot Singh Sidhu’s backing.That the party has given its stamp of approval was evident yesterday when the senior leadership asked Fateh to preside over a workers’ meeting.The legislator was quick to obey the party’s diktat and held a workers’ meeting at the BJP office.Specks of dissidence did surface against his candidature with veteran leaders claiming they had been ignored. However, by the time the meeting ended, he had managed to pull everyone onto his side, particularly the old-timers from the saffron outfit.Sources say Fateh still has a lot of work to do because two senior leaders, former municipal committee chief Naresh Mahajan and Batala unit former president Suresh Bhatia, did not turn up. Both were strong contenders for the ticket this time.With all other mainline parties announcing their candidates, the Congress is still trying to get its act together. Like in the previous elections, the Jat Sikh versus Hindus debate has again surfaced.Supporters of three-time MLA Ashwani Sekhri claim Batala has a Hindu majority population, while loyalists of Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa cite statistics to claim the majority of voters are Jat Sikhs. Both these leaders are in the reckoning for the ticket. The high command has already re-nominated Tript from his old seat of Fatehgarh Churian but he is adamant that either he or his son should be given the nomination from Batala.                                     #FatehJungBajwa                                     #SAD                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjps-fateh-jung-singh-bajwa-gets-going-no-clarity-in-congress-364114

The Sanyukt Samaj Morcha has fielded Sarbjit Singh Alal who has raised various social issues in the past.The first visit of Mann, who is the party’s CM face also, on Sunday to the area laid bare the fact that the constituency would witness a fierce battle as all parties have trained their guns on him.Not many residents are ready to express their opinion on their choice, but some of them spoke of change.When asked about what kind of change, some say there is a need for third alternative while others are in favour of farmers’ party. However, there are still many who say they will vote for traditional parties.In all, there are 1,64,322 voters, including 86,593 male and 77,721 female.“The credibility of Mann is zero in the constituency as neither he has given promised funds to villages nor fulfilled other promises. He has not even visited the villages that voted for him twice during the Lok Sabha elections,” said Garg.Mann and other leaders of his party have been raising the corruption issue and lack of basic facilities. Goldy has challenged Mann to an open debate on developmental works undertaken by him. He also has been trying to build a narrative of an ‘outsider’ versus ‘Dhuri da putt’ as he belongs to the constituency. “Mann has always escaped from debate. I challenge him to an open debate as he has done nothing for the Sangrur Lok Sabha constituency despite winning twice. I will also share my achievements during the debate,” said Goldy.“Residents are fed up with the Congress, SAD, AAP and others. This time, they have made up their mind to vote for farmers. Dhuri voters are well aware that about the wrongdoings of Goldy, Mann and Garg. I am getting good response and will defeat other candidates,” said SSM candidate Sarbjit Alal.Largely rural areaHaving 74 villages, the constituency is largely rural. Dhuri town is the only urban area in the constituency. Farmers’ issues, including complete waiver of dues of sugarcane growers, lack of health and education facilities and problem of drug menace, are likely to dominate the election.                                     #Bhagwantmann||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/key-seats-bhagwant-manns-entry-raises-stakes-in-dhuri-364099

Bhagwant Mann, state aap chiefFrom ‘Ik mauka Kejriwal nu’ in the previous polls, the AAP was seeking vote on ‘Ik mauka Kejriwal te Mann nu’ slogan, he said, asking people to give a chance to them.“This time, it’s a contest of pairs. On the one hand, there is Kejriwal and Mann, on the other it’s Sidhu and Channi. Kejriwal and I are like brothers. Houses where brothers live peacefully are blessed, but those where they fight are destroyed. Sidhu and Channi keep saying different things. They claim theirs is a ‘double engine’, ours too is, but it is on one track. The Congress has four to five engines running on different tracks,” he said.Asked about the recent seizure by the ED, Mann said Rs 10 crore was a huge amount to be found at the house of a CM’s relative. “The money must have been given for some wrongdoing. Channi should explain where the money was meant to be used.”On the issue of illegal mining, Mann said former CM Capt Amarinder Singh had expressed helplessness at taking action at a number of Congress MLAs involved. —                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #IllegalMining||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhagwant-mann-charanjit-channi-cant-handle-kin-how-will-he-control-punjab-364086
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||AAP’s drive ‘fake’, complaint filed: Navjot Singh Sidhu||Terming AAP’s ‘Janta chunegi apna CM’ campaign a “trick of deception” to create “fake” perception among people, PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu has complained to the Election Commission seeking a probe into the matter.Explain expenditure incurredDetails of expenditure incurred in analysing data must be explained as it is the violation of poll code. Over 2,000 people and Rs25-30 crore are required for exercise. Navjot SidhuThrough the campaign, AAP leader Arvind Keriwal had claimed to have received 21,59,475 calls and messages before announcing Bhagwant Mann as the party’s CM face, based on the feedback received.Sidhu, in his complaint, said the AAP had created a fake hype to mislead people. Questioning the party claims of having analysed the data in just four days, he said it was humanely impossible to process 7 lakh WhatsApp and 2.5 lakh voice messages, apart from 8 lakh voice calls.“As it takes at least 15 seconds, as many as 23,040 calls can be attended in four days. If the claims of AAP are correct, details of expenditure incurred in analysing the data needs to be explained.”He claimed the AAP launched a private number to host the “fake” contest to “elect” their CM face by popular vote. “They announced the CM face by popular vote of 21,59,475 responses received within four days, whereas the population of Punjab is over 2 crore,” he claimed.“By creating this fake campaign, the AAP had created a hybrid model of fake news and deceptive talent show which is now being captured largely by all publishers and electronic media paid by the party. This is being done to disillusion sincere voters who are not realisingthis is merely a marketing budget of AAP and media houses are paid for featuring this as a headline,” alleged Sidhu.He claimed it wasn’t the first time the AAP had falsified the public. “Kejriwal is a perpetual and habitual liar. He hasn’t only deceived Indians, but also NRIs whose money he has been enjoying for his personal benefits.” — TNS                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #NavjotSidhu||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aaps-drive-fake-complaint-filed-navjot-singh-sidhu-364084

Though the morcha had amended its application and re-submitted it to the commission on January 17, they are yet to hear on the date of their application.The morcha has already fielded 98 candidates, including the 10 candidates fielded by the Sanyukt Sangharsh Party of Gurnam Singh Charuni.Prem Singh Bhango, parliamentary board member of the morcha told The Tribune, the morcha had also filed an application before the EC on January 12, demanding that an election symbol be allotted to them.“Since we have not heard anything from the commission, we approached the Chief Electoral Officer, Punjab, here today and requested him to treat our candidates as Independent, but allot a common election symbol of ‘tractor’. We requested him to ask all deputy commissioners to allot common symbols to our candidates. He assured us that he would look into the matter,” said Bhango.                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rajewal-led-morcha-seeks-tractor-symbol-364083
25-01-2022||Bathinda||Setback for Sanyukt Samaj Morcha, CPI goes it alone in Punjab polls||In fresh trouble for the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM), after the CPI (ML), another ally, Communist Party of India, today said it will contest on its own and field candidates on 22 seats in the Assembly elections. The party released its first list of 15 candidates.Punjab CPI secretary Bant Singh Brar, former MLA Hardev Arshi and leader Nirmal Dhaliwal accused SSM’s Balbir Singh Rajewal of being a “one-man show” and accused the outfit of being “undemocratic” in distributing ticket. They accused Rajewal of being “inaccessible”. Nine seats were allotted to the CPI, but only six had been announced so far, they claimed, adding there was no clarity on why their seats were reduced.“Under the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, they together fought against the three farm laws and later some unions formed the SSM to contest the polls. At the time, we made it clear the CPI is a national political party and it has its own identity, so we will contest on our symbol, but they later started asking us to contest on the SSM symbol.”The CPI leaders also questioned the allotment of ticket by the SSM to gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana from Maur in Bathinda. They accused the outfit of overlooking the controversial past of candidates. They said several candidates who had no role to play in the farm stir had been given the ticket.However, the CPI leaders were hopeful of the SSM holding talks with them so that an alliance could be worked out.Nominees announcedSurinder Singh Jalalabad | Gurditta Singh NihalSinghwala | Sukhwinder Singh Malout | Krishan Chauhan Budhlada | Satwant Singh Lehragaga | Amarjit Singh Amritsar West | Gurmail Jagraon | Rajinder Singh RanaSultanpur Lodhi | Bhagwan Singh Payal | Kashmir Singh Nabha | Kashmir Singh Zira | Sunil Dutt Chabbewal | Santokh Singh Hargobindpura | Satyadevi Saini Pathankot | Gurdayal Singh Khadoor Sahib                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/setback-for-sanyukt-samaj-morcha-cpi-goes-it-alone-in-punjab-364081
25-01-2022||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu calls AAP's drive to select CM face 'scam', complaint lodged with poll panel||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday dubbed AAP’s survey to select its CM face for the state Assembly polls a “scam” and “deceptive scheme” and said his party has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against it.Sidhu also launched a scathing attack against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal, calling him a “trickster and hypocrite”.Addressing reporters at a press conference here, Sidhu urged the Election Commission to register criminal cases against AAP for running a “fake campaign”.AAP had announced its Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann as its CM face last week following a survey in which people were asked to call on a phone number to give their preference.Kejriwal had claimed that they had received over 21.59 lakh responses from January 13 to 17 under the “Janta Chunegi Apna CM” campaign and 93.3 per cent people had given Bhagwant Mann’s name.Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu got 3.6 per cent votes, the Delhi chief minister had added.The Congress leader said this many calls can’t be received on a private number over a few days.“If we try to fit this data into mathematical calculations, then it does not make sense at all. Usually, such calls take at least 15 seconds, then only 5,760 calls can be attended in one day and that shall add up to 23,040 calls in four days,” he said.“It is a deceptive scam to trick people. This is exactly what he (Kejriwal) has done,” he said.“This mechanism of deceit to create an illusion and propaganda of fake news is a complete violation of the model code of conduct and the Election Commission of India should take strict notice of it,” Sidhu said.He said the Congress has complained to the election panel as to how Kejriwal is trying to “befool” people of Punjab through “dirty tricks”.Kejriwal is a “trickster and a hypocrite,” said Sidhu.“I will expose this hypocrite, he is a habitual liar. This was an avoidable lie. Why would you create all this nonsense and propaganda to do something like this? But if he has done this, it is not the first time. We have seen earlier how he went on an apology-tendering spree, including Bikram Singh Majithia,” said Sidhu.In the complaint to the Election Commission, Sidhu has written that AAP received around 7 lakh WhatsApp messages, 2.50 lakh voice messages and approximately 8 lakh voice calls.Sidhu urged the poll panel to register criminal cases against AAP.“Due an inquiry be conducted and in case, this campaign is found to be fake, in such an instance, the Election Commission is requested to register criminal cases against the Aam Aadmi Party through its national president Arvind Kejriwal under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code,” wrote Sidhu in a letter to the Chief Election Commissioner.Reacting to the charge, AAP leader Raghav Chadha said Sidhu’s pain is he got only over 3 per cent votes in the AAP’s campaign.“His own party does not take him seriously, then why should we take him seriously.” Chadha said “Sidhu is the drama queen of Punjab politics”.“Sidhu used unparliamentary language against AAP and our leader Arvind Kejriwal, we condemn it. He is frustrated that he was not made the CM when Amarinder Singh was removed.”“His party has not declared him CM face so far and no other party is willing to take him, so all his frustrations are coming out,” he said.The AAP leader further said, “Sidhu’s mission is to divert the real issue, which is illegal mining racket,” the leader said.“After the Enforcement Directorate raids, entire Punjab is seeking answer from the Congress and the chief minister,” he said.“When AAP carried out a raid in December and exposed how illegal sand mining was going on at Jindapur village in Chief Minister Channi’s Chamkaur Sahib constituency, Sidhu had maintained complete silence. Sidhu who keeps speaking about cable mafia, drug mafia, other mafia, did not utter a word when we exposed the illegal activity,” said Chadha.                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-calls-aaps-drive-to-select-cm-face-scam-complaint-lodged-with-poll-panel-364075

25-01-2022||Chandigarh||High court rejects bail plea of Akali leader Bikram Majithia in drugs case||The Punjab and Haryana High Court today dismissed anticipatory bail plea of senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia.The order was passed by Justice Lisa Gill after hearing final arguments on his bail plea. Majithia was earlier granted interim anticipatory bail and directed to join investigation.The setback for Majithia came a day before the process of filing nomination papers was to commence. Punjab government's stand before Justice Gill on the previous date of hearing was that he had not extended full cooperation during the investigation. His counsel asked for a week to surrender. Justice Gill observed the Court would consider it.Majithia now has the option to move the Supreme Court, following the dismissal of his plea. Else, he can surrender.Among other things, Majithia was -- at the time of being granted interim anticipatory bail -- asked to keep his mobile phone constantly on and share with the investigating agency his live location through WhatsApp. He was also directed to fully cooperate in the investigation and abide by the conditions, including appearance before the investigating agency as and when required.He was further directed not leave the country till the next date of hearing and provide his mobile number to the investigating agency. He was also asked not to directly or indirectly try contacting any of the witnesses or anyone connected with the case in any manner.Majithia was apprehending arrest after a case under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at Mohali on December 20, last year. He moved the High Court after a Mohali Court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition. The case had attained political proportions, with Majithia claiming that the registration of the FIR was vitiated by political and ulterior motives.                                     #BikramMajithia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-akali-leader-bikram-majithia-in-drugs-case-364028
25-01-2022||New Delhi||For the sake of stability of country the alliance was important, say Punjab NDA leaders||The BJP will contest 65 seats, Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress 37 seats and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led outfit 15 seats, BJP president JP Nadda on Monday said, announcing the seat sharing formula for the upcoming elections to the 117-member Punjab Assembly.Nadda said there may be a couple of changes here and there of candidates and other factors. The BJP is contesting Punjab elections in alliance with Punjab Lok Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sankyukt), the breakaway faction of Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal).Nadda said the alliance is not just meant for change in power in the border state but also security of future generations. Noting that Punjab shares a 600 km border with Pakistan, Nadda emphasised that the alliance had been made to “save” the key border state.Similar statements were also made by Amarinder Singh, who pointed to use of drones dropping ammunition and other security threats to the state.“The purpose of these operations was to weaponise the state and carry out nefarious activities in collusion with Pakistan,” he said. “I even asked Navjot Singh Sidhu, what are you doing going around hugging (leaders of Pakistan),” he said, adding that Punjab needs infrastructure and finance flow for progress that can only happen with an NDA alliance. “I removed Sidhu because he was totally incompetent and useless,” he said. Singh also claimed to have received a request from Pakistan that “Sidhu should be taken and in case he is found incompetent he should be removed”.                                     #Amarinder                                     #BJP                                     #Punjabpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-polls-bjp-to-contest-65-seats-ally-amarinder-singhs-party-37-364024
