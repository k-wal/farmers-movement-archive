23-01-2022||---||Rana Gurjeet urges Sonia Gandhi to expel Sukhpal Khaira||Jalandhar, January 23Senior Congress leader and Technical Education Minister Rana Gurjeet Singh on Sunday urged party president Sonia Gandhi to expel Sukhpal Singh Khaira from the party for his alleged involvement in ‘drug money’ laundering.In a letter to Gandhi, Rana said, “He (Khaira) is currently in jail in connection with the money laundering case. It is not the routine money laundering case of unaccounted wealth or money. It relates to drug money. The money in question has been made through drugs, which is unacceptable and indefensible.”The minister said the Congress party has always been against drugs. “In fact it was our former president Rahul Gandhi who had flagged the issue in 2015, while referring to the serious problem of drugs in Punjab,” he said in the letter, adding, “How can our party give ticket to someone who is tainted by drug charges or to any of his family members?”“It will be difficult for the Congress leaders and contestants to defend the indefensible that on the one hand we have sworn that we will eliminate drugs and on the other hand we are giving a party ticket to a tainted person who is in jail accused of money laundering which he accumulated from drugs,” he said.Rana said, this was high time that the Congress took a stand on the issue of drugs and someone who is tainted and is in jail for the same charges should not get the party ticket.“He is not winning anyways and allotting the party ticket to him or any of his family members will not only send a wrong signal, but will also mean wasting a precious constituency and during a crucial election,” he added.He claimed that as a loyal and humble Congressman, who has served in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha for the last two decades projecting and defending the Congress policies, principles and ideals, he could not turn a blind eye to what was happening in his party and that too just next to his own assembly constituency.“I consider it my sincere duty to bring all these facts to your attention so that you take urgent corrective measures,” he remarked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rana-gurjeet-urges-sonia-gandhi-to-expel-sukhpal-khaira-363799

He has termed the FIR as baseless and said his political opponents were trying to make an issue out of nothing.Malerkotla police have registered a case under sections 153-A IPC ( Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence) and 125 of representation of People Act 1950,1951 and 1989 against Mohammad Mustafa. The FIR claimed that while patrolling in area, they got information about a video wherein Mustafa was allegedly giving an inflammatory speech.“After getting information about viral video, our SHO has registered the FIR. We would ask Mohammad Mustafa also to submit his reply during our investigations” said SSP Malerkotla, Ravjot Grewal.After Mustafa allegedly threatened the AAP workers with dire consequences four days back during a meeting in evening and video went viral, AAP leaders also lodged a complaint with Election Commission and a notice was issued to Mustafa. But after video created storm on social media, police finally registered an FIR last night.“I have never spoken against any community nor I have asked my supporters to issue any statement.

23-01-2022||---||Poll season and party hopping: Why self-gain is the ideology of choice||Renu Sud SinhaTHE findings of a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) on candidates who switched parties and recontested from 2014 to 2021 are both insightful and eye-opening. Based on the election affidavits of 500 MLAs and MPs, the BJP, as expected, emerged as the biggest gainer, with 173 joining the party. The Congress was the biggest loser, with 177 defecting.The defections, the report noted, led to governments in Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Goa, Arunachal Pradesh and Karnataka falling, blaming it on the nexus of money and muscle power, and absence of laws on the functioning of parties. “It will be a mockery of democracy if we fail to plug these loopholes,” the report released in September last year concluded, adding that it is high time “our parties and politicians put an end to the politics of convenience and self-gain, and start practising politics of conviction, courage and consensus”.However, parties think that they are above law, says Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder, ADR. This is quite evident in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur, where party hopping remains the most dominant election activity ahead of the polls beginning next month.A lawyer by profession, Chhokar favours a “comprehensive and strict law governing the functioning of parties that can have checks and balances to take care of many existing loopholes”. Till such a law comes into existence, he says, the free run of hopping parties will continue.Maj Gen Anil Verma (retd), national coordinator and head, ADR, calls it a sad state of affairs. “The parties have been defying orders of the Election Commission of India (EC) and the Supreme Court on poll-related issues.”He suggests a three-pronged strategy — a strict and proactive judiciary, a vigilant EC and an informed voter. “I don’t have much hope from the voters because they do fall prey to caste, creed, religion, and freebies. The electorate also does not understand the gravity of electing representatives with criminal background. The only solution left is voter education for ethical and informative voting.”The EC and judiciary, he says, have been acting lenient for reasons best known to them. “Both should take stern measures. The present penalty by the SC on defectors (post-election) is quite low — between Rs1 lakh and Rs5 lakh. It should be increased to a few crores to at least cover the cost of conducting elections.”The EC, says Maj Gen Verma, may not have much power such as de-registering parties which encourage hoppers, or freezing their symbol, but Article 324 does give it some freedom to resolve issues plaguing the electoral system, “which the EC has not been using pro-actively”. The anti-defection law, too, needs to be amended, he says, “but lawmakers are these politicians only and they are, obviously, not keen on doing it”.“Switching parties has always been a part of both pre and post-poll scenario. However, this time, most parties seem to have become dharamshalas with no doors,” says Dr Pramod Kumar of the Institute for Development and Communication (IDC), Chandigarh.Balwinder Singh Laddi, Congress MLA from Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur district, seems to prove this point. Miffed at not getting the party ticket, he, along with sitting Congress MLA Fateh Singh Bajwa and former minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi walked across the saffron line. Laddi was back in his parent party in less than a week, calling it an “emotional decision to go to the BJP”. However, even his apologies to the Congress have not earned him a ticket.A veteran politician of over 50 years, Bir Devinder Singh, who has himself switched parties, calls it the downside of the anti-defection law that penalises only individual legislators switching parties after the election. “Politics nowadays is completely devoid of values. There is no commitment to ideology by anyone anymore, neither by the individuals switching sides or by parties who welcome such turncoats into their parties,” says the former Punjab Vidhan Sabha Deputy Speaker.Dr Kumar feels blurred ideological boundaries have made this mobility easy as well as fast.Come one, come allDespite assertions by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal of not accepting ‘kachra’ from any party in Punjab, AAP has been on a major induction spree, ‘welcoming’ leaders from the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and rewarding them with tickets, even at the cost of causing resentment among its own committed cadre.However, of all the 117 names already announced, the party claims only 20 per cent of its nominees are ‘migrants’. Thirteen had joined AAP only a few days ago.Some of the major names from the Congress that have been given the ticket include Sukhjinder Singh Lalli (Majitha), Raman Bahl (Gurdaspur), Ranjit Singh Rana (Bholath), Raman Arora (Jalandhar Central), Jagroop Singh Gill (Bathinda Urban) and Joginder Singh Mann (Phagwara).Even many veterans with deep roots in SAD have given in to the allure of power. Traditional Panthic leader and former minister Surjit Singh Kohli, with over seven decades’ association with the Akali Dal, has switched allegiance to AAP, along with son Ajit Pal Singh Kohli, a former Patiala mayor and now the party’s nominee from there. Other prominent names include real estate baron Kulwant Singh, who has been given a ticket from Mohali, and former SAD minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan’s son Jagrup Singh Sekhwan, who is contesting from Qadian (Gurdaspur).In this season of defections, AAP has seen some losses as well — the most curious case being that of Ashu Banger, the party’s nominee from Ferozepur Rural. This is perhaps the first time that a candidate has switched sides even after getting the ticket, the denial of which is otherwise the usual factor for deserting any party. While AAP leader Harpal Cheema alleges coercion on part of the Congress, Banger denies the charge, saying he will soon reveal the reality.Prof Jagroop Singh Sekhon, former professor of political science at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, calls it an era of ideology-less politics. “Power remains the sole aim and getting the ticket the only end with all kinds of means justified to get it.”The only agenda most political parties have is to win the elections at any cost, adds Dr Kumar.From 23 to 65When the BJP and SAD parted ways in Punjab and with the backlash generated by the farmers’ protest, the BJP, the buzz was, would find it difficult to even field 117 candidates. Today, with new partners in Capt Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s SAD (Sanyukt), the BJP has forced the Congress to delay releasing the second list, lest the sulking leaders who are denied the ticket switch over to the saffron party.A defender in other four poll-bound states, this is the first time the BJP is contesting on its own in Punjab, at around 65 seats from a mere 23 earlier. In an effort to play down its Hindutva image and gain a foothold in the state, it is accommodating prominent Sikh leaders from the Congress and SAD.Apart from Congress’ Bajwa, Sodhi, Dhaliwal, Harjot Kamal, Akali leaders Jagdeep Singh Nakai, Gurtej Singh Ghuriana, Sarabjit Singh Makkar and Manjinder Singh Sirsa have joined the BJP. The party has also managed to rope in Akali stalwart Gurcharan Singh Tohra’s grandson Kanwarveer Singh (Amloh). In its first list released on Friday, out of 35 candidates, 13 are Sikhs.The party is serving an inclusive platter of nominees, including Brahmins, Khatris, Baniyas, SCs and farmers. Notable inclusions in the first list are recent entrants from the Congress — Nimisha Mehta (Garshankar), a close associate of CM Channi, and Arvind Khanna (Sangrur), a relative of former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.Most significantly, one-third of these 35 nominees are recent entrants from the SAD and the BJP.But as candidates change parties at their convenience, how do they justify it to those whom they represent — their voters?Prof Sekhon says the traditional voter is not going anywhere and will vote according to caste. Populism should take care of others, adds Dr Kumar. “This is evident from freebies offered in manifestoes, rather ‘menufestoes’. With at least five parties in the ring, competitive bribing is the new norm,” he rues.“The protest movement against farm laws had brought in some accountability, with leaders strongly telling farmers not to vote for a particular party. Their becoming stakeholders now will only add to the problem,” feels Prof Sekhon.From promises of money, free atta-dal to jobs, the parties are offering need-based sops. Surinder Rai (33), an unemployed professional from Ferozepur, remains hopeful of AAP’s promises of employment, not affected by the Banger episode.For Sirhind-based Anmol Bali, the sitting Congress MLA from Fatehgarh Sahib Kuljit Nagra’s past performance is the deciding voting factor. Banger, too, is certain of his win despite the last-minute switch. “I have worked hard in my constituency, sometimes even 18 hours at a stretch. My voters and supporters know this.”With elections in the state being deferred by a week, February 1 is now the last date to file nominations. The season of defections has just got extended.Reverse migration in UPThe BJP may have emerged as a major poacher in Punjab, but in Uttar Pradesh, it is the Yogi Adityanath government that has been facing the heat.Three ministers — Swami Prasad Maurya, Dara Singh Chauhan and Dharam Singh Saini — and MLAs Bhagwati Sagar, Roshan Lal Verma, Brijesh Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Mukesh Verma and Bala Awasthi have gone to the Samajwadi Party (SP), which has emerged as the saffron party’s main Opposition.Another BJP MLA, Avatar Singh Bhadana, has joined the RLD. Two Apna Dal MLAs have also quit.“Maurya claimed he and other OBC leaders were feeling alienated in the Thakur-dominated administration. Akhilesh Yadav is actively courting such leaders as he wants to remove the Yadav tag from his party and consolidate the non-Yadav OBC vote, which these leaders should bring,” says a Lucknow-based veteran journalist.“Mulayam’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav and two more relatives, Hari Om Yadav and Pramod Gupta, joining the BJP is a mere face-saving for the party, as they hardly bring anything to the table,” he adds.The saffron party was also able to induct Priyanka Maurya, Congress’ poster girl of “Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon” campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/features/poll-season-and-party-hopping-why-self-gain-is-the-ideology-of-choice-363714

Barring a few workers, not many will support him. His disconnect with workers is the prime reason. Madan Lal Jalalpur, Cong MLAJust a few weeks ahead of the elections, Capt Amarinder and his family members, who till recently were canvassing for the Congress have switched sides to the new outfit formed by the former CM — Punjab Lok Congress — avowedly “to serve the public”.District Congress president KK Malhotra, Mayor Sanjeev Sharma, PRTC chairman KK Sharma and around two dozen councillors have quit the Congress to ensure victory for the Captain faction, which will field candidates in an understanding with the BJP.The royal family has been nurturing the Congress in Patiala for the past over two decades, winning seven seats out of the total eight falling in the district in 2017. Senior party leaders say even if no one wants to openly accept the fact that Capt Amarinder was the main reason for the Congress’ victories on these seats, his “exodus with supporters will surely harm the party prospects”.“A leader of Captain’s stature along with his MP wife Preneet Kaur has the acumen to not only give a tough fight, but also win seats for their candidates,” says a senior Congress leader. “With a few weeks to go before the voting happens, the Congress is yet to find a big name to replace him in the Patiala urban seat,” he adds.With a five-way contest among the Congress, SAD-BSP, BJP-PLC-SAD (Sanyukt), Sanyukt Samaj Morcha and Aam Aadmi Party on the cards, the choices are many and victory margins are likely to shrink.Last week, a few councillors revolted against Cabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra from Patiala and Patiala rural. Narinder Lalli, who was recently made the party’s Patiala urban president, said the Congress’ local leaders had passed a resolution on the matter. “We will write to the Congress high command that they should give ticket to anyone, but Mohindra.”Already the Patiala Municipal Corporation is a divided house after a faction led by Mayor Sanjeev Kumar Sharma quit the Congress to join the Captain’s new outfit.Claiming that the Captain faction will not make much impact in Patiala, senior Congress leader Madan Lal Jalalpur, a sitting Ghanaur MLA, says barring a few workers, not many will support Captain.“Captain’s disconnect with workers is the prime reason. Usually in all constituencies, workers got their works done through the local MLA,” he says, adding the institution is always bigger than an individual and “Capt Amarinder will realise this in the upcoming polls”.Key leaders jump shipDistrict Congress chief KK Malhotra, Mayor Sanjeev Sharma, PRTC chairman KK Sharma and two dozen councillors have quit the party and joined Captain faction                                     #CaptAmarinderSingh                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-divided-house-in-patiala-post-capt-amarinder-singh-exit-363598

Keeping in view the facts, it is necessary to unearth the entire racket.”The assertion came as Justice Kshetarpal refused to grant concession of the pre-arrest bail to an accused in a cheating case. The accused had moved the High Court against the State of Punjab and other respondents for the grant of pre-arrest bail in a criminal case arising from an FIR registered on September 10, 2021, for cheating and criminal breach of trust under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code and the provisions of the Punjab Travel Professionals (Regulation) Act, 2014, at Rama Mandi police station in Jalandhar district.The prosecution’s case was that the first informant or the complainant was duped of Rs 16 lakh on the false assurance of the accused, who promised to help him shift to Canada. The petitioner, on the other hand, claimed that he had received the amount on behalf of his friend. The amount was later transferred as per his direction.Appearing before the Bench, the counsel representing the petitioner contended that he, in a bona fide manner, received the amount without knowing the purpose for which the payment was being made. As such, he was required to be granted the concession of pre-arrest bail.After hearing rival contentions and going through the documents, Justice Kshetarpal asserted the allegations of the prosecution were serious in nature. The petitioner did not dispute receiving the amount and gave his own self-attested copy of the Aadhaar card. “No ground to grant the concession of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner is made out. Consequently, the present petition is dismissed,” Justice Kshetarpal concluded.Accused denied bail in cheating caseThe assertion came as Justice Kshetarpal refused to grant concession of the pre-arrest bail to an accused in a cheating case. The accused had moved the High Court against the State of Punjab and other respondents for the grant of pre-arrest bail in a cheating case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/necessary-to-unearth-entire-racket-of-fake-travel-agents-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-363594

Former DSGMC chief Manjit Singh GK, Paramjit Singh Sarna and Harvinder Singh Sarna objected to it. They demanded the vote be declared invalid, but the same was not accepted by pro-term chairman Gurdev Singh.Attempts to hold a poll by raising hands was not accepted as the Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971, has the provision for only secret ballot.The deadlock continued for more than 10 hours. Later in the evening, the Delhi Police reached the venue and this led to protests by the Sikh community on the social media. Manjit GK alleged the Delhi Police evicted 21 members, including him, the Sarnas and others. The remaining members cast their votes.While 28 votes went in favour of Kalka, the vote of Jasbir Singh Jassi was ‘reserved’ in a sealed cover as he had not proved his proficiency in Punjabi language. The Act mandates an elected member of the DSGMC to be proficient in Gurmukhi. The Directorate of Gurdwara Elections conducts a written exam to check the ability of an elected member to write and read Gurmukhi.Harinder Pal Singh, a former member of the DSGMC executive council, questioned the move to conduct such an exam after the elections to the House.The victory of the Kalka-led group has come after an internal strife. The Akali Dal has 30 members in the House, having 51 voting members. The House has 55 members in all. Four don’t cast votes as they are nominated.Row over showing of ballot after vote                                     #DSGMC                                     #HarmeetSinghKalka                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/harmeet-singh-kalka-elected-new-dsgmc-chief-amid-uproarious-scenes-363593

23-01-2022||---||Punjab CM patronising illegal mining: SAD||Chandigarh, January 22Accusing Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi of sheltering illegal sand miners, the SAD today released audio recordings between some alleged sand miners to substantiate the claim.SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, at a press conference, claimed Darshan Singh, a farmer and an activist against illegal sand mining, recorded his conversations with Iqbal Singh, a former sarpanch of Salahpur village, where large-scale illegal mining had taken place. Darshan also recorded separate conversations with ex-sarpanch’s son Ravinder Singh on the subject.Majithia claimed the conversations suggested how the CM was allegedly patronising miners, adding only an impartial probe could reveal the extent to which Channi and his family had “looted” the state exchequer.He claimed the recordings proved a close nexus between the CM and his nephew Bhupinder Singh Honey, from whom the ED recovered Rs 10 crore in cash and gold recently, and that they were partners in the illegal sand mining business.Majithia, while showing Honey’s proximity to Channi through photographs, claimed the CM’s nephew was using a vehicle bearing an MLA sticker.‘Aide’ faces 3 casesRopar: CM Channi’s ‘aide’ Iqbal Singh had been booked thrice for illegal mining. He was first booked by Singh Bhagwantpur police in 2012 but was acquitted in 2016. The second case was registered in 2013 at the Chamkaur Sahib police station, but was acquitted in 2017. The third FIR was lodged in 2020, but cops couldn’t finish probe.

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Sand mining row: Charges slanderous, says Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi||Terming the allegations levelled by SAD leader Bikram Majithia against him as “baseless and frivolous”, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi today dared the Akali leader to present even a single proof that indicates his involvement in sand mining across Punjab.All at BJP’s behestThe BJP is using central agencies to take revenge from me after PM Modi’s fiasco. The Opposition is playing politics over issue. Charanjit S Channi, CM“I have never denied my relationship with my nephew Bhupinder Singh Honey and being a relative, he might be present at some of my functions. It is not a crime to get clicked with relatives at my son’s marriage or some other functions,” said CM, while denying his links in the Honey’s money laundering case being investigated by the ED.Lashing out at Majithia for the “slanderous and misleading” campaign against him, CM Channi said Majithia was dancing to the tunes of the BJP government, and was trying to take revenge for booking him in an NDPS case, claiming former CM Capt Amarinder Singh, in cahoots with SAD-BJP, had covered up his misdeeds.CM Channi said: “Let me remind Majithia he was investigated by the ED for his relations with drug peddlers and a drug kingpin named him for sheltering and facilitating smuggling of drugs. Majithia’s photos were with them. Does it mean he knew them and sheltered them?”He asked Majthia, former CM Parkash Singh Badal and SAD chief Sukhbir Badal to clear their stand on their relationship with drug peddlers including Anwar Masih, Bittu Aulakh, Jagdish Bhola, with whom they usually shared political stages. Reacting to the audio recordings of Iqbal Singh and his son Binder taking his name, Channi claimed if a person was using his name for personal gains, it didn’t mean he was associated with them. —                                     #BikramMajithia                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #IllegalMining                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/charges-slanderous-says-charanjit-singh-channi-363586

The farmers’ political outfit released its fresh list of 34 candidates today, taking the total to 68 so far.Sidhana had remained at loggerheads with farmer leaders during their year-long agitation. Questions had then been raised as how he had tried to sabotage the movement in connivance with actor Deep Sidhu. In fact, Sidhana was banned from speaking from the SKM stage.Among those fielded by the SSM are Bhola Singh Brar (Bagha Purana), Harprit Pal Singh Virk (Sultanpur Lodhi), Kulwant Singh Joshan (Kapurthala), Baljinder Singh (Fatehgarh Churian), Yudhveer Singh (Bhoa), Kulwant Singh (Dinanagar), Rajeev Kumar Lovely (Gill), Ram Lal Sandhu (Dasuya), Purshottam Heer (Adampur), Kulbir Singh Matta (Kotakpura), Ravinderpal Kaur (Faridkot), Daljit Singh Bains (Balachaur), Resham Singh (Attari), Surjit Singh (Khemkaran), Zulafkar Ali (Malerkotla), Darshan Singh Babbi (Amloh), Amandeep Kaur Dholewal (Bassi Pathana), Des Raj Jassal (Jalandhar North) and Jaswinder Singh Sangha (Jalandhar Cantt), Gurnam Singh Daud (Jandiala), Kamalit Singh (Sri Hargobindpur), Satvir Singh (Amargarh). —                                     #LakhaSidhana                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ticket-to-controversial-lakha-sidhana-363584

We will fight the poll on our symbol.” CPI (ML) leaders too have reservations over the issue.Earlier, the SSM had trouble with ally Sanyukt Sangharsh Party led by Gurnam Singh Charuni, which had demanded 25 seats. The SSM had offered nine. Charuni later settled for 10 seats.Also, the Aam Aadmi Party alleged the SSM was being supported by the BJP. Its state affairs incharge Raghav Chadha recently said the BJP was facilitating the SSM in a bid to thwart AAP progress. Pannu said, “We forced the BJP to withdraw the farm laws after a year-long struggle. There is no question of any tie-up with it. Misleading information is being spread to malign us.”In another development, ex-servicemen have expressed resentment over not been given representation in the group.Brig Inder Mohan Singh, vice president, Indian Ex-Services League, said, “We had talks with Rajewal and Charuni, but we were not given due representation.

We are a family and will sort out all issues,” he stressed.He was replying to queries on Congress’ Kapurthala candidate Rana Gurjeet Singh openly opposing the party candidate in Sultanpur Lodhi, Navtej Cheema.

Releasing a five-page document on his ‘Punjab Model’ to empower the youth, he said college girls would be provided electric scooters manufactured in Ludhiana — one of the industrial clusters to be developed across the state.

This was objected too by the Sarna brothers – Paramjit and Harvinder – along with former DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK.They sought that the vote be declared ‘invalid’. However, the same was not accepted by the pro-term chairman Gurdev Singh.Attempts by the group led by Harmeet Singh Kalka to hold a poll by raising hands were not accepted as the Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act 1971 has a provision only for a ‘secret ballot’.The other controversy was over the vote of Jasbir Singh Jassi. He has, so far, not proved his proficiency in Punjabi language. His vote was kept in a sealed cover and a decision will be made by a court. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Act mandates an elected member of the DSGMC must be proficient in Gurmukhi.After the DSGMC House is elected by the Sikh community, the Directorate of Gurdwara Elections conducts a written exam to check the ability of an elected member to write and read Gurmukhi.Harinder Pal Singh, a former member of the DSGMC executive council, questioned the move to conduct such an exam after the elections to the House. “This exam should be conducted when nominations are filed by candidates. What is the use of such an exercise after elections,” he suggested.Meanwhile, last night the Shiromani Akali Dal seemed to overcome its internal strife to put up a united front in the DSGMC polls.The Akali Dal has 30 members in the House that has 51 voting members. The House has 55 members; the four don’t caste votes as they are nominated.The Sarna brother and Manjit GK group has 21 members.The Akali Dal was facing a kind of split with some members, loyalists of former DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, wanted to form a splinter group. Last month, Sirsa quit the Akali Dal and opted out as of president of the DSGMC to join the BJP. Some of those threatening to form a splinter group could be accommodated on key positions.                                     #DSGMCPoll                                     #ManjinderSirsa                                     #RakabGanjGurdwara                                     #Sikh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/controversy-ugly-scenes-mar-dsgmc-elections-363554

23-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress leaders want Charanjit Channi to be CM face; top brass says they'll fight polls under collective leadership||There is a growing clamour within the Punjab Congress over the need to declare a chief ministerial candidate for next month's assembly polls, with many senior leaders throwing their weight behind Charanjit Singh Channi, the state's first chief minister from the Scheduled Caste community.Though the Congress high command has so far maintained that the party will fight the February 20 elections to the 117-member assembly under a "collective leadership", many leaders in its state unit are seeking that the air surrounding the issue be cleared at the earliest.The party had declared its chief ministerial candidate ahead of the elections in 2012 and 2017, senior leader and minister Brahm Mohindra said, adding that Channi had proved himself in the role in just three months."There should not be any confusion in the party about announcing the CM candidate when there is already one who has proved himself beyond everybody's expectations," he said.Channi became chief minister last year after Amarinder Singh was made to resign from the post by the Congress. The clamour on the issue grows in the Congress's state unit in the backdrop of the Aam Aadmi Party, which is emerging as a strong contender for the polls, declaring its MP and state unit chief Bhagwant Mann as its chief ministerial candidate.     The Shiromani Akali Dal, which has been the Congress's main rival, may not have formally named its candidate for the chief minister's post, but its president Sukhbir Singh Badal is the likely choice.The need to declare a chief ministerial candidate becomes more important for the Congress as the AAP had named Bhagwant Mann as its candidate, while the SAD are projecting Sukhbir Badal for the post, Mohindra said.Mohindra's cabinet colleague Rana Gurjeet Singh has also thrown his weight behind Channi, saying raising a question mark about his continuation as chief minister, after the party came back to power, could prove suicidal."Channi has done an exceedingly outstanding job in just three months," Rana Gurjeet Singh said.Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Shahkot MLA Hardev Singh Laddi Sherowalia are also backing the idea of having Channi as chief minister if the party succeeded in the polls.However, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, who was in Chandigarh this week, while replying to a question on the issue, said, “Sidhu ji Punjab Congress ke sardar hain (Navjot Singh Sidhu is Punjab Congress chief), Channi ji government ke sardar hain (Channi is chief minister), and we will contest elections under collective leadership.”A survey ‘Who should be the CM face of the Congress in Punjab?' on Twitter by Nikhil Alva, an aide of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, shows that Channi is the choice with maximum 68.7 per cent of the total 1,283 voters in the survey responding in his favour.While this may not be a party survey, but it also showed that 11.5 per cent voters batted for Sidhu followed by 9.3 per cent in favour of Sunil Jakhar while 10.4 per cent said there was no need for a chief ministerial candidate.The Congress on January 17 shared a short video, showing actor Sonu Sood, whose sister is contesting on a party ticket from Moga, saying "the real CM" will be the one who deserves to be at the post and not that person who declares himself to be the chief ministerial candidate.The 36-second video on Twitter, which was retweeted by the Punjab Congress, ends with visuals of Charanjit Singh Channi at different programmes and events.Even Channi, who is from the Scheduled Caste community, which enjoys a sizeable presence in the state, had recently said that the Congress should declare its chief ministerial candidate and pointed out that it had been seen in the past that doing so had allowed the party reap electoral gains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/many-in-punjab-congress-want-charanjit-channi-to-be-cm-face-top-brass-says-theyll-fight-polls-under-collective-leadership-363481
