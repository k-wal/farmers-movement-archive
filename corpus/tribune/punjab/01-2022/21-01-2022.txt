21-01-2022||Mukesh RanjanNew Delhi||CISF asks aviation authorities to implement ‘one hand bag’ rule meticulously||Domestic flyers will no longer be allowed to carry more than one hand baggage in the aircraft. The move is aimed to ease out congestion and security concerns and reduce the burden at screening points at airports.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked the aviation authorities to implement the ‘One Hand Bag’ order meticulously.As per the Bureau of Aviation Security (BCAS) Circular, no passenger should be permitted to carry more than one handbag barring a few exceptions, including women’s purses and laptop bags.The CISF guards all key airports in India. Officials explained that passengers, carrying more than one handbag, were leading to increased clearance time as well as delays, congestion in security checkpoints and inconvenience to other travellers.“However, it has been seen that passengers on an average carry 02-03 Nos of hand bags to the screening point. This has led to increased clearance time as well as delays, congestion in pre-embarkation security check (PESC) point and inconvenience to passengers. It is therefore felt that enforcement of the aforesaid Circulars must be ensured by all stakeholders/airlines,” read the circular.The airport security force has directed all airlines to inform the passengers about the one hand bag rule by putting this information on boarding passes/tickets of travellers. “All airlines may be directed suitably to inform passengers and to display ‘one hand bag rule’ on their tickets/boarding passes very conspicuously,” it said.It has also instructed airport operators to place hoardings in order to inform the passengers about the one hand bag rule. “Airport operators may be instructed to place hoarding/banner/board/ standees displaying the contents of the ‘One hand bag Rule’ near the check-in counters, vantage locations before SHA (security hold areas) at the airports, so that passengers get sensitised and if required, have an option to switch their extra hand bags to registered baggage,” the circular said.It has also instructed airport operators to place hoardings in order to inform the passengers about the one hand bag rule.“Airport operators may be instructed to place hoarding/banner/board/ standees displaying the contents of the ‘One hand bag Rule’ near the check-in counters, vantage locations before SHA (security hold areas) at the airports, so that passengers get sensitised and if required, have an option to switch their extra hand bags to registered baggage,” the circular further said.                                     #aiport                                     #aviationrules                                     #flights                                     #handbaggage                                     #limit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cisf-asks-aviation-authorities-to-implement-one-hand-bag-rule-meticulously-363268
21-01-2022||Saurabh MalikChandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC sets aside regularisation of 98 assistant district attorneys||More than eight years after the services of 98 Assistant District Attorneys appointed on a contract basis were regularised, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday set aside an order appointing them against public posts by “a mode not envisaged by the Rules framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution”.Justice Sudhir Mittal at the same time made it clear that the state may continue with them as contract employees, subject to initiation of direct appointment process within six months. The respondents-ADAs would also be eligible to apply for the posts. “Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case, it is directed that stipulation of upper age limit shall be relaxed for them,” Justice Mittal added that while fixing a year’s deadline for the completion of the process.The matter was placed before Justice Mittal after a bunch of petitions were filed against the State of Punjab and other respondents by Gurinder Singh and other petitioners through counsel Kapil Kakkar, Shivam Malik, Anurag Goyal, Parth Goyal and Amarjit Kaur. They were seeking the quashing of orders dated October 8, 2013, regularising the services of the respondents.The Bench was told that the Government of Punjab issued an advertisement dated October 17, 2009, inviting applications for 98 posts of ADA on contract basis. While the process of selection was underway, order dated October 8, 2013, was passed regularising the services of the respondents.Justice Mittal observed policy dated March 18, 2011, was framed for employees of seven different departments. It was extended only for the ADAs belonging to the Prosecution & Litigation Department —a part of the Department of Home Affairs & Justice. It included the jails department and Advocate-General’s office.Justice Mittal asserted: “The policy was framed for the benefit of employees of the said departments as well, but the ADAs were singled out for preferential treatment. Nothing has been brought on record to show that there was a necessity to extend the policy for granting permanent employment,”Justice Mittal added the direct appointment process had already been initiated and the posts occupied by the contractual employees could also have been filled up through direct recruitment, maybe in a staggered fashion to ensure that the subordinate Courts’ working was not adversely affected. “The preferential treatment, thus, given to the private respondents and that too on the basis of their own request, is patently arbitrary,” Justice Mittal added.                                     #appointment                                     #assistantdistrictattorneys                                     #PunjabandHaryanaHC                                     #PunjabHC                                     #regularisation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-hc-sets-aside-regularisation-of-98-assistant-district-attorneys-363266
21-01-2022||Chandigarh||PM’s security breach stage-managed by Channi govt: Amarinder||Punjab Lok Congress leader Amarinder Singh on Friday launched a scathing attack against Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, alleging that the road blockade that led to the PM’s security breach was “stage-managed” and kickbacks were received in the transfer and posting of officers.The incumbent government has been exposed as a “suitcase di sarkar” after the recent ED raids that unearthed crores of rupees from the chief minister’s kin, he said in a statement.Amarinder Singh also claimed that Channi had once “fallen on his feet”, imploring to get rid of a harassment complaint by a woman officer.The prime minister’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur earlier this month, after which he returned from the poll-bound state without attending the rally there.The former Punjab CM alleged that the Channi government had “instructed police not to remove farmers who were stopping BJP buses” from reaching the Ferozepur rally venue.Amarinder Singh said he had earlier passed the flyover near Ferozepur and there was no blockade there.The PM’s security breach was “clearly stage-managed” by the Channi government, the leader said in a statement.Describing the incident a major security lapse, the former CM said instead of taking a defiant stand, Channi should have issued an unequivocal apology.“We are sensitive border state and Pakistan’s ISI is always looking to create trouble here,” he said, asserting that one cannot ever take any chances.Amarinder Singh regretted having helped “Channi resolve the #metoo complaint against him”, saying the then minister had “fallen on his feet and pledged loyalty to him for life”.“Now, he has changed colours and claiming he had been trying to get rid of me for the past two years!” he said.Dubbing Channi as an “unreliable and untrustworthy person”, Amarinder Singh alleged that Channi made transfers and postings an industry in Punjab in the past three months.“Three DGPs have been changed, his home minister has been openly accused in a cabinet meeting by his colleague that money was being taken for posting of SSP, there was a tug of war on the AG’s post…This is not ‘lokaan di sarkar’ (people’s government) but ‘transfer posting di sarkar’, which has now also become ‘suitcase di sarkar’,” he added.The former CM said the Enforcement Directorate seizure from a Channi’s kin was a follow-up on the case that the agency had registered after he (as CM) had ordered an inquiry while he was heading the government.Unfortunately, he said he had been unable to take any serious action against the Congress MLAs “who were involved in illegal mining in the state as that would have damaged the party’s interests and Sonia Gandhi had failed to respond to his query on which minister or MLA she wanted him to sack over the issue”.Labelling Channi a total failure, Amarinder Singh said the new chief minister had done nothing except indulge in postings and transfers since taking over.“Even the announcements made by Channi are nothing but projects that were launched or announced by me,” he said, citing farm loan waiver, jobs under the Ghar-Ghar Rozgar scheme and free bus travel for women.“Even free power which he claims to be his initiative was something my government was working on finding ways and means to implement,” he added.Amarinder Singh alleged that Manpreet Badal as finance minister had scuttled many of his schemes and plans by claiming to have no funds, which it appears now was a total lie.On why no sitting Congress MLA was joining his party, Amarinder Singh said they are only waiting for their party to announce tickets, “which is being deliberately delayed as the Congress is scared of defections”. —                                     #CaptAmarinder                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #Punjabpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pms-security-breach-stage-managed-by-channi-govt-amarinder-363264
21-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab police seizes grenade launcher, 3.79 kg RDX, thwarts possible terror attack around R-Day||The Punjab Police Friday recovered a grenade launcher with two compatible grenades, 3.79 kg RDX, nine detonators, and two sets of timer devices from Gurdaspur, thwarting a possible terror attack around the Republic Day, a senior official said.Border Range Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohinish Chawla said the 40-mm Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) that was recovered during the day could cover up to 150 meters and could be detrimental to the VVIP security, according to an official statement.The recovery was made on the disclosure of Malkeet Singh, a resident of village Gazikot in Gurdaspur who was arrested Thursday by the Gurdaspur Police based on a tip-off in a terror module and conspiracy case, he said.“Thwarting a possible terrorist attack around the Republic Day, the Punjab Police have recovered 40mm Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) with two 40 mm compatible grenades, 3.79 Kg RDX, nine electrical detonators and two sets of timer devices for IEDs from Gurdaspur,” Chawla was quoted as saying in a statement.The consignment of explosives was sent from across the border by Pakistan-based International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) chief Lakhbir Singh Rode, he added.During November-December 2021, the Gurdaspur Police had busted two terrorist modules controlled by the ISI of Pakistan and arrested four members of the modules, besides recovering around 1 kg RDX, six hand grenades, one tiffin box IED, three electrical detonators and two pistols.SSP Gurdaspur Nanak Singh said the role of Malkeet Singh in retrieval and delivery of fire arms/explosive consignments intended for ISYF terror module, busted recently by the SBS Nagar Police, was revealed during investigation.                                     #grenade                                     #PunjabPolice                                     #rday                                     #RDX                                     #Republicday                                     #terrorattacks||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-seizes-grenade-launcher-3-79-kg-rdx-thwarts-possible-terror-attack-around-r-day-363262
21-01-2022||New Delhi||Punjab assembly polls: BJP announces 34 candidates in first list||The BJP on Friday released the first list of 34 candidates for the upcoming election to the 117-member Punjab assembly, slamming both Congress’ Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and AAP’s chief ministerial candidate Bhagwant Mann while predicting a “surprising verdict” favouring the coalition led by it in the state.  Punjab BJP in-charge Dushyant Gautam, who hit out at the Congress Government on its “failure to resolve issues related to corruption, misgovernance, sacrilege, illegal sand mining and drug addiction,” also took a direct dig at CM Channi, referring to the recent ED raids, including on those linked to him. “All the problems remain, which shows that no progress was made in the past five years. Congress’ present CM (Charanjit Singh Channi) is himself deep in corruption…in his own constituency illegal sand mining is happening. It also needs to be investigated how he managed to amass such wealth in just two-three months,” Gautam said.He also hit out at the state government over the “breach of the Prime Minister’s security”. And while highlighting the steps taken by the Narendra Modi-led Centre for Punjab, Gautam predicted “surprising results”, favouring the coalition. The people have made up their mind, we are sure that the coalition will do very well in the elections,” he said.Union minister Hardeep Puri, who too slammed Channi for “illegal sand mining in his constituency”, also urged for “deep reflection” on CM candidates of both Congress and APP given the sensitive nature of the border state and its contribution to the nation.Without naming Mann, Puri said he was neither against social drinking nor was he taking a moral position. “Doing ‘nasha is a personal choice…but there are videos, facts speak for themselves…I am not taking moral position on drinking (alcohol)…If you like social drinking, you can…but in a sensitive state like Punjab can you make a man with such an image your face,” he questioned.Interestingly, he also referred to BJP’s earlier coalition with the Akali Dal as “bad marriage”, adding “I am glad they left on their own”. In coalition with Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), the BJP is contesting around 65 seats. Leaders said the rest of the names will be announced soon.Announcing the first list general secretary Tarun Chugh said the party has given representation to all sections of society, including 12 persons from farmer’ families, eight from scheduled castes, and 13 candidates are Sikhs. “The list has doctors, lawyers, sportspersons, farmers, youth, women, and former IAS,” Chugh said. Among those fielded by the BJP are Manoranjan Kalia (Jalandhar central) Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi (Ferozepur city) Kanwarveer Singh Tohra (grandson of Gurcharan Singh Tohra) from Amloh, Surjit Kumar Jiyani from Fazilka and Tikshan Sood from Hoshiarpur. The list includes women candidates Renu Kashyup and Nimisha Mehta, Kabbadi player Ranjit Singh Khojewala and retired IAS officer SR Laddhar. It is not yet clear who will contest from Chamkaur Sahib and Amritsar east from where Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu will fight or Dhuri from where Mann will contest.      Here's a list of their candidates: Kapurthala: Ranjit Singh Khojewal, a kabaddi playerJalandhar West Mahendra Pal BhagatJalandhar Central Manoranjan KaliaJalandhar North Krishandev BhandariMukeria : Jangi Lal MahajanDasuya: Raghunath Rana,Hoshiarpur: Tikshan SoodChabewal (SC): Dr Dilbagh RaiGarshankar: Namisha MehtaBanga: Mohan LalBalachaur: Ashok BaathFatehgarh Sahib: Deedar Singh BhattiAmloh: Kanwar Vir Singh Tohra from the family of Gurcharan Singh TohraKhanna: Gurpreet Singh BhattiLudhiana central: Gurdev SharmaLudhiana west: Advocate Vikram Singh SidhuGill: SR Laddar, retd IASJagraon : Kanwar Narinder SinghFerozepur City: Sitting MLA Rana Gurmit Singh SodhiJalalabad: Puran ChandFazilka: Surjit JyaniAbohar: Arun NarangMukhtsar: Rajesh BathelaFaridkot: Gaurav KakkarBhuchomandi : Rupinder Singh SidhuTalwandi Sabo: Ravi Preet Singh SidhuSardulgarh: Jagjit Singh MilkhaSangrur: Arvind KhannaDera Bassi: Sanjiv Khanna                                     #BJP                                     #Channi                                     #list                                     #PMsecuritybreach                                     #Punjabpolls                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #release||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-assembly-polls-bjp-announces-34-new-candidates-363247
21-01-2022||---||Charanjit Channi says he is planning to sue Arvind Kejriwal for 'defaming' him||Chamkaur Sahib, January 21Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday said he is preparing to sue AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal for defaming him with reference to the recent raids by the Enforcement Directorate in the state.Interacting with a select media gathering here, Channi said Kejriwal had crossed all limits of decency by posting his picture on social media showing him with currency notes which were not recovered from him.On January 18, around Rs 10 crore was recovered by the Enforcement Directorate during raids on multiple locations in Punjab, including those related to a relative of Channi, as part of money laundering probe against the ‘sand mafia’.Channi alleged that following the raids, Kejriwal had posted his picture on Facebook showing him sitting with currency notes. The AAP leader had thrown all decency to the winds so he had sought permission from his party to sue Kejriwal, he said.He alleged that it was not for the first time that the Delhi CM had resorted to this.Channi said the money was not recovered from him or his family. “Yes, it was a failure on my part that I could not keep an eye on my relatives’ deeds, still I am not responsible for any wrongdoing by people other than my family,” he said.Alleging that Kejriwal is in the habit of levelling false allegations against others during election campaigns, Channi said Kejriwal had already tendered an apology to Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley and Bikram Majithia.He claimed that AAP had installed hoardings worth Rs 200 crore in Punjab besides election campaign advertisements on television. Similar expenditure was being incurred by the party in the Goa and Uttarakhand elections, he said, questioning the source of these funds.He also targeted AAP for choosing Bhagwant Mann as its chief ministerial candidate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/charnajit-channi-says-he-is-preparing-to-sue-arvind-kejriwal-for-defaming-him-363230

21-01-2022||We’ve all seen Sikhs adorning turbans in different styles and forms. But it is a centuries-old tradition to cover the head in the subcontinent. Tribune Correspondent Charanjit Singh Teja and photojournalist Vishal Kumar traverse the history behind the tradition…||TURBANED GLORY||Commonly known as dastaar, pagg, pagri, keski and patki, wearing a turban is a centuries-old tradition to cover the head in the subcontinent as a mark of respect. Generally worn by males, Sikh women and Sadhvis, too, wear turban to cover their head. Traversing different phases of history, it has evolved in style with time. It varies among different regions, cultures, religions, sects, social status and even trades and castes. Though Muslims and Hindus of Punjab used to wear a turban and had different styles of adorning it, it has now been reduced to a few special occasions only. However, in modern era, majorly Sikhs wear the turban, as it is a part of their religious code. Sikhs, too, wear it in different styles, which reflects diversity...Traditional TurbansDuring Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s time, the Sikhs adopted a uniform style of turban under French General Ventura. He formed two battalions in the Maharaja’s army, where this uniform-style of tying turban was introduced. Even the terms — pages and fifty —came from European terminology. As military culture dominates Punjabi society, it became a fashion to wear modern turban styles.Anglo-Sikh turbans: These turbans were part of the uniform of Sikh soldiers, who fought world wars for the British. There is a huge influence of this style of turbans on Sikhs in the Indian Army. People call it Fauji Pagg.DumalaIt is a traditional style of turban which used to be worn by Sikh warriors. Nowadays, Nihang Sikhs, who wear a blue dress of Khalsa Panth, wear it. They use strong fabric and tie it so tightly that it doesn’t open during fights (now, martial arts) or while riding a horse. Elements such as iron chakaras, small swords, barshi (sharp-edged knives), nagni (snake-style), mor-pankh and chan tara are used to decorate the turban. Some Nihangs wear huge and heavy dumala, while some prefer it small and lightweight. The colour is mainly blue.

21-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Rana Gurjeet Singh campaigns for his 'Independent' son against Cong's official candidate||Jalandhar, January 20Two days after three MLAs and an ex-MLA demanded expulsion of minister Rana Gurjeet Singh from the Congress, he took on Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Cheema holding a rally in his native Bussewal village and addressing it in favour of his son Rana Inder Partap Singh.Rana’s son has announced to contest from Sultanpur Lodhi as Independent candidate against party candidate Cheema, over which the latter has been lodging complaint with the party against Rana for creating indiscipline. Rana did not just dare to hold a rally against Cheema but even challenged him in his hometown.“I will quit politics if my son loses the battle”, he announced. He even said that Cheema would have surely become jittery after seeing the strength and the response of the rally in his own village. Cheema, however, has alleged that Rana had brought in 40 cars from his own Kapurthala constituency and showed them as voters of Sultanpur Lodhi.The war of words that has ensued between the two has made the atmosphere in Sultanpur constituency very tense. Rana has been claiming that he is not committing any indiscipline. “I am just supporting my son. When he will win, we will add this seat in the Congress kitty,” he is telling at all rallies. Meanwhile, Cheema fumes: “When I have got the Congress ticket, how and why should the minister from the same party support an Independent candidate against me. This is gross indiscipline and I hope that the party high command will act soon.”Rana, on the other hand, has said: “If party president Sonia Gandhi will ask me to withdraw from supporting my son, I will follow her direction. For me, party is still supreme. I have only been supporting my son as the people of Sultanpur Lodhi have been feeling much suppressed under Cheema owing to the registration of false cases.”Cheema has termed Rana’s claims as false and been alleging that he is playing in the hands of the rival parties, including the SAD, BJP and the Punjab Lok Congress.                                     #RanaGurjeetSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/rana-campaigns-for-his-independent-son-against-congs-official-candidate-363145

He also went to Pholariwal and paid obeisance at a religious place there. Asked about his plan, Kaypee said: “I am waiting for the review of the seats. The Congress Central Election Committee meeting is due on January 22 and I am hopeful that the party will take a decision in my favour.”Kaypee is seeking a review of either Adampur or Jalandhar West seat, which have gone to Sukhwinder Kotli and sitting MLA Sushil Rinku, respectively.Kaypee, who has earlier served as PPCC president and Jalandhar MP, was also the minister in 2007-12 term of the Congress. He had contested from Adampur Assembly seat in 2017 but got defeated from Akali leader Pawan Tinu by nearly 8,000 votes. He had contested from Hoshiarpur Parliamentary seat in 2014 but lost to BJP’s Vijay Sampla by 13,582 votes.In 2012, his wife Suman Kaypee had contested from Jalandhar West Assembly seat but lost to BJP’s Bhagat Chunni Lal by nearly 12,000 votes. Kaypee had earlier won from Jalandhar South (named so before delimitation) three times in 1985, 1992 and 2002. He had lost in 2007 and 1997.His detractors have said that since Kaypee has faced a hat-trick of defeats, he had no right to claim a ticket. “He and his family have got ticket 10 times. It is time that they let others too put their hat in the ring,” said a senior party leader.                                     #MohinderKaypee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/kaypee-holds-meetings-in-cantt-area-says-will-wait-for-review-363153

But the District and Sessions Judge, in a report submitted before the HC, said the comments submitted by the officer did not contain any legally justifiable reason for passing the orderHolding that the order had raised “serious concerns”, Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri has directed forthwith placing of the matter before the administrative judge of Faridkot for information and “further necessary action”, if required.The matter was brought to the HC’s notice after an accused filed a petition under Section 439 of the CrPC for regular bail in a cheating case registered on January 29, 2021, under Sections 420 and 120-B of the IPC at Sadar police station in Kotkapura.Referring to the orders passed by the Faridkot Additional Sessions Judge, Justice Puri asserted it was pointed out to the HC that the petitioner was in custody since March 18 last year.

But the District and Sessions Judge, in the report’s concluding part, submitted before the HC, said the comments submitted by the officer did not contain any legally justifiable reason in passing the order.“A perusal of the order would show that the Additional Sessions Judge, Faridkot, has discussed the contentions of the parties considering the same to be anticipatory bail application… In the operative part again, it has been observed that it was not a fit case for grant of pre-arrest bail to the accused.

For the past few days, Sidhu has been silent on the issue of declaring the CM face.Despite the official line, the party circles are abuzz with a Twitter opinion poll on “Who should be the Congress’ CM candidate”, started by Nikhil Alva, an aide of Rahul Gandhi. In the opinion poll, four options — Channi, Sidhu, Jakhar and “no choice should be announced” — have been provided.

On the remaining 21 seats, there are two or three names.

The women were married in the city while their parental houses were 70-80 km away, across the Chakki river. Rani’s grouse was that their in-laws did not allow them to visit their parents as regularly as they wished.Game-changerThe bridge will prove to be a game-changer for the legislator if he polls a majority if not all of these votes. A Congress MLARs 35 crore projectIt took the Public Works Department two years and a sum of Rs 35 crore to establish the 380 metre four-laned high-level structureReason: The distance was too much and public transport was an apology. “We need a bridge over the Chakki,” they told Vij.The fact that the MLA himself was involved in the project’s planning and execution at least ensured that red-tapism did not rear its head. Its political significance in an election year was not lost on the government. Recently, Chief Minister Charanjit Channi brushed aside the officials’ decision to hold a virtual inauguration ceremony. He himself presided over the opening event.If Rani and others of her ilk had heaved a sigh of relief, farmers of this sugarcane rich belt too were smiling. Earlier, they had to take their produce 100 km away to the nearest sugar mill in Mukerian. Now, the distance has been reduced to 30 km.Moreover, an added advantage is that the bridge also connects to the Pathankot-Jalandhar national highway.Life has changed for the betterment of 10,000 strong populace sprinkled across 70 villages. Earlier, youth of the area were apprehensive of travelling such a long distance to find employment. Now, scores of youth can be seen everyday crossing the structure on their way to work in Pathankot.The project has the potential to turn into a match winner for MLA Vij. There are approximately 5,000 votes in the area. In a five pronged contest, with Congress, AAP, SSM, SAD-BSP and BJP-Punjab Lok Congress in fray, the victory margins will be narrow. If the Congress works hard to sustain the euphoria till D-Day, the bridge surely has the potential to swing votes to its side.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-talwara-jattan-bridge-to-prosperity-votes-363042

The panel asked district excise officials to take action against such shops which might accept coupons to give liquor.It has also asked the department to monitor the daily sale of liquor retail shops by comparing it with the figures of average daily sale of preceding months.Similarly, it urged close monitoring of liquor shops showing a significant increase in stock, shops located in slums or in proximity of slums and shops in interior rural pockets. The poll panel has also asked the law enforcement agencies to check records during the previous two elections and identify the “potential problematic areas”.The department has been directed to establish and operationalise round-the-clock check-posts with CCTVs at strategic locations in their jurisdiction.Apart from this, the commission has directed the department to focus on arrest of kingpins, stockists and distributors for effective deterrence. “In liquor cases, most of the FIRs are filed against foot soldiers. Efforts should be made to catch hold of the kingpins.”The use of banned narcotics has emerged another area of concern for the EC during the Punjab elections as drugs worth Rs 18.26 crore were seized during the last Assembly elections.                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/check-distribution-of-liquor-coupons-to-voters-says-ec-363030

If no steps are taken within five days, we will start gherao of AAP candidates and Kejriwal in the state. — Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, Social ActivistGiving an ultimatum to AAP supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal till January 26, Sikh organisations in Amritsar have given a call for boycott of party candidates in the upcoming Punjab Assembly polls if he failed to clarify his stance on releasing Bhullar. The issue has also reached the Akal Takht, demanding opposition of the AAP candidates in protest.In Bathinda, senior leaders of Sikh outfits, social activists led by author Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, have also sought Bhullar’s release. Dibdiba, while addressing mediapersons, alleged Bhullar had already served his life term, but the Delhi Government had been creating hurdles in his release. They would issue “warning letters” to all AAP candidates in the fray and ask Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to “clarify his stand” on the matter within five days, failing which they would target and gherao AAP candidates and Kejriwal in the state, he said.“We will issue warning letters to all 117 candidates fielded by the AAP and Delhi CM Kejriwal and ask them to clarify their stand on the matter as to why Bhullar is not being released despite having served his full term.

If it is really so, he needs to clarify his stand on the matter,” said Dibdiba.In Amritsar, Akal Federation’s Narain Singh Chaura, accompanied by Bhullar’s wife Navneet Kaur, warned that the Punjab Government in compliance with the Home Ministry’s guidelines had sent the file pertaining to premature release of Bhullar, but the Delhi Government-led by Kejriwal had been adopting dilly dally approach to clear it.He said Kejriwal had refused to endorse the file thrice in September 2019, February 2020 and August 2020 and that he must clarify his stance before the Punjab polls.“If the formalities pertaining to Bhullar’s release were not furnished till January 26, we will gherao AAP candidates contesting elections in Punjab under protest,” he said.Bhullar, who was convicted in the 1993 Delhi bomb blast case, is undergoing life imprisonment after the Supreme Court commuted his death sentence. He was sentenced to death by a designated TADA court on August 25, 2001. He was shifted to Amritsar Central Jail in June 2015 and is facing serious health issues. As the case pertains to Delhi, it is the prerogative of the Delhi Government, to sign his premature release order.                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #DavinderPalSinghBhullar                                     #HardeepSinghDibdiba                                     #Sikh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/clarify-stance-on-bhullar-kejri-told-363034

Residents here rue that they have been reaching out to the authorities concerned, but to no avail.Past trendThe constituency has been a SAD stronghold since 2007. Sitting MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu won the seat in 2012 and 2017, while Sarbjit Singh Makkar won it in 2007. The Congress last won from here in 2002, when Kanwaljit Singh Lally became the MLA.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1, 66,370Male -86,448Female - 79,919Third gender - 3Locals’ key demands“The never-ending construction of the flyover has become a pain. Ever since the project was initiated in December 2016, the life of people living in and around the site have been crippled. We are forced to commute on a dilapidated road from the main Adampur market. The chaos on the road has hit the local trade hard, but who cares?” says Harbans Kaur, a resident.Joginder Singh, another resident, says the bus stand has been lying dysfunctional ever since it was constructed in 2017. He adds the infrastructure is going to waste; the premises are being used by private taxi drivers, while the buses pick passengers from the roads. “We don’t understand why this bus stand was built, when the government has no plans to open it to the public. It’s a sheer waste of public funds. Why the incumbent MLA hasn’t taken up the matter and got it operational in all these years?” he says.“The inefficient garbage collection system has made it hard to move around the city, with the foul smell emanating from the piles of waste. The situation gets worse during rains, as garbage along with sewage and rainwater enters our houses”, says Rakesh Aggarwal, who runs a sweets shop in Adampur market.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/5-years-on-flyover-incomplete-363036

ED raids have brought to the fore his close links to sand mafia. — Ashwani sharma, State BJP PresidentAddressing mediapersons here, Verka claimed the BJP and PM Modi were trying to suppress people of the Dalit community by resorting to “cheap politics”. He was accompanied by senior congress leader Alka Lamba.Verka claimed the BJP’s ideology had always been “anti-Dalit” and therefore the Modi government was adopting such tactics to suppress and intimidate people of the community and Punjab.“It is sad to believe the Prime Minister who speaks in the interest of Dalits and Backward Classes has stooped so low,” said Verka, adding the BJP, Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal were hatching a conspiracy against the Dalit CM.Verka stressed the BJP wanted to grab the CM’s chair by any means and was attempting to disturb peace in the state to achieve that.Verka alleged Rs 3 crore, destined for its Lucknow office, were seized from a vehicle belonging to the BJP in Ghaziabad. Subsequently, Rs 177 crore were seized, but no case was registered.“When ED raids BJP leaders, no action is taken. Here, the Punjab CM is being deliberately targeted and humiliated,” he said.                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #RajKumarVerka||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-bid-to-suppress-scs-by-targeting-cm-verka-363037
21-01-2022||Ruchika M Khanna||Agriculture bailout not enough for Punjab farmers||Chandigarh, January 20Punjab had seen strides in agriculture reforms under the chief ministership of Capt Amarinder Singh between 2002 and 2007. It was then that the diversification to horticulture, promotion of food processing industry, getting agri-retail giants for contract farming, and famous “farm to fork” projects were conceived and some of them took off.Randeep Nabha, Agriculture MinisterStubble mgmt, waiver key successesThe government has ensured scientific management of stubble and reached out to farmers through loan waiver, besides giving jobs to kin of ‘martyred’ farmers.Prem Singh Bhango, Sanyukt Samaj MorchaGovt failure behind poll plungeHad successive governments done well, farmers wouldn’t have had to enter poll fray. We have decided to contest so that farmer-friendly policies are introduced.Having inherited near-empty coffers and lacking both will and vision to raise resources, the government failed to fulfil any of these promises. Debt waiver was extended to just a fraction of farming households and farm suicides continued unabated as agriculture debts mounted. It became a hot potato for the government, rather than a trophy they had hoped for.The state’s antiquated irrigation system remained ignored — almost no efforts were made to reline the canal systems, wherever little work was carried out (as in Fazilka late last year), it was of inferior quality.Aman Arora, Aam Aadmi partyNo steps towards diversificationThe government neither ensured complete debt waiver, nor gave Rs20,000 per acre relief to farmers in case of natural calamity. Nothing was done to diversify agriculture..Gurbakshish Singh, a farmer from Bimbar village, near Nabha, said the government failed to do anything to give a fillip to the sagging agrarian economy. “Ecologically sensitive and economically viable agriculture are the two main necessities to give a push to the agriculture sector in Punjab, but no policy intervention in this regard was made,” he rued, adding those farmers who cultivated oilseeds like mustard or other cash crops suffered financially as no income support was assured and these continued to sell below the MSP.What was promisedWhat has been DeliveredIt’s not that the present state government did nothing for the farmers. The Farm Loan Waiver Scheme did benefit 5.61 lakh farmers, whose one-time crop loans amounting to Rs 4,600 crore were waived. Luckily for the government, each food procurement season ended successfully, with no major glitches. Even during the lockdown period of April 2020, the Congress government ensured smooth procurement of wheat. In 2017-18, it successfully tackled the whitefly infestation on cotton crop in the southern Malwa region.The government more or less streamlined the process of giving compensation to families of farmers who died by suicide because of high farm indebtedness. Jobs were also given to the next of kin of those farmers who died during the year-long agitation.A “political” ace up the Congress governments’ sleeve would be the support it initially rendered to the farmers’ struggle against the three central farm laws.It was at Capt Amarinder’s insistence that an all-party meeting against the farm laws was called and the Punjab Vidhan Sabha rejected these outright. The state government also played an important role in the negotiations between the Centre and the state to resolve the struggle.However, the fact remains the Congress government failed to fulfil most of its pre-poll promises. In the last year of its rule, the government was also found lacking in ensuring timely supply of urea and DAP during both rabi and kharif seasons.LEADERSPEAKBJP, captain not even in the raceThe AAP has an edge over other parties with Bhagwant Mann as its CM face. Neither the Akalis nor the Congress has announced a CM candidate.

In 2009, Partap Bajwa was elected MP from the Gurdaspur parliamentary seat. In the 2012 Assembly polls, his wife Charanjit Kaur Bajwa was allotted the party ticket despite objections raised by Fateh Jung. Enraged, he left Qadian and drove straight to Sri Hargobindpur to back Congress candidate Balwinder Laddi. In 2017, Fateh Jung successfully contested from Qadian.A few months ago, when Partap Bajwa declared his intention of contesting the Assembly polls, he chose the Batala seat to make a comeback to state politics. He did so because his brother was the sitting legislator from Qadian and it would have been difficult to dislodge him.However, in December, PCC chief Navjot Sidhu at a rally at Kahnuwan, which is part of the Qadian seat, declared Fateh Jung’s candidature. Days later, Partap Bajwa declared himself as the nominee from Qadian even as the Congress election committee was yet to take a call. Fateh Jung quit the Congress and joined the BJP.                                     #BajwaBrothers                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #Qadian||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-qadian-a-house-divided-by-polls-363003
21-01-2022||New Delhi||Congress seeks Election Commission intervention over ED raids against Punjab CM Channi's relative||The Congress sought the Election Commission’s (EC) intervention on Thursday on the ED raids on a relative of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and alleged that the action was politically motivated to malign and defame the chief minister and the party-led state government.A delegation of Congress leaders met EC officials virtually and submitted a memorandum to them, alleging that the raids were conducted ahead of the February 20 Punjab Assembly polls to create a perception and influence the voters.The delegation comprising Randeep Singh Surjewala, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Harish Chaudhary, Devender Yadav, Ganesh Godiyal, Pranav Jha and Aman Panwar also reminded the chief election commissioner (CEC) about the alleged Model Code of Conduct violations by the ruling BJP in poll-bound Uttarakhand by “back-dating and tampering” with government records.The Congress leaders said the raids against Channi’s relative are in violation of the EC’s directives to the finance ministry and other probe agencies to ensure a level-playing field in the Punjab polls.They said the commission, during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, had issued an advisory to the Centre on “illegal, motivated and vendetta-driven enforcement actions”.“It is unfortunate that despite a specific direction issued by this commission, the central government continues to flout it with impunity as if it is baiting this commission to profess that a premeditated central government is neither under the jurisdiction of this commission nor does it need to adhere to any constitutional authority.“The blatant misuse of central investigative agencies for conducting politically motivated raids with the sole objective to publicly defame and malign the leaders of the Indian National Congress, particularly, the Congress chief minister in the state of Punjab, continues regardless of the Model Code of Conduct and with a view to illegally influence public opinion in the ongoing elections scheduled to be held on February 20,” the Congress memorandum said.The delegation said the timing of the raids is questionable as they have come crucially close to the Punjab polls and asked what the ED was doing for the last four years and why has it “suddenly woken up” now.“Does this itself not prove malice and mala fide?” the Congress leaders asked.Surjewala alleged that the Punjab chief minister has been targeted through these raids on his relative in order to create a perception and influence the voters of the state into believing that Channi, through his family members and the Congress, is involved in the allegations of money laundering.He also alleged that mala fide news items are being planted by the ED against Channi and a fake perception is being created against him.“ED raids are a revenge against the failure of the prime minister’s rally in Ferozepur on January 5. A sustained attack has been launched by the central government and the BJP against Charanjit Singh Channi, Chief Minister of Punjab, since the day of the prime minister’s rally in Ferozepur on January 5, when almost all 70,000 chairs were vacant and no one turned up,” the memorandum said.Seeking the EC’s immediate intervention in the matter, the Congress termed it a “brazen misuse of the official machinery and part of a larger pattern of malicious intimidation that is being done to directly influence the outcome in five election-bound states”.“This commission must enforce what it commands. In light of the above, it is important that this commission intervenes and exercises its power under Article 324 of the Constitution of India and address this issue by taking stern actions against ED officials conducting such illegal and mala fide raids and the consequent game to malign and defame,” the Congress memorandum said, hoping that the poll panel would treat it as urgent.The ED on Wednesday said it had seized cash amounting to over Rs 10 crore, including about Rs 8 crore from a relative of Channi, during raids conducted in connection with its anti-money laundering investigation against illegal sand-mining operations in the state.Enraged over the raids, Channi had accused the Centre of hatching a conspiracy against him as a revenge for the return of Prime Minister Narendra Modi without attending an event and addressing a rally during his visit to Punjab’s Ferozepur earlier this month.The Congress pointed out that no one from Channi’s family was named in a 2018 FIR related to illegal sand mining, which was registered by the Nawanshahr police in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district.“The fake case being built up by the central government and the ED is that Kudrat Deep, an accused in the FIR (who was discharged at the stage of framing charges), is an acquaintance of Bhupinder Singh Honey,” it said.Honey (28) is the son of Channi’s sister-in-law and has recently returned to India after completing his studies abroad.The Congress alleged that the case sought to be built up by the investigative agency is “deliberately contrived and self-serving and designed to serve the interest of the BJP and its allies, who are becoming irrelevant in the political landscape of Punjab”.“It is also a blatant and audacious abuse of the state machinery by the Government of India, which categorically falls under the offence of ‘undue influence’ as provided in the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860,” it said.                                     #Channi                                     #Congress                                     #EDRaids                                     #ElectionCommission                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-seeks-election-commission-intervention-over-ed-raids-against-punjab-cm-channis-relative-362992
