11-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab: SAD leader Bikram Majithia alleges conspiracy behind PM security breach||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Tuesday said the recent breach in the prime minister’s security in Punjab was a conspiracy hatched by the Charanjit Singh Channi government to embarrass the BJP.He also accused the chief minister of trying to downplay the issue of security breach and refusing to own responsibility for the same, and said “earlier also we have witnessed how the persons who had come to garland former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi assassinated him”.Majithia, whose party Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is an erstwhile ally of the BJP, made the remarks while speaking to reporters after he was granted anticipatory bail in a Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act case registered against him.On the issue of a security lapse during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Ferozepur, he said that the security of the prime minister was compromised.When the chief minister or the Punjab Congress chief travel, their roads are not blocked but their route diversion plans are ready, Majithia said.He questioned why the state government failed to find an alternative route for the prime minister.The prime minister’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur last week after which he returned from the poll-bound state without attending any event, including a rally.“It was well planned to embarrass the BJP and the entire system and who was hatching this conspiracy, it was (the then DGP Siddharth) Chattopadhyaya, Channi, (Deputy Chief Minister) Sukhjinder Randhawa and (state Congress chief) Navjot Singh Sidhu,” Majithia alleged.Asked if there was a conspiracy behind what happened with the prime minister during his visit, he said, “100 per cent”.                Majithia said he has never heard of the chief minister or the Punjab Congress chief stranded on any road for 15-20 minutes.It never happened in the past that a prime minister remained stranded for 15-20 minutes, he said while suggesting that in such a situation anything could have happened.“It was a well-planned conspiracy hatched at the Chief Minister’s house by PPCC president, Sukhjinder Randhawa, and this DGP,” he alleged.He also cited the Rajiv Gandhi assassination. “What has happened in the past, those who went to garland Rajiv Gandhi assassinated him,” the SAD leader said.Channi is speaking nonsense that he would have spilled his own blood and taken the first bullet had there been the slightest threat to the prime minister’s security, Majithia said.He added that had there been any untoward incident regarding the prime minister’s security, what face would they have had.The Supreme Court on Monday had said it would set up a panel headed by its former judge to probe the security breach during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to Punjab and stayed the parallel inquiries by committees of the Centre and the state government into the lapses. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-sad-leader-bikram-majithia-alleges-conspiracy-behind-pm-security-breach-360372

11-01-2022||Satya Prakash||Former SC judge to probe PM Modi's security lapse in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 10The Supreme Court on Monday ordered setting up a high-level committee headed by a former judge of the top court to probe the security lapse during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab last week.Centre’s notice self-contradictoryYour show-cause notice is self-contradictory. By constituting the committee, you seek to inquire if there is a breach of the SPG Act and then you hold state Chief Secretary and DGP guilty.... Who held them guilty? — CJI-led BenchCommittee to submit report at earliestA three-judge Bench led by CJI NV Ramana ordered the inquiry committees of the Centre and the Punjab Government to halt their respective probe into the January 5 security lapse.“We are taking the PM’s security breach very seriously,” said the Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli.The committee led by a retired Supreme Court judge will include the Chandigarh Police chief, National Investigation Agency IG, Punjab and Haryana High Court Registrar General and the Punjab ADGP (Security), the top court said, adding that a detailed order would be released later.The committee will submit its report to the top court at the earliest, it said. Once the committee submits its report, the top court will pass orders for action to be taken by the Centre and the Punjab Government. The order came after the Punjab Government demanded an independent probe into the breach in the Prime Minister’s security, saying the state would not get a fair hearing in any probe carried out by the Centre.Just before the crucial hearing, many Advocates-on-Record (through whom cases are filed in the Supreme Court) allegedly received calls from an anonymous number from the UK taking responsibility for the security breach at Hussainiwala flyover.The Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) has written to the Supreme Court Secretary General (with a copy to Delhi Police Chief), demanding immediate action against those responsible for it.According to the SCAORA letter, the caller also threatened the Supreme Court judges, asking them to refrain from hearing the PIL as “the court had not been able to punish the culprits of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots”.During the hearing on a petition filed by an NGO, Lawyer’s Voice, seeking a probe into the security lapse, Punjab Advocate General DS Patwalia took strong exception to the seven show-cause notices issued to the SSP concerned, Chief Secretary and senior officials of the state, asking them to explain why action should not be taken against them. The petitioners wanted the court to fix responsibility of the Punjab Chief Secretary and the state’s DGP, place them under suspension and direct the Centre to initiate departmental action against them.Alleging that “there is some politics behind it”, Patwalia said, “I will not get a fair hearing from the Central Government. Please appoint an independent committee, and give us a fair hearing....”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta clarified that the show-cause notices were issued before the court’s order. “If you have already made up your mind then what’s the need for having an inquiry.... There’s a lapse and it has to be found out who is responsible for it,” the Bench said.“Your show-cause notice is totally self-contradictory. By constituting the committee, you seek to inquire if there is a breach of the SPG Act and then you hold the state Chief Secretary and the DGP guilty. Who held them guilty?” it wondered. The Solicitor General said these were only show-cause notices and not findings. Noting that it was an issue of the security of the PM, Mehta said it could be examined by senior officials of the Central Government. The report could be placed before the Bench and then “Your Lordships can take an appropriate decision,” Mehta said.Patwalia objected to it and reiterated his demand for an independent probe. Finally, the top court ordered setting up a committee headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-sc-judge-to-probe-pms-security-lapse-360136

He was told to join the investigation.Justice Gill lays down conditionsAmong other things, he was asked to keep his cellphone constantly on and share with the investigating agency his live location through WhatsApp.The order would remain in force at least till January 18 — the next date of hearing. For the purpose of joining the probe, Justice Lisa Gill gave Majithia two days, making it clear that the interim order was without prejudice to the prosecution’s right to press for his custodial interrogation, if required.Majithia was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in Mohali on December 20 last year. He moved the High Court after a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea. The case assumed a political hue with Majithia claiming political vendetta.In her five-page order, Justice Gill asserted it was considered expedient at the current stage to direct the petitioner, at the first instance, to join the investigation and directed Majithia to appear before the investigating officer on January 12 at 11 am. He was told to fully cooperate and abide by the conditions, including appearance before the investigating agency as and when required.Majithia was also directed not to leave the country till the next date of hearing, provide his cellphone number to the probing agency and not to directly or indirectly try contacting any of the witnesses or anyone connected with the case in any manner.Justice Gill observed reliance by the prosecution, at the present stage, was primarily upon the statements of certain persons, including Jagdish Singh Bhola, Maninder Singh Aulakh, Jagminder Kaur and Jagjit Singh Chahal. Bhola stood convicted in another case while Chahal and Aulakh were acquitted.Statements of these three persons were recorded by the ED at the first instance. As per a status report submitted by the Additional Director-General of Police, Special Task Force & Border, Harpreet Singh Sidhu, no fresh statement by Chahal or Aulakh was recorded during the inquiry. Sidhu’s statement dated December 22, 2021, was a reiteration of the status report submitted by him.Similarly, the statement of former ED officer Niranjan Singh, dated December 22, 2021, was a narration of the sequence of events. Bhola in his statement dated January 3 had merely reiterated his earlier statement.Majithia was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and RS Cheema with counsel DS Sobti and Arshdeep Singh Cheema.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/interim-bail-hc-tells-majithia-to-join-probe-360138

However, it would not “oppose” the SSM in any constituency.Has Committees in 1,400 villagesThe announcement is important as the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has a lot of influence in the Malwa belt which comprises 69 of the total 117 Assembly constituencies.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had hoped to make gains in rural segments in alliance with the SSM, but that has not worked out. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which has its vote bank in rural Punjab, could also see a division in its votes.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), said but for the newly formed SSM, other parties would be asked questions on their stand on various agriculture issues mentioned in their manifesto.“All farmers’ organisations, including those part of the SSM, will meet on January 15 to discuss demands that are yet to be met by the Union Government,” he added. When contacted, Rajewal said he was sure of Ugrahan’s support. “It is just a pretence,” he claimed. “Seat-sharing with Gurnam Singh Charuni’s Sanyukt Sangharsh Party will be announced soon,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ugrahan-wont-contest-polls-or-support-ssm-360140

The demand for social media experts has also gone up suddenly."This year's election will be different from those held in the past as it will see the maximum use of social media tools for reaching out to the voters. With the help of social media, I am able to connect with thousands of area residents within minutes. Since Covid cases are rising sharply, it's safe also," said Harpal Singh Cheema, Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly.Money mattersSome social media experts say they have been charging Rs 30,000-50,000 a month to operate politicians' social media accounts, including Facebook and Twitter. Some of them said they had been signing Rs 4-8 lakh contracts for providing and managing all social media services till elections.Even those who have never been very active on social media are now hiring experts to stay connected with voters. There are many like Dhuri Congress MLA Dalvir Singh Goldy who operate their social media accounts themselves and don’t have any team for the purpose.“I have been using social media since my university days and I personally operate all my accounts,” Goldy said.State coordinator of various cells of BJP Jatinder Kalra said social media management was a key component of the election campaign of all politicians these days.“Till some years ago, only a few could really understand the importance of social media, but Covid and farmers' agitation have made everyone realise its importance. I have exposed many scams through social media and it has been also helping us to counter fake campaigns,” Karla said.SAD spokesperson and Sangrur candidate Winnerjit Singh Goldy said, “Many elderly persons have also taken to social media now. It has been playing an important role for all.

However, at present, the administration has woken up and a few guesthouses on the campus, apart from a hostel, have been reserved for isolation of mildly infected interns and JRs.“Separate arrangements were made after the students took up the issue with the authorities,” a leader of the junior resident doctors’ association said.An official of the GMC said: “The action was taken as soon as the matter was brought to light.” He said earlier in the absence of any specific guidelines, no special arrangement was in place.A hostel resident said: “No isolation, as is required under Covid guidelines, is possible in a hostel where inmates have to share washrooms, toilets and even the mess.” He said the reason of the infection could be due to weather conditions but even the mess staff had started showing symptoms similar to Covid infection.Earlier last week, an outbreak of Covid infections was reported from Government Medical College in Patiala, after which the administration got the hostels vacated. 242 test positive in districtAmritsar: After 242 persons tested positive for Covid on Monday, the district tally increased to 48,957.

Justice Meenakshi I Mehta also made it clear that illegal mining was harming the environment and the ecological system of the area.The ruling by Justice Mehta came after an accused in a theft case moved the High Court apprehending arrest, following the registration of an FIR on September 26, 2021, at the Lopoke police station in Amritsar, under Section 379 of the IPC and the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act.The Bench was told that the petitioner, coming on a tractor trailer, stopped on being signalled by a police team. However, he escaped from there. The vehicle was loaded with 400-feet ‘sand’ without any permit or requisite document.Appearing before the Bench, his counsel contended that the petitioner was falsely implicated in the case. He had not been apprehended on the spot. As such, he deserved the relief of anticipatory bail. The State counsel, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner was involved in one more case of similar nature in addition to the present case. Keeping in view the nature of the offence committed by him, the petition was required to be dismissed, the State counsel added.Refusing to grant the concession, Justice Mehta added the tractor, to which the trolley loaded with ‘sand’ was attached, was allegedly being driven by the petitioner,who allegedly escaped from the spot on noticing the police party. Document or permit regarding the ‘sand’ loaded in the tractor trailer was not available.“Keeping in view the ever-growing menace of illegal mining of the minerals in the region, this Court is of the opinion that the petitioner does not deserve the relief of anticipatory bail. Resultantly, the petition in hand stands dismissed,” Justice Mehta said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illegal-mineral-mining-evergrowing-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-360137

The constituency has seen many investments in the past one decade.However, it has gained much notoriety for illegal mining, which is rampant in the whole Ghaggar belt and farmlands near it.Ghanaur, being a rural segment, shares its border with Haryana and the constituency residents will be the first in the state to get canal-based water supply, for which work is almost in its final stages.“After years of flooding and losses in every monsoon due to the overflowing Ghaggar and the diseases its polluted water brings with it, we will finally get treated canal-based water supply for our villages,” says Bapror resident Devinder Singh. “Due to water pollution and skin diseases near villages along the river, the cost of our land has not risen,” he said, adding that a permanent solution to Ghaggar was the need of the hour.Sitting Congress MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur has nurtured the constituency for almost 15 years. The SAD has fielded its former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, ignoring former MLA Harpreet Kaur Mukhmailpur, whose family enjoys a significant public support. AAP is fielding kabaddi player Gurlal Singh Ghanaur.Jalalpur says he has been instrumental in getting many works done like setting up of a water treatment plant for drinking water, an industrial corridor project for six villages, new Shambhu block, road widening, upkeep of Civil Hospital, renovations of Anaj Mandi, a sewage treatment plant, renovation of bus stand, etc.Locals’ key demandsPast trendIn 2002, Congress candidate Jasjit Singh Randhawa was the winner; while in 2007, Jalalpur won as an Independent.

Nagra alleged that Cheema was stopping the ongoing development works in villages.The MLA said the works were underway before the enforcement of the model code of conduct.

As per the norms prevailing since 1998, the DD allows all recognised parties to put up a video, in which a speech is read to its viewers for the allotted time ranging between five to 15 minutes, depending on the parties’ previous term performance. The script of the speech has to be submitted in advance for approval to analyse that no part of it is either provocative or violates the model code of conduct.Spokesperson, Shiromani Akali Dal, Dr Daljeet Singh Cheema said, “Though social media is powerful these days, the reach of DD still remains high. Some remote areas of Punjab do not have a proper access to social media due to poor Internet connectivity. Owing to the curbs put on campaign in view of Covid, we expect more free time from the DD and All India Radio for such programmes.”Leaders of the BJP are demanding that instead of allotting the time according to the previous performance of a party, there should be level field playing and all the parties should get the same free time to express their views. “We are against the idea of giving less time to the parties that have not performed well in the previous elections. For a new contest in a new scenario, all parties should get the same time to speak. We will definitely raise the issue in the meeting,” said former BJP minister Manorajan Kalia.EC yet to give orderThe EC is expected to double the free time for the parties, but we are yet to receive any formal orders for it.

11-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Punjab CM's stand on 'security threat' to PM Modi worked, claims Congress survey||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 10The recent narrative of “custodian of Punjabiat” and “protector of farmers” set by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi to counter BJP’s charge of “security threat” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have been working to the advantage of the Punjab Congress.The CM’s response to PM Modi’s “say thanks to your CM that I could return alive to Bathinda airport” jibe seems to have been taken positively on the ground as is reflected in a recent survey — with a sample size of 25,000 persons — carried out in different urban and rural areas by the party. The feedback survey indicates a jump in the percentage of people supporting the Congress because of Channi’s line of action, irrespective of caste or religion. Insiders point out CM Channi managed to puncture the BJP’s narrative set around the Modi’s brand image and silence his critics within the party. A senior AICC leader pointed out Channi, while apologising for the episode and saying PM’s security was of “utmost concern” for him and that he would “shed his blood” to save the PM, made people see the reason, as he made it a point to reach out to protesting employees and BJP workers at different points during his travel.“Earlier, it was farmers versus BJP. Now, it is ‘Punjab versus BJP’,” pointed out a leader involved in party’s war room strategy. By terming BJP’s narrative of threat to the PM an attack on ‘Punjabiat’, the Congress has made it “Punjab versus BJP”. The leaders pointed out by standing by the protesting farmers and stating he could not order lathicharge or opening of fire at his own people, CM Channi seemed to have turned the tables on the BJP.This may have a bearing on the tussle between PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and CM Channi over the party’s CM face, though the party has announced it will go into the elections under Sidhu, Channi and Sunil Jakhar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cms-stand-on-security-threat-worked-claims-cong-survey-360099
11-01-2022||GS Paul & Ravi Dhaliwal||Punjab votes 2022: Despondency, no wave||In the run-up to the 2022 Assembly elections, the hapless ‘Majhails’ — those belonging to the border belt of Majha — are silent as of now as to which way the political wind will blow.The region comprises four districts — Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran and Pathankot — and sends 25 MLAs to the 117-member Assembly. The electorate is largely disappointed with the government over its inability to tackle the problems of drug abuse, farm crisis, dilapidated health and education infrastructure, besides non-implementation of the special economic zone (SEZ). Further, lack of jobs for youngsters, corruption in government offices, and poor law and order figure high on their list of dissatisfaction. Incidents of sacrilege and missing ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib remain among the most contentious issues.Pyare Lal Seth, president, Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, says his fraternity has yet to make up its mind on which way they will go, as a major political parties — the Congress, SAD-BSP, and BJP and its allies — hasn’t named their candidates on most of the seats. It will be a daunting task for the Congress to repeat its feat of 2017 this time. The party had claimed 22 seats, while SAD won two and the BJP one. AAP failed to open its account. Rattan Singh Randhawa, a farmer, says the Congress may have changed its CM but the party remains the same. “They only fight among themselves, not for the people. Majha has emerged as the centre of drug abuse due to its proximity to the International Border. Similarly, the issues of rise of gangster culture in connivance with police, inadequate job opportunities, poor health and education facilities and inadequate compensation to farmers who till their land beyond barbed fencing never find a place on the priority list of any of the parties,” he said. Amid the burning economic, religious and social issues, the repeal of the farm laws may not help the BJP, which is contesting in alliance with the Punjab Lok Congress and SAD (Sanyukt), while the Congress and SAD-BSP are in a tight contest. The Aam Admi Party (AAP) is yet to make its presence felt here.Having made the 2015 sacrilege at Bargari a political issue to target the SAD during the 2017 elections, the ruling Congress may be wary this time of the fallout of fresh “sacrilege” attempts at the Golden Temple and Kapurthala gurdwara ahead of the polls.A fractured SAD has gone full throttle in Majha to regain its lost political ground by taking the lead in announcing candidates and launching rallies and door-to-door campaign to counter the dent. The major issues they face include the disappearance of 328 “saroops” of Guru Granth Sahib and drug smuggling, in which former minister Bikram Majithia has been booked.Sarbjit Singh Verka, an advocate, feels the only party against which there is no major negative sentiment remains the AAP, yet it will be difficult to say whether it will make an impact.“The gangster culture, drugs, corruption, sand and liquor mafias have been prevalent in both SAD and Congress regimes. Similarly, the missing saroops from SAD-dominated SGPC’s possession and sacrilege (2015 Bargari) still haunt the Akalis, whereas the recent ‘sacrilege’ incidents may worry the Congress. So, it will be challenging for both parties. On the drug issue, the Congress failed to root it out, as was promised by former CM Capt Amarinder Singh. An FIR was lodged during Charanjit Channi’s tenure, but SAD leader Majithia is still out of reach. It is unchartered territory for the AAP here, and may prove to be the dark horse this time,” he says.The Congress finds itself in a tight spot too as the employees, health workers and teachers took to the streets over regular jobs. Prof GS Sekhon, president, Amritsar unit, Punjab Federation of College and University Teachers, says: “We were the sufferers under the Congress regime. We will vote for the party that gives us in writing that it will implement the 7th Pay Commission.” GNDU’s research student Jatinder Veer Singh, a first-time voter, says they will look for the party that has plans to generate job opportunities in government and private sectors. In the Hindu belt of Pathankot, Sujanpur, Bhoa and Dinanagar too, no clarity has emerged among voters, unlike in 2017. Insiders say the BJP may contest all seats, as Capt Amarinder Singh’s PLC wields no influence here. The state BJP has been asked to focus on 45 seats that have a Hindu population of more than 60 per cent. All four seats fall in the category.The seats are primarily Hindi-speaking. In the 2007, 2012 and 2017 polls, when the seat sharing agreement was in place between the SAD and the BJP, all the four seats used to go to the BJP because of its demographic profile which is heavily loaded in favour of the Hindu community.Another key factor is the controversy over Dogri certificate. People of area tend to be short-statured and the Dogri certificate used to help youth desirous of joining the armed forces some advantage in height. However, several years ago this certificate was scrapped. In Bhoa and Dinanagar, the mood is sombre with a majority of the voters claiming they need nothing but employment for their children.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-votes-2022-despondency-no-wave-360095

I will not get justice from the central government committee," Patwalia told the top court.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta clarified to the Bench that the showcause notices were issued before the court's order."If you have already made up your mind, then what's the need for having an inquiry...There's a lapse and it has to be found out who are responsible for it," the Bench said."Your showcause notice is totally self-contradictory. By constituting the committee, you seek to inquire if there is a breach of the SPG AC and then you hold the state Chief Secretary and the DGP guilty...Who held them guilty?" it wondered.The Solicitor General said these were only showcause notices and not findings. He said it's an admitted case of security lapse and the PM was exposed.Mehta said someone from the Cabinet Secretariat, DG, SPG and Intelligence Bureau officials should be there in the committee.Noting that it was an issue of the security of the Prime Minister, Mehta said it could be examined by the senior officials of the Central Government. The report can be placed before the Bench and then "Your Lordships can take an appropriate decision," Mehta said.He said the committee of the Central Government can examine it and submit the report to the court and in the meantime no action will be taken against any officials.Patwalia objected to it and reiterated his demand for an independent probe, saying the showcause notices issued to state government officials made it clear that the Central committee had already made up its mind.Finally, the court ordered setting up a committee headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-demands-independent-probe-into-pm-security-breach-359938
