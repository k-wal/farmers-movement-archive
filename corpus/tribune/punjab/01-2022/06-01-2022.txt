Punjabi tradition is such that they will protect you with their own lives and every Punjabi has that courage,” Khera told reporters.“To win petty political battles, you cannot undermine this country, any region of this country, any institution of this country. But, unfortunately, the Prime Minister always chooses to do this, especially when that region has nothing to do with the BJP, that region rejects the BJP always,” he said.“Why are you insulting Punjab,” he asked.In a “major security lapse”, Modi’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by farm protesters in Ferozepur on Wednesday. He returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a rally.The Centre blamed the Congress government in Punjab for the breach.On Thursday, the state government constituted a two-member committee to conduct a “thorough probe” into the incident.The Congress leader said instead of politicising the matter, the Prime Minister should behave in a manner which befits the mighty institution he holds.“Do not try and prove it to the world, show it to the world something which is not true. India is not a banana republic, despite your efforts to make it one,” he said.Over the last 24 hours, Khera alleged, there have been some attempts unfortunately by the Prime Minister and the ruling party to create a controversy.The Congress leader claimed that as per the blue book that is followed by the Special Protection Group (SPG), there is advance security lesson in which all stakeholders and security agencies come together and follow it in letter and spirit.He said the SPG takes the final call and other agencies assist the SPG in executing it. “Let the enquiry report come out, facts will be there for you,” he said.The Congress leader claimed that what happened with the Prime Minister in Punjab was because of a sudden change of plans and him not taking an alternative route. He also did not provide time to the Punjab Police to clear the path, Khera claimed.He said the Prime Minister knowing well that the farmers are protesting against the Centre should have given more time to security forces or should have taken an alternative route.He also said the farmers are seeking sacking of MoS Ajay Mishra Teni whose son is named in the charge-sheet in Lakhimpur Kheri killings.Citing past examples, Khera said the Prime Minister had in 2017 elections in Gujarat accused former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Army General Deepak Kapoor and former Vice President Hamid Ansari of plotting against him in collusion with Pakistan.Khera said on September 22, 2017, the Prime Minister was visiting his home constituency Varanasi when some girls of Banaras Hindu University were protesting against harassment at the Lanka Gate area of Varanasi and top police officers tried to dissuade them, but they failed and the girls continued protesting.“Did you hear the Prime Minister utter these words, which he uttered yesterday for Punjab, in Punjab. ‘Thank You Mr Chief Minister, Main Zinda Laut Aya, I am returning alive’. You didn’t hear this against (UP CM) Adityanath. Why didn’t he use these words in UP,” he asked.He also said that on September 15, 2018 in Delhi, when the prime minister was attending the Swachhata Shramdan Programme, his cavalcade got stuck near Paharganj in a traffic jam. but he did not say, “Mr. Chief Minister, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, Thank You, I am going back alive, why? Why these double standards.”                On December 25, 2017, when the prime minister was going to inaugurate the magenta line of the Metro in Gautam Buddha Nagar, his cavalcade lost its way, wasted some minutes, and a junior officer was suspended.

06-01-2022||Barnala||If PM Modi has to stop for 15 minutes, why BJP is so scared, asks Navjot Sidhu||Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday at Barnala questioned the BJP and said farmers sat at New Delhi borders for more than one year against central farm laws, but if PM Narendra Modi has to stop for 15 minutes in Punjab, why is the BJP so scared. He also said that if few hundred people came to listen to PM Modi, it was the failure of the BJP and former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.“If PM had to stop for 15 minutes, why the BJP is so scared? Former Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh gave a speech to empty chairs as only few hundred people came to rally. It was the failure of the BJP and Capt Amarinder and the bubble of the BJP has burst,” said Sidhu while addressing a rally at Barnala grain market to seek votes for former Barnala MLA Kewal Singh Dhillon.He also alleged that the BJP had promised to double the income of Punjab farmers, but his central BJP government through farm laws tried to create more problems for farmers.“Now the BJP and its leaders are enacting drama of repealing the laws to take votes of farmers. But our farmers are well aware that the BJP had not taken the laws back willingly, but the anger of the farmers of the country has compelled the BJP to repeal the black laws,” said Sidhu.Raising questions over the timing of fresh sacrilege cases and bomb blast in Ludhiana court, Sidhu alleged that many forces wanted to spoil the peace of Punjab.“We would vote in forthcoming assembly elections not only to elect next state government, but to save our future generations. Many forces are working to destroy Punjab, I request all to be alert while voting,” said Sidhu.He criticised SAD leaders for their alleged involvement in mining and cable mafia. Sidhu also challenged New Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for an open debate about the development of New Delhi and other facilities there.“Kejriwal has been making false claims about development of New Delhi. If he is right, I challenge him for an open debate. He could debate with me anywhere and I would welcome him,” said Sidhu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/if-pm-modi-has-to-stop-for-15-minutes-why-bjp-is-so-scared-asks-navjot-sidhu-358822
06-01-2022||Tanda (Hoshiarpur)||PM Modi's 'life threat gimmick' aimed at toppling democratically elected Punjab Govt: CM Channi||Facing flak from the BJP over the “security lapse” during the Prime Minister’s Punjab visit, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday alleged that Narendra Modi’s “life threat gimmick” was aimed at “toppling a democratically elected government” in the state.Channi further said the Prime Minister is a respected leader of the nation but it does not behove a leader of his stature to indulge in “such cheap theatricals”.He was addressing a gathering here after laying the foundation stone for development works worth Rs 18 crore at the New Grain Market, an official statement said.The Chief Minister claimed there was no threat to Modi’s life as he cancelled his programme on Wednesday because of less number of people in the BJP’s rally at Ferozepur.He said because of the empty chairs at the rally venue, the Prime Minister went back to the National Capital citing the “frivolous reason of security threat”.Channi alleged that the “false pretext” on which the PM cancelled his visit was part of a “larger conspiracy to defame Punjab and murder democracy in the state on lines of what was done earlier in Jammu and Kashmir”.The Chief Minister asked how could the Prime Minister’s life be threatened if the protesters were more than a kilometre away from him.He said that the place where Modi’s cavalcade stopped not even a slogan was raised, then how could his life have been threatened.Channi reminded Modi that Punjabis have sacrificed their lives for unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country and added that they could never pose any danger to the life and security of the Prime Minister.“The thin presence of public in the rally has exposed the poor position of the BJP in the state which is not going down well with its entire leadership,” he claimed.Citing a comparison, Channi said the weather was poor on Wednesday and on Thursday as well but there were very few takers for BJP’s rally on Wednesday, whereas the Congress’s rally was swelling with people across the state.“Yesterday’s gimmick by the Prime Minister and his coterie is aimed at imposing the President’s rule in the state,” he claimed.Channi reminded the Prime Minister that Punjab can be won only with love and not by pressure. He said Punjabis will vehemently oppose any move to destabilise democracy in the state.The Chief Minister urged Modi to “stop defaming the state and its people for vested political interests”. Channi reminded him that Punjabis have played a key role in socio-economic development of the country, besides safeguarding its borders.“The slanderous campaign launched by the BJP is an insult to all the Punjabis and it is unwarranted and undesirable,” he said.At a separate event at Machhiwara in Ludhiana, Channi asked what were the intelligence officials around the Prime Minister doing if they had sensed a threat to his safety.Channi said the fact of the matter was that barely 700 people turned up at the BJP’s rally but the blame was pinned on the Punjab Government citing security threat to the Prime Minister.“The truth is that five days before the PM’s scheduled rally, the Special Protection Group (SPG) took over the landing spot, rally site and (went over) each security detail but later the prime minister’s cavalcade suddenly took land route,” Channi said, adding that the route was cleared by the SPG.The chief minister reiterated that had there been any danger to the prime minister, every Punjabi was nationalist enough to face bullets as they had done before in the service of the nation.Punjabis have never shied away from making sacrifices for the nation and are as patriotic a race as any other in the country, he said.At Tanda in Hoshiarpur, Channi termed former chief minister Amarinder Singh a “political deadwood”, saying it was evident from a rally on Wednesday where the royal scion of Patiala addressed empty chairs.He said that everyone knew Amarinder Singh had “backstabbed” Punjab due to which no one wanted to listen to him. “The day is not far when all the candidates of the Maharaja will lose their deposits in the polls,” Channi claimed.Assailing AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Channi described him as a “chronic liar”, alleging that he was trying to “mislead the people of the state with his fake promises”.In a “major security lapse”, Modi’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur on Wednesday after which he returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a scheduled rally.The Prime Minister was scheduled to lay the foundation stone of development projects worth over Rs 42,750 crore, including the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway and a PGIMER satellite centre on Wednesday, besides addressing a rally.

06-01-2022||Chandigarh||SSP told us PM Modi would be coming by road but we took it as bluff: BKU-Krantikari chief Surjeet Phul||The chief of a farmer outfit, which had blocked the route of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s convoy in Ferozepur forcing it to return, on Thursday said his group was told by the district police chief that the PM would be travelling by this road, but “we thought it was a bluff to get the road vacated”.It was revealed by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) chief Surjeet Singh Phul, whose union had blocked the Ferozepur-Moga road near Piareana village as part of their protest.The PM’s convoy had got stuck on a flyover on this road for 15-20 minutes when it reached near Piareana village, around 30 km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala in Ferozepur.A decision was then taken to take the PM’s convoy back to Bathinda airport.After landing in Bathinda on Wednesday, Prime Minister Modi had to take the road route to Hussainiwala in Ferozepur because of the inclement weather.Talking to reporters, Phul said, “We initially thought they were bluffing us. The PM will not come. (If he comes) he will come by air as a helipad was set up there.”   Phul said they thought it was a ploy of the police to get the road vacated to allow buses of BJP workers to pass through for the rally. “We thought that way,” he said.“We never knew that the PM was coming,” said Phul.Asked which police officer told them that the PM was coming, Phul said it was the Senior Superintendent of Police (Ferozepur).The SSP said the prime minister was coming, said Phul.“We told him if the PM had to come, will it be known just an hour before his arrival? It was not possible,” Phul said.He further argued that there was so much traffic on the road and if the PM had to take this road, the traffic on both the up and down lanes would have been stopped in advance.“You (SSP) are bluffing us. We do not trust you and we will not vacate the road. You are lying about the PM visit,” said Phul.Some farmer bodies, including the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) had earlier announced to oppose Modi’s visit.They were demanding from the government to fulfil their pending demands, including bringing a law to guarantee the minimum support price for crops and withdrawal of criminal cases against farmers, who had participated in the agitation against the central farm laws.In a “major security lapse”, Prime Minister Modi’s convoy was left stranded on a flyover in Ferozepur on Wednesday after some protesting farmers blocked the road forcing the PM to return from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a rally.The Union Home Ministry has sought an immediate explanation from the state government on the PM’s security breach, saying it did not ensure the requisite deployment with Home Minister Amit Shah too warning that such dereliction of the security procedure during the prime minister’s visit is totally unacceptable and the accountability will be fixed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ssp-told-us-pm-modi-would-be-coming-by-road-but-we-took-it-as-bluff-bku-krantikari-chief-358809

Thankful to him for his concern. Grateful for his good wishes, which are always a source of strength. @rashtrapatibhvn pic.twitter.com/g6Unl8WCJJ  The Home Ministry, meanwhile, is awaiting the response of the Punjab government before fixing responsibility in the matter and has called for strictest action against those responsible.President Ram Nath Kovind met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today and received from him a first-hand account of the security breach in his convoy in Punjab yesterday. The President expressed his concerns about the serious lapse. pic.twitter.com/lzvAuriuGb  The developments came even as former prime minister HD Devegowda termed as unfortunate the controversy over PM’s security breach and cautioned against complacency in protecting the highest official of the state.The BJP, meanwhile, has met Punjab governor and demanded the sacking of DGP Sidharth Chattopadhyay and Home Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa.The matter is set to assume a major political colour on the eve of elections to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur and Punjab with the BJP set to project the Congress as a “Modi hater which tried to bring harm to the PM by exposing him for over 15 minutes at an elevated road in Punjab’s Ferozepur yesterday”, as already stated by Union minister Smriti Irani.The Congress has rejected the charges of security breach.Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “The BJP is enacting a political drama because of thin attendance at the PM’s rally. Is it our job to arrange crowds for the rally? See the BJP duplicity and doublespeak: When PM Modi’s convoy is stuck in traffic in Gautam Budh Nagar on 25th December, 2017; it’s ok and there is no security breach. When the PM’s convoy gets stuck in Delhi on 15th September, 2018 the BJP puts it out on its twitter and hails it! But as PM changed his route last minute and travels by road and a delay of 15 minutes happens in clearing the farmers it is projected as endangering his life. Did anyone attack PM’s convoy? Isn’t the BJP insulting three crore Punjabis by such false bogey? He is India’s PM not BJP’s.

06-01-2022||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court to hear PM's security breach matter on Friday||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 6A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security was breached in Ferozepur in Punjab, a petition in the Supreme Court on Thursday demanded a thorough probe into it.Senior advocate and former Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh mentioned the petition by ‘Lawyer’s Voice’ before a three-judge Bench led by CJI NV Ramana for urgent hearing.The Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli, asked the petitioner to serve a copy of his petition to the Punjab Government and posted it for hearing on Friday.The security breach had happened on Wednesday when Modi was on his way to address a BJP rally and his cavalcade had to take a U-turn after some protesters blocked his way. The Prime Minister was reportedly stuck on a flyover for around 20 minutes.Terming it an “unacceptable” and “serious lapse” on the part of the Punjab Government and the state police, Singh said it needed to be thoroughly investigated under the supervision of the top court.The petitioner wanted the top court to pass orders to fix responsibility of Punjab Chief Secretary and the state’s DGP and place them under suspension; and direct the Centre to initiate departmental action against them.It sought a direction to the Bathinda District Judge to take possession of all evidence relating to police and security bandobast for the Prime Minister’s visit.As Singh mentioned the issue of breach in the security of the Prime Minister and sought an urgent hearing,  the CJI asked, “What is it that you are expecting from us?”Singh said, “It’s extremely relevant to ensure it does not happen again and responsibility for this lapse should be fixed. A professional and effective investigation is needed into the bandobast.”He requested the Bench to direct the Bathinda District Judge to take into custody entire records of the deployment of Punjab Police in connection with the Prime Minister’s visit and produce before it.“After the records are submitted by the district judge, Your Lordships may decide what steps are to be taken,” Singh submitted.The petitioner wondered how private persons were given access to the PM’s route and were instigated to block his route. “It is clear from the events that private persons were given access to the Prime Minister’s route, and other persons were instigated to join the blockade, which represents a serious and unpardonable breach of national security by the State apparatus and the political establishment of the State,” the petitioner submitted.“Considering the prevalent situation, which clearly has a national security implication, the highest standard of security arrangements was imperative and as per protocol, the car for the Chief Secretary and DGP or their nominees of the visiting state is earmarked and supposed to join the motorcade. However, as per the reports, neither chief secretary/representative nor DG/representative joined the motorcade during the movement of the Prime Minister.” the petition pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/supreme-court-to-hear-pms-security-breach-matter-on-friday-358759

Consequently, she was held up by the B-division police and her maternal family members were informed in Rajasthan.Police incharge Amarjit Singh said the woman was carrying some jewellery and cash and her family members would reach here in a day. “According to her, she lived in Maharajganj (UP), but she gave us the contact number of her maternal home in Rajasthan. Nothing objectionable has been found from her possession, but she appears to be mentally unstable, may be due to some domestic dispute,” he said.The woman, a mother of two-and-a-half-year-old son, met the Pakistan man during an online ludo game 10-12 days ago and later connected on Facebook and WhatsApp.She said he (Pakistani) had invited me to Pakistan. “When I asked how I could reach there, he told me to come to the Attari-Wagah border,” she said.As she told an auto-rickshaw driver to drop her at the Attari-Wagah border, another cop deputed at Jallianwala Bagh, Ranjit Singh, overheard the conversation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/woman-tries-to-cross-over-to-pak-arrested-358515

For us, it represents his vote-catching ability. He may have been marginalised following the sleaze video which went viral in the run-up to the 2017 Gurdaspur bypoll. Sukhbir has pulled him to his side by promising a “decent position” to his son, Sonu Langah. The senior Langah will now openly support the party candidate Ravi Karan Kahlon,” said a senior leader.Sucha Singh Chhottepur, the party’s nominee from Batala, has also been asked to activate his workers in Dera Baba Nanak. Chhotepur’s former seat of Dhariwal was dissolved in 2012 and a large number of his villages were shifted to Dera.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sukhbir-visits-gurdaspur-to-quell-dissidence-358516

As a result, it had also hit the livelihood of many construction workers, it said. Moreover, fresh guidelines have also been issued keeping in view the third Covid-19 wave.Other Cabinet decisionsWith a view to providing employment avenues to the unemployed youth, besides ensuring robust health of the students of government schools, the Cabinet approved creation of 2,000 posts of physical training instructor (PTI) by the Directorate of Recruitment of the Department of School Education in the pay matrix of Rs 29,200 per month.The process for filling these newly created posts would be started in a phased manner. The decision would entail a financial burden to the tune of Rs 70.08 crore per annum on the exchequer, the statement said. As these fresh appointees are to be provided minimum pay of the applicable pay matrix during their probation period of three years, there shall be financial implications to the tune of Rs 210.24 crore for the first three years.In a bid to ensure effective formulation and implementation of Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP), the Cabinet approved the outline of the proposed Punjab State Welfare and Development of Scheduled Castes (Planning, Earmarking and Utilisation of Financial Resources) Sub-Allocation Ordinance, 2022.The new law will be instrumental in ensuring transparency and accountability at all levels in the implementation of the SCSP and there will also be a provision of incentives for good performance.Notably, the percentage of SC population in the state is 31.94%, the highest in the country. The statement said the state government was committed to the socio-economic and educational development of the Scheduled Castes in the state. For the development of the SCs, various schemes under the SCSP were being implemented by the different departments, it said.MINISTERS Express solidarity with DGPThe Cabinet also discussed efforts by the BJP to politicise the episode of protesters blocking the route of PM’s convoy on Wednesday. The entire Cabinet expressed solidarity with DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyaya who was called to brief the Council of Ministers about the incident.

It is learnt that majority of the residents are disgruntled mainly due to the environmental hazards caused by the “chotti nadi” that passes through the area. Nadi, a rain water rivulet, has virtually turned into a sewage drain over the years. It, in fact, passes through around 35 residential colonies of the constituency and has affected most of the area. However, a transformation project of the rivulet is already on, but the residents are not happy with the pace of work and blame the current dispensation for not completing the project in time.Jasvir Singh, vice-president, Old Bishan Nagar Sudhar committee, said: “We thought that work on the transformation project would be completed in time, but it didn’t. We continue to face health issues due to Chotti Nadi.” It is learnt that widening of roads has also been a major demand here. Demanding that the Patiala-Sirhind road should immediately be four-laned, residents say narrow roads are the major cause of road accidents in the area.Past trendCabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra is serving a second successive term as MLA from the constituency.

Residents are not getting vaccinated, while sampling has also gone down as neither the protesting employees are working nor are they allowing others to work.Doctors alleged that they tried to resume vaccination and sampling, but the protesting employees had been creating problems. All NHM employees, including computer operators, information assistants, pharmacists, staff nurses, multipurpose health workers, lab technicians, staff posted in operation theatres, etc., have been on strike for two months. They are demanding regularisation of services.“We know patients are suffering, but the government has been unjust. We are working on meagre salaries for 15 years.

Physical hearing will be allowed only in a limited category of cases.Curbs on entryOnly fully vaccinated people would be allowed to enter the court complex. Action would be initiated against those roaming without masks. Individuals carrying certificates issued by their counsels regarding their “required presence” would be allowed to enter. “The court should not insist on personal appearance of the complainants in routine cases, rather the personal appearance of the complainant should be insisted upon if he is supposed to make statement before the court,” it said.The readers have also been directed to furnish list of witnesses supposed to appear in the court before the date.Amritsar District and Sessions Judge Harpreet Kaur also came out with a new roster for all judicial officers in the district courts and sub-divisional courts at Ajnala and Baba Bakala. Only 50 per cent of the judges would be available for physical hearing, while the remaining would work from home. Most of the cases would be adjourned to suitable dates. Urgent matters, to be heard by judicial officer working from home, would be taken up the next day. The judicial officers have also been asked to depute 50 per cent staff to ensure smooth working.Issuing directions to ensure safety of judicial officials, lawyers, staff and litigants, Jalandhar District and Sessions Judge Rupinderjit Chahal specified 18 types of case to be taken during restrictive functioning. These include bail applications, protection petitions, custody cases, excise, gambling, stay matters, time-bound civil and criminal cases. The filing of fresh cases would be permitted from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm. To prevent overcrowding, videoconferencing mode would be preferred wherever possible, especially for the undertrials.

So far, there is no stay on his arrest. An MLA and former minister in the Akali government, Majithia was apprehending arrest after a case under the NDPS Act was registered in Mohali on December 20. He moved the High Court after a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition.Majithia was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and RS Cheema with counsel DS Sobti and Arshdeep Singh Cheema. Appearing on his behalf, the senior counsel “vehemently” argued that there was inexplicable delay in lodging the FIR. Besides, the FIR itself could not have been lodged as it was incumbent upon the authorities to firstly seek the competent court’s permission before proceeding against him if any material had indeed surfaced against him, he contended.The senior counsel also referred to orders passed by a Division Bench during the hearing of a writ petition on the drugs issue to submit that the matter was being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate, a Special Task Force and a committee constituted under orders of the court. But no action was taken against the petitioner for all these “long” years.The Bench was also told that the registration of the present FIR was “vitiated by political and ulterior motives and the petitioner had no criminal record”. — TNSHave evidence: GovtSpecific, sufficient and clear-cut material to connect Majithia with offences.

The blockade started at 10.30 am after they were stopped by the police from marching towards the DC office in Ferozepur. However, these protesters claimed that they did not know that the PM was stalled on the route till the news went viral after the PM had left.Carrying green and red flags, they continued to raise slogans against Modi.It may be mentioned that several farmer unions, including the BKU (Ugrahan), BKU (Dakaunda) and the Kirti Kisan Union, had been protesting across the state against the visit for the past three days.“The protesters, led by BKU (Krantikari) and some members of our union, Krantikari Kisan Union, did not believe the police when they urged them to lift the blockade, saying that PM Modi’s cavalcade was not getting the right of way to reach Ferozepur. The decision to hold protests across Punjab, with maximum concentration in Ferozepur was taken by 10 unions, including BKU (Ugrahan), in a joint meeting held at Barnala on December 31,” Darshan Pal, president, Krantikari Kisan Union, told The Tribune.As the protesters realised that they had actually stalled PM Modi’s Ferozepur rally, Baldev Singh Zira, general secretary of BKU (Krantikari), addressed the protesters and claimed that the farmers had taught “arrogant Modi” a lesson. “He had placed spikes on the borders of Delhi to prevent your march, you have now forced him to retreat,” he told them.Avtar Mehma, press secretary, Krantikari Kisan Union, said during the meeting of farm unions on December 31, a decision to hold protests during the PM’s visit was taken.Ultra-left unionThe BKU (Krantikari) is believed to be an ultra-Left farmers’ union. Though a part of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, it had recently chosen not to be a part of Sanyukt Samaj Morcha — the political formation of farmers’ unions.

The state leadership had allocated buses to each office-bearer of the party. Some constituencies were allocated about 60 buses.From 3,200 buses to just 500However, sensing lukewarm response ahead of the PM’s rally, the party started reducing the number of buses that were to be pressed into service — so much so that the parking arrangement at the rally venue was reduced to just 500 buses.Farmers’ organisations had been preparing for a stiff opposition for several days. They made announcements from village gurdwaras, asking people not to attend the rally. The cold wave and showers added to the BJP’s woes.As a result, the tepid response was all too visible on Wednesday morning. The party could not gather enough numbers to fill the buses to their optimum capacity. “Even party leaders could not get much help from labour chowks,” said a senior leader of the BJP’s kisan morcha.The BJP claimed the buses were stopped from reaching the venue. Sources, however, say the buses were indeed stopped, but the number was nowhere near the party’s claim of 3,000 buses.Of the 65,000 chairs arranged for the rally, 30,000 were put upside down. Around 5,000 chairs were occupied. The cancelled rally has allowed sidelined leaders to question the main organisers of the rally and the party for giving undue importance to turncoats. BJP general secretary Jiwan Gupta, who was the incharge of the rally, could not be contacted in spite of repeated attempts.Last week, state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma had claimed in a press conference that the party would gather five lakh people for the rally and it would be one of the biggest rallies in the Punjab’s history.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/5-000-turn-up-at-pms-rally-venue-358508

Security officials say that probably for the first time, a 140-km road stretch was marked as the “contingency route” for the Prime Minister and his entourage.As per schedule, PM Modi landed at the Bhisiana Air Force Station at 10.25 am. He was supposed to fly in a helicopter to Ferozepur, but for the bad weather, the PM’s cavalcade took the road (contingency plan) around 11.15 am.It was well reported in the media that several groups of farmers were protesting in and around Ferozepur.Sources say the Punjab Police had deployed more than 2,000 personnel on the contingency route, while national security agencies were deputed for the land and air surveillance.Notably, the entire route was within the 50-km radius of the International Border. This means that it fell in the jurisdiction of the BSF, as per a recent order of the central government.Inquiries made by The Tribune revealed that senior Bathinda police officials led PM Modi’s cavalcade from the Bhisiana airport to their area. Officials of Faridkot and Moga districts followed the same protocol. The PM’s entourage traversed 130 km without encountering any problem. The alleged security breach took place about 10 km short of Modi’s destination at Piarena village. It was 1.30 pm then.The BKU (Krantikari) was already camping on the elevated part on the national highway and had blocked one part of the road. Neither Punjab nor central security agencies could pre-empt the trouble at this spot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2-000-cops-deployed-on-contigency-route-358509

He said it was because of the heavy rain and poor visibility that the plan was changed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fix-responsibility-for-breach-bjp-358511

06-01-2022||---||No security lapse, PM Modi's route was changed at last minute: Punjab CM||Chandigarh, January 5Denying any security lapse or attempt to attack PM Narendra Modi, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi today said it was wrong to give a political colour to the incident by linking a peaceful protest by farmers with threat to PM’s security.Also read:5,000 turn up at PM Narendra Modi’s Ferozepur rally venuePM Modi cancels Ferozepur rally as farmers block flyover; Centre claims security breachDeliberate bid to physically harm PM, alleges BJPIt was unfortunate that PM’s convoy was stuck on a flyover for nearly 20 minutes after some protesters (yet to be identified) suddenly blocked road leading to Ferozepur, he said during a press conference.“Still, if anyone feels there is a security lapse, we are ready for any probe,” he said while rushing to add that the road on which the protesters were sitting was not on the route plan of the PM’s convoy.The CM ducked questions over the state DGP giving road clearance, saying everything was planned in consultation with the PM’s security agencies. “He said he regretted that the PM had to return. We have full respect for the PM, but it was wrong to give a political colour to the incident. The farmers had been sitting on Delhi’s borders for a year, nothing happened. If there is any threat to the PM, I will be the first one to give my blood. A Punjabi will never attack any guest,” he said.The plan of PM’s travel by road was shared at the last moment. “We were told that the PM would travel by a helicopter from Bathinda to Ferozepur. But all of sudden, the PM decided to travel by road,” he said.The CM said after receiving a call from Union Home Minister Amit Shah, he personally intervened and successfully convinced the farmers to lift dharnas on roads leading to the venue of BJP rally. All roads leading to the rally venue were cleared last night. Some agitators, however, reached there and sat on the road. The PM’s convoy was stopped way before that spot.“To lift any protest it takes at least 10-20 minutes. The PM was informed about it and also offered a different route, but he chose to leave,” Channi said.“I did not go to receive the PM today as I was in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.Security protocol3-tier security for PMTwo dummy cars||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-lapse-route-was-changed-at-last-minute-punjab-cm-358561

Repeated rejections by the people have taken them to the path of insanity. The topmost echelons of the Congress owe an apology to the people of India.” “Such dereliction of security procedure during the PM’s visit is totally unacceptable and accountability will be fixed,” he added. The PM reportedly landed in Bathinda this morning from where he had to go to the National Martyrs Memorial at Hussainiwala by helicopter. As his helicopter could not take off due to inclement weather, he started his journey to Ferozepur by road. When the PM’s convoy reached near Piareana village, where Ferozepur DIG Inderbir Singh and SSP Harmandeep Singh Hans were present to receive him, around 200 protesters blocked the road following which the PM’s cavalcade remained halted there for 15-20 minutes.Meanwhile, announcements were made from a nearby gurdwara due to which more farmers reached the spot and the situation turned tense. SPG sleuths then decided to take the PM back to Bathinda as they feared he might get trapped if the protesters blocked the other side of flyover also.Later, the Prime Minister went back to Bathinda and from there to Delhi.Talking to The Tribune, DIG Inderbir Singh said it was like a flashmob of around 100 farmers that suddenly arrived at the spot and blocked the road.Demanding CM Channi’s resignation over the issue, state BJP chief Ashwani Sharma said, “Buses carrying BJP workers were halted at Harike Pattan, Moga, Tarn Taran, Abohar, Malout, Kotkapura. Party workers were also attacked at some places in the presence of police officials.”The Ministry of Home Affairs said the PM’s schedule and travel plan were communicated well in advance to the Punjab Government and as per procedure, they had to make necessary arrangements for logistics, security as well as keep a contingency plan ready. According to the laid-down procedure, an alternative route was to be kept ready for which clearance of roads and deployment of security personnel needed to be ensured by the state government, an official said.How the events unfoldedWe did it, claims BKU-KrantikariAgainst PunjabiatWhat has happened today is not acceptable.

JP Nadda, BJP president, claimed that fearing a resounding defeat in the Assembly elections, the Congress government in Punjab had resorted to all possible tricks to “scuttle” Modi’s programme in the state. He accused CM Channi of “refusing to come on the phone to address the matter”.He also accused the Punjab Government of using the police to prevent people from attending the PM’s Ferozepur rally. “A large number of buses were stranded because of the high-handedness of the police and its connivance with the protesters. It’s sad that the PM’s visit to launch projects worth thousands of crores was disrupted.

06-01-2022||Mumbai||Bulli Bai app probe: Sikh names were used to mislead, say Mumbai Police||The persons involved in the promotion of the ‘Bulli Bai' app targeting Muslim women used names related to the Sikh community in Twitter handles in an attempt to mislead, Mumbai Police said on Wednesday.This could have led to communal tension which the prompt arrests of three accused averted, the police said in a release.Earlier, Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale had told reporters that police were probing why such aliases were used. "Names related to the Sikh community were used to make it look like these Twitter handles had been created by persons from that community," the police release issued in the evening said.The women who were targeted were Muslim, so there was a possibility that it could have created "enmity between two communities" and led to "breach of public peace", it said."As the accused were arrested in time", this was avoided, the police said.The app, hosted on the GitHub platform, displayed photographs of women for "virtual auction", the release said, pointing out that this was similar to the Sullideals app case which had surfaced six months ago.   The accused shared photos from the Bulli Bai app on Twitter by using handles like @bullibai_, @sage0x11, @jatkhalsa7, @wannabesigmaf, @jatkhalsa and @Sikh_khalsa11.The information on the Twitter handle of the app claimed that its creator was "KSF Khalsa Sikh Force", while another Twitter handle, "Khalsa Supremacist", was its follower, the release said.During the technical analysis, police found the involvement of Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a second year civil engineering student of Dayanand Sagar College of engineering, Bengaluru, it said.The ‘Khalsa Supremacist' handle, allegedly used by Jha, mentioned the user's location as Canada, the release said.He also ran a YouTube channel called "Tavasya Vats".Police recovered a mobile phone, two SIM cards and a laptop from him.A senior police official told PTI that the Twitter handle of the app was created by ‘prime accused' Shweta Singh (18) who was arrested from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand.She had passed her Class 12 exam in the science stream and was preparing for joining an engineering course, he said.Mayank Rawal (21), the third accused, was also an engineering student, police said.

Khanna||Members of BKU-Krantikari responsible for stalling PM Modi's cavalcade in Ferozepur||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 5.Members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) were responsible for stalling the cavalcade of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Piareana village of Ferozepur on Wednesday.A group of farmers, owing allegiance to BKU-Krantikari, had blocked the elevated road near Piareana village, in protest against Prime Minister’s visit to Punjab today. The blockade was started at 10.30 am, after they were stopped by the police from marching towards the DC office in Ferozepur.Also read: PM Modi cancels Ferozepur visit after farmers block roadsMHA takes cognisance of ‘security breach’ during PM’s Punjab visit, seeks report from Channi Govt Punjab CM Channi terms 'security breach' incident unfortunate, blames PM Modi's 'change of plan'BJP, SAD, Capt Amarinder slam Punjab govt for PM Modi's 'security breach'No security breach in PM Modi’s convoy, BJP should introspect its ‘anti-farmer attitude’: SurjewalaThe protesting farmers claim that they did not know that PM Modi was stalled on this route till the news went viral after the PM had left. Carrying green and red flags, they continued to raise slogans against Modi and demanded legal guarantee for MSP, punishment for the perpetrators of Lakhimpur Kheri violence and withdrawal of cases registered against farmers during their struggle.It may be mentioned that several farmer unions, including BKU Ugrahan, BKU Dakaunda and Kirti Kisan Union, have been protesting across the state against PM Modi’s visit for the past three days. Effigies of the PM were burnt in villages and the farmer unions also stopped buses in different parts of the state, carrying people to the rally site in Ferozepur.“The protestors, led by BKU-Krantikari and some members of our union, Krantikari Kisan Union, did not believe the local police when they urged them to lift the blockade, saying that PM Modi’s cavalcade was not getting the right of way to reach Ferozepur. The decision to hold protests across Punjab, with maximum concentration in Ferozepur was taken by 10 unions, including BKU Ugrahan, in a joint meeting held at Barnala on December 31,” Dr Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union said.As the protester realised that they had actually stalled PM Modi’s Ferozepur rally, Baldev Singh Zira, general secretary of BKU (Krantikari) addressed the protesters and claimed that the farmers have taught “arrogant Modi” a lesson. “Usne tuhade raste vich kil paye si, aj tuhadi taakat ne Modi nu bhaja ta ethon (He had place spikes on the borders of Delhi to prevent your march, you have now forced him to retreat),” he told the gathering after the cavalcade of the PM turned away.It may be mentioned that BKU-Krantikari is believed to be an ultra left farmer union. Though a part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, they had recently chosen not to be a part of the Sanyukt Samaj Morcha—the political formation of farmer unions. In 2009, president of the union Surjit Phul was arrested and remained lodged in jail for five months after being booked under different Sections of the UAPA. He was arrested for allegedly having links with Maoist organisations. Avtar Mehma, press secretary of the Krantikari Kisan Union, said that during the meeting of kisan unions at Barnala on December 31, a decision to hold massive protests during the PM’s visit was taken. “Each organisation was to protest at different sites in a village based on their strength. The BKU-Krantikari was protesting at Piareana village, since they had maximum supporters in this area,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bku-krantikari-claims-responsibility-for-stalling-pm-modis-cavalcade-in-ferozepur-358443

So far there is no stay on his arrest.Taking up the matter, Justice Lisa Gill of the high court also fixed the case for further hearing on Monday, when the State will file a reply to the contentions raised by Majithia in his plea. The MLA and former minister in the Akali government was apprehending arrest after a case under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered at Mohali on December 20.He moved the high court after a Mohali Court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition. Majithia was represented by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and RS Cheema, with counsel DS Sobti and Arshdeep Singh Cheema. The state was represented by senior advocate P Chidambaram.Among other things, Majithia contended: “To target the petitioner is one of the major election planks of the current government. To fulfill its election stunt, the Congress government in Punjab has been day and night browbeating officers to register false cases against the senior leadership of SAD, including the petitioner”.He claimed witch-hunting of political opponents was at its peak in the run-up to the polls and the Congress government in Punjab had changed three DGPs over a span of three months. The bureau of investigation also saw the change of three directors.The petition added that police officers were forced and coerced to falsely implicate the petitioner or face transfers, charge sheets, and dire consequences. “(DGP) Chattopadhyaya also has a long-standing personal animosity with the SAD leadership and has been appointed, as is well known, to please the Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, the arch-rival of the petitioner,” the petition added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bikram-singh-majithia-bail-punjab-hc-issues-notice-to-punjab-no-stay-on-arrest-yet-358390
