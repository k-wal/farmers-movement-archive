He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In charge of Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far away from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.शिक्षा, चिकित्सा और समाजसेवा के क्षेत्र में उल्लेखनीय योगदान करने वाले श्री इक़बाल सिंह जी के निधन से बहुत दुःख हुआ। उनकी सेवाओं के सम्मान स्वरूप, उन्हें वर्ष 2022 में पद्मश्री के लिए चुना गया। उनके परिवार व प्रशंसकों के प्रति मेरी गहन शोक-संवेदनाएं।  With only five students in a one-room school called ‘Akal Academy' at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the building and managed the school for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.Pained by the passing away of Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. He will be remembered for his efforts to increase education among youngsters. He tirelessly worked towards furthering social empowerment. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this sad hour. May Waheguru bless his soul.  However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993. By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.Deeply saddened to know about the demise of Shiromani Panth Rattan Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. The spiritual leader was recently honored with Padma Shri for his exemplary social work. May Guru Sahib grant peace to the departed soul. My condolences & concerns for his family & followers. pic.twitter.com/luVFxYLEzJ  As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector, he was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care including free surgeries to poor people.Deeply saddened by the demise of social worker & philanthropist Shiromani Panth Rattan, Sardar Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. Conferred with Padma Shri this year, Babaji was admired & respected for his efforts towards sewa of humanity. pic.twitter.com/urzSP9nWTc  Under a women empowerment programme, underprivileged young women are rehabilitated by way of education and jobs.                                     #BabaIqbalSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/renowned-social-worker-and-padma-shri-awardee-baba-iqbal-singh-passes-away-at-96-in-baru-sahib-365340

29-01-2022||Jalandhar||AAP would take 'decisive action' against Bikram Singh Majithia voted into power, says Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party’s national convenor Arvind Kejriwal said his government would take “decisive action” against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, who’s being investigated in drug cases in Punjab.“What has the current government done to put him (Majithia) behind bars,” Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal asked. Mathia has maintained his innocence in the drug cases, but his anticipatory bail application was recently rejected by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Kejriwal, who is in Punjab campaigning for assembly elections next month, said his Delhi government had “neither the judiciary nor police” under them and therefore had no role to play in the release of Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar,.Bhullar is a prisoner whose release has recently become a topic of debate. He was convicted and sentenced to death for his involvement in the 1993 Delhi bomb blasts case and has been in prison since 1994. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2015. AAP’s chief minister candidate Bhagwant Mann was quoted as having claimed that Bhullar’s file for permanent release was with the Delhi Lieutenant Governor but he is recently quoted as having said that the Delhi government would decide “once the legal process gets over”.                                     #AAP                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #BikramSinghMajithia                                     #Punjabpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-would-take-decisive-action-against-bikram-singh-majithia-voted-into-power-says-kejriwal-365291

When the woman refused to meet his demands, the accused allegedly circulated her video on social media after which the police complaint was lodged,” SHO Singh said.                                     #Hoshiarpur                                     #rape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/man-rapes-18-year-old-in-hoshairpur-circulates-obscene-video-on-social-media-365285

Fight! Do you have the guts?”Hitting out at the Akalis, who have fielded Majithia from his constituency, Sidhu said, "They have come only to play the spoilsport. But in this 'Dharam Yudh', they will not succeed because where there is 'Dharma' there is victory.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-files-nomination-from-amritsar-east-dares-bikram-majithia-to-fight-only-from-this-seat-365281
29-01-2022||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu and company will have to pay for false case against Bikram Majithia, says Sukhbir Badal||SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal has said that Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and the police officers who had “conspired to falsely implicate” Bikram Singh Majithia, besides other Akali workers during the Congress government, will have to pay back, including dismissal from service, when the SAD returned to power.Badal spoke to Tribune correspondents Sanjeev Singh Bariana and Jupinderjit Singh.From the scenario of a three-cornered election contest in Punjab last time, it is five-cornered now. Will it not be confusing for the voters? This is a new phenomenon. People are definitely confused. A person today joins a new party and within days shifts to another.After announcing a 13-point development programme last August, the SAD seems to be forgetting public issues and once again is raking up the issue of drugs after the name of Bikram Majithia had cropped up. Where have the issues concerning public welfare gone? Congress in the last five years has done nothing except rake up the issues of drugs and sacrilege. They want to hide their failure. They don’t mention that they promised ‘ghar ghar naukri’ or mobile phones or the debt waiver to farmers and delivered nothing. They want to divert public attention. People know that they are lying. We have always kept welfare of people as our top priority. We need to talk on the Majithia issue because this is a false case. We have to defend him because he is innocent. In routine, we engage with our people to know what they want. We work for their welfare.   Why is SAD making Majithia contest from two seats, especially from the seat of Navjot Sidhu in Amritsar East?Navjot Sidhu has gone overboard in his arrogance. He thinks he is the biggest. He has been accusing Majithia of wrongdoings without an iota of truth. So we decided that we will fight him. Let people of his constituency decide who is right. What is wrong in registering the case against Majithia in wake of serious allegations?Registering a false case is a crime. The government changed two DGPs and two Bureau of Investigation chiefs. They ignored written orders. I am not talking about Bikram’s case alone. There are a number of cases in which the innocent have been framed. In Punjab, the Congress leadership has ruined the lives of many common people by registering false cases. So Sidhu will have to pay if you return to power?Obviously, we will have a commission of inquiry and the police officers who were part of the conspiracy against Majithia would face dismissal from service. We have to set an example. Unless that happens, the system will continue to rot. We will dismiss all found guilty, be it 10 or 20 or 30 or 100 or even 200. We will ensure nobody registers a false case in future. Chief Minister Charanjit Channi and Home Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa also made accusations against Majithia. But you have chosen to field Majithia only against Sidhu.Channi is just a pawn. He made noise only to make his own presence felt when he saw someone else was gaining prominence. Sidhu has been boasting that he directed the police to register the case. He also said that he was telling the CM to do that. Who would you prefer to see as the CM face of the Congress - Sidhu or Channi?It does not make a difference to us. We will beat both. They are number three in the race at the moment. Congress will not be able to cross 15 seats. In fact, the number 2 position is a close fight between AAP and Congress. The number for both will be anywhere between 10 and 15 seats. AAP has no credibility now. They have projected Bhagwant Mann as the CM face but actually the image is a mirage. Look at the new posters. Kejriwal is omnipresent. Why Kejriwal? I have never seen Congress saying ‘Rahul Gandhi ko mauka do’. Bhagwant Mann is the dummy face and I can give you in writing that if by chance they get a majority, Kejriwal will organise another bogus voting to get himself in the CM chair.Parties are still promising freebies to their voters. You also promised 400 units of free power. Don’t you think that the state is already in a bad financial situation?  Don’t look at debt as a burden. Compare debt with GDP of the state. Look at the huge debt Ambani has. But he commands the most powerful company. Debt is used for business and even to expand. Using debt in infrastructure and economy gives a financial boost and increases the revenue. In one example, I say that tapping solar power is the way ahead. I have a plan to set up a 15,000 MW solar plant which will make us self-sufficient. We will be able to pay off the entire power debt within a few years. The SAD is said to be the original party of the farmers. During the year-long farmer protests it seemed that a sizeable number of farmers don’t trust you any longer. What do you say?This category of protesters are leftist labour unions, not farmers. Most of them are associated with the CPI and CPM. These parties were controlling the agitation. These unions will not make any difference. Our cadre consists of real farmers. They are with us.A large number of private institutes in the field of education in the state have failed to live up to expectations. Colleges are empty and students are shifting abroad in big numbers. How do you see the situation and what do you see in future? Punjabis by nature cannot be tied down. They always move to greener pastures. It is sad that many of them are doing nothing more than mopping floors abroad. We will educate them before they go so that they are better placed. We have envisaged a Student Card Scheme. Our kids will be able to study anywhere they want in the world. They will be given an interest-free loan. Working out the merit of the case, the state will ensure the movement of all the deserving cases. Last time we worked on improving the roads and the power sector and the results on ground show that we were successful. This time we will work on improving education and health sectors.What is your reaction to different poll survey reports on Punjab elections which don’t place SAD comfortably?These are paid surveys. The Delhi government funds are being used for elections of Punjab by the AAP to manage poll surveys. The party is paying channels to carry advertisements asking them to do surveys in their favour in return. Last time they did the same. One survey had given them 100 seats and they got only about 20. One of the public perceptions doing the rounds is that no party will get a majority in Punjab. There will be possible tie-ups among them after elections. One perception holds that SAD will tie up with the BJP.The BJP will get zero seats so why would we tie-up with zero. They might at best get one or two. Last time, it was three-cornered so people thought there would be a hung assembly. The Congress won with a big majority. This time, with five-sided contest we are very sure it will not be a hung assembly. We will win because our workers are committed. Are these elections different from the earlier ones?This time the elections are very frustrating. We are not meeting people. There is no election mood. Neither people nor politicians are enjoying it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-and-company-will-have-to-pay-for-false-case-against-majithia-sukhbir-365277

Real photos are certified by the family of Bhagat Singh,” Chaman Lal wrote in a letter addressed to Kejriwal.Lal, who is Honorary Advisor, Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre, Delhi, wrote that sometimes the Centre and Punjab government have been found using painting-based unreal pictures of Bhagat Singh in advertisements, which always has been objected to by the Bhagat Singh’s family and scholars of freedom struggle.“Unreal photograph of no other freedom fighter or national icon such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Subhas Bose or Ambedkar is used for official purpose. This injustice is done only to Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh and Kartar Singh Sarabha,” Chaman Lal wrote.Lal said that while implementing the laudable decision the Delhi government can also undo the injustice done by the central and many state governments to Bhagat Singh by using his wrong, faulty, unreal and painting-based portraits in advertisements. The Delhi government has already set up Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre and picture of Bhagat Singh can be arranged from the archives.Lal also requested Kejriwal that out of three new universities set up by the Delhi government one may be named after Bhagat Singh. “I suggest that Teachers Training University may be named after Bhagat Singh. Delhi already has universities named after Ambedkar and Netaji Subhas Bose. It will be appropriate to have a university named after Bhagat Singh. Delhi can become the first state to name a university after Bhagat Singh,” Lal wrote in his letter to the Delhi CM.                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #BhagatSingh                                     #BRAmbedkar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/avoid-unreal-photographs-of-bhagat-singh-in-offices-scholar-tells-kejriwal-365245

Often asked to sing a few lines from his hit songs, he readily obliges.Will ensure jobs for youthOn being elected MLA of the ruling party, I will be able to bring development projects to my constituency and help generate jobs for the youth. Sidhu Moosewala, Mansa candidateA greenhorn in politics, he is invariably seen in jeans and a black jacket at public meetings. What stands out is the 'tilak' on his forehead. Such symbolism matters in the constituency which is dominated by Hindu voters, mostly from the Bania community.“I have joined politics not for status or fame. I want to be a part of the system to bring about change. I want to be the voice of the people,” he says. Pitted against Dr Vijay Singla of the Aam Aadmi Party and SAD’s Prem Arora, the singer has launched an exhaustive campaign, including on social media. His digital team regularly uploads pictures of his door-to-door campaign and other events on his Facebook page, “Mansa da Sidhu.”Appealing for votes, he claims: “The Congress will return to power in the state. On being elected as MLA of the ruling party, I will be able to bring development projects to my constituency and help generate jobs for the youth. I was raised in Mansa, and I want to work for its betterment.”Taking a dig at AAP, he reminds the people: “After the elections last time, almost half of the AAP legislators joined the Congress. You must make an informed choice."

29-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Navjot Sidhu targeted, day after Rahul Gandhi visit||Chandigarh, January 28A day after party leader Rahul Gandhi said the chief ministerial face of the party will be announced ahead of the February 20 Assembly elections, the churn has begun.Don’t know her: WifeMy father-in-law had married twice, and Suman Toor was one of the two daughters from his first marriage. I don’t know her. I have never met or spoken to her. — Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu, PCC Chief’s WifeActivities have gained momentum in the party on the selection of the CM face, with both Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu camps pulling out all the stops as the party takes fresh feedback from leaders and party workers in all constituencies.Though both leaders have committed before Rahul they will abide by the decision of the party high command to name the CM face, the internal wrangling within the party seems to be getting bitter and personal. The timing of a press conference on Friday by Suman Toor, ‘sister’ of the PCC chief from the US, in which she accused Sidhu of abandoning their elderly mother after the death of their father in 1986 and her death as a “destitute” woman at the Delhi railway station in 1989, is being seen in political circles as part of efforts to contain the Amritsar East MLA, who is battling his detractors both within the party and outside the Congress, particularly the AAP, SAD and Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) led by Capt Amarinder Singh.While Akali leader Bikram Majithia is contesting against Sidhu from the constituency, the PLC chief has already announced he won’t let Sidhu win. A senior party leader said the timing of Toor’s allegations is as suspect as that of ED raid on Channi’s nephew. “Earlier, Channi’s detractors used the ED raid on his nephew to tarnish the former’s image as he was going up on the popularity charts.

Asserting that the alliance of the BSP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) would form the next government with a clear majority in Punjab, party’s state president Jasveer Garhi on Friday said Mayawati would kick off the campaign from February 8 with a massive rally in Nawanshahr.He said Punjab had a special place in the heart of the BSP supremo as late Kanshi Ram, the founder of the party, belonged to the state.Targeting the ruling Congress, the state president said: “The grand old party will be wiped out from the this time. The SAD-BSP alliance will rid the state of the Congress misrule and usher in good governance and fulfil people’s aspirations.”                                     #BSP                                     #Mayawati                                     #Nawanshahr||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/maya-to-address-nawanshahr-rally-on-feb-8-365053
29-01-2022||---||Kejriwal's diktat: Only locals to lead campaign||New Delhi/Jalandhar, Jan 28As part of AAP’s strategy to consolidate election campaigns in poll-bound Punjab and other states, party’s national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has directed that only local leaders should lead the campaign in their respective areas. This measure comes on the back of fresh assessment by poll managers of the party this week about approach and progress of its election campaigns.Wary of 2017 poll outcomeIn effect, the diktat forbids senior leaders and activists from outside who take part in the election campaigns from taking the centre stage in any manner. The directive expressly is to leaders from outside the state concerned to avoid making statements or views to media.A source in the AAP said the measure is to dispel any impression among voters that leaders from outside in the poll-bound state were trying to influence the elections.The view in AAP circles is that the party had to pay the price in the last Assembly elections in Punjab, even though it was in a good position, owing to this factor.The party had fallen short to rectify the impression among people of the state that the party was not in sync with local issues.The wide-ranging view in the AAP is that the opponents in Punjab were successful in creating distrust among the populace about the intentions of the party, which it could not counter.Hence, the party took a corrective measure by declaring Bhagwant Singh Mann as the chief ministerial face. Sources say the AAP in all probability will activate its supporters-residents in Delhi to canvass with their relatives and friends in Punjab to vote for the party.Meanwhile in Jalandhar, promising an honest government, the AAP supremo today said there had been no justice in sacrilege or drugs cases in Punjab so far as “everyone” is involved in protecting the culprits.Targeting CM Charanjit Channi and SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, Kejriwal while addressing a gathering at the townhall in Adampur termed the recent FIR against the Akali leader a sham and asked people whether those facing charges of sand mining and drugs could protect the state. “People should rather opt for the AAP’s ‘kattar imandaar sarkar’ (fiercely honest government),” he said.Earlier, addressing a meeting at Phillaur, Kejriwal said: “Have any of those committing sacrilege incidents been punished? Why? Because the perpetrators and masterminds are all together. Had those behind the Bargari incident been punished, no one would have dared to commit sacrilege at Darbar Sahib. If the AAP government comes to power, it will ensure strict punishment to culprits so that there is no repeat of such incidents.”Kejriwal took a pointed dig at Majithia and Channi, alleging: “Drugs are being sold openly as governments side with those behind it. They enact a drama. Channi is boasting about an FIR having been lodged. The FIR is part of the drama. Did you catch him? They are all in this together.” “If our government comes to power, this entire network of suppliers will be busted,” he claimed.                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #PunjabAAP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kejriwals-diktat-only-locals-to-lead-campaign-365055

29-01-2022||Ruchika M Khanna||Balbir Singh Rajewal: Will 'restore' power to Punjab people||Chandigarh, January 28The Sanyukt Samaj Morcha (SSM) is seeking public mandate for the February 20 elections on the promise of strengthening the healthcare and education sectors and ending the “mafia raj” in sand mining, liquor, transport and cable business,.Breakaway groups to come togetherPolicymakers for key sectorsAs education, employment generation and healthcare can’t be left largely to private sector, the SSM will appoint three policymaking experts on each sector, if voted to power. — Balbir Singh Rajewal, SSM LeaderClaiming a massive support from farmers, traders and other civil society groups, the SSM says they alone pose a real challenge to the traditional political parties — Congress, Akali Dal and BJP-led alliance. Accusing the Aam Aadmi Party of succumbing to the tactics followed by other traditional parties, the SSM claims in such a political scenario, they alone can offer an alternative form of governance.Talking to The Tribune here today, Balbir Singh Rajewal, chief ministerial candidate of the SSM, said it was this (political) uniqueness of the morcha that was driving other traditional parties to put pressure on the Election Commission, which is unwilling to either register their political party or grant a common symbol to their candidates. The morcha has already declared 115 candidates for the 117 Assembly segments.“People got a sample of our governance model during our year-long struggle, wherein all that the morcha leaders said and dictated, after due consultations, was followed in letter and spirit. There were no divisive factors at play, and we all fought and won the battle for a common cause in a disciplined and democratic manner,” he told The Tribune.“Similarly, we are promising to fight for the common cause of alleviating the suffering of people and bringing the lost glory back to Punjab. For this, we will remove the mafia-like hold of the political class on sand mining, liquor, transport and cable businesses. The political class — with varying percentages of profit, depending on who is at the helm — is pocketing roughly Rs 1 lakh crore through their involvement in these four businesses alone, with maximum amount being pocketed in liquor business (Rs 55,000-Rs 60,000 crore per annum), followed by sand mining business (Rs 25,000 cr per annum).“Add to this, the corruption in administration, where posts in major public-dealing offices are ‘auctioned to highest bidding official’, who then extracts this back from the common man,” alleged Rajewal, claiming they planned to restore power to the people and fill the near-empty coffers of the state.Reiterating that the three major lessons in policymaking and governance learnt during the course of the pandemic were that education, healthcare and employment generation could not be left largely to the private sector, the farm union leader said they would appoint three policymaking experts on each sector, if voted to power, and strengthening the public sector would be their top priority as it would end exploitation of people.“Till the public healthcare strengthens, we promise to bear 50 per cent cost of healthcare in private sector,” he added. Rajewal also said their manifesto would be released shortly, wherein they were promising power to commercial users at the same rate applicable to domestic power consumers. An interest-free, fixed-term loan of Rs 3 lakh would also be provided to all farmer and labourer members of cooperative societies, he added.                                     #Rajewal                                     #SSM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rajewal-will-restore-power-to-people-365064

29-01-2022||---||Faridkot: Post ED raids, sand prices soar 25%||Faridkot, January 28Days after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had raided multiple locations of the companies linked to alleged illegal sand mining in the state; sand prices have registered about 25 per cent hike in the area.Drop in illegal miningAgainst the state government’s fixed price of Rs 5.5 per cubic feet at the sand pits, sand is being sold at Rs 28 to Rs 30 per cubic feet in the retail market here. Before the ED’s raid, sand was being sold at Rs 22 to Rs 24 per cubic feet in the retail market.Claiming the department was strictly enforcing the state government’s instruction regarding the ceiling on sand prices, District Mining Officer (DMO) Rupinder Singh said he had no information regarding the hike in prices of sand. Faridkot Deputy Commissioner Harbir Singh said he would check the retail prices at sand pits and in retail market.According to sources, the hike in prices has been due to fall in the rate of illegal mining and lesser availability of vehicles for transportation of sand. After the ED tightened noose around some persons in the state, many local leaders who were in the business have suspended their work for the past about 10 days. Tippers have been the most common and visible means for sand transportation from the mining pits to the retailers in the past 10 years.It is alleged that several political leaders have links with those in the sand mining and sand transportation business. As they have had almost ‘monopoly’ control on the transportation of the sand from mining pits to the retail market, so the transportation charges were quite high and unreasonable.After the raid at various locations in Punjab about 10 days back, these political leaders have asked their relatives to suspend illegal mining and sand transportation. Thus the raids have led to a shortage of sand in the open market and causing a hike in its price, said a retail dealer in sand in Faridkot. Before theraids, we were getting sand at Rs 45 per quintal and selling it at Rs 55 per quintal but now we are getting for Rs 60 per quintal, said a retailer.The DMO said there was no government approved sand mining site in the district and all sand being sold is brought from the adjoining districts, so he didn’t know the reason behind the hike in sand prices.                                     #ED                                     #IllegalMining||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/post-ed-raids-sand-prices-soar-25-365067

What the people here have gone through in the past is in front of everyone to see. People will punish the Congress as also turncoats who could not bring about development in the city, despite being in the Cabinet for five years,” said Juneja.“I am a common man.

I have devoted my time and energy on visiting residents.”Juneja said he had already completed two rounds of canvassing in the constituency where Capt Amarinder was yet to even make his first visit in years. “I know the battle is tough, but my personal connect with people and the philanthropist work done by my father will be rewarded by people, who are done with dynasty politics,” he said.After filing his nomination papers, Juneja said a divided Congress, following the exodus of many local leaders due to their siding with Capt Amarinder, had left the party vulnerable.                                     #CaptAmarinderSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/juneja-banks-on-personal-connect-365070

29-01-2022||Chandigarh||1.25 lakh posts vacant, Centre doing politics in name of soldiers: Sachin Pilot||Senior Congress leader and former Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot has accused the Narendra Modi government at the Centre of doing politics in the name of soldiers, saying instead of fulfilling the promises made to them, it is working against their interests.Addressing mediapersons after the release of booklet ‘Vote in the name of bravery, hurt the interests of the Army’, Pilot flanked by Congress media incharge Pawan Khera said soldiers fought the enemies on the country’s border, terrorism and separatism within, but it was a pity that the Centre did politics in their name.He alleged the government, which talked of nationalism, hadn’t filled posts of around 1.25 lakh soldiers lying vacant.He said the Congress-led UPA government had implemented the “one rank, one pension” scheme in 2014, but the NDA government, which promised to implement this scheme in Rewari, Haryana, had not yet taken any steps.He also condemned the Centre for reducing the ECHS amount by Rs 2,000. Similarly, the government imposed a 50 per cent GST on products available at the canteen and put a cap on these too, he lamented. —                                     #SachinPilot||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1-25l-posts-vacant-centre-doing-politics-in-name-of-soldiers-pilot-365074

We had asked her to vote through postal ballot from home, but she denied. She has always been motivating others too to exercise their franchise and play their role of a responsible citizen. As to best of my knowledge, she has never missed to cast her vote,” said Salma.Malerkotla Deputy Commissioner Madhavi Kataria said they had launched a special campaign to boost voter turnout. “Navisan is Malerkotla’s oldest voter. With a video of her, we are requesting everyone to use their right to vote.

29-01-2022||Saurabh Malik||Drug menace in Punjab appears to be touching new heights: HC||Chandigarh, January 28While rapping the police for their “callously casual approach” towards official duty in a drugs case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted that drug menace in Punjab appeared to be touching new heights with each passing day.The Bench asserted such conduct was least expected as the officials were duty bound to check the crime graph in the state, especially when drug menace had become deep rooted and was taking its toll like “a slow poison” on the youths.Justice Meenakshi I Mehta also admonished the Punjab Food and Drug Administration for waking up from “deep slumber” only after the Bench took a note of certain facts during the course of hearing. “The conduct on the part of the authorities mentioned is highly deplorable and it speaks volumes of their questionable acts and omissions, which pose a serious challenge for the state in tackling with the drug menace which seems to be touching new heights with every passing day,” Justice Mehta asserted.The matter was brought to Justice Mehta’s notice after bail and other pleas were filed by two accused in a case registered on April 13, 2021, at Rureke Kalan police station in Barnala under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Taking into consideration the facts of the case, Justice Mehta allowed regular bail. Before parting, Justice Mehta asserted the court was constrained to express “deep concern and anguish over the manner in which the authorities concerned dealt with the case at different relevant stages”.Referring to the status reports/replies, Justice Mehta asserted the police officers mentioned different spellings of the tablets allegedly recovered in the case without realising the repercussions and consequent legal implications.This was despite the fact that they were supposed to be well-versed with the same and required to deal with such matters with utmost sincerity and caution. Justice Mehta added it was “unpleasantly surprising” to note that Assistant Commissioner Drugs, FDA, Punjab, issued a letter to a pharmaceutical company for cancelling permission to manufacture formulations containing ‘tramadol hydrochloride’ salt. But FSL reports said tablets with the same brand name — allegedly recovered in the case — contained ‘pregabalin’.Even if the brand name used was taken to be not within the FDA’s domain, the fact remained that the department was supposed to check and supervise the drugs being manufactured in the state to ensure strict compliance of relevant law/rules. “The subsequent use of same brand name by the manufacturer for manufacturing the tablets containing a different salt is likely to lead to grave consequences as the same can result in serious health hazards for the patients as well as the public at large”.                                     #DrugMenace||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/drug-menace-appears-to-be-touching-new-heights-hc-365077

29-01-2022||Saurabh MalikChandigarh||Beant Singh assassination: Punjab and Haryana HC grants parole to Rajaona to attend late father's 'bhog' ceremony||Punjab and Haryana High Court granted parole to death row prisoner Balwant Singh Rajaona on Friday to attend his late father’s “bhog" ceremony.Rajaona, a former Punjab police constable who was sentenced to death on July 27, 2007, for the 1995 assassination of Punjab’s former chief minister Beant Singh, had approached the high court for bail to attend his father’s funeral rites.On Friday, a Bench of Justices Ajay Tewari and Pankaj Jain disposed of his petition with a direction to the authorities to allow him to attend the ceremony with adequate police escort on January 31 from 1 pm to 2 pm.Rajaona, who submitted his petition through counsel Vivek K Thakur, his father was the only one who had been taking care of him and coming to meet him often in the 26 years that he has spent in prison, and that he should be allowed to attend his last rites. That request, however, was rejected on the ground that parole could not be granted to a death row prisoner.Rajaona’s counsel Thakur then argued that the Supreme Court had under similar circumstances granted parole to a death row convict to attend his mother’s last rites with a police escort.Former chief minister Beant Singh was killed in a blast outside the Punjab Civil Secretariat on August 31, 1995. The explosion killed 17 people, including the suicide bomber, Dilawar Singh.                                     #BeantSinghassassination                                     #PunjabHC                                     #Rajaona||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/beant-singh-assassination-punjab-and-haryana-hc-grants-bail-to-rajaona-to-attend-late-fathers-bhog-ceremony-365020
