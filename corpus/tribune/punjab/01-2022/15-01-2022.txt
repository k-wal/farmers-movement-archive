15-01-2022||Saurabh Malik||Give accused choice to furnish surety bonds, FD, electronic money transfer or lien over bank account: HC||Chandigarh, January 15In a significant judgment, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the Court and the “arresting officer” should give a choice to accused granted bail with surety to either furnish surety bonds, handover a fixed deposit, direct electronic money transfer or create a lien over his bank account.Justice Anoop Chitkara also made it clear that the accused should also have a further option to switch between the modes. “The option lies with the accused to choose between the sureties and deposits and not with the Court or the arresting officer,” Justice Chitkara added.The ruling came in a case where a West Bengal resident was seeking suspension of sentence after being awarded 10 years imprisonment and Rs 1 lakh fine following conviction for possessing 220 gram of heroin.Amicus curiae or “friend of the Court” Jasdev Singh Mehndiratta submitted not suspending sentence only because the convict was a native of a distant State would violate Article 21 of the Constitution, which extended to all persons residing anywhere in India and even encompassed a foreigner. He further argued that the Court or the “arresting officer” should give a choice to the accused to either furnish surety bonds or give a fixed deposit, given the advent of online identification.Justice Chitkara added people worldwide were travelling more and more, covering huge distances with exponential growth in technology and the opening up of borders. Persons were living far away from their ancestral places and it exposed them to the risk of being arraigned as accused in locations distant from native places or residence. People also switched over jobs much more frequently, shifted residences overnight, and were frequently on the move.They had started relying on dedicated digital services and platforms run by highly skilled and talented professionals. The dependence of individuals on communities appeared to be decreasing day by day. “The generation ‘Z’ neither would like to stand as someone’s surety nor ask a stranger to stand as their surety. Against this backdrop, the youth neither appears inclined to take favours nor return. Given this, requesting someone to stand as surety might be seeking favours and may not appeal to the younger generation,” Justice Chitkara added.The Bench observed comprehensive data on role of sureties in bringing the accused to justice was absent. Fixed deposit, electronic transfer, or creating a lien over the bank account in place of cash or sureties was likely to improve the possibility of attendance because the accused would be aware that their money was safe and accruing interest. They would also keep in mind that failure to appear would lead to the forfeiture of the money.                                     #PunjabHaryanaHC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/give-accused-choice-to-furnish-surety-bonds-fd-electronic-money-transfer-or-lien-over-bank-account-hc-361570
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Denied ticket by Congress, Moga MLA Harjot Kamal joins BJP||After the Congress denied ticket to him for the upcoming Punjab assembly polls, Moga MLA Harjot Kamal on Saturday joined the BJP here in the presence of its senior leadership, including Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.The Congress on Saturday released its first list of 86 candidates for the February 14 state assembly polls, refusing tickets to four sitting legislators, including Kamal.The ruling party gave a ticket to Malvika Sood Sachar, the sister of actor-philanthropist Sonu Sood, from the Moga assembly seat.“I joined the BJP today,” Kamal said and thanked the party leadership, including president J P Nadda and Shekhawat.Noting that he worked for the Congress for 21 years, the sitting Moga legislator questioned the Congress’s choice of ignoring him and giving Sood the ticket.“What are her qualifications? She is just Sonu Sood’s sister,” Kamal said while slamming Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.He said it was “below the dignity” of their positions to bring Malvika Sood into the party fold. She had joined the Congress on January 10.Kamal had threatened to fight from Moga as an independent if he was not given the ticket, despite Channi promising said that he would be suitably adjusted.Voting for Punjab’s 117 assembly seats will be held on February 14 and the counting of votes will take place on March 10.                                     #MalvikaSood                                     #Moga                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #SonuSood||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-polls-denied-ticket-by-congress-moga-mla-harjot-kamal-joins-bjp-361562
15-01-2022||New Delhi||AAP’s claim stands vindicated: Raghav Chadha after EC relaxes norms for registration of parties||A day after the EC reduced the period for registration of new political parties, the AAP on Saturday said its claim stood vindicated and accused the poll panel of relaxing the norms in the middle of the elections to damage the poll prospects of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party in Punjab “under a conspiracy”.The AAP had on Thursday claimed that the Election Commission (EC) was going to register a new political party by bringing changes in its rules at the behest of the BJP in the middle of elections to stop the party from winning assembly polls in Punjab and forming its government in the state, an allegation the poll panel later dismissed, terming it “factually incorrect”.Addressing a press conference at the party’s headquarters here on Saturday, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha asked the EC and the BJP to disclose the name of the “political morcha” for which the rules were changed “overnight”.The AAP leader, however, refused to name the political party in question, saying it will soon be known to everybody.The EC on Friday announced the reduction of notice period for registration of new political parties in the five poll-going states from 30 days to 7 days, keeping in view difficulties caused by Covid-19-induced curbs.“The Election Commission of India came with a circular on January 14 saying that it has reduced the 30-day notice period to 7 days in view of the political parties facing some difficulties in submitting their registration form and completing other formalities due to Covid-19 pandemic,” Chadha told reporters on Saturday.“With this, the AAP’s prediction, apprehension, suspicion, information has turned into belief,” the AAP leader said, terming the Commission’s notification “documentary evidence” of the claims that AAP had made in this on Thursday.Raising objections to the Election Commission’s decision, Chadha, who is co-in charge of the AAP’s political affairs in Punjab, alleged that the EC has brought in changes in its rules to register a new political party “under a conspiracy” to defeat “the AAP and Arvind Kejriwal’s honest politics” in the assembly polls.“Under a big conspiracy, a new political party is being registered, perhaps to cut the votes of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)... This is our apprehension. It is bothering us,” he said He asked both the poll panel and the BJP to disclose the name of the party for whose registration the rules were relaxed “overnight”.“Who are those political people, political forces who want to see AAP defeated at any cost? I want to ask both the Election Commission and the BJP... People have the right to know in democracy. The Election Commission going to register a new party overnight so that it cuts the AAP’s votes,” he said.Replying to a question on whether the party now plans any legal course of action against the poll panel’s decision, Chadha said that the AAP will take the issue to the people’s court, instead of approaching the court of law.The AAP leader claimed that the EC “never” registered a new political party by bringing changes in its rules “in the middle of elections and after the announcement of the dates of polls”.However, the EC in its statement on Thursday had said that it relaxed the notice period in view of the pandemic during the assembly polls in Bihar, Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Noting that it had recently announced the schedule for assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur on January 8, the poll panel said, “It has been brought to the notice of the commission that in view of prevailing restrictions on account of Covid-19, there was dislocation and delay in moving applications for registration, which in turn led to delay in registration as a political party.”After considering all aspects, the commission has given a relaxation and has reduced the notice period from 30 days to seven days for the parties which have published their public notice on or before January 8.“For all parties, including those parties which have already published the public notice in less than 7 days prior to January 8, objection, if any, can be submitted latest by 5.30 pm on January 21, or by the end of the originally provided 30 days period, whichever is earlier,” the statement added.                                     #AAP                                     #assemblypolls                                     #ElectionCommission                                     #NewParty                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aaps-claim-stands-vindicated-raghav-chadha-after-ec-relaxes-norms-for-registration-of-parties-361545
15-01-2022||Kottayam (Kerala)||Police plan to appeal against Bishop Franco’s acquittal in nun rape case||A day after a Sessions Court here acquitted Roman Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal of the charge of raping a nun in a convent in the State, Kerala police on Saturday sought legal advice to move an appeal against the verdict in the High Court.Kottayam SP D Shilpa told reporters that the police have sought legal opinion from the special public prosecutor to move an appeal against the judgment.“We got the detailed verdict late Friday. We have sought a legal opinion to move the appeal,” she said.Meanwhile, Bishop visited various churches and met former MLA P C George, who had been backing Mulakkal since the issue came out.The Bishop, after a brief meeting with George, left for other visits to churches nearby, but refused to comment before the media.George, who met the media after the meeting, said the case was an effort to target the Church.He said the case was part of a conspiracy to target the Church and the believers.Mulakkal, 57, was accused of raping the nun multiple times during his visit to a convent in this district between 2014 and 2016 when he was the Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The complainant is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus, a diocesan congregation under the Jalandhar Diocese.Acquitting the Bishop, the judge of the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, in the order, said the victim’s claim that she was raped on 13 occasions under duress cannot be taken reliance on the basis of her solitary testimony.                                      #BishopFranco                                     #JalandharDiocese                                     #Kerala                                     #NunRape                                     #RomanCatholic||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-plan-to-appeal-against-bishop-francos-acquittal-in-nun-rape-case-361530

15-01-2022||New York||Video: Man arrested, charged with hate crime for attacking Indian-origin Sikh taxi driver in US||Authorities in the US have arrested and charged with hate crime a man, who attacked an Indian-origin Sikh taxi driver at JFK International Airport here, knocked off his turban and yelled at him "turbaned people, go back to your country".Mohamed Hassanain was arrested on Thursday for the January 3 attack on the Sikh taxi driver, who is being identified only as Mr Singh out of respect for his request for privacy.It’s not enough to say that we need to fight AAPI hate. We actually need our elected officials to get involved with consequences for those who commit acts of violence against our community. @GregMeeksNYC @NYCMayor @AdrienneToYou @yuhline @rontkim pic.twitter.com/Dkk23lQw0gThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department (PAPD) confirmed on Friday that Hassanain was arrested for the attack against Singh, said community-based civil and human rights organisation The Sikh Coalition.The incident is being considered a hate crime, given that Hassanain shouted “go back to your country” and called Singh "turbaned people” in a derogatory manner while repeatedly punching and shoving him, it said.Hassanain is being charged with Assault in the Third Degree as a Hate Crime, Assault in the Third Degree, and Aggravated Harassment in the Second Degree, and will be arraigned on Saturday, it added.“I am thankful to law enforcement, the Sikh Coalition, and all those in the community who have offered their strength in this difficult time,” Singh said in a statement to The Sikh Coalition.“No one should experience what I did--but if they do, I hope they receive the same overwhelming amount of support and quick, professional action by the authorities in response,” he said.On January 3, New York City resident Singh was physically attacked and berated near his cab at JFK International Airport. Singh had parked his cab at the Terminal 4 taxi stand when another driver blocked his vehicle.When Singh picked up a customer, he stepped out of his car to ask the other driver to move. The other driver attempted to hit Singh with his own car door; he then began repeatedly punching Singh in the head, chest, and arms, causing his turban to become unraveled and fall off, the statement said.The other driver called Singh “turbaned people” and shouted at him to “go back to your country,” according to the statement issued by the organisation.Sikh Coalition Legal Director Amrith Kaur Aakre said the organisation was grateful to the Port Authority Police Department and Queens District Attorney's Office for their prompt action in this case, and for recognising that the attack on Singh included clear anti-Sikh bias.“This case underscores the importance of sharing all of the details of these kinds of attacks with law enforcement. Holding perpetrators accountable for both their actions and their hateful motivations is the clearest way to show that bigotry, and the violence that it fuels, have no place in our communities,” Aakre said.Singh had filed a report with the Port Authority Police Department immediately after the incident.The Sikh Coalition worked to ensure that the report “paints an accurate picture of the attack given the language barrier during the initial conversations.”  The organisation's staff had accompanied Singh to a meeting with a detective to provide language assistance and legal support.The organisation said that in its experience, taxi and rideshare drivers from the Sikh community are at a heightened risk of hateful assault.Navjot Pal Kaur had posted the 26-second video of the attack on January 4 on Twitter and it soon went viral. Kaur had tweeted, “This video was taken by a bystander at John F. Kennedy international Airport. I do not own the rights to this video. But I just wanted to highlight the fact that hatred continues to remain in our society and unfortunately I've seen Sikh cab drivers get assaulted again and again.”  Simran Jeet Singh, author and Director for the Aspen Institute's Inclusive America Project, tweeted “Another Sikh cab driver assaulted. This one at JFK Airport in NYC. So upsetting to see. But it's crucial that we don't look away…What I am sure of is how painful it is to watch our fathers and elders get assaulted while they're just trying to live an honest life.” “For those who aren't Sikh, I can't put into words what it means to have your turban knocked off — or to see someone else's turban knocked off. It's visceral and gut-wrenching and just so disheartening to witness,” Singh tweeted.India's Consulate General in New York had termed the assault on the Sikh taxi driver as "deeply disturbing” and said it has taken up the matter with US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident.The US State Department also said it was “deeply disturbed” by reports of the attack on the Sikh cab driver at JFK International Airport, captured on video."Our diversity makes the U.S. stronger, & we condemn any form of hate-based violence,” the State Department's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) had tweeted.“We all have a responsibility to hold perpetrators of hate crimes accountable for their actions, no matter where such crimes occur,” it said in the tweet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/video-man-arrested-charged-with-hate-crime-for-attacking-indian-origin-sikh-taxi-driver-in-us-361511

15-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||'Lack of evidence by prosecution led to acquittal of Bishop Franco'||Jalandhar, January 15Lack of proper evidences put forth by the prosecution and contradictory versions given by the complainant nun to different persons have led to the acquittal of Bishop Franco Mulakkal by the Kerala court.In the 289-page judgment passed by Kottayam Additional Sessions Judge Gopakumar G, he concluded that there is no consistency in the statement of the victim.“The grievance projected by her to the companion sisters was that the accused was taking retaliatory steps for not yielding to his sexual desires, whereas her version before the court was that she was forced to do sexual intercourse with the accused on 13 occasions. Prosecution has failed to give proper explanation for the inconsistent version.”The court observed, “This is a case in which the grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up. There are exaggerations and embellishments in the version of the victim. She has also made every attempt to hide certain facts. It is also evident that the victim was swayed under the influence of others who had vested interest in the matter. The infighting, rivalry and group fights of the nuns, and the desire for power, position and control over the congregation is evident from the demand placed by the victim and her supporting nuns, who were ready to settle the matter if their demand for a separate region under the diocese of Bihar is accepted by the church.”The court has taken a serious view of the fact that the prosecution has failed to produce the mobile phones. The order says, “The police could not seize the mobile phone used by the victim, which would have provided some input into the alleged vulgar messages sent by the accused. The laptop also was not subjected to scientific analysis, as it is claimed that the hard disk got damaged.”On the medical examination of the victim, the order reads, “It is true that the hymen of the victim was found torn in her medical examination. But the defence contends that there was a complaint against the victim by her own cousin that she had indulged in sexual intercourse with her husband. Even if it is assumed that the complaint was false, from the mere fact that the victim’s hymen was found torn, penile penetration or forcible sexual intercourse cannot be inferred.”The court observed, “As regards the complaint of the nun’s cousin, it is established that the accused had absolutely no role in the complaint. One cannot reach the conclusion that the inquiry ordered by the accused was part of his retaliatory measure for not yielding to his sexual demands, on the 14th occasion. It is quite natural for a person at the helm of the affairs to order inquiry into a complaint, when serious allegations of inchastity are raised against a nun, that too by her own cousin. There were other circumstances as well to order such an inquiry since it is established that the husband of her cousin had stayed at the convent for five days under the pretext of attending a convention.”The court said, “It is doubtful as to why the victim’s cousin, who is a teacher, would malign the reputation of her husband, who is a lawyer practising at the Supreme Court, for a silly verbal brawl with the victim and her family. At any rate, she has not till date withdrawn her complaint. In the said circumstances, the inquiry ordered by the mother superior at the recommendation of the accused cannot be regarded as an act of vengeance, as alleged by the prosecution.”“This court is unable to place reliance on the solitary testimony of the complainant nun to hold the accused guilty of the offences charged against him and accordingly acquitted the accused of the offences.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lack-of-evidence-by-prosecution-led-to-acquittal-of-bishop-franco-361501
15-01-2022||Lahore||Punjabi Lehr reunited over 200 families from India and Pakistan, says blogger who connected 2 brothers 74 years after Partition||Much like the landmark Kartarpur Corridor that connects India and Pakistan, Punjabi Lehr, the Pakistan-based YouTube channel that brought together two brothers separated by Partition after 74 years and got many a little teary-eyed, has reunited over 200 friends and families across the border.Separated at India-Pakistan partition, brothers meet at Kartarpur after 74 yearsA video of the tearful reunion, showing the elderly brothers, one from India and another from Pakistan, hugging each other at the visa-free Kartarpur Corridor this week, has gone viral.Emotions run high and tears wouldn't stop from the eyes of septuagenarian brothers who were divided during Indo Pak partition but reunited at Kartarpur Sahib after 74 years.While keeping aside their bilateral differences India Pakistan have opened #KartarpurCorridor onNov 9,2019 pic.twitter.com/oIO1cSspcMThe emotional meeting of 84-year-old Saddique Khan from Pakistan's Punjab and his brother from Indian Punjab, Habib alias Sikka Khan, lasted more than an hour before the brothers returned to their respective homes.The reunion of the two octogenarian brothers separated during Partition in 1947, in addition to being a showstopper for pilgrims in Kartarpur, also put a spotlight on the Pakistan-based YouTube channel that helped them meet and hug each other after 74 years.Nasir Dhillon, who runs his YouTube channel with over 531,000 subscribers, says the channel's aim is “to bridge a gap between the peoples of East and West Punjab, created by Partition."  “With the help of the people of both sides of the Indian and Pakistani Punjab, we have reunited over 200 friends and families across the border,” Dhillon told PTI."People from both sides of the border share their stories of separation from their immediate family members, relatives and friends during bloody riots of Participation in 1947, and some link is found through such videos (stories) that help find their loved ones, friends and their ancestral houses," said Dhillon, who runs the channel with Bhupinder Singh Lovely of Nankana Sahib.The 37-year-old man from Faisalabad who served as a police officer for 12 years in Punjab Police started his YouTube channel some four years ago.He said his grandfather gave him the motivation to start the channel to help reunite the families and friends separated by Partition and promote love among the people across the border.“My grandfather was from Indian Punjab village Karan Taran Panjwar. He would tell me stories of the partition that kindled my interest in doing something related to reuniting the people across the border," he said."My grandfather and my father had a desire to visit the village but unfortunately they left the world without having this desire fulfilled," he said.Dhillon, a father of three who is in the real estate business, said he too wants to visit his ancestral village if the Indian government provides him a visa.Uploading a clip of over 84-year-old Saddique Khan of Faisalabad (some 130 kms from Lahore) some two years ago on the channel helped trace his younger brother on another side of Punjab.This week Saddique met his lost brother Habib alias Sikka Khan at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in an emotional reunion after 74 years. In an over one-hour meeting, Saddique who was 10 years old in 1947, tried to recollect his memories related to his family.Younger Sikka was one-and-a-half-year-old at that time. “My mother, young Habib who was in her lap and younger sister were at grandparents' house when the riots broke out. My father and I left for Pakistan in a chaotic situation. On the way my father was killed,” Dhillon quoted Saddique as having said.Dhillon said when he uploaded the interview of Saddique talking about his lost brother during Partition about two years ago, a doctor from Canada contacted him and informed him he belonged to Phulewal village of Indian Punjab and helped trace Sikka.“Both brothers then were connected by WhatsApp video call and talked hours about their family,” Dhillon said.Sikka told Saddique their mother committed suicide by jumping into a canal as she had developed a mental disorder after losing her husband, son and some other relatives. Their sister also died a few years after Partition, he said.Saddique was brought up by his uncle while Sikka was taken care of by a Sikh family. Saddique got married and had children and grandchildren while Sikka remained single, he said."Since Sikka even did not have a passport and to get an Indian visa for Saddique was not easy, it was decided that the former should reach Kartarpur Sahib using the corridor which does not require a visa,” Dhillon said.He said both brothers might have been united over a year ago at the corridor if the restrictions had not been imposed by India due to Covid-19.Saddique has appealed to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to help his brother get a visa for a longer period so that he could travel to Pakistan and live with him, he said.“Now both brothers talk over the phone and may meet again using the corridor,” he said, urging the Indian and Pakistan governments to allow senior citizens to have visa-free travel into each other's side.Dhillon also talked about a number of stories of Indian Sikhs who visited their ancestral residences in Pakistan's Punjab province in recent times.The Kartarpur Corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, with the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district in India's Punjab state.The 4 km-long corridor provides visa-free access to Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the Darbar Sahib.In November 2019, Prime Minister Khan formally inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor as part of the commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak at a colourful ceremony, paving the way for Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit one of their religion's holiest sites in Pakistan without needing a visa.                                      #KartarpurCorridor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-lehr-reunited-over-200-families-from-india-and-pakistan-says-blogger-who-connected-2-brothers-74-years-after-partition-361494

The one-time cash award for girls is laughable. — Tamanna, A Postgraduate StudentTalking with The Tribune, Gurpal Singh, an MSc (IT) student at GNDU, said ‘political jumlas’ would not work and that a new party should be given a chance. “Successive governments collected crores by charging between Rs 1500-Rs 3000 from those appearing for exams for various government posts but the results were never declared,” he said. Research scholar Jatinder Vir Singh (29) mentioned Delhi Government’s “success in raising world-class education and health infrastructure.”Many students said they would wait for the parties to release their manifestos and then make up their minds.Tamanna (23), a postgraduate student, pointed out that the government, instead of creating job opportunities in the state, had announced English language programmes like IELTS and TOEFL to help the youth to move abroad. “We don’t want freebies. We will buy our own scooters and laptops. The one-time cash award for girls is hilarious,” she remarked.University’s assistant placement officer Dr Amit Chopra said initially, there had been a dip in placements due to Covid-19, “but the situation is now improving. The number of companies coming to us for placements has increased. There is job market in IT, life sciences and the education sector. Students are getting good offers.”Foreign Languages Department student Ravinder Kaur (26) said she would exercise the NOTA (none of the above) option. “Except for engineering, placement in other departments is likely to be the last priority of political parties. This time, NOTA will definitely be my choice,” she stressedFirst-time voter Harnoor Singh Sandhu (19), pursuing BA (Hons) in Social Sciences, is a national-level gold medallist in junior athletics. “I will pick a young contestant, irrespective of the party. We lack in sports infrastructure. Despite the efforts by cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, nothing much has happened on the ground,” he maintained.MTech student Aditya Takiar (23) said due to lack of job opportunities, students had no choice but to move out of the state or country. “Unfortunately, Punjab lags behind in industry. I believe there should be the same party at the Centre and in the state for better growth,” he added.LeaderspeakNot in favour of declaring CM faceThere should be no chief ministerial face. The Assembly elections should be fought as a team. No single leader can be a superhuman. All candidates should be held accountable. — Pargat Singh, CongressChanni has earned people’s goodwillCharanjit Singh Channi as CM has earned goodwill among masses. The work done by him in a short span of time has touched people, especially villagers, and turned the tide in favour of the Congress. — Madan Lal Jalalpur, CongressWill reshape schools as in delhiAAP will bring about a change in Punjab.

15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Getting state rid of mounting debt top priority, says AAP's Bhagwant Mann||State A president Bhagwant Mann today said the party’s top priority would be to get the state rid of debt of over Rs 3 lakh crore.Will end sand mafiaWe will end the sand mafia that is robbing the state of Rs20,000 crore every year. Similarly, transport and excise will be better managed. — Bhagwant Mann, AAP PresidentHe said while Punjab continued to reel under ever-increasing debt, the assets of leaders increased manifold. “Leaders that ruled the state have built huge hotels, palaces and shopping malls, and purchased property abroad. Buses belonging to them have also increased manifold. At the same time, government buses and routes have decreased drastically,” he said.Not a single leader had become poor, because they plundered the government treasury, Mann added. “Today Punjab has a debt of over Rs 3 lakh crore and it has a population of three crore. Thus every Punjabi has a debt of Rs 1 lakh on his head, meaning every child in Punjab is born under debt,” he said.The Sangrur MP said AAP had a comprehensive plan for the overall development of Punjab. Presenting a blueprint, Mann said: “Out of Punjab’s treasury of Rs 1,68,000 crore, Rs 35,000 crore is being looted every year through corruption and mafia, which will be stopped first if AAP comes to power.”The AAP president said their government would not tolerate corruption and vendetta politics. — TNS                                     #AAP                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/getting-state-rid-of-mounting-debt-top-priority-says-mann-361341

The AAP has so far not announced a candidate from this reserved seat and had apparently been waiting for the Mazhabi Sikh leader to make a move. Mann, like other Phagwara leaders, has also been raising the issue of making Phagwara a district as the residents have to travel to Kapurthala district headquarters, 40 km away, to get their works done. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ex-minister-snaps-50-yr-ties-with-congress-also-quits-as-punjab-agro-chief-361343

We hope that he takes back his administrative powers too,” he said. Ever since the Kerala team began interrogating Mulakkal in the case, the administrative powers had been handed over to Bishop Agnelo Gracias.As per reports, “ladoos” were distributed among followers who turned up at the church. Mandeep Sachdev, Mulakkal’s lawyer in Punjab, said: “ We had always said since Mulakkal became a Bishop at a very young age of 45, there is some internal politics involved.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sigh-of-relief-for-jal-diocese-missionaries-361359
15-01-2022||Kottayam (Kerala)||Bishop Franco Mulakkal acquitted; nuns to file appeal||A court in Kerala on Friday acquitted Roman Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal of the charges of raping a nun in a convent here, triggering emotional reactions from nuns who support the survivor, while the jubilant priest urged followers to “praise the lord and be happy”.Didn’t get justiceWe will take forward our fight till our sister gets justice. We didn’t get the expected justice from judiciary today. — Sister Anupama, Nun’s SupporterCharges falseThe other side has the right to appeal. Even if they go for appeal, there is no tension as prosecution charges are false. — B Raman Pillai, Bishop’s lawyerAs the prosecution failed to produce evidence against the accused, G Gopakumar, judge of the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, acquitted the Bishop in a single-line judgment. Mulakkal, 57, was accused of raping the nun multiple times during his visit to a convent in this district between 2014 and 2016 when he was the Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese. The survivor is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus, a diocesan congregation under the Jalandhar Diocese.A visibly relieved Mulakkal, who arrived in the court to hear the verdict, burst into tears and hugged his followers and lawyers after over the verdict. “Daivathinu Sthuthi (praise the Lord),” he told reporters.In a brief statement issued soon after the verdict, the Jalandhar Diocese thanked those who believed in the innocence of the Bishop.A group of nuns of Kuravilangad Convent here, who have been standing by the survivor, were on the verge of tears when they said they were yet to believe such a verdict came out from the court and they did not know what had happened. The survivor and her supporters stay in the Kuravilangad convent in this south Kerala district.Sister Anupama, who was the face of the nun’s fight for justice, said they would challenge the verdict in the higher court and take forward the fight of their hapless colleague.“We will continue our stay in the convent and take forward our fight till our sister gets justice. Police and prosecution showed justice to us but we did not get the expected justice from the judiciary,” she told reporters.Criminal lawyer B Raman Pillai, who led the Bishop’s legal team, said the other side had the right to appeal against the verdict. “Even if they go for appeal, there is no tension as prosecution charges against the Bishop are false,” he claimed.Explaining the factors that worked in his party’s favour, the lawyer said the prosecution case was “very weak, investigation was very poor and statements of most of the witnesses came in favour of the accused because they were telling the truth”.He claimed the defence team could expose in the court the “manipulation” of a most important document by the investigation team. Investigators, lawyers and social activists who stood with the nun in her fight against Mulakkal expressed shock over the verdict.Terming the verdict as “very, very unfortunate” and “unnatural”, senior IPS officer S Harishankar, who had led the special investigation team in the rape case, said 100 per cent conviction was expected in the case and the verdict would be an “astonishment” for the entire legal system of the country.In the case, the survivor was a nun and the assailant was a person who was powerful enough to decide whether she should continue to live or die, he said. “The argument that the woman should have reacted at the time of molestation is unacceptable. An appeal will be filed in the higher court challenging this verdict. The state police chief already gave instructions in this regard and an appeal will be filed as soon as we get a copy of the verdict,” he said. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bishop-acquitted-nuns-to-file-appeal-361358

I have had a long association with veteran Congress leader and Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. In the last elections, I contested on the AAP ticket and managed to win with a huge margin due to the support of the Congress,” he claimed.He said after Moosewala’s induction into the party, the state leadership had been presenting him as the nominee from here.Apart from Manshahia, former minister Sher Singh Gagowal family and Youth Congress district president Chuspinder Singh Chahal are opposing Moosewala’s candidature from Mansa.Meanwhile, in a bid to resolve the infighting in the Mansa segment, PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu today reached out to Moosewala and former minister Sher Singh Gagowal’s grandson Michael Gagowal, who is seeking a ticket from Mansa.It is learnt the meeting failed to bear fruit as Gagowal asserted they be given the ticket, as in the 2017 polls they were ignored by the party.

Many of these are operated from abroad and their posts often generate a large number of views.A student was looking for quick buck when his friend approached him with a lucrative offer. The job required him to create several seemingly authentic social media accounts on various platforms. He has been outsourced by an IT company given the contract to manage the digital campaign for a particular party or candidate.It is learnt certain foreign groups have generated posts on the social media in an attempt to propagate fake news about the 1984 riots, radicalise youth, and further exacerbate discord by exploiting the farmers’ protest ahead of the elections.Dr Rubal Kanozia, assistant professor, Central University Punjab, Bathinda, who is researcher in misinformation and fake news and also a social media analyst, says misinformation doesn’t happen due to a candidate’s posts or advertisement, but through third-party pages, influencers, who may or may not be getting paid.To reduce the effect of propaganda campaigns, the government should include media and information literacy in the curriculum. As an impact of such campaigns, development issues are dropped from the narration and personal attacks on candidates takes centrestage, which is not a good sign in development politics, he adds.Dr Vitull K Gupta says: “Organised misinformation is more than just a digital issue. It is an extension of our society, reflecting its lopsided keel. Those with massive resources robotically flood the medium with propaganda, leaving only an insignificant slice free for independent voices”.“Our IT team is keeping tabs on such activities on the social media and whenever report the matter to the election commission we find such content,” says AAP spokesperson Neel Garg.BJP state media co-incharge Sunil Singla says: “Our IT teams are keeping a close watch.

15-01-2022||Ravi Dhaliwal||Batala industry gasps, rues lack of support||Batala, January 14Total lack of interest-and vision-shown by the political class in the past four decades has meant that Batala’s once famed industrial units are now gasping for breath even as leading businessmen claim that only the government incentives in the form of fiscal package and tax reforms can revive the ailing units of ‘steel town’. Statistics tell a chilling story. In the 80s, the city with 2,000 odd units was teeming with industrial activity.That was the time when Batala became the envy of many cities. Residents wore opulence on their sleeves and signs of economic prosperity were visible everywhere. Car, scooter and tractor sales hit the roof and posh colonies mushroomed on the town’s outskirts.Dr Satnam Singh Nijjar, chairman, Gurdaspur district planning board, said, “The ‘iron bird of India’ had the highest number of agricultural and machinery units in North India. Cotton ginning, weaving, sports, woollen, sugar refining and rice milling businesses had sprouted in every nook and cranny.”Around 40 years down the line, just 400 units remain. Things started looking gloomy when in 1992 the centre abolished Freight Equalisation Policy (FEP). This policy was adopted in 1948 to facilitate uniform growth all over the country.An official of the Department of Industries and Commerce, said, “This meant transportation of minerals and metals would be subsidised to a factory established anywhere in the country. With its abolition, the cost price of goods manufactured in Batala became more than the selling price of the same goods elsewhere.”Poor rail connectivity, too, proved to be a bane for the industrialists. If this was not enough, neighbouring states of J&K and HP launched the single-window clearance system and also started offering massive tax rebates. Slowly, but steadily, Batala’s units started shifting base. On a conservative estimate, 60 percent of the total population is dependent on the industry. Despite this, in the past 40 years, not even a single MP or MLA has deemed it appropriate to extend a helping hand to the beleaguered industrialists.                                     #Batala                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/batala-industry-gasps-rues-lack-of-support-361348
15-01-2022||Sanjiv kumar Bakshi||Dasuya: 3 decades on, no district status||One of the oldest sub-divisions and constituencies in Hoshiarpur district, the Dasuya Assembly segment is rich with diverse geographical conditions and at the same time plagued with problems as well. The semi-hilly terrain of the Kandi area has always been a point of concern and a major electoral issue with the problem of unemployment. The demand for a medical college is long-pending, even after assurances of successive Chief Ministers.Past trendIt has been a Cong bastion since Independence, except for 1967 and 1969. In 2007 and 2012, BJP’s Amarjeet Sahi defeated Cong MLA Ramesh Chander Dogra. After Sahi’s death, his wife Sukhjit Kaur retained the seat in bypoll. In 2017, Dogra’s son Arun won the seat back.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1,96,178Male -1,00,405Female -95,772Third gender - 1Locals’ key demandsFor three decades, the district status to Dasuya has also been lingering. The then MLA of Dasuya, Ramesh Chander Dogra, who held important portfolios in Congress governments, raised the issue several times. Then BJP MLA Amarjeet Shahi too had promised district status to Dasuya in his poll promise, which got support from the then Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. But nothing happened. In 2017, it was on the list of the poll promises of all candidates. Congress MLA Arun Dogra won and the issue was expected to be resolved.In the 2019 General Election, the then-CM Capt Amarinder Singh also promised to make Dasuya the district. Now recently, CM Charanjit Singh Channi too agreed to consider it. But the issue remains alive for coming elections. Despite this, Mukerian and Tanda have been carved out of it to make them sub-divisions.                                     #Dasuya                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-decades-on-no-district-status-361347

Work on the Daastan-e-Shaheedan museum, built in the memory of two elder Sahibzaadas of Guru Gobind Singh, which had been going on since 2006, gathered steam and it was finally opened to public on November 19 last year.Past trendFrom 1977 to 2002, SAD’s Satwant Kaur Sandhu won from here, while Congress’ Bhag Singh and Shamsher Singh registered victories in 1985 and 1992, respectively. In 2007, Charanjit Channi defeated Sandhu. He went on to win in 2012 and 2017.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1,95,947Male -1,03,983Female -91,963Third gender - 1Locals’ key demandsThe development in the area got further boost after Channi became the CM last September. A majority of the roads in the constituency lying in a dilapidated condition for 10 years were repaired. Channi also laid the stone of the Rs 114 crore Bela-Paniali bridge to provide direct connectivity with Doaba. To boost tourism, a heritage street on the lines of Amritsar has been completed in front of Gurdwara Katalgarh Sahib.

The AAP has so far not announced a candidate from this reserved seat and had apparently been waiting for the Mazhabi Sikh leader to make a move. Mann, like other Phagwara leaders, has also been raising the issue of making Phagwara a district as the residents have to travel to Kapurthala district headquarters, 40 km away, to get their works done. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ex-minister-snaps-50-yr-ties-with-congress-also-quits-as-punjab-agro-chief-361343
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||Getting state rid of mounting debt top priority, says AAP's Bhagwant Mann||State A president Bhagwant Mann today said the party’s top priority would be to get the state rid of debt of over Rs 3 lakh crore.Will end sand mafiaWe will end the sand mafia that is robbing the state of Rs20,000 crore every year. Similarly, transport and excise will be better managed. — Bhagwant Mann, AAP PresidentHe said while Punjab continued to reel under ever-increasing debt, the assets of leaders increased manifold. “Leaders that ruled the state have built huge hotels, palaces and shopping malls, and purchased property abroad. Buses belonging to them have also increased manifold. At the same time, government buses and routes have decreased drastically,” he said.Not a single leader had become poor, because they plundered the government treasury, Mann added. “Today Punjab has a debt of over Rs 3 lakh crore and it has a population of three crore. Thus every Punjabi has a debt of Rs 1 lakh on his head, meaning every child in Punjab is born under debt,” he said.The Sangrur MP said AAP had a comprehensive plan for the overall development of Punjab. Presenting a blueprint, Mann said: “Out of Punjab’s treasury of Rs 1,68,000 crore, Rs 35,000 crore is being looted every year through corruption and mafia, which will be stopped first if AAP comes to power.”The AAP president said their government would not tolerate corruption and vendetta politics. — TNS                                     #AAP                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/getting-state-rid-of-mounting-debt-top-priority-says-mann-361341

For a more secure future, it is looking beyond the traditional parties such as the Congress, SAD and BJP. Importantly, those in the 18-35 age group constitutes nearly 55 per cent of the Punjab electorate.‘Jumlas’ won’t workPolitical ‘jumlas’ will not work. A new party should be given a chance. Successive governments collected crores of rupees from those taking exams for various posts, but results were never declared. — Gurpal Singh, MSC(IT) Student at GNDUWill buy own laptopsInstead of creating jobs, government announced English language programmes to help youth move abroad…. We don’t want freebies. We will buy our own scooters and laptops. The one-time cash award for girls is laughable. — Tamanna, A Postgraduate StudentTalking with The Tribune, Gurpal Singh, an MSc (IT) student at GNDU, said ‘political jumlas’ would not work and that a new party should be given a chance. “Successive governments collected crores by charging between Rs 1500-Rs 3000 from those appearing for exams for various government posts but the results were never declared,” he said. Research scholar Jatinder Vir Singh (29) mentioned Delhi Government’s “success in raising world-class education and health infrastructure.”Many students said they would wait for the parties to release their manifestos and then make up their minds.Tamanna (23), a postgraduate student, pointed out that the government, instead of creating job opportunities in the state, had announced English language programmes like IELTS and TOEFL to help the youth to move abroad. “We don’t want freebies. We will buy our own scooters and laptops. The one-time cash award for girls is hilarious,” she remarked.University’s assistant placement officer Dr Amit Chopra said initially, there had been a dip in placements due to Covid-19, “but the situation is now improving. The number of companies coming to us for placements has increased. There is job market in IT, life sciences and the education sector. Students are getting good offers.”Foreign Languages Department student Ravinder Kaur (26) said she would exercise the NOTA (none of the above) option. “Except for engineering, placement in other departments is likely to be the last priority of political parties. This time, NOTA will definitely be my choice,” she stressedFirst-time voter Harnoor Singh Sandhu (19), pursuing BA (Hons) in Social Sciences, is a national-level gold medallist in junior athletics. “I will pick a young contestant, irrespective of the party. We lack in sports infrastructure. Despite the efforts by cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, nothing much has happened on the ground,” he maintained.MTech student Aditya Takiar (23) said due to lack of job opportunities, students had no choice but to move out of the state or country. “Unfortunately, Punjab lags behind in industry. I believe there should be the same party at the Centre and in the state for better growth,” he added.LeaderspeakNot in favour of declaring CM faceThere should be no chief ministerial face. The Assembly elections should be fought as a team. No single leader can be a superhuman. All candidates should be held accountable. — Pargat Singh, CongressChanni has earned people’s goodwillCharanjit Singh Channi as CM has earned goodwill among masses.

15-01-2022||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana High Court paves way for police quizzing under CCTV||Chandigarh, January 14In a significant order liable to change the way accused are quizzed in police stations, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that interrogation rooms will also be covered by the Supreme Court directions on installing CCTV cameras in every nook and corner of the police stations.The observation is significant as the process of grilling and investigation will be video-recorded once the CCTV cameras are installed in interrogation rooms.The stand of the Haryana Director General of Police is that there is no provision in the CrPC for conducting interrogation under CCTV cameras. His Punjab counterpart is “conspicuously silent in his affidavit on the aspect”.Justice Amol Rattan Singh has asked Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh DGPs to file affidavits on the compliance of Supreme Court directions. The directions came after accused Kaushal filed a plea through senior advocate Bipan Ghai with counsel Paras Talwar. He was seeking directions for conducting videography from the time of leaving the jail premises till reaching the police station concerned for interrogation. Ghai also prayed for a direction to record the interrogation.Ghai also referred to the SC directions in the case of “Paramvir Singh Saini versus Baljit Singh”. Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted the SC directions were to the extent of installing cameras at the main gates of the police stations, the entry and exit points, in all lock-ups, corridors, lobby, reception areas, verandas, out-houses, officials’ rooms, outside the lock-up rooms, station hall and in front of the police station compound. The cameras were also to be installed outside washrooms and toilets.“The obvious implication is that no part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTV surveillance. Naturally, therefore, any interrogation room would also be covered by such directions,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted.Police stations under e-surveillanceNo part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTVs... interrogation room would also be covered by such directions (of the SC). — Justice Amol Rattan Singh,Punjab and Haryana High Court                                     #CCTV                                     #Highcourt                                     #InterrogationunderCCTV||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-paves-way-for-police-quizzing-under-cctv-361370
15-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Punjab Poll 2022 1st list: Bid to iron out differences in Congress party||Chandigarh, January 14The Congress is yet to announce its first list of candidates for the Punjab Assembly elections. Sources say differences persist among members of the AICC-appointed screening committee, which held two back-to-back meetings on Friday in a bid to reach a consensus on certain seats.Ropar, Kharar, Dera Bassi, Garhshankar, Sujanpur, Balachaur, Khemkaran and Sunam are among these.Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Chaudhary is said to be supporting the candidature of Deepinder Dhillon from Dera Bassi while Pradesh Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu is keen on fielding Youth Congress leader Amit Bawa Saini. In Ropar, Channi is reportedly opposed to the candidature of Barinder Dhillon but he has the backing of the Punjab affairs in-charge. In Garshankar, the CM is keen on fielding Namisha Mehta whereas former Pradesh Congress chief Sunil Jakhar is supporting Amarpreet Lally's candidature. A report from Delhi said CM Channi was keen on securing the party ticket for his brother Manohar Singh from Bassi Pathana.The latter had earlier resigned as Senior Medical Officer at Kharar Civil Hospital to concentrate on Bassi Pathana.Likewise, Fateh Jung Bajwa, the sitting Qadian MLA and brother of Partap Bajwa, could be fielded from another seat. Fateh Jung, who joined the BJP recently, is open to returning to the Congress, if allotted a seat. The party is debating candidates for Lambi, Patiala and Jalalabad.Folowing differences of opinion over the first list of candidates, party president Sonia Gandhi has asked the Punjab screening committee led by Ajay Maken to hold a review and suggest potential candidates.Also, party leaders are gauging the opposition from other aspirants to the candidature of Bollywood actor Sonu Sood’s sister Malvika Sood from Moga and Sidhu Moosewala from Mansa.There have been protests by Mansa MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia and others.No consensus on...                                     #PunjabelectionswithTribune                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-poll-2022-1st-list-bid-to-iron-out-differences-361327
15-01-2022||Kottayam (Kerala)||Nun's supporters express shock as Bishop Franco gets clean chit in rape case||The acquittal of Roman Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal of charges of raping a nun in a Kerala convent by a court here triggered emotional reactions on Friday as nuns who support the survivor expressed shock and dismay over the verdict and said they would continue the fight till justice is prevailed while the jubilant bishop urged followers to 'praise the lord and be happy'.A group of nuns of Kuravilangad Convent here, who have been standing with the survivor in her fight, were on the verge of tears when they said they were yet to believe such a verdict came out from the court and they did not know what has happened.The survivor and her supporters stay in the Kuravilangad convent in this south Kerala district.Sister Anupama, who was the face of the nun's years-long fight for justice, said they would surely challenge the verdict in the higher court and take forward the fight of their hapless colleague."We will continue our stay in the convent and take forward our fight till our sister gets justice. Police and prosecution showed justice to us but we did not get the expected justice from the judiciary," the teary-eyed nun told reporters.In a broken voice, she also said the verdict gives them a message that ordinary mortals like them should never break their silence against any injustice and fight a case whatever happened to them in the life."Those who are wealthy and influential can do anything in this society. That is what we see around us now. We have never felt anything strange till the time of argument of the case. We believe it was sabotaged after that," she said.When asked whether they would be safe in the convent and they expect any ill-treatment from the church authorities in the wake of the verdict, she said they had never been safe there and they could not reveal many things happening inside the institution.Sister Anupama also made it clear that they were even ready to die to get justice for the survivor.Meanwhile, a visibly relieved and emotional Mulakkal, who arrived in the court to hear the verdict, burst into tears, hugged his followers and lawyers, sharing his joy over the verdict."Only the trees that bear fruits are stoned. I am just proud of that. Praise the Lord," an elated bishop told reporters outside the court.When asked what he has to say to his followers and faithful, the priest urged them to praise the lord and be happy.Some of his followers were even seen crying out of joy knowing the acquittal of the bishop.Investigators, lawyers and social activists who stood with the nun in her fight against Mulakkal expressed shock over the verdict, saying it was totally unexpected.Terming the verdict as "very very unfortunate" and "unnatural'', senior IPS officer S Harishankar, who had led the special investigation team in the rape case, said 100 per cent conviction was expected in the case and the verdict would be an "astonishment" for the entire legal system of the country.In the case, the survivor was a nun and the assailant was a person who was powerful enough to decide whether she should continue to live or die."The argument that the woman should have reacted at the time of molestation is unacceptable. An appeal will be filed in the higher court challenging this verdict. The state police chief already gave instructions in this regard and an appeal will be filed as soon as we get a copy of the verdict," he told reporters.Even the supreme court made it clear multiple times that the victim's statement, if it is consistent and not having massive contradictions, is a satisfactory piece of evidence for conviction, he said, adding that it would give a wrong message to society and those suffering similar assaults silently.Public prosecutor, Jithesh J Babu, said it was a single-line judgment and could avail the details only after getting the copy of the verdict."We do not know what has happened. Thirty-nine witnesses have given their statements supporting the prosecution. No one has turned hostile. As many as 122 documents had been submitted and there was ample evidence. There was no lapse in anything," he said.He also said the verdict would be challenged in the higher court and the decision would be taken after consulting with the government and the investigators.Activist-nun Sister Lucy Kalappura, who took part in the survivor's fight for justice and was expelled from her congregation recently, said the verdict was regrettable and expressed hope that justice would be prevail at any cost in the higher court.In a brief Malayalam statement issued soon after the verdict, the Jalandhar diocese thanked those who believed in the innocence of the Bishop till date and provided him with the necessary legal assistance."The prosecution has failed miserably in proving the charges against the Bishop", said a lawyer in the Bishop's legal team.Mulakkal, 57, was accused of raping the nun multiple times during his visit to a convent in this district when he was the Bishop of the Jalandhar diocese of the Roman Catholic church.As the prosecution failed to produce evidence against the accused, the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, acquitted the Bishop.The rape case against the Bishop was registered by police in Kottayam district in June, 2018.In her complaint to the police, the nun had alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by Franco between 2014 and 2016.The Special Investigation Team which probed the case, arrested the Bishop in September 2018 and charged him with wrongful confinement, rape, unnatural sex and criminal intimidation.Trial in the case, started in November 2019, had concluded on January 10. The court had restrained the print and electronic media from publishing any matter relating to the trial in the case without its permission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nun-rape-court-verdict-supporters-of-survivor-express-shock-say-praise-the-lord-361224
15-01-2022||Chandigarh||5 kg RDX seized from near international border in Amritsar's Attari||An improvised explosive device (IED) and some Indian currency notes were found on Friday concealed in a bag lying on the Attari-Bachiwind road in Punjab's Amritsar, close to the India-Pakistan border, a senior police official said.The Special Task Force of Punjab Police launched a search operation based on a specific input about drugs and explosives and recovered the bag, just a month before the assembly polls in Punjab.It came on a day an IED stuffed with RDX and ammonium nitrate was found inside an unattended bag at the Ghazipur flower market in the national capital.After the recovery of the IED in Amritsar, the police have cordoned off the area."The IED weighing 5 kg...was found concealed in a bag on Attari-Bachiwind Road. Some Indian currency notes were also found inside," Assistant Inspector General of STF Rashpal Singh, who was present at the site, told PTI over the phone.He said experts and bomb-disposal squad members were called to the site and further investigation is underway.On Thursday, close on the heels of busting a terror module backed by the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), Punjab Police had said it seized 2.5 kg of RDX, besides arms and ammunition, on the disclosure of the prime accused in two recent incidents of hurling of grenades in Pathankot.Police had also seized a detonator, a detonating cord, five explosive fuses along with wires, and 12 live cartridges of AK-47 rifles, Director General of Police (DGP) VK Bhawra said here on Thursday.The explosive material was to be used in assembling IEDs, police had said."The recovery was made on the disclosure statement of accused Amandeep Kumar alias Mantri of village Lakhanpal in Gurdaspur, who is the prime accused in the two recent incidents of grenade attacks in Pathankot," the DGP was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the state police.Kumar was among the six ISYF operatives arrested by police on Monday. He has confessed to have hurled grenades in two separate incidents in Pathankot, according to the statement issued on Thursday.Senior Superintendent of Police, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Kanwardeep Kaur had Thursday said following the revelations made by Kumar, teams were sent to Gurdaspur district and the explosive material was recovered.She had said the consignment was provided to Kumar by the self-proclaimed chief of the ISYF (Rode), Lakhbir Singh Rode, who is currently residing in Pakistan, through his associate and the handler of this terror module, Sukhpreet Singh alias Sukh of Kharal village in Dinanagar.According to the statement, since June-July last year, Rode has figured prominently in operationalising a series of terror modules through his network in Punjab and abroad.A large number of militant hardware, including RDX, tiffin IEDs, associated explosive material for assembling IEDs, hand grenades, and firearms, as also narcotics have been pushed in by him from across the international border, mainly via drones and using his network of cross-border smugglers, the police said.On Monday, police had said they had solved a case involving a recent grenade blast outside the gate of the Army cantonment in Pathankot by busting a major terror module backed by the ISYF with the arrest of six of its operatives.The ISYF is believed to have the backing of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/5-kg-rdx-seized-from-near-international-border-in-amritsars-attari-361222
