27-01-2022||New Delhi||Hockey Olympian Charanjit Singh dies at 90||Captain of India's 1964 Tokyo Olympics gold medal-winning hockey team, Charanjit Singh, died on Thursday at his home in Una, Himachal Pradesh, after suffering a cardiac arrest that followed prolonged age-related illnesses.The former mid-fielder was 90 and would have turned a year older next month. He is survived by two sons and a daughter.Charanjit suffered a stroke five years back and was since paralysed."Dad was paralysed after suffering a stroke five years back. He used to walk with a stick but for the past couple of months, his health deteriorated and on Thursday morning he left us," his younger son VP Singh told PTI.Besides captaining the Olympic gold-winning team in 1964, he was also a part of the silver-winning side in the 1960 edition of the Games. He was also a part of the 1962 Asian Games silver-winning team."His last rites will be performed today after my sister reaches Una from Delhi," VP Singh said.His wife died 12 years ago. While his elder son is a doctor in Canada, his younger son was next to him when he breathed his last. His only daughter is based in New Delhi.His last rites will be performed in Una on Thursday evening.The two-time Olympian was a part of India's glorious days. A charismatic halfback, Charanjit had led the Indian team to a historic gold medal in 1964 Tokyo Olympics, beating Pakistan in the final and also featured in the Indian team that won silver in the 1960 Games in Rome.Charanjit was an alumnus of Col Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun, and Panjab University. After his illustrious career in international hockey, he worked as the director of the physical education department in Himachal Pradesh University in Shimla.He was one of the architects of India's stunning performance at the 1960 Olympics before an unfortunate injury forced him to sit out of the final against arch-rivals Pakistan, which they lost by a slender 0-1 margin.The 1960 disappointment still fresh in his mind, a Charanjit-led India turned the tables around four years later, defeating Pakistan by the same margin to clinch the gold medal.Recollecting the fond memory in the lead-up to last year's Tokyo Olympics, Charanjit had told Hockey India Flashback Series: "Both the teams were regarded among the strongest teams during that time, and we had a very challenging outing against them (Pakistan)."Moreover, you know, how intense it becomes when you play against Pakistan, that too in the final of the Olympics. The match was also interrupted briefly to cool down the tempers of both teams."I told my boys to focus on the game, rather than wasting time talking to them. We were tested hard but also showed great character, and won the match by a narrow 1-0 margin to return home with that historic gold medal."Speaking further about his Olympic achievements, Charanjit had said, "Winning two Olympic medals for the country has been a moment of pride and honour for me. You know, after winning the gold medal at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, we were accorded a warm welcome on our arrival at the airport, a lot of fans had assembled, and it was a very special feeling for every one of us."    "Hockey was a very popular sport in India. It was given more importance because of the rich history, and our country had dominated in this sport in early years. We had won many gold medals at a prestigious event like the Olympics, and that was the key reason for it."Hockey India condoled the death of Charanjit, saying the country had lost a legend of the sport."It is a sad day for the hockey fraternity. Even in his old age, he would light up every time there were conversations about hockey and he could accurately recall every great moment he was part of during India's golden days of hockey."He was a legendary halfback who inspired an entire generation of players. He was a very cool-headed captain and he will forever be remembered for his incredible skills on the field and for his humility off the field," HI president Gyanendro Nigombam said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hockey-olympian-charanjit-singh-passes-away-364672

27-01-2022||Rajmeet SinghChandigarh||Punjab polls: Rebellion continuous to brew in Congress over second list||Trouble for Punjab Congress is far from over. Hours after Congress announced the second list of 23 candidates, the party is again seen struggling to contain a rebellion.On other hand, party leaders are questioning the party’s decision to give tickets to kith and kin of party leaders. They said the elections become launch pad of politicians to kick start the political career of their kith and kin.Citing examples, it has been pointed out that Vikram Bajwa (son-in-law of Rajinder Kaur Bhattal), Jaswinder Dhiman (son of MLA Surjit Dhiman), Vikram Chaudhary (son of MP Santokh Singh), Smit Singh ( Nephew of PPCC Chief Navjot Singh Sidhu), Kamil Amar Singh (son of MP Dr Amar Singh) and Mohit Mohindra ( son of senior leader Brahm Mohindra), Tript Bajwa and Rana Gurjeet had been seeking for their sons.A day ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s a day's visit to Punjab, party leaders sound rebellious on being denied party tickets. A strong contender from the youth congress quota in Sunam, Dhaman Bajwa, who has been denied the party ticket, had the backing of CM Charanjit Singh. But Navjot Singh Sidhu ensured that the ticket from Sunam was given to Jaswinder Dhiman, son of sitting Amargarh MLA Surjit Singh Dhiman, as the PPCC Chief wanted to get a ticket for nephew and a close aid Smit Singh from Amargarh. Smit’s father is a former MLA from Dhuri, Dhanwant Singh.Another senior leader Jagmohan Singh Kang, who has been denied ticket from Kharar, said he would decide his next course of action after meeting supporters. He claimed he was getting offers from BJP and AAP. Kang blamed CM Charanjit Singh Channi for denying him the ticket to adjust his confidant Vijay Sharma Tinu. In Sahnewal, Satwinder Bittu, who has been denied a ticket to adjust Vikram Bajwa, also protested against the party decision.All eyes are the remaining eight seats expected to be announced any time. The remaining contentious seats are Patiala (Urban), Jalalabad, Nawanshahr, Attari, Barnala, Bhadaur, Khem Kharan, and Ludhiana (south).                                     #Congress                                     #oneticketonefamily                                     #Punjabpolls                                     #rebellion                                     #ticketdistribution||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-polls-rebellion-continuous-to-brew-in-congress-over-second-list-364641
27-01-2022||---||Congress’ anti-Dalit face to fore in ticket distribution for Punjab polls: AAP||Chandigarh, January 26Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Punjab affairs co-in-charge Raghav Chadha has accused the Congress of being anti-Dalit and said their anti-Dalit face has come to the fore in ticket distribution for Punjab Legislative Assembly Elections.He said the Congress has always used SC community for votes. Congress made an SC leader, Charanjit Singh Channi, their chief minister for few weeks, to do vote bank based politics in Punjab. He said behind this step of Congress’s their only intention was to divide the people of Punjab on religion-caste basis and woo SC voters in their favour.During a press conference at the party headquarters on Wednesday, Raghav Chadha said the Congress does not have a place for Dalit leaders and their high command has always been a supporter of nepotism in politics. Raghav Chadha claimed that the Congress high command gave tickets to all the big Congress leaders of Punjab, their brothers and nephews, sons and even sons-in-law as per their demands, but brother of CM Channi was denied the ticket even after he clearly expressed his desire to contest assembly elections.Chadha gave examples that Congress gave ticket to Sunil Jakhar’s son from Abohar, Amar Singh’s son to contest from Raikot, MP Santosh Chaudhary’s nephew from Kartarpur. Similarly Avtar Henry’s son from Jalandhar (Rural), former Chief Minister Harcharan Singh Brar’s daughter-in-law Karan Kaur from Muktsar, Navjot Singh Sidhu’s nephew Sumit Singh from Amargarh, Vikram Bajwa, son-in-law of former Chief Minister Rajinder Kaur Bhathal, from Sahnewal, Former MLA Surjit Dhiman’s nephew was given ticket from Sunam and Brahm Mohindra’s son has been fielded from Patiala (Rural).Raghav Chadha said that the Congress party did not accept the appeal of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who belongs to SC community, to give ticket to his brother even after he’d practically begged for it. He said that Congress as per its tradition has applied ‘use and throw’ at Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-anti-dalit-face-to-fore-in-ticket-distribution-for-punjab-polls-aap-364638
27-01-2022||Archit Watts||SAD announces 94-year-old Parkash Singh Badal as Lambi candidate||Lambi (Muktsar), January 26The SAD on Wednesday announced party patron and former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal as its nominee from Lambi Assembly constituency.The party had released its first list of 64 candidates on September 13 last. Till Tuesday, the party had declared candidates in 95 of 97 seats in a pre-poll alliance with the BSP. However, the candidates from Lambi and Amritsar East were yet to be declared.Political experts said the SAD kept waiting for over four months this time anticipating that the Congress may do something like that of the last election, when it had surprised everyone by fielding Capt Amarinder Singh from Lambi just a few days ahead of the election.Notably, 94-year-old Badal has mostly toured his constituency in the last few days. Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal too along with his father-in-law has held public meetings in some villages. Notably, Lambi falls in Bathinda parliamentary constituency. Further, the former CM has assigned duties to his relatives and lieutenants to go door-to-door in the villages.Sources said SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal too would soon hold a meeting with the party activists from Lambi at his Badal village residence here.In 2012, it was the toughest electoral battle for Badal when he took on his younger brother Gurdas Singh Badal (PPP) and estranged cousin Maheshinder Singh Badal (Congress). Badal won by a margin of 24,739 votes. He continued cordial relations with Gurdas until the latter passed away in 2020.Five-time CM to face first-timer candidatesThe five-time CM will face two new entrants, 52-year-old Jagpal Singh Abulkhurana of the Congress and 59-year-old Gurmeet Singh Khudian of the AAP.Jagpal is son of late minister Gurnam Singh Abulkhurana, who had won from Lambi in 1992 when the SAD had boycotted the elections. Gurmeet Khudian is son of late MP Jagdev Singh Khudian, who had become MP as a SAD (Amritsar) candidate, died under mysterious circumstances. Both Jagpal and Gurmeet have never contested the Assembly election in the past.Once Badal files his nomination, he will become the oldest candidate in the electoral history of the state. Born on December 8, 1927, he became the youngest Chief Minister in 1970. Further, he became the oldest CM in 2012. Besides, he was the youngest sarpanch when got elected from Badal village in 1947.He has served as a Chief Minister from 1970-71, 1977-80, 1997-2002, 2007-12 and 2012-17. He has also served as a Union Minister for a short stint. During his political innings, he has been to jails a number of times for the party activities. He has remained president of the SAD from 1995 to 2008. He was bestowed upon the title of Panth Rattan Fakhr-e-Qaum by the Akal Takht in 2011. Badal was conferred with Padma Vibhushan in 2015, which he returned in 2020 in protest against the three contentious farm laws.Age seems to be just a number for 94-year-old Parkash Singh Badal. Though he now gets the support of people accompanying him to walk, once he reaches the venue of any political programme he successfully delivers lengthy and meaningful speeches. His mind is still sharp and immediately recognises everyone. He gives credit for his health to the public, saying, “People keep me busy and that’s why I am still better than many others.” He does some exercise every morning and performs prayer twice a day.Since 1997, Badal has been winning consecutively from this constituency. In 1977, his younger brother Gurdas Singh Badal had won from here as SAD candidate. Further, in 1980 and 1985, Badal’s cousin Hardipinder Singh had won from here as SAD candidate. The Congress has however won from Lambi just thrice in 1962, 1967 and 1992. The CPI too has won from here twice in 1969 and 1972.Before Lambi, Badal was elected MLA five times from Gidderbaha Assembly constituency. Before the reorganisation of the state, he contested the first Assembly election from Malout on the Indian National Congress (INC) ticket in 1957 and won.He has so far lost just one election at that too with just 57 votes from Harcharan Singh Brar from Gidderbaha in 1967.                                     #PunjabElections2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-announces-94-year-old-parkash-singh-badal-as-lambi-candidate-364635
