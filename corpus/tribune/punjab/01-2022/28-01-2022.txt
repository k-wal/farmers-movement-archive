He stated this while addressing a gathering at the town hall in Adampur. Earlier in the day, he also addressed a meeting at Phillaur.Speaking on sacrilege cases, Kejriwal said, “Have any of those committing sacrilege incidents been punished? Why? Because those who commit these, and the masterminds who send them are all together. If those committing the ‘Bargari kaand’ had been punished, no one would have dared to commit sacrilege at the Darbar Sahib. If the AAP government comes to power, it will punish those committing sacrilege so strictly that no one would dare to insult a religious scripture every again.”Kejriwal took a pointed dig at Majithia and the state CM. He said, “Aaj nasha khuleaam bik raha hai. Kyon bik raha hai nasha? Kyonki nasha bechne valon ke saath sarkarein mili hui hain. Nautanki karte hain. Ek nautanki kar ke FIR kar di. Aur Channi sahab khoob ghoom rahe hain, ‘Maine FIR kar di’. Vo to khuleaam ghoom raha hai. Pakra usko? Himmat nahi hai inki pakarne ki. Ye saare apas mein mile hue hain. (Today drugs are openly being sold. Why? Because governments side with those selling drugs. They do drama. The FIR was also filed as per drama. And Channi is going around saying I’ve lodged FIR. He is roaming around openly. Did you catch him? They don’t dare to. They are all together in this.”Kejriwal further added, “If our government comes to power, this entire network of suppliers amounting to not just one or two but hundreds — will be nabbed on a war footing. They will all be nabbed.”He also added rehabilitation of youths and provision of employment would be part of the plan to counter drugs.    In his dig at CM Channi with regards to the ED raid, Kejriwal said, “Today allegations are being made against the state CM. That huge stacks of currency have been found in an ED raid on the CM’s relative. This is the state in three months. I wonder how much money they have all earned together. There are allegations of sand mining. On the other hand, another leader is charged with selling drugs. Tell me is the state safe in such hands?”Kejriwal addressed meetings at Phillaur in support of candidate Principal Prem Kumar and at Adampur, in support of candidate Jeet Lal Bhatti.  AAP Punjab’s Chief Minister candidate Bhagwant Mann, also addressed the gathering saying AAP has a roadmap ready for the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/there-will-be-no-action-in-sacrilege-cases-as-everyone-at-top-is-involved-says-kejriwal-364993

Mittal is expected to announce his decision later in the day.Among his various demands, sources said, was a party ticket to his oldest son Arvind Mittal.This is the second time BJP didn’t give Mittal, a former minister in the SAD-BJP cabinet from 2012-17, his desired seat—Anandpur Sahib.The Mittals could not be contacted for a confirmation, but a senior Akali leader said he was in touch with the party. Arvind Mittal is a senior lawyer and a former additional advocate general for Punjab. Madan Mohan Mittal was reportedly also upset with the BJP in the last assembly elections for having passed his son’s candidature over for Ropar district planning board chief Parminder Sharma in the last elections.Sharma lost the election to Congress candidate Rana KP Singh. The BJP meanwhile tried to placate the angry Mittals by appointing Arvind Mittal as Punjab BJP secretary and party spokesperson."He was expecting the party to give him a ticket in 2022 and even held meetings with his supporters despite farmer protests against three controversial farm laws,” a close confidante said. “When the party ignored him and announced Sharma’s name on Wednesday, he decided it was time to weigh his options.”                                     #AnandpurSahib                                     #BJP                                     #MadanMohanMittal                                     #Punjabpolls                                     #SAD||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/upset-with-bjp-over-ticket-distribution-former-punjab-minister-madan-mohan-mittal-weighs-his-options-in-talks-with-akalis-364985

This will be his 13th Assembly elections, but this time, he is not the SAD-BSP alliance’s CM face as his son Sukhbir Badal’s name has already been announced.He was the youngest sarpanch when he got elected from Badal village in 1947. Besides, he became the youngest CM in 1970. Further, he became the oldest CM in 2012. He has also the record of becoming the CM for five times from 1970-71, 1977-80, 1997-2002, 2007-12 and 2012-17. Besides, he has remained a member of Lok Sabha once.In his over 75-year political journey, Badal has lost just one Assembly election and that too from Harcharan Singh Brar in Gidderbaha in 1967 by just 57 votes. He won the first Assembly election before the reorganisation of the state from Malout in 1957 on the ticket of Indian National Congress. He won Assembly election five times in a row from Gidderbaha in 1969, 1972, 1977, 1980 and 1985. Thereafter, he switched to Lambi and won five times in a row in 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017.Badal did not contest just two Assembly elections in his political career, once in 1962 and, thereafter, in 1992 when SAD had boycotted it.He will face three first-timers this time. The Congress has fielded Jagpal Singh Abulkhurana, son of late minister Gurnam Singh Abulkhurana. AAP has fielded Gurmeet Singh Khudian, son of late MP Jagdev Singh Khudian and BJP has fielded its former Muktsar district chief Rakesh Dhingra.Sources in SAD said the party kept waiting for the announcement of Badal’s candidature this time because Congress had last time surprised everyone by fielding Capt Amarinder Singh from Lambi just a few days ahead of the election. In 2012, it was a triangular contest between Badals – Parkash Singh Badal (SAD), his younger brother Gurdas Singh Badal (PPP) and estranged cousin Maheshinder Singh Badal (Congress). However, Parkash Badal won with 24,739 votes.Before testing positive, Badal was holding a door-to-door campaign. He is set to return to his constituency in a day or two. In his absence, his relatives are campaigning for him. Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal too has already toured some villages.Badal was conferred with Padma Vibhushan in 2015, which he returned in 2020 in protest against three farm laws.It’ll be his 13th poll                                     #HarsimratBadal                                     #Lambi                                     #ParkashSinghBadal                                     #SAD                                     #SukhbirBadal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sr-badal-sad-nominee-from-lambi-oldest-in-fray-364795
28-01-2022||Jupinderjit Singh||Navjot Singh Sidhu vs Bikram Singh Majithia: Mother of all battles in Amritsar East||Chandigarh, January 27The Amritsar-East constituency has become the hottest seat with the Shiromani Akali Dal announcing on Tuesday to field drugs smuggling accused Akali leader and ex-minister Bikram Singh Majithia against sitting MLA and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.With a “down-but-not-out” attitude, Majithia had last week hinted that he would be ready to contest against Sidhu, who he accused of conspiring to falsely implicate him in the drugs smuggling case. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced his candidature in Amritsar. Immediately, media and political analysts touted the contest between the two leaders as the mother of all battles in Punjab. The Akalis have been defensive since the drugs smuggling case against Majithia with party leaders preferring to fight the allegations legally. However, in a sudden change, the party adopted an aggressive move and field Majithia. He will contest from his home constituency Majitha also.It is not only going to be high-adrenaline contest, going by the decade-old rivalry between the two leaders, but also of much political significance for the state. Navjot Sidhu is keen on becoming the Chief Minister face of the Congress but will lose the claim if he tastes defeat at the hands of Majithia. On the other hand, Majithia risks loss of face against his bitter rival if he does not return victorious. He looks at the victory as validation of his claims that he was falsely implicated and won in the court of people.The history of the seat does not augur well for the Akali leader. SAD had last won from the seat in 1951. Since then, the seat has been the stronghold of the Congress and the BJP. Sidhu won in 2017 on the Congress ticket, pocketing almost little more than 60 per cent votes. His wife was elected from the seat in 2012. Sidhu had led from the segment while winning the Lok Sabha poll thrice from the Amritsar, including a byelection.PCC chief won 2017 polls                                     #BikramMajithia                                     #NavjotSidhu||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-vs-bikram-singh-majithia-mother-of-all-battles-in-amritsar-east-364794
28-01-2022||Vishav Bharti||Punjab Assembly poll: Turncoats dominate BJP's second list too||Chandigarh, January 27The BJP today released the second list of 30 candidates for Punjab. If one-third of the first list of the BJP contained turncoats, the saffron party has preferred them over its traditional workers in the second list too.The list reads more like that of SAD and Congress candidates. However, its prominent face Harjit Singh Grewal, who had been mediating between the Centre and farmers on the three laws, is so far missing from the list. While talking to The Tribune, Grewal said: “My party has decided some other role for me. I welcome the party leadership’s decision.”Congress’ sitting MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa has been fielded from Batala; MLA Harjot Kamal from Moga, All-India Sikh Student Federation ex-chief Kuldeep Singh Kahlon from Dera Baba Nanak, Pradeep Singh Bhullar from Majitha and Jalandhar ex-Mayor Surinder Mahey from Kartarpur Sahib.Former SAD leaders who have been named in the second list include Sarbjit Singh Makkar from Jalandhar Cantt, Darshan Singh Shivjot from Chamkaur Sahib and Gurpeet Singh Shahpur from Nabha. Jagdish Kumar Jagga, who joined the BJP after leaving the Punjab Lok Congress, is a nominee from Rajpura. He has been preferred over Harjeet Singh Grewal.

Kang claimed that barring Channi and Punjab affairs incharge Harish Chaudhary, other members of the central election committee were in his favour.Addressing a press conference, Kang said he had also written to party president Sonia Gandhi in this regard.                                     #JagmohanSinghKang                                     #Kharar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kang-threatens-to-contest-as-independent-from-kharar-364786
28-01-2022||Ravi Dhaliwal||Son denied Batala ticket, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa raises revolt against Ashwani Sekhri||Batala, January 27Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa has expressed “extreme disapproval” at the candidature of three-time former MLA Ashwani Sekhri from Batala Assembly seat.At the same time he made it clear that his son, Ravi Nandan Bajwa, may throw his hat in the ring as an Independent if the official candidate was not changed. Ravi is the incumbent chairman of Gurdaspur Zila Parishad. Tript himself had been eyeing the seat, but when he was given the ticket from Fatehgarh Churian, from where he is the sitting MLA, he triggered a rebellion against Sekhri.Sekhri has contested seven successive elections from this seat and is seen as a man carrying enough experience and expertise to win. He has triumphed on three previous occasions. It is a known fact that when he was an opposition MLA from 2012 till 2017, he used his personal equation with the then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal to arrange funds for the development of the area.On his part, despite being the incumbent legislator of Fatehgarh Churian, Tript has ushered in several projects for Batala. Residents claim that the city has seen unprecedented infrastructural growth in the last five years. This includes civic projects, including brick-lining of Hansli drain considered the lifeline of the area.Hours after the party announced the candidature of Sekhri, Tript and his acolytes, including Mayor Sukhdeep Singh Teja and a dozen councillors, went on an overdrive to impress upon the high command the futility of fielding Sekhri. He claimed that “he was a sure shot winner going by the development works he had carried out.” Insiders claim that with Tript having a sizable following in the area, Ravi could play the spoiler for Sekhri.                                     #TriptRajinderBajwa||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/son-denied-batala-ticket-tript-rajinder-singh-bajwa-raises-revolt-against-ashwani-sekhri-364785
28-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Rahul Gandhi's bid to counter Opposition attack over Punjab CM face||Chandigarh, January 27Amid mounting pressure on the Congress high command to declare the CM face for the Assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi today aimed to counter the Opposition’s narrative and, at the same time, kept the pot boiling for two stakeholders Chief Minister Channi and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.After Channi and Sidhu urged the former party president to announce the CM face, Rahul said he would soon announce it after talking to party leaders and workers. At the same time, he managed to publicly get commitment from both leaders that they would abide by the decision of the party high command, irrespective of the choice.Party insiders said in what appears to be a pre-planned course of action, Rahul is learnt to have got an assurance from them on abiding by the party decision before the virtual rally. At the rally, Channi and Sidhu were seen complimenting each other.By praising Channi and agreeing to Sidhu’s model on revenue generation by checking evasion of government revenue from liquor, sand mining, transport and cable TV business, Rahul kept both leaders in high spirits.“It will be wrong if the party high command drops Channi as the CM face as it will impact the Dalit vote bank. It will also be wrong to think that the party will not face the fallout by not announcing Sidhu as the CM face. The PCC chief has repeatedly said he should not be used to win elections and be given some decision-making powers,” said a senior party leader.Channi and Sidhu put up a united front by embracing each other on the stage.                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #NavjotSidhu                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #RahulGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rahul-gandhis-bid-to-counter-opposition-attack-over-punjab-cm-face-364784
28-01-2022||---||Charanjit Singh Channi or Navjot Sidhu? Decision soon, says Rahul Gandhi||Jalandhar/Amritsar, January 27On his daylong visit to the state, former AICC chief Rahul Gandhi today said he would soon announce the chief ministerial candidate for the state Assembly elections.Addressing a virtual rally in Jalandhar, Rahul said either of the two — Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi or PCC chief Navjot Sidhu — would be picked. He said opinion would be sought from the party workers before making the announcement.Rahul said he discussed the issue with both Sidhu and Channi on his way to the venue. “They told me the biggest question everyone is asking in Punjab is who of the two will take the lead. There cannot be two leaders. If one gets the chance, the other one will pledge support for him. I was really happy with it. So, I thought that if the party leaders, workers and Punjab want it, we will take the decision. We will do it by seeking the opinion of our workers and I want everyone to fight as a team.”Prior to his speech both Sidhu and Channi set the narrative in this direction. Sidhu said: “People are asking who will be the leader to put forth the party agenda. I will accept your decision. Meinu darshani ghoda na bana dena (Do not make me a mere showpiece).”Starting his speech with the verses of Guru Ravidass, Channi told Rahul, “If you have liked my 111 days of CMship, a thought could be given for the next five years.” He was, however, quick to change his stance, “You have already given too much to someone whose family has not even had anyone even as an MLA. Pick anyone as CM face. I assure you my full support.” At this, he invited Sidhu near him on the dais and hugged him. Sidhu responded with a warm gesture as ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Pargat Singh also came along.Rahul also spoke on many plans already put forth by Sidhu in his Punjab Model for the past few days.Affirming that his party would give a push to the industry, Rahul said, “We want ‘Made in Punjab’ labels to go popular.” On governance, he said, “We will start single window system for 160 services under ‘Sarkar aapke dwaar’ project. We will focus on decentralisation.” On women issues, he said, “I have suggested that a dedicated women manifesto must be released with two-three main promises”.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi along with party’s all candidates kicked off the election campaign after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple here today. He also paid tributes to martyrs at the Jallianwala Bagh, before visiting Durgiana Mandir and Bhagwan Valmiki Tirath temple.Rahul landed at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport, Amritsar, at 12.30 pm from where he directly reached the Golden Temple. Unlike his June 2017 visit when he opted to stand in a queue meant for common devotees, he gained access from the VIP lane to the sanctum sanctorum and offered ‘rumala’ and ‘karah parshad deg’ at the shrine. In acknowledgement, SGPC staffers presented him a ‘sehra’ (a garland). Congress leader Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachchar presented him a ‘kirpan’. He also listened to the kirtan for some time.He was flanked by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, Deputy CMs OP Soni and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. During the course of his visit, he kept on sharing his experience through tweets in Hindi.Eight of nine MPs not presentOf a total of eight Congress MPs, only Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla accompanied Rahul. Punjab Lok Congress leader Amarinder Singh’s wife Preneet Kaur (Patiala), Manish Tewari (Anandpur Sahib), Ravneet Singh Bittu (Ludhiana), Jasbir Singh Gill (Khadoor Sahib), Mohammad Sadique (Faridkot), Chaudhry Santokh Singh (Jalandhar) and Amar Singh (Fatehgarh Sahib) were conspicuous by their absence. Congress leaders said most MPs were busy with their prior commitments. The Khadoor Sahib MP clarified due to his personal obligations he was not able to attend the Amritsar function and for this he had already informed his leadership, ‘no assumptions please’.There can’t be two chiefsThey (Channi & Sidhu) told me the biggest question everyone is asking in Punjab is who of the two will take the lead. There cannot be two chiefs. If one gets the chance, the other one will pledge support for him.

While Mohit Mohindra has been named from Patiala Rural (Brahm Mohindra’s current seat), Lal Singh’s son Rajinder Singh, the sitting MLA from Samana, has been re-nominated.Asked whether the party has not already bent this rule by fielding both former CM Rajinder Bhattal and her son-in-law Vikram Bajwa, sources said, “You cannot penalise someone for marrying into a political family. Vikram Bajwa has his own politics and could not have been denied a ticket just because he married the former CM’s daughter. Fielding father and son is different from fielding mother-in-law and son-in-law.”AICC in charge Punjab Harish Chaudhary and screening panel chairman Ajay Maken will again meet tomorrow to take the call on whether to relax the ‘one family one ticket’ rule for Patiala and the list is likely to be released on Friday.“If the rule is bent for Patiala no one will mind. It is a unique seat,” a source said, adding that there was a growing input to field a Hindu face from Patiala and these factors were still under discussion.Earlier, the Congress has denied tickets to two members from one family. CM Charanjit Channi’s brother was seeking a nomination from Bassi Pathana but the sitting MLA was named; minister Tript Bajwa wanted a ticket for his son as did minister Rana Gurjeet.In Barnala, the party remains divided between fielding former MLA Kewal Dhillon and ex Union minister Pawan Bansal’s son with sources saying Bansal’s son had the backing of Punjab’s top industrial houses while Dhillon had an edge with local organisational support. “These issues are being discussed,” said party sources.In Nawanshahr, the Congress has to decide whether to field a fresh face instead of sitting MLA Angad Saini, whose wife Aditi Singh, Rae Bareli MLA, recently joined the BJP challenging the Gandhis.“The party is considering whether to field Angad Saini’s mother or opt for a new face,” a source said, indicating Angad Saini could be dropped.In Khemkaran, the dilemma lingers on whether to rename sitting MLA Sukhpal Bhullar who is being opposed by Punjab Congress campaign in charge Sunil Jakhar and in Attari, sitting MLA Tarsem DC has massive anti-incumbency.Other pending seats are Ludhiana South, Jalalabad and Bhadaur.                                     #BrahmMohindra                                     #CaptAmarinderSingh                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cong-dilemma-in-patiala-continues-list-delayed-364759

The previous chargesheet was filed in July 2020 by then SIT head DIG RS Khatra. In 2018, the CBI had also conducted a probe into the case of theft of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. It had given a clean chit to the accused.Khatra had reportedly not taken into account evidence collected by the CBI. On January 4 last year, while issuing orders to replace Khatra following a plea by the accused, the High Court had asked the police to take CBI probe into account and file a supplementary challan. In the present chargesheet, the SIT has incorporated the evidence collected by the CBI, said IGP Parmar.The SIT had last year visited Sunaria jail in Rohtak twice to question Ram Rahim in the sacrilege cases. The SIT has so far arrested seven dera followers. All of them are out on bail. While Ram Rahim is lodged in jail, three other accused Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri have been declared proclaimed offenders.                                      #DeraSachaSauda                                     #GurmeetRamRahim                                     #GuruGranthSahib                                     #sacrilege                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sacrilege-chargesheet-filed-against-ram-rahim-364761

We will hear the matter on Monday,” A Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told senior advocate P Chidambaram, who represented the Punjab Government.The interim order in favour of Majithia came after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi submitted on his behalf that “this was a case of political vendetta”. “I don’t know if this is election fever or election virus. Everyone is rushing to the court now… Is this fair, Mr Chidambaram?” the CJI asked. “The order (of HC) was passed on January 24....Thereafter, he went into hiding,”Chidambaram replied. Majithia apprehended his arrest in connection with a case under the NDPS Act registered at Mohali on December 20, 2021. He alleged that the FIR was filed against him due to political reasons.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had on January 24 rejected his anticipatory bail plea, but granted him protection from coercive action for three days to enable him to approach the Supreme Court.“The present case is blatantly political in nature and has been registered with a mala fide objective to target the petitioner, who is a mainstream leader of opposition party, one month prior to polls in the state,” Majithia submitted. —                                     #BikramMajithia                                     #DrugsCase||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/majithia-gets-sc-protection-against-arrest-till-jan-31-364762

Today’s decision has rekindled a hope in the community that all guilty will be punishment,” Sirsa said. He has urged the HC to direct the SIT to take action against Kamal Nath in an FIR lodged in 1984 at Parliament Street police station in which five persons were named and were allegedly accommodated at the Congress leader’s house.The case is related to a mob of rioters storming the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib here.

Justice Vivek Puri asserted prior consent for sexual acts would not extend to future occasions, if two persons were previously involved in a consensual sexual relationship.Prior sexual consent will not extend“Even on the assumption that if two persons previously had consensual sexual relationship for any reason whatsoever, the consent of prior sexual acts will not extend to future occasions. It cannot be construed as a circumstance to conclude that the accused gets a right to perpetually exploit the prosecutrix”.“The withdrawal of the consent effectively nullifies the earlier consent and forcibly sexual intercourse becomes non-consensual, attracting the penal provisions of Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code,” Justice Puri asserted.The ruling came in a case where the accused made attempts to build up a case of “consensual relationship” and claimed he was in a live-in-relationship with the complainant — a 35-year-old divorcee. His counsel argued the case was registered with in “oblique motive of extortion out of a failed love affair”. In an attempt to buttress his contentions, the petitioner-accused placed on record certain photographs.Justice Puri asserted it may be true that the law acknowledged live-in-relationship. But it was, at the same time, required to be borne in mind that the law also acknowledged a woman’s right to have sexual relationship.The crime of rape consisted of committing sexual act without consent or against a person’s will. “Even on the assumption that if two persons previously had consensual sexual relationship for any reason whatsoever, the consent of prior sexual acts will not extend to future occasions. It cannot be construed as a circumstance to conclude that the accused gets a right to perpetually exploit the prosecutrix”.Referring to the facts of the case in hand, Justice Puri asserted the FIR was silent about any consent at any occasion on the part of prosecutrix. Rather, forcible sexual intercourse was alleged. The photographs may indicate that the prosecutrix was known to the petitioner, but it could not be prima facie concluded that the prosecutrix had been a consenting party.Justice Puri added the investigation was complete and challan had been presented. But the charge was yet to be framed and the prosecutrix was yet to be examined. The defence version that the prosecutrix was a consenting party could not be accepted at the current stage. It was to be substantiated during the course of trial after the examination of the prosecutrix.“Although there are observations in the MLR of the prosecutrix that she was in a consensual relationship with the petitioner for past one year, it has also been mentioned that on July 5, 2021, she was physically assaulted and sexually abused. Moreover, the consensual relationship at earlier point of time becomes insignificant in view of the observations already recorded,” Justice Puri ruled, while dismissing the plea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-means-no-even-after-initial-yes-in-rape-case-hc-364768
28-01-2022||Deepkamal Kaur||Congress will soon announce party's CM face in Punjab: Rahul Gandhi||Jalandhar, January 27Former AICC chief Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he would soon announce the Chief Ministerial candidate for Punjab Assembly polls.Addressing a virtual rally at a palace on Mithapur road here falling in Jalandhar Cantonment seat, Rahul said that either of the two -- Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and PPCC chief Navjot Sidhu – would be picked. He said opinion would be sought from the party workers before making the announcement.Rahul said he discussed the issue with both Sidhu and Channi on his way to the venue. Both were of the opinion that two persons cannot lead Punjab. They told me, “The biggest question everyone is asking in Punjab is who of the two will take the lead. There cannot be two leaders. If one gets the chance, the other one will pledge support for him. I was really happy with it. So, I thought that if the party leaders, workers and Punjab want it, we will take the decision. We will do it by seeking the opinion of our workers and I want everyone to fight as a team.”Prior to his speech both Sidhu and Channi set the narrative in this direction. Sidhu said, “People are asking who will be the leader to put forth the party agenda. I will accept ever other decision of yours. Meinu darshani ghoda na bana dena (Do not make me a mere showpiece).”Starting his speech with the verses of Guru Ravidass, Channi told Rahul, “If you have liked my 111 days of CMship, a thought could be given for the next five years.” He was, however, quick to change his stance, “You have already given too much to someone whose family has not even had anyone even as an MLA. Pick anyone as CM face. I assure you my full support. This is the demand of Punjab today. Other parties mocking at us that our marriage procession does not have a groom. They say that we are fighting. Let them all say it.”At this, he invited Sidhu near him on the dais and hugged him. Sidhu responded with a warm gesture as ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Pargat Singh also came along.In his speech, Rahul said while coming here today, an idea came to his mind, “The name of the state -- Punjab includes Congress symbol ‘Panja’ (hand).” On the recent farmer agitation, he said, “The farmers never wanted those farm laws. They want revolution not evolution.” He spoke on many plans already put forth by Sidhu in his Punjab Model for the past few days.Affirming that his party would give a push to the industry, Rahul said, “We want ‘Made in Punjab’ labels to go popular.”On governance, he said, “We will start single window system for 160 services under ‘Sarkar aapke dwaar’ project. We will focus on decentralisation.” On women issues, Rahul said, “I have suggested that a dedicated women manifesto must be released with two-three main promises.”                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-will-take-decision-on-cm-face-for-punjab-after-discussions-with-party-workers-rahul-gandhi-364723
