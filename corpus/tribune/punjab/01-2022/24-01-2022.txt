But the way he is talking, I feel it is shameful. He has occupied a constitutional post and was chief minister, it is wrong to speak like this...to grab headlines and remain in the news....”“Today the issues in Punjab are of farmers, of MSP (minimum support price of crops) and of unemployment. By raising such issues, one can only divert attention and that is what he is trying to do,” the Congress leader said.At a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, former chief minister Singh claimed he had got a message from Pakistan to reinstate Navjot Singh Sidhu in his government because he was an old friend of their prime minister.Singh, who has floated a new party after leaving the Congress and is fighting next month’s Punjab assembly polls in an alliance with the BJP, said he was told that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan would be grateful if he could keep Sidhu in the government.“I removed Mr Sidhu from the job, the man was totally incompetent, incapable and totally useless. In seventy days he didn’t complete a file. I told him I don’t want you in my government.“Then several weeks later I got a message from somebody we both know, he knows and also I know. I got a message from Pakistan that the prime minister (Imran Khan) has sent a request that if you can take Sidhu in your cabinet, he will be grateful. Sidhu is an old friend of his. And if he doesn’t work you can remove him,” Singh said.Sidhu was dropped by Singh from his cabinet during his tenure as the state’s chief minister and did not enjoy good ties with the cricketer-turned-politician.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinders-pakistan-charge-against-sidhu-an-attempt-to-divert-attention-congress-364063

He was earlier elected from this seat in 2012 and 2017.Family members of several other contestants in the fray for the February 20 Punjab Assembly polls are going door to door to garner support for the coming elections.With a ban on big gatherings and rallies by the Election Commission of India in view of Covid, family members of candidates are meeting voters personally to ensure they vote for their contestants.Aekom exudes confidence that voters of Gidderbaha will vote for her father for the “unprecedented” development works carried out during the last 10 years and make him victorious again.“My father did what he promised to the people of the area,” she says while adding that she is getting a very good response from the people.An elderly man in a village even praises Warring for ensuring water to his fields when the teenager visits his house.A few days back Aekom inaugurated the poll office of her father in Gidderbaha.Warring became the transport minister when Charanjit Singh Channi took over as chief minister last September.Simrat Kaur Khangura, wife of Congress candidate Dalvir Singh Goldy, is also touring her husband's assembly constituency to garner support.Goldy, who is a sitting MLA, will again contest from Dhuri assembly segment.

I frequently go to them and get a warm welcome,” she says.On how she views Bhagwant Mann as a contestant against her husband, Khangura says she does not see him anywhere.She claims Mann, a two-time MP from Sangrur Lok Sabha seat, visited Dhuri constituency only twice in 2014 and 2019 during the Lok Sabha polls.“Bhagwant Mann has not been seen in this constituency,” Khangura told PTI.The AAP leader does not have anything to say for what he did for this area, she adds.She says her husband Goldy has done a lot of development work including setting up several sports grounds, smart schools and upgrading some schools in Dhuri constituency.Dhuri is one of the assembly constituencies which fall under Sangrur parliamentary constituency.Punjab goes to polls on February 20 and is set for a multi-cornered contest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/family-members-pitch-in-for-those-contesting-punjab-assembly-polls-363999

We had no way of knowing that we had violated your border,” he said.Pakistan and India regularly arrest rival fishermen for violating the maritime boundary which is poorly marked at some points.According to the lists of prisoners exchanged by India and Pakistan at the start of this year, at least 628 Indian prisoners were held in Pakistan -  51 civilians and 577 fishermen.The Indian government also shared the list of 355 Pakistani prisoners in India - 282 civilians and 73 fishermen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pakistan-to-hand-over-20-indian-fishermen-to-india-at-wagah-363994

They represent both segments. The idea was to encourage people to vote, especially those with disability, the first-timers and the elders in the above 80 group. They will be provided transport to reach special booths meant for PwDs, where special arrangement of ramp, wheelchair, water and toilet facilities with proper signage have been made for their convenience. The entire process will be documented to be part of the government gazette,” he said.Born on June 14, 2003, at a New Delhi’s hospital, Sohna and Mohna were conjoined below the torso, having one pair of legs. They have two hearts, two pair of arms, kidneys and spinal cords, but only one liver and gall bladder.As their parents refused to accept them, they were brought at Pingalwara Home in Amritsar. Dr Inderjit Kaur, head of the Pingalwara Society, says both brothers had different minds, opinions and choices. They are two brains in one body.The twins have an ITI diploma (electrical) and were recently appointed as Regular T Mate (RTM) at the 66-kV PSPCL office near the Dental College Amritsar. However, technically they would be drawing one salary on the name of Sohna only, but as far as voting was concerned, they would be treated as two individuals.Khaira said: “They were registered by the Election Commission and will be able to cast their votes in the Assembly election this time,” he said.Now, the officials have been working out on the modalities to comply with the technical issues dealing with the ‘secret ballot norms’, as no other person can be present when one is casting his or her vote.“As the twin brothers are conjoined in such a way that their heads are in the same direction, one could be made blindfolded when the other one would be casting his vote,” said the officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/sohna-mohna-roped-in-as-role-models-to-encourage-people-to-come-out-vote-363931

Cartons are being stocked at sugarcane fields and tubewells of loyalists.This brand can be sold only in Chandigarh. “Anybody found to be carrying it in Punjab is liable to be prosecuted,” said Gurdaspur SSP Nanak Singh.Insiders claim that UK-1 is flowing freely in election-bound Punjab. “However hard we may try, it is an insurmountable task to check its availability because of the elaborate network put in place by carriers,” said a senior officer. The Batala police yesterday seized 80 cartons of UK-1 from a Fortuner car at Shikhala village in Sri Hargobindpur. The cops were acting on a specific tip-off. Senior SAD leader Bikram Majithia claimed that the consignment was to be delivered to a prominent candidate.Batala SSP Gaurav Toora said, “All forward and backward linkages with the named politician are being probed.” Officers claim in the election time they normally receive inside information about liquor being illegally stored from rival candidates. “We have tangible information that the UK-1 brand of liquor will be distributed by the candidates during the polls as it is available at a cheap rate in Chandigarh. We are using our network of informers to zero-in on the storage places,” said an officer. The police are also keeping an eye on liquor being produced illegally by bootleggers. The villages located on the banks of river Beas are being keenly watched. The Batala hooch tragedy of August, 2020, in which more than a hundred people lost their lives, is still playing on the minds of the law enforcement officers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cops-in-tizzy-banned-liquor-brand-makes-way-into-state-363834

With the Vidhan Sabha elections again round the corner, politicians are back to their best, including a slew of promises on the Ghaggar.Politicians have been milking the issue of floods and pollution to fight electoral battles in Patiala and Sangrur districts for the past almost two decades without offering any permanent solution. In the past three decades, floods in Ghaggar have caused losses in hundreds of villages.“Though MLA and MP candidates promise end to our suffering, nothing concrete has ever been done,” said Ghanaur resident Gurinder Lalli. Besides floods, many residents of villages alongside the polluted Ghaggar face cancer problem. Many villages have cancer patients. The Ghaggar originates in Himachal Pradesh and flows from Punjab and Haryana into Rajasthan.“To stop the devastation in its area, Haryana has constructed a toe wall on the 4-km stretch from where the Ghaggar flows into the state. Every monsoon, we suffer losses to life and property while pollution is killing us slowly,” said Amaninder Singh from Hashampur Mangta, a tail-end village. “We will work to widen and strengthen its banks to ensure that floods can be controlled,” said Ghanaur MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur.                                     #Ghaggar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ghaggar-floods-key-issue-in-sangrur-patiala-363840

Another issue that has cropped up is that SAD (Sanyukt) wanted to contest from 20 segments, but have been offered just 15 seats in the alliance.Sources revealed that SAD (Sanyukt) has also conveyed to the top BJP leadership that undue weightage has been given to Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Lok Congress.The sources revealed that SAD (Sanyukt) leaders conveyed to the saffron party that they have been denied those constituencies, where Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) has strong presence.A senior leader on condition of anonymity said denying ticket to SAD (Sanyukt) in Badal strong hold would only help the latter.The sources revealed that when the seat sharing formula was finalised, leaders of all the three parties did not sit together, but BJP’s top brass held seperate meetings with PLC and SAD (Sanyukt) leaders and allocated the seats.                                     #ParminderDhindsa                                     #PunjabLokCongress                                     #Punjabpolls2022                                     #SADSanyukt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fissures-appear-in-bjp-alliance-over-seat-sharing-363844

24-01-2022||Gurdaspur||Punjab Diary: Joy & sorrow together||Shifting loyaltiesAmritsar: The 2022 Assembly poll has seen a spike in turncoats. Residents are shocked to learn about leaders shifting loyalties in search of tickets. Prominent leaders who switched over include Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia, Sarchand Singh, Harjinder Singh Thekedar, Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar and Ashwani Kumar Navi Bhagat. Lalli Majithia, who moved from the Congress to the AAP, will contest from the Majitha segment. Lalli’s brother, Jagwinder Pal Singh, alias Jagga Majithia (60), has been given Congress ticket. Sarchand Singh, an aide of senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia, joined BJP. Harjinder Singh Thekedar, who had won from Amritsar South constituency in 2002, switched over to Punjab Lok Congress. Ashwani Kumar Navi Bhagat, a sitting Congress councillor from ward number 14, which falls in the Amritsar North segment joined the SAD.Late night surpriseFerozepur: Late night calls are often annoying, but advocate Rajnish Dahiya’s joy knew no bounds. Dahiya, who was denied ticket from the Ferozepur (Rural) segment, got a surprise call from AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal while he was sleeping. To his utter surprise, Kejriwal told him that he will be an AAP candidate. Following the brief conversation, his nomination letter was released in the night itself. Earlier, AAP had allocated ticket to Ashu Banger, who, switched over to the Congress. The AAP went into the disaster management control and within a few hours named Dahiya as their candidate.Love for white jeepMuktsar: A white Wrangler Rubicon jeep seems to have caught the fancy of SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal. Though he mostly travels in a bulletproof vehicle, yet for the last few months he is canvassing for the party candidates in this jeep. Sources say Sukhbir finds it comfortable to come out from the Jeep’s roof during campaigning. Some others say it can be a lucky charm as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/joy-sorrow-together-363850

24-01-2022||CM Charanjit Channi||Coordinated attack, elite don't want me at helm: Punjab CM Charanjit Channi||You are being accused of illegal sand mining. What do you have to say in your defence?They (Opposition parties) all have united against me, be it Aam Aadmi Party’s Arvind Kejriwal or Shiromani Akali Dal’s Bikram Singh Majithia. They are being openly supported by the BJP. They don’t see any rival, except Channi, and want to finish me of politically. Enforcement Directorate (ED) raids are part of a big plan, which has been tried elsewhere earlier. Wherever the Centre is scared of the Opposition, raids happen. It was evident in West Bengal, Maharashtra and even Tamil Nadu. I am not connected with the illegal sand mining even remotely. They are targeting me and my family because they see our government coming back to power. All attempts are being made to corner me. I am prepared for the fight. People will help me. I am being victimised as the elite class does not want a common man at the helm. It is a coordinated attack on me.Also read: AAP seeks time from Punjab Governor on illegal mining issueIllegal mining: No clean chit to anyone yet, says Navjot SidhuNothing to do with illegal sand miningED raids have a pattern. These were also carried out in West Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. I have nothing to do with illegal sand mining. They are targeting me and my family because they see our party returning to power.Why will Opposition parties collude against you?They all are having sleepless nights over Channi. Adjustments are being made even while picking candidates. Their lists of candidates prove that. They have understood that they cannot win separately, so they have joined hands. They are strategically facilitating one another in attacking me. But people of Punjab are intelligent and can see through their game plan. Results will show that. In several constituencies, SAD and AAP workers are helping each other only to keep Congress and Channi out. My party is firmly standing by me.Ready for the fightI am being victimised as the elite don’t want a common man like me at the helm. I’m ready for the fight. CS Channi, CM, PunjabWhat do you have to say about pictures being circulated linking your name with illegal sand mining?Let them say what they want. Pictures don’t prove anything. Leaders like Kejriwal, in the past, have made wild allegations against Arun Jaitley, Nitin Gadkari and Bikram Singh Majithia. After the elections, he had to apologise to all of them. It will be the same in our case. I have in fact brought down the rates of sand prices at the khuds where it was sold at Rs 22 per square foot. It is now available for Rs 5 per square foot.But it is not available at Rs 5 per square foot to the common man.I am talking about the price at the source in the khuds, and you are talking about the price that consumers pay. This is high because of several factors, including charges paid to transporters. I had instructed Deputy Commissioners to pass on the benefit to consumers well before the elections were announced.Has announcement of CM face been delayed because of the sand mining controversy?Last time, the CM face was announced 15 days before the elections. This time we still have 25 days. There is no relation between the sand mining controversy and naming of the chief ministerial candidate. This will be decided by the high command.Has ban on physical rallies impacted the poll campaign?Yesterday, I had gone to Balachaur. Thousands of people came at the grain market. Hands folded, I told them that I could not address a large gathering.What are the achievements you are highlighting?We are projecting the work done by our government in 111 days. Electricity and water charges of consumers have been cut. So have petrol (by Rs 10/litre) and diesel (by Rs 5/ litre). We carried out at least 150 notifications of the work done. People know that we can transform Punjab.The party’s ‘one family, one ticket’ norm has triggered dissent. Your comment.The ‘one family, one ticket’ norm is the party’s decision and we all respect it. At the same time, I must admit that the decision may affect victory chances at some seats, including Batala.What does Punjab need the most at this juncture?Punjab needs a good administrator and a leader who is accessible. Former CM Capt Amarinder Singh closed shop at 4 pm. Another leader shuts shop at 6 pm. There is a difference between performing on stage and running a state. Bhagwant Mann swore on his mother’s name that he would give up liquor and Capt Amarinder swore by Gutka Sahib that he would change the face of Punjab, but failed.Do you see Bhagwant Mann as a threat?Bhagwant Mann is no threat at all. He is a dummy CM face. He does not have the requisite experience and capability whereas I have set a new benchmark for politicians on how to run the government efficiently. I have made officers work hard in the past three months. Sukhbir Badal as CM face does not have even 10 per cent acceptability.                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #IllegalMining||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coordinated-attack-elite-dont-want-me-at-helm-charanjit-singh-channi-chief-minister-punjab-363826
