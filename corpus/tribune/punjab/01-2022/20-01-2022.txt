20-01-2022||Chandigarh||ED raids busted Channi’s common man image: Opposition||The BJP and the SAD on Thursday targeted Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, saying the recovery of crores of rupees from his nephew’s premises by the Enforcement Directorate has busted his common man image.Both parties asked Channi to explain the seizure of money from his nephew’s residence, a day after the Punjab CM alleged that efforts are being made to “trap” him in a false case.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday had said it seized Rs 10 crore in cash, including about Rs 8 crore from the premises of Channi’s relative.  The raids were conducted in connection with an anti-money laundering investigation against illegal sand mining operations in the poll-bound state.In a statement, the ED had said “incriminating documents” related to illegal sand mining and property transactions, mobile phones, gold worth more than Rs 21 lakh and a Rolex watch worth Rs 12 lakh were also seized.Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma on Thursday said the seizure of cash, gold and an expensive watch has busted the “false image” of a humble common man cultivated by the CM.He asked the Punjab CM to refrain from making statements that he is being targeted because he belongs to the Scheduled Caste community.“Corruption has no religion and the BJP will never tolerate it. Our party follows zero tolerance to corruption,” said Sharma, adding that law enforcement agencies should reach to the roots of the crime.Former union minister and Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal alleged that Channi’s family members “minted crore of rupees through illegal sand mining during his 111-day stint as the CM”.In Bathinda, Harsimrat Badal alleged, “Now, after the Enforcement Directorate raids on the residence of the chief minister’s nephew and recovery of money and goods, it is very much clear that the sand mafia in the state is being run by Mr Channi.”  She demanded that the “self-proclaimed poor” chief minister should tell Punjabis how his relative was found to be in possession of the money.The Bathinda MP said during the last five years, the Congress government had completely “ruined” Punjab.“All development works started by the erstwhile government led by Parkash Singh Badal were stalled. The government reneged on all promises made to each and every section of society,” she said.“The poor and Scheduled Castes section of society were oppressed with social welfare schemes being severely pruned and even closed altogether,” she said in a party statement. —                                     #CharanjitChanni                                     #Congress                                     #Punjab                                     #Punjabpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ed-raids-busted-channis-common-man-image-opposition-362989

Kaypee has alleged that Pargat had made ex-BSP leader Sukhwinder Singh Kotli join the party during a rally of Punjab CM Charanjit Channi in his Cantt constituency and supported his candidature from Adampur.Kaypee is reportedly of the view that Pargat has conspired against him and made him go out of contest. He has said that he would definitely enter the fray and it could be Jalandhar Cantonment against sitting party MLA Pargat Singh.As many as 35 sarpanches of the Cantt villages, too, had reportedly met Kaypee at his place in Model Town, which is a part of Jalandhar Cantonment constituency. They said they would openly support him even if he would contest as a rebel. Kaypee has been maintaining that several villages of Cantt constituency have been a part of his Jalandhar South constituency that he represented prior to the delimitation of the Assembly areas. Even his father Darshan S Kaypee had contested from this seat.Reacting on the development, Pargat said: “I have talked to Kaypee twice since the list of candidates came. I got to know that he is angry with me and I have tried to clarify that I have nothing against him. I was never a part of the screening committee. I practically have no power to get his ticket cancelled. I am trying his best to get him pacified and I believe that he will agree to what I have said.”Some Congress insiders have said that it was a part of the strategy of Kaypee to rake up the matter and threaten the minister so as to put pressure on the high command for a review of the ticket list and to adjust him from some seat. District Congress president Balraj Thakur has said he was busy in another programme of the party and could not mediate between the two leaders. “There could be some confusion on the matter. We will sort it out soon,” he said.                                     #MohinderSinghKaypee                                     #PargatSingh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/kaypee-threatens-to-contest-against-pargat-from-cantt-362843

According to information, many beneficiaries have allegedly got the vaccination certificates without taking a jab.Sources said the department had been suggested to change the passwords of the login IDs that were issued for entering the vaccination data.Officials from the department said over 200 login IDs had been issued in the district to get an access of the Covid vaccination portal. The IDs were also shared with those private persons who had to be hired for few days, owing to the strike of health staff in last month, said the department. Sources said the person who made fake entries, must be possessing the login information to the vaccination portal.According to the Health Department, there is a difference of thousands between the data available on the online portal and that with the Patiala Health Department. The vaccination count on the Central Government portal – CoWIN – is higher as compared to the state department’s data.District Immunisation Officer Dr Veenu Goyal said the issue had already been brought into their notice and steps were being taken to stop such practice.

The plan has been formulated on the basis of deliberations and inputs from the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Ministry of Education, Defence, Health Department and others.These 18 districts figure in the list of 272 districts in the nation that the Centre had declared ‘most affected districts’ in terms of drug abuse and addiction. The districts include Faridkot, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Ludhiana, Mansa, Moga, Pathankot, Sangrur, Patiala, Muktsar, SBS Nagar, Tarn Taran and Hoshiarpur.The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment had identified the vulnerable districts based on the findings of a national survey on the extent and pattern of substance use in the country from the supply point of view as provided by the NCB.As per the action plan, school principals are told to maintain a list of shops of cigarettes, beedis and other tobacco products operating within 100 yards radius of their school as per Section 6 of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act. The list shall be shared with the DEOs, who should share it with the district magistrates.Upon receiving the list, the local authorities and police, will issue order to take appropriate corrective action to ensure that no cigarettes/beedis or any other tobacco product shops exist within the radius of 100 yards of the schools/educational institutions and other institutions meant for children.Schools shall display and exhibit a board at conspicuous place(s) on the premises, prominently stating that sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products near the educational institutions is strictly prohibited and is a punishable offence. — TNSCorrective action||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/implement-plan-to-prevent-drug-abuse-among-kids-deos-told-362724

The High Court, during the course of hearing, was told that seven criminal cases were pending investigation against sitting and erstwhile MPs and MLAs in Punjab, including senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia.An affidavit carrying the details was placed before the Division Bench of Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Sandeep Moudgil by Senior Deputy Advocate-General Gaurav Garg Dhuriwala.The affidavit by Punjab Inspector-General of Police, Bureau of Investigation, Gursharan Singh Sandhu, said cases were pending against MLAs Pawan Kumar Tinu, Gurpartap Singh Wadala, Baldev Singh Khehra, Balwinder Singh Bains and Simarjit Singh Bains, besides ex-MLAs Anil Joshi, Malkeet Singh AR, Ajit Singh Kohar and Virsa Singh Valtoha.The admonition and submissions came just two months after the Bench was assured that all efforts were being made to expedite the process of investigation and conclude the same. As the matter came up for resumed hearing, the Bench asserted status reports had been submitted in compliance of earlier order. But the assurances given on the last date of hearing and recorded in the order dated November 11, 2021, had not been fulfilled in toto.“We would not say that the intention on the part of the states of Punjab or Haryana is lacking, but the efforts and actions supporting the intention appear to be missing or at least lagging. The reports as have been submitted indicate movement in the right direction, but the pace thereof is moving cannot be, by any stretch of imagination, said to be satisfactory,” the Bench added.Before parting with the case, the Bench took note of a request made by the counsel for the states of Punjab and Haryana for “some time” to submit the further progress and status in the pending cases for investigation.Accepting the request, the Bench fixed March 28 for further hearing in the matter.The Bench was hearing suo motu or Court on its own motion matter “In Re: Special Courts for MPs/MLAs” for monitoring the progress of cases pending against the MP/MLAs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-raps-punjab-haryana-for-tardy-investigation-against-legislators-362723

Neither the SAD nor the Congress has done enough. Six years since the first case, the probe is still on. How much more time is needed? Justice Ranjit Singh (retd)Clamour for justiceVarious probes by the SITs into the sacrilege cases made little headway, leaving the public clamouring for justice. Justice SS Sodhi, former Chief Justice of Allahabad HCJust a month before the state goes to the elections where sacrilege is a burning issue, Justice Ranjit Singh launched his book ‘The Sacrilege’ (Unistar Books) on Wednesday. In a special note at the end of the books, he wrote the incidents continue to be “hot potatoes” for the government to handle.Former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court SS Sodhi and former judges Justice Nawab Singh and Justice Mahesh Grover released the book. Justice Sodhi said various investigations by the SITs into the sacrilege cases had made little headway, leaving the public clamouring for justice.In the book, Justice Ranjit Singh mentioned that he had submitted his inquiry report in a record time of 14 months but the police probe was still on. “What are they investigating now?”“Young Ajit Singh who lost movement in one of his legs has still not been given a government job and due compensation. Disciplinary action against policemen held guilty by the commission is awaited both by the government and the Ministry of Home Affairs.”Not sparing the judiciary in his book and comments made at the release, Justice Ranjit Singh said he found the judicial intervention in the cases quite extraordinary. He further said he had to bring the book out in the public domain so that truth could prevail.“The High Court has apparently gone much beyond its jurisdiction in granting blanket bail to a former DGP, who has been the main person responsible for the brutal police actions (firing on protesters). In a most unprecedented manner, the HC has stalled the probe into the case against the DGP till the state Assembly elections. It has failed to realise that a new SIT had been formed on the directions of the coordinate Bench.”On timing the release of the book near to the elections, he said he had no political agenda. “It is just a coincidence that the book is being released now.”Talking to the media, Justice Ranjit Singh reiterated that on the basis of his probe, Dera Sacha Sauda followers conspired and carried out the sacrilege incidents; then DGP Sumedh Saini and then CM Parkash Singh Badal were responsible for police firing on the protesters at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura and SAD leaders were behind various events leading to sacrilege incidents.In the 14-chapter book, first 12 pages include the probe report while the last two are his comments on the recommendations made by the Judicial Commission and the present state of affairs regarding the incidents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dera-followers-behind-sacrilege-incidents-justice-ranjit-singh-362721

This time around, the daughters of two prominent leaders of Muktsar district are among those seen on the campaign trail, wooing the voters to re-elect their fathers to Assembly.Punjab Transport Minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring’s daughter Aekom is going door to door in Gidderbaha, seeking votes for the two-term Congress legislator.All of 15, Aekom seems to have learnt oratory from her father, a fiery leader who has carved a niche for himself in the home district of the Badals. Muktsar is traditionally seen as an Akali Dal bastion. Warring was awarded a Cabinet berth during the recent change of guard in the Punjab Congress regime.Accompanied by security personnel and local Congress leaders, she moves from house to house, appealing to the residents with folded hands to help her father score a hat-trick. “I am seeking votes on the basis of my father’s report card. He has undertaken several developmental works in Gidderbaha segment,” says Aekom. The other girl shouldering her father’s campaign load is Khushmehar Kaur, daughter of SAD MLA from Muktsar Kanwarjit Singh Rozy Barkandi. “My father and his party have contributed immensely for Muktsar. He has stood by you through thick and thin. You must keep this on mind when you cast your vote on February 20,” explains Khushmehar to an elderly couple.In 2012, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s son Arjun Badal had hogged the limelight with his speeches. Similarly, in 2017, SAD’s Gidderbaha candidate Hardeep Singh Dimpy Dhillon’s nephew Abhay Dhillon too had swayed crowds with his oratorical skills. Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s daughter Harkirat Kaur and son Anantvir Singh also had hit the campaign trail during the 2019 parliamentary elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-muktsar-gritty-daughters-take-charge-of-poll-campaign-362701
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: 5-way contest, Ravidassias hold the key||As Punjab will witness a five-cornered contest, Ravidassias, one of the prominent Dalit communities, holds the key to the political outcomes during the 2022 Assembly polls.The relevance of Ravidassias can be gauged from the fact all the political parties urged the EC to postpone voting (from February 14) as lakhs of members of the community travel from Punjab to Varanasi to celebrate Guru Ravidas Jayanti. Heeding to the request, the EC postponed the voting to February 20.Of nearly 32% Dalit population in the state, 60% comprise Ravidassias, mostly spread out in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Kapurthala districts of Doaba.While the Congress has been trying to garner votes by appointing first Dalit Sikh CM Charanjit Singh Channi, the SAD-BSP has also announced to appoint a Dalit Deputy CM after formation of their government. Thus, the voting pattern of the community would be interesting to see. In the past, the community has remained divided on caste and political lines.A senior Dalit leader, Ram Lal Jassi, said it’s yet to be seen whether the Congress uses Channi to win the polls or empowers the Dalits by making him the CM for the next five years. “It has to been seen if Jats and Hindus approve of Dalit leadership or vote on community and caste lines.”During the 2017 polls, a large section of Dalit voters polled in favour of Congress, followed by SAD and AAP. By entering into and alliance with BSP, Akalis hope to perform better this time. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/5-way-contest-ravidassias-hold-the-key-362716

From politicians to journalists to family doctors of the DEOs, the government officials are trying to approach everyone to avoid poll duty.Apprehending violence and Covid during the upcoming Vidhan Sabha polls, government employees are running from pillar to post to get exemption from poll duty. While a majority are allegedly trying to shirk work citing excuses, many others fear action by the Election Commission (EC) in case of lapses, if any.NO EXEMPTION, ONLY ACTION If senior officers can work in field throughout the day, govt officials can too...they should stop seeking exemption.

Everyone wants exemption from election work,” said an IAS officer.For instance, maternity leave, severe infection, pain in heart, birthday of daughter, a sick relative, skin allergy, taking care of an infant, cooking for parents and attending to a pregnant wife are some of the excuses being made by government officials to seek exemption from poll duty.A majority of the DEOs have, however, “almost decided to sanction leave only in case of any death”.Meanwhile, women officials too want to stay away from poll duties, apprehending violence, while others fear repercussions for any lapse on the voting day.Patiala DEO Sandeep Hans, however, has warned of strict action against all such officials approaching him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/officials-approach-dcs-to-avoid-poll-duty-362715

The EC has prepared the list of 17 constituencies based on the inputs received from the Punjab Police and the state Excise Department.The expenditure sensitive constituencies include Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s segment Chamkaur Sahib in Ropar, Former CM Parkash Singh Badal’s Lambi, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal’s Bathinda Urban and Transport Minister Raja Warring’s Gidderbaha, Agriculture Minister Kaka Randeep’s Amloh, former Power Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar’s Rampura Phul, PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s Amritsar East, Deputy CM Om Parkash Soni’s Amritsar Central, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia’s Majitha and Home Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa’s Dera Baba Nanak.Taking note of the situation, the EC has deployed 50 expenditure observers. It has also asked the Commissioners of Police and SSPs of the area concerned to submit route maps in the expenditure sensitive areas.In the previous elections, a total of Rs 58.02 crore in cash was seized.

Surjewala said the BJP’s “anti-farmer” mindset stood exposed.Yellow revolution for revivalThe party's Punjab model envisages MSP on dal, edible oil and maize under yellow revolution. The government will pay 50 per cent salaries of all labourers working in farms up to 5 acres.

Besides, they accuse income tax officials of harassment.Residents, on the other hand, are upset over the condition of roads.

20-01-2022||---||Post ED raid, Congress tweaks campaign strategy in Punjab||Chandigarh, January 19Wary of the BJP using the ED raid on the nephew of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi in illegal sand mining case to build narrative of corruption in the Assembly polls, the Congress has changed the track of its campaign strategy.Delaying its plan to project Channi as the leader and a serious contender for the CM face, party strategists are taking BJP head-on while building up anti-Punjabiat and anti-Dalit narrative against the saffron party. They are using examples of central agencies being used in other poll-bound states to threaten and pressurise political opponents.Senior AICC leaders Randeep Surjewala and Rajeev Shukla, besides others, landed in Punjab to address back-to-back meets on the alleged BJP-AAP collusion.“The BJP is settling scores for what happened at Ferozepur during PM Narenedra Modi’s visit and failure of its rally. I have and always stood with Punjabis. They want to politically damage me. People of Punjab can see through the design of the BJP and AAP,” said the CM. A senior leader said, “after the AAP announced Bhagwant Mann as its CM face, the Congress is not under pressure to announce its CM nominee. Rather, we will project Mann as a non-serious CM, compared to tried and tested 111 days of Channi’s performance.”Leaders privy to internal party discussion said ever since the controversial visit of the PM to Punjab and rising popularity chart of CM Channi, the ED raid is being seen as a move to puncture the Congress move to cash in on increasing his popularity to win the elections.Yesterday, the INC purposely shared a short video of Sonu Sood on “who should be the CM”. The criteria mentioned in the video builds party’s narrative around Channi.The Congress has already started working on a sustained campaign to project Channi as the future Punjab leader, even as party leadership has been officially maintaining that the elections would be fought collectively with Channi, Navjot Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar as leaders.Sources said in the given circumstances, the party would counter the fresh salvo from the BJP by bringing Sidhu in taking on the saffron party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/post-ed-raid-congress-tweaks-campaign-strategy-in-punjab-362693
20-01-2022||Rajmeet Singh||Free ride for transport mafia in Punjab||Chandigarh, December 19As Punjab goes to the Assembly elections next month, reining in the transport mafia, revising the bus timetables and giving minibus permits to unemployed youths remain raging issues.One of the key components in the 2017 transport policy — ending the illegal extension of bus permits to private operators, who are mostly politically influential persons — is caught in a legal battle.Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Transport ministerProactive steps takenProactive steps to end the transport mafia have been visible on the ground in the last two months, when compared to four and a half years of Capt Amarinder’s regime, which was marred by the slow-decision making.In the Charanjit Singh Channi government, the Transport Department, which is led by Amrinder Singh Raja warring, claims most of the 680 multiple permits of illegal extension of more than 1 lakh km have been cancelled. However, private bus operators continue to run their buses on monopolistic routes. The prime reason being most of the orders to cancel the bus permits have been stayed by different courts, raising question on the claims made by the government.Daljit Singh Cheema, SADNo action, just vendetta politicsThe court stay on the Transport Minister’s orders proves that he has indulged in vendetta politics. By claiming that he has increased the department’s revenue and checked tax evasion, he is questioning the performance of his predecessor only.“Not only Capt Amarinder Singh during his four and half a years of rule failed to end the transport mafia, which ate into the business of small bus operators, the Channi government, too, has had little success in controlling the menace. Though the Transport Department recently made headlines for the crackdown on the transport mafia, it’s back to square one with almost no impact on illegal operations,” points out a private transporter, who runs mini-buses on the Ludhiana-Amritsar section.Harpal Singh Cheema, AAPWrongdoers have patronageThe transport mafia is controlled by Akali Dal and Congress. Whatever action that has been initiated so far during the Congress regime has little impact on the ground. Transporters continue to indulge in illegal activities and still get relief from the court. Nevertheless, one positive thing that has happened in the past few months is the check on the evasion of the revenue of the Transport Department. In December, the daily income from the transport undertakings — Punbus and PRTC — increased to Rs 1.27 crore. Since November last year, defaulting private transporters have deposited tax amounting to Rs 25 crore.The government has also focused on the modernisation and upgrade of transportation services. The Transport Department has initiated a process to induct 800 new buses in the fleet of PRTC and Punbus. Contrary to his predecessors, Raja Warring was seen more on the ground to know the problems faced by commuters and transporters. The minister got encroachments removed in and around bus stands and initiated the construction of the new bus stands.The previous Capt Amarinder Singh government can also be credited with restructuring of the 22 district transport offices and streamlining the process of issuance of the registration certificates (RCs), besides speeding up the work on the automated driving test centres. As part of his government’s flagship scheme ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar Yojana’, Capt Amarinder granted mini-bus permits, mostly to the unemployed youth.Govt’s achievementsFailures||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/free-ride-for-transport-mafia-in-punjab-362690
20-01-2022||Chandigarh||ED raids: Punjab CM Channi alleges 'conspiracy to trap' him||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday accused the BJP-led central government of hatching a “conspiracy” to “trap” him in the case in which raids were conducted by the Enforcement Directorate at many places in the state.He alleged that whenever elections are to take place, the BJP government at the Centre uses agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Income Tax and others against political opponents to target and arm-twist them.“A conspiracy has been hatched to trap me in this case,” claimed Channi, referring to the ED raids conducted at the residence of his nephew on Tuesday.He alleged that attempts were being made by the federal probe agency sleuths to “trap” him in the case.Channi, accompanied by some ministers, including Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, was addressing a press conference.ED sources said on Wednesday about Rs 10 crore cash has been seized during the raids conducted in an anti-money laundering investigation against illegal sand mining operations in Punjab that included about Rs 8 crore from the premises linked to Bhupinder Singh alias Honey, a nephew of Channi.Another about Rs 2 crore has been seized from the premises linked to a person identified as Sandeep Kumar, they said.Reacting to the ED raid at his nephew’s premises, Channi claimed that he was not even named in a 2018 FIR of the Nawanshahr (Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district) Police.However, officials said the action has been initiated after taking cognisance of the 2018 FIR of the Nawanshahr Police and some other such police complaints against some companies and individuals alleged to be involved in the business of illegal sand mining in the state.Channi also sought to link the ED raids at the premises of his nephew to the recent scheduled Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ferozepur, during which the PM returned without addressing a rally after his convoy got stuck for 15-20 minutes due to farmers’ protest.“What was my fault, if Modi had to return?...why revenge is being taken on me,” the chief minister asked, referring to the ED raids.Punjab is scheduled to go to the polls on February 20.                                     #Channi                                     #EDraid                                     #Nawanshahr                                     #PunjabCM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ed-raids-punjab-cm-channi-alleges-conspiracy-to-trap-him-362660

20-01-2022||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Punjab mining raids: ED seizes Rs 8-crore cash from CM Channi's relative; Rs 21 lakh gold||The ED on Wednesday said it has seized cash amounting to over Rs 10 crore, including about Rs 8 crore from a relative of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, during raids conducted in connection with an anti-money laundering investigation against illegal sand-mining operations in the poll-bound state.In a statement, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said “incriminating” documents related to “illegal” sand mining and property transactions, mobile phones, gold worth more than Rs 21 lakh and a Rolex watch worth Rs 12 lakh were also seized during the searches that ended on Wednesday.Agency sources also refuted allegations of high-handedness during the raids, saying the action launched on Tuesday was undertaken by following “due legal procedures and no personal comments or individual threats were made”.They said most of the documents related to the sand-mining business and about Rs 8 crore cash were seized from the premises linked to Bhupinder Singh alias Honey, a nephew of Channi.Cash amounting to about Rs 2 crore was seized from the premises linked to a a man identified as Sandeep Kumar, the sources said.The ED statement said those covered in the raids included “Kudratdeep Singh, the Pinjore Royalty company and its partners and shareholders, Kanwarmahip Singh, Manpreet Singh, Sunil Kumar Joshi, Jagveer Inder Singh, Randeep Singh, Providers Overseas Consultants Private Limited, its directors and shareholders, including Bhupinder Singh and Sandeep Kumar, at Mohali, Ludhiana, Rupnagar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Pathankot”.The federal probe agency is expected to soon summon the people covered during the searches for a fresh and detailed round of questioning.Preliminary questioning of those covered in the raids was done over the last 24 hours, the sources said.Reacting to the raids, Channi had told reporters on Tuesday that relatives of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee were raided during the Assembly polls in that state and the “same pattern” is being followed by the ED in Punjab to “pressure” him, his ministers and Congress party members.“We are ready to handle the pressure,” he had said, adding that he had no links with the raids.Opposition parties in Punjab had earlier linked Channi with the dealings of Honey, which the chief minister had denied.The ED filed a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe these instances linked to alleged sand mining in November last year.The ED case is based on a 2018 FIR lodged by the Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar police that pressed charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Mines and Minerals (Regulation of Development) Act, 1957.The FIR mentioned that a team of officials from the mining department, the civil administration and police carried out a “surprise check” on March 7, 2018 on the basis of a complaint received at Rahon, SBS Nagar police station regarding illegal sand mining.“It was found that several mines were being excavated by various machines and mining was being carried out beyond the designated area.“Several tippers, trucks, porcelain machines, JCB machines etc. were captured and seized by the investigating team,” the ED said quoting the police FIR.“The seized tippers and trucks were also found to be overloaded with sand. The seized weighment slips having office stamps had actually not been issued by the office concerned and were forged,” it said.Subsequently, the mining operation at the Malikpur mining site and the process of approval of weighment slips were stopped by the team, the agency said.According to the police FIR, apart from Malikpur, illegal mining activities were also being carried out at Burjtahl Das, Barsal, Lalewal, Mandala and Khosa.“On the basis of the information available, investigation was initiated against the mentioned mine owners and their associates in order to ascertain the money-laundering activities undertaken by them for laundering their proceeds of crime.“Further investigation in the case is ongoing,” it said.The 117-member Punjab Assembly will go to polls on February 20 and the counting of votes will be taken up on March 10.
