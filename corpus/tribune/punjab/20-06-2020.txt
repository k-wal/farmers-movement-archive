The policemen require his signature on the delivery, but so far their attempts have been unsuccessful.The policemen don’t know how long they’re going to have to be in the city.“It depends on senior officials,” they said.The case pertains to Sidhu’s controversial remarks made last year, when he was campaigning for Congress candidate Tariq Anwar in Bihar’s Katihar district for the 2019 general election.  Sidhu has been accused of making a provocative speech during the campaign. The Election Commission of India had imposed a 72-hour ban on him. He also faces criminal charges for the speech under the Representation of the People Act and the India Penal Code.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/code-violation-bihar-policemen-camp-in-city-to-meet-navjot-singh-sidhu-congress-leader-remains-elusive-101906

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM calls all-party meet on ordinances related to farm sector||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has called an all-party meeting on June 24 over the issue of three ordinances related to the agriculture sector recently passed by the Centre, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said on Saturday.“Views of all the parties will be taken to arrive at the consensus that these ordinances were against the interest of the farming community and we should approach the Centre and the prime minister over this issue,” Jakhar said.He said farming communities were up against this ‘Kala Kanoon’ (black law) and they have vehemently opposed these ordinances.“Under these laws, the efforts are being made to hand over the rights of farmers to the multinationals and big corporates,” he alleged and expressed fear that the Narendra Modi government had decided to “disband” the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism with these ordinances under a “planned move”.The Centre recently passed three ordinances—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance.The Centre had said these would transform the farm sector and help raise farmers’ income.However, the Congress government in Punjab had said these ordinances were completely against farmers and would badly hit the agrarian state.The chief minister has already appealed to Prime Minister Modi to review three ordinances and also warned that it could pave the way for disbanding the MSP regime as well as the foodgrain procurement regime, triggering unrest among the state’s farmers.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Ordinance 2020 allows barrier-free trade in agriculture produce outside the notified APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees) mandis.Whereas, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance 2020 empowers farmers to engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers and exporters through advanced agreements on pre-agreed prices.The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act was meant to deregulate food items, including cereals, pulses and onion.

After this, they again came to my office, met the SE and left. It was later in the evening that a video of their act — which they shot themselves — went viral.

Harjot, a single parent, said she delivered online lectures to her students in the morning while in the evening she helped her daughter complete her lessons. “Now the school has planned online assessment exams for the children and it is stressing me out,” said Harjot.Harjot said the parents seemed to be competing with each other in posting activity videos and homework sheets in the online groups formed by teachers. A teacher herself, she feels that the parents cannot don the hat of a teacher entirely. “Some do not have time, others do not have required skills and some do not know how to start. As parents, everyone teaches or tries to teach new things and life lessons to children. But formal school and college education is different and the present situation has hampered it,” she said.In a suggestion to parents, Harjot said, “Apart from helping children do school assignments, the parents should also teach children what they know best. Be it painting, dancing, a sport or even cooking. It is more important to spend time with the child as they are not able to go outside for playing.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/online-classes-a-burden-for-parents-101796
