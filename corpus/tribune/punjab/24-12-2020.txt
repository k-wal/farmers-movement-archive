24-12-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Centre ‘delaying’ release of funds to Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 24Amid the ongoing stand-off between the BJP-led Centre and farmers over the new agriculture laws, the Centre is adopting “dilly dallying tactics” over the release of funds to Punjab.A two member ministerial delegation comprising of state Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Food and Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Thursday met the Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister Piyush Goyal in Delhi. They, however, were disappointed at the Union Minister giving them just assurances that the matter was being examined by the Finance Department.The Centre has held back Punjab’s Rural Development Fund worth Rs 1,200 crore, which Punjab’s Congress government alleges is an arbitrary decision. The state will lose these funds, if not released by December 31, when the current Cash Credit Limit allowed to purchase paddy expires.Talking to The Tribune from Delhi, after the meeting ended late in the night, the two ministers said that they were just told that after the Legal Department had examined Punjab’s case, the Finance Department was examining it.“I don’t understand why they are delaying it. There is no legal sanction for this arbitrary act. In the past almost six decades, this fund has never been stopped. There was no explanation for stopping the fund. Punjab had given its reply to the Centre after an objection was raised in October on how the money was used for the intended purpose of rural development,” Badal told The Tribune.Food Minister Ashu said that this was a statutory tax, and the Centre should release it. “But no concrete assurance has been given to us,” he rued.A letter to hold back the RDF was sent to Punjab on October 23, where the Centre sought information on how the state was using the funds.The Centre had decided to hold back the funds till the issue was sorted out. This was right in the midst of the farmers’ agitation against the agriculture laws and the state Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had taken a strong objection to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-delaying-release-of-funds-to-punjab-188894

24-12-2020||New Delhi||Canada-based businessman mulling prolonging stay in India to take part in farmers' protest||With the protesting farmers remaining steadfast in their demands, a Canada-based man, who arrived in India a week ago, is mulling the idea of prolonging his stay here as he feels the need to participate in the agitation.Gurbaksh Singh, who has been a businessman in Toronto for the last 30 years, said he came to India last week to be part of the agitation demanding the revocation of three new farm laws that "threaten the land ownership" of thousands of farmer families, including his."Although I have my return ticket booked for next week, after seeing all this, I am thinking if I should prolong my stay here," Singh, who is originally from Punjab's Nawanshahr, said.While he is putting up at his ancestral home in Nawanshahr, Singh has been visiting the Singhu border protest site of the farmers every couple of days.He said he felt the need to participate in the protest not just because he hails from a farmer family, but also because what is happening is an "injustice to the most important citizens of the country that is the farmers".Several rounds of talks between the government and the farmers have resulted in a stalemate.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow the farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.While the protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that the new laws would lead to the eventual elimination of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations, the government has been asserting that the MSP and the "mandi" (wholesale market) systems will stay, accusing the opposition of misleading them.

24-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab emerges hub of illegal sale of imported cigarettes to J-K, Himachal||Punjab has been emerging as a hub of illegal sale of imported cigarettes and a crucial route to neighbouring Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, posing a threat to the health of smokers too who are getting hooked to the cheap quality of international brands sans health warnings, trade insiders said on Thursday.A major tax inspection by the Excise and Taxation Department on two prominent cigarette distributors of the Amritsar city was conducted on Wednesday.Official sources told IANS it seems the tax evasion by both the distributors is of nearly Rs 50 lakh that comprises banned tobacco products, lesser known Indian brands and a large stock of the imported ones.Trade insiders believe besides Amritsar, Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Jalandhar are the main transit points of the imported and cheap Indian brand of cigarettes that are routed from Delhi."Delhi Customs (Preventive) conducted multiple searches, including the warehouses of logistics service providers. Seized 19.3 lakh foreign cigarettes valued at Rs 2.35 crore. Four arrests so far. Investigation is on," Customs (Preventive) Delhi informed in a tweet on Wednesday.According to the officials, the seized cigarettes were smuggled from countries like China, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia to evade taxes and sell them in Delhi and other major cities."When compared to the Indian brands, consumers prefer to buy foreign brands due to the international quality, catchy labels and nicely packed," an investigator told IANS.Whereas cigarettes produced and packed in India have to adhere to specified health warnings, both in pictorial and text formats, to discourage the smokers.Trade insiders say Punjab alone has an annual legal market of 120 million cigarettes and the grey market accounts for 20-30 per cent.Chandigarh and Panchkula cities have an annual legal market of 20 million and 10 million cigarettes respectively, and the illegal market has a share of 15-20 per cent.While Kashmir has an annual legal market of 300 million cigarettes, the grey market has a share of seven-eight per cent, comparatively less than Punjab's share.Himachal's tourist destinations Shimla and Manali have the annual illegal market of one million cigarettes each. They have a legal market of 10 million and five million cigarettes respectively.Most of the illegal cigarette brands attract the retailers as they are available at a significantly lower price than the legal cigarettes. They are sold in the market at one fifth the price of the legal product, said the investigator.Take the case of an imported brand. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs Rs 20-30 to a retailer, who is selling at a cost of Rs 100. While an Indian brand cost between Rs 250 and Rs 300 with a profit margin of approximately Rs 5.A spokesperson for the Punjab government said 21,446 fines under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act or COTPA were imposed in 2019-20 and the maximum fines were against selling cigarettes without pictorial warning.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-emerges-hub-of-illegal-sale-of-imported-cigarettes-to-j-k-himachal-188814

But he is happy, for he gets to eat different varieties of food thanks to langar started by farmers.Like him, children of migrant labourers come to the protest site every morning and return in the evening. Their schools are closed because of Covid.“My friends and I play hide and seek, drink tea, and eat biscuits, chapattis with ‘chhole’, sweets and fruits. We even take food home. No one stops us from doing that,” Raj says. Besides food, farmers have been providing children with woolen clothes.When asked about the reason behind the farmers’ protest, Raj quickly responded: “They want to get the price of their crops enhanced.”His friend Avinash interrupted him. “They are here with tractor-trailers as the government is not allowing them to reside in their villages,” he said naively.Standing nearby was Class VIII student Sapna, holding a bag full of biscuits and other food items. “Children of my locality and those from nearby areas have been spending a good time here ever since the farmers arrived. My father also came here once to have langar,” she said.Jai Tirth Singh, a farmer from Punjab, said that besides food, several protesters had also provided children and slum-dwellers with sweaters, jackets and blankets after seeing them shivering in cold.“Some children raise slogans of ‘Kisan Ekta Zindabad’. They ask about the duration of our stay. I think they don’t want us to return,” said Jaspreet Singh, another farmer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-dharna-at-tikri-border-takes-new-meaning-for-poor-kids-188597

SAD leaders, too, skipped a meal. They asked Singla to take some concrete steps for farmers rather than enacting such “drama”. Punjab AAP chief Bhagwant Mann also announced all legal aid to farmers who are facing derogatory remarks from their opponents.“Residents of Malerkotla remained on fast on Wednesday to express their solidarity with the farmers. Since patients need nutrition for recovery, we supplied food to them at a local hospital. We have also been supplying required items to New Delhi border,” said Dr Naseer Akhtar, president of Sikh-Muslim Sanjha foundation.Minister Singla announced full support to farmers and arhtiyas. “The farmers’ agitation has become a mass movement and all residents are supporting the collective cause.

Farmer unions have given a call for hunger strike and we are offering our support,” said Singla.Punjab president of AAP and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann announced at Sangrur that his party would offer all legal aid to farmers in taking legal action against all those who are making defamatory statements against farmers.“Some leaders are trying to label our farmers as Khalistanis and Maoists.

The Congress is also responsible for the new farm laws,” said Mann.SAD leaders, who also remained on fast to support farmers, advised Minister Singla and AAP leaders for some effective steps.“We also remained on fast today, but did not enact any drama like Singla and AAP leaders.

24-12-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||United we matter, say farmer leaders spearheading stir||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 23“We (farmer unions) have united for a cause and the cause is much bigger than any union or leader. It is the cause of saving the agrarian sector, by stopping the government from giving our economic rights to corporates,” says Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary, Bhartyia Kisan Union (Dakaunda).Leaders of each of these 32 unions, whether big or small, set aside personal biases and egos to come together as a team every day. Each day, they meet in the afternoon and each and every aspect of the ongoing stir — the current stage, the formal and “informal” proposals by the Centre and the further course of agitation — is discussed threadbare. These issues are then discussed with the BKU Charuni leadership and later in the meetings of Sanjha Kisan Morcha.Considering that there is a drastic variation in the education levels and exposure of all leaders (from doctors to those who are not even matriculates), it is indeed unique that all are together.Common CauseExperience has taught us to carry everyone along. Any leader who breaks away will meet his own political end. This fear too keeps many together. —Balbir Singh Rajewal, BKU (Rajewal)In fact, the BKU Ekta Ugrahan and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, the two unions that are staging a dharna at some distance from the joint dharna of the other 32 unions at Tikri, too, participate in the meeting of the Sanjha Kisan Morcha and implement the decisions on carrying the protest forward. It was at the behest of Dr Darshan Pal, president of the Krantikari Kisan Morcha, who played a role in stitching together the differences, that representatives of these unions started coming to the meetings of the Sanjha Kisan Morcha.Each day, one of the union leaders is given a chance to handle the stage and to announce the outcome of the meetings. All decisions are taken and announced only after a verbal voting and the decision of the majority vote is accepted. “I have spent more than 50 years in fighting for farmers’ issues. Experience has taught us to carry everyone along, by giving equal importance and opportunity to each leader. Moreover, any leader who breaks away will meet his own political end. This fear too keeps many together,” says Balbir Singh Rajewal of the BKU Rajewal.Attempts by the Central Government to ignore some farmer unions while calling others for talks, or holding talks with some unions that are not a part of the protest just “for optics” have all been “successfully ignored”, Rajewal said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/united-we-matter-say-farmer-leaders-spearheading-stir-188484

On the way, I was amazed to meet so many people who were more than aware of the Central agriculture laws. Everyone showed their solidarity with farmers,” he said.Gurtej said it was unfortunate that farmers were still fighting for their rights for which his elders raise their voice in 1938. He had also been embarking on a 20-km journey on his cycle every day to spread the word on the Central laws in remote areas before the Delhi protest started.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ghadarites-nephew-reaches-singhu-on-foot-from-jalandhar-188485

It shows that the high-profile accused are creating hindrances in the process of law, he alleged.About his shifting by the ECI from the organised crime control unit in the run-up to the Lok Sahba poll in April 2019 and him filing the chargesheet against the accused of Kotkapura police firing during this time, the IG said it was backdoor but an unsuccessful attempt by Sukhbir Singh Badal, through one of his supporters to attract the jurisdiction of the ECI in a clandestine manner as his involvementin firing as well as sacrilege cases had been precisely stated in the chargesheet.Defending his act of writing a letter to the District and Sessions Judge, Faridkot, in June 2020, urging that a judicial officer should not be entrusted with “any part of the case at any stage” due to his alleged “family ties” with the Badal family, the IG submitted to the HC that it was based on inquiries and intelligence inputs that the judicial officer had close link with the Badal families, whose name have been specifically mentioned in the chargesheet. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ig-kunwar-vijay-pratap-singh-accuses-sukhbir-badal-of-derailing-probe-188492

Referring to the facts of the case, Justice Kshetarpal said the High Court was sad to observe that “the officials have lost all compassion”. Describing the matter as "unfortunate", Justice Kshetarpal said he hoped that the order would serve as a wake-up call for the officers.Order a WAKE-UP CALL FOR OFFICERSThe admonition came on a petition filed against the State of Punjab and other respondents by Balbir Kaur. Taking up the matter, Justice Kshetarpal observed the petitioner lost her son on November 26, 2016. At the time of his death, he was working as a rural medical officer with the State of Punjab.His widow and children shifted to Canada and submitted an affidavit giving 'no objection' to the authorities to release the pension benefits exclusively to the petitioner-mother. The writ petition was filed by her for the issuance of directions to the official respondents to release pension and other admissible benefits exclusively to her.Justice Kshetarpal, during the course of hearing, took note of a short reply filed by a respondent, which stated that the department concerned did not release the amount since the widow did not contact it along with necessary papers. It was also submitted that the widow was required to sign necessary papers before the pension and other pending benefits could be released.Justice Kshetarpal also took note of the submissions by the respondents that approximately Rs 3 lakh was subsequently released to the petitioner as the arrears of medical reimbursement, salary, leave encashment and ex gratia. The process for releasing the payment on the account of contributory provident fund and family pension, too, had also been initiated. The amount legally due to the petitioner will also be released.Disposing of the petition, Justice Kshetarpal said the court was compelled to make the observations after noting the stand of the parties. “The petitioner shall be at liberty to move an application for the revival of the writ petition, if she feels still aggrieved with respect to the subject matter of the writ petition,” Justice Kshetarpal concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/set-your-house-in-order-lest-court-is-forced-to-intervene-state-told-188493

The elderly, particularly women, found it very difficult to get the material of their choice.”A 70-year old farmer from Barnala, Ajmer Singh, said: “I had been trying to get hold of a few blankets for past many days as the distribution of the relief material is not systematic. However, in the mall, everything is organised, making it easier for farmers.”A student of Punjabi University, Udham Singh, said: “We are providing material with help of the money that the ‘sangat’ is offering to help farmers sustain their protest. We are giving farmers the privilege of choosing what they need.” A young farmer from Faridkot, Sehajdeep Singh Gill, said: “We have started the system of visiting the camps and giving tokens to farmers, who then come to the mall and fill a form to list their requirements which are provided on the spot.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/free-kisan-mall-set-up-by-khalsa-aid-at-tikri-border-188506

24-12-2020||---||Don’t politicise stir: Capt to Akalis, AAP||Chandigarh, December 23Even as he extended all possible help to families of protesting farmers, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday asked the Akalis and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to stop indulging in petty politics over the farm laws as the issue was not political but concerned the future of the state and its children.“The issue is not political, it concerns the future of Punjab, our agriculture and the future of our children. If we don’t oppose the black farm laws, we will endanger the future of our children,” said the CM, addressing the people through the 19th Facebook Live #AskCaptain edition.Appealing to all not to politicise the agitation of the farmers, who were battling severe cold at the Delhi borders where they have been protesting for the past 28 days, the Chief Minister exhorted the AAP and SAD to stand unequivocally in support of the farmers over the farm laws.Urging the farmers to take care of themselves amid the severe cold, Captain Amarinder asked them to call 1091 helpline or 112 police helpline for any emergency help for their families back in Punjab. Expressing concern over the death of farmers during the protests, he prayed to the almighty that the Centre may resolve the issue soon. “The ball is in their court,” he said, citing the fears of the farmers that the MSP system and the FCI procurement model would end as recommended by the Shanta Kumar report. “Who will buy foodgrains if FCI is wound up?” he asked, adding that this would eventually lead to an end to the PDS system. “Who will feed the poor then?” he asked.The Chief Minister took a dig at the repeated U-turns of both the Opposition parties on the issue. The truth, said Captain Amarinder, was Punjab was initially not part of the committee formed by the Centre to discuss agricultural reforms but was incorporated after he wrote to them. Subsequently, two meetings were held, one related to finance and attended by Manpreet Badal and the second where only officers were invited and a draft was shared which made no mention of the laws.His government responded and objected to the suggestions of the Centre in the draft and categorically maintained that MSP should not be tinkered with at any cost, he added.Not visiting singhu, tikri to avoid politicsCaptain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said he had deliberately chosen not to visit borders of the national capital to express his solidarity with the farmers. Responding to questions about his failure to visit the protesting farmers, he said it was out of respect of the feelings of the farmers, who have clearly stated that they don’t want any political parties to be involved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-politicise-stir-capt-to-akalis-aap-188510
