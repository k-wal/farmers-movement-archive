Currently an active militant of LeT in the Kashmir valley, Dar had absconded in 2017.The duo further disclosed that they had collected the consignment from two unknown persons early this morning at a pre-arranged location on Maqboolpura-Vallah road near the vegetable market in Amritsar. They had then concealed the consignment in the truck, which they had brought ostensibly for the purpose of loading vegetables and fruits from the mandi in Amritsar, according to the DGP.Aamir Hussain Wani has revealed that, on his earlier trips to Punjab in his truck, he had collected more than Rs 20 lakh of hawala money at the behest of his handlers — Ishfaq Ahmed Dar and Rameez Raja, who is currently lodged in a jail in J&K for his involvement in terror activities.Aamir has also disclosed that, during previous trips to Amritsar, he had ferried two armed Hizbul Mujahideen and LeT militants from Punjab to the Valley. Incidentally, both the men are now dead.A case FIR under Section 25/54/59 Arms Act, 3/4/5 Explosive Substances Amendment Act 2001 and 13, 17, 18, 18-B, 20 Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967, has been registered, and further investigations are on, said the DGP.According to Gupta, the arrest of Aamir and Wasim had corroborated recent intelligence inputs indicating that Pak ISI has been pushing weapon consignments and infiltrating militants from across the border into Punjab, and further to Kashmir valley for carrying out terror activities.  Earlier, on April 25, 2020, Punjab Police had arrested another J&K based youth, namely Hilal Ahmed Wagay, who had come to collect drug money from Amritsar, on the instructions of slain Hizbul Mujahadeen Commander Riaz Ahmed Naikoo.In that case also, Hilal Ahmed had used a truck for ferrying the drug money.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-arrest-2-kashmir-based-let-militants-from-pathankot-97749

Stringent curbs could help delay the peak for as long as possible, he added, pointing out that with no early vaccine or treatment in sight, strict protocols were the only way to fight the pandemic.Even as he warned of the pandemic worsening in the coming days and weeks, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also asked medical and health experts to consider the imposition of strict conditions, including mandatory testing certification, for entrants from Delhi, where the situation had assumed alarming proportions.On an average, 500 to 800 vehicles are coming to Punjab from the national capital every day, the DGP informed the meeting. A decision on stricter curbs on those coming from Delhi would be taken after a review by the experts, an official spokesperson said after the meeting.Pointing out that many of those, who had come from outside, had behaved irresponsibly and did not report to the health authorities, the Chief Minister said tough measures would have to be taken where needed, as the spike was still continuing and was expected to escalate in the days ahead.The Chief Minister suggested that since it normally took three to four days for the virus to show up, those coming from outside should be tested after a week and in the meantime, they should be strictly asked for home-quarantine themselves. He also directed the DGP to ensure strict implementation of the home-quarantine.The DGP disclosed that 550 flying squads of the Punjab Police were enforcing the same.Referring to complaints received on social media, and through other channels, of private hospitals charging exorbitant sums for COVID hospitalisation and care, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh directed the Health Department to ensure strict application of the CGHS rates. All data on the availability of beds etc should be put in the public domain, he added.The Chief Minister’s directions came even as the doubling rate in the state worsened from 22 on May 31 to 15 on June 10, showing a progressive decline day by day. Though significantly longer than the national average, the doubling period decline was a matter of anxiety, said the Chief Minister.Expressing concern over the large number of people coming from outside the state, even though the positive cases among them were not many, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said there was no scope for complacency in the state’s battle against COVID-19. The state government’s efforts would need to be scaled up further, particularly in view of the Health Department’s projections suggesting that the peak of the pandemic had yet to hit Punjab, and it could happen towards the end of August if the doubling period continues to come down as per the current trend.Acting tough, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, on Thursday, stressed the need to fine people for not wearing masks and not observing precautions against Covid-19."I feel sad that we need to fine our people for not wearing masks & not observing other precautions against #Covid19," he informed in a tweet.Also read: Mission Fateh: Yuvraj Singh shares 3 ‘weapons’ for COVID prevention"(The) government alone cannot win the fight against #Covid19 & I seek support of all.

Nazar Singh, Chief Agriculture Officer, Kapurthala, said, “We are expecting paddy sowing over 1.17 lakh hectares this year.”Over 45 paddy transplanting machines have been purchased in Jalandhar district under the 40-50 per cent subsidy plan of the Agriculture Department. Dr Surinder Singh, Chief Agriculture Officer, Jalandhar, said 1.68 lakh hectares of agricultural land was expected to come under paddy cultivation this year in the district and paddy transplanting machines were being bought owing to labour shortage. Sukhminder Singh, a progressive farmer from Dyalpur village in Jalandhar who has bought a machine, said over 60 farmers had contacted him for using it.Good response from Muktsar farmersMuktsar: Despite much noise over the exodus of migrant labourers, there is an insignificant rise in labour charges for transplantation of paddy crop in the region. As the transplantation season officially started today, some paddy growers informed that they had struck deals at Rs2,700-3,000 per acre for paddy transplantation, which is just about Rs200-300 more than the last year. Gurdeep Singh, a farmer from Daula village here, said, “A majority of farmers having big landholdings have opted for direct sowing of rice technique this year, thus the labourers who were earlier demanding double money have now agreed to work at almost last year’s charges. The paddy transplantation is underway at an average price of Rs3,000 per acre in our area.” Archit Watts||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/labour-crisis-mechanised-sowing-picks-up-in-punjab-97340

11-06-2020||Vishav Bharti||Department objects to ‘bias’ against rural doctors||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 10The Rural Development Department and the Department of Health and Family Welfare are clashing with each other over the treatment being meted out to rural doctors.In a letter sent to the Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, by the Rural Development Department director DPS Kharbanda, it has been alleged that more than 700 rural doctors are being treated like “lesser mortals” by the Health Department.Flagging the issue in reference with a news report by The Tribune on June 8, the department has said that rural doctors were put at the disposal of the Health Department but they are not being treated “equally” and they are being deputed mainly to maintain isolation wards and flu corners.The letter alleges that due to the Covid-19 duties of rural doctors, the healthcare services in the rural areas have crippled. The letter further asks the Secretary, Health, to instruct all Civil Surgeons to treat rural doctors equally, so that they don’t feel discriminated against.Significantly, there are around 1,200 posts of rural medical officers in the state, but around 500 posts are vacant.Kharbanda said they were getting a lot complaints from doctors that they were being “mistreated” by health officials. “Rural doctors are government officials, so they should be treated in a dignified way,” he said.Dr JP Narula, president of Rural Medical Services Association, said the health department was asking rural doctors to carry out the duties which were to be done either by nurses or lab technicians.Medicos refuse to collect Covid samplesRural doctors say stocking and labelling samples is not their domain, but that of ENT doctors or lab technicians. AYUSH doctors too have refused to collect samples. Though the government labs can now process 9,000 Covid samples, there is a shortage of ENT surgeons, so AYUSH doctors, nurses and rural doctors have been deputed for sample collection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/department-objects-to-bias-against-rural-doctors-97349

11-06-2020||Amid allegations of the authorities going slow on the probe into the illicit liquor business||‘Guilty will be punished, no matter who’||What steps are being initiated to check the illegal liquor trade?We have taken several proactive steps. Besides SIT, I have set up a five-member Excise Reforms Group to look into all aspects of this activity with the explicit aim of breaking the nexus between manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. The panel, comprising Housing and Urban Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria; Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla; Adviser (Financial Resources) VK Garg, Secretary (School Education) Krishan Kumar and retired IAS officer DS Kalha, will take into account the suggestions made by Finance Minister Manpreet Badal and former Local Government Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. Strict action will be taken against those involved.Is the government probing allegations that certain Congress MLAs are involved in the illicit business?As I said earlier, the SIT and the Excise Reforms Group will look into every aspect of the illicit business. The aim of the latter is to suggest ways to break the nexus. Those found complicit will face action as per the law, irrespective of who they are. The law will take its own course. I have made it clear to all concerned that we will not allow any impediment in the investigation or the legal process.Was the SIT to probe the illicit trade set up after a preliminary inquiry?No, there was no preliminary inquiry. There was enough indication of the illicit trade after illegal distilleries were unearthed. A factory in Ludhiana’s Khadur village was found filling cheap whiskey into bottles of top foreign brands during a joint raid by the Excise and Taxation and Police departments on February 13. Subsequently, the enforcement agencies swung into action. They found more evidence of a large-scale mafia. I decided that this warranted the setting up of an SIT so that the culprits were brought to book.Has the SIT been given a time frame for submission of report?I have asked it to submit a report at the earliest without compromising on the investigation. The racket seems to be widespread and the SIT has a huge task of probing every aspect.Does the state have a mechanism to check the quality of liquor in bottles sold at vends?There has always been a system of random and periodic checking to see if the bottles have the hologram issued to the registered distilleries/bottling plants. The vends are inspected regularly for any stock unaccounted for. Also, random sampling is undertaken periodically by the Food and Drug Administration.What steps do you plan to check such activity which entails loss of revenue?Following the recent raids, we have intensified random sampling at the vends. The Excise and Taxation Department, along with the district administrations, launched ‘Operation Red Rose on May 17. Since then, 3,202 FIRs have been filed and 2,436 persons arrested under the Excise Act. The seizures include 31,782 litres of illicit liquor, 1,03,817 litres of smuggled liquor and 5,49,806 kg of lahan. These are big numbers. The SIT will ensure that the entire network is busted.As for the revenue losses, there is really no way to assess these as the department confines itself to the number of bottles seized. The focus now is on eliminating the illicit liquor business so that there is no revenue loss on this account. I will not allow Punjab to become a hub of such trade which not only causes losses to the exchequer but also poses a serious threat to people’s health.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/guilty-will-be-punished-no-matter-who-97437
