Elaborating, he submitted that the policy stated that there would be five wholesale licencees for any brand of foreign liquor, which shall sell liquor to all retail licencees.Chhibbar added that big retail players had obtained authorisation for foreign brands, which has harmed independent retail outlets like the petitionerGiving reasons, Chhibbar added instead of buying foreign liquor directly from a reputed manufacturer, the petitioner now as left at the mercy of the competitor retailer having wholesale authorisation for a particular foreign brand.“This is one way that cartelisation of foreign trade in Chandigarh has empowered few big retailers, from whom the petitioner is forced to buy foreign liquor. Hence, the petitioner is always come at competitive disadvantage,” Chhibbar added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-haryana-hc-rules-liquor-vends-allotment-subject-to-outcome-of-petition-challenging-chandigarhs-excise-policy-103250

They also target youth such as gangsters for the purpose, he said.A senior police official privy to the investigations revealed that Gurmeet Singh was a drug addict and was involved in the trafficking of opium from Rajasthan though there was no FIR against him.The official pointed out that he was also ‘scrutinised’ through a social media platform and he was later called with a religious jatha to Pakistan where he met with his Pak-based handlers in 2017.Later, he remained in touch with them through video conferencing calls through OTT applications.Talking to The Tribune, the investigation officer said that Gurmeet told that the Pakistan-based agencies were not targeting a particular community.They were looking for the Punjabi youth whichever faith they belonged to and radicalised them for furthering their interests including disrupting peace and promoting hatred in the region.Busting a terror module with their arrest, the police had confiscated a German-made MP5 submachine gun, a 9mm calibre pistol with four magazines and two mobile phones from their possession.Meanwhile, the police were trying to identify those who had dumped the sophisticated weapon in the fields near Gurdaspuria Dhaba on GT Road.When they were trying to retrieve the weapons, some persons got suspicious and informed the police following which they were arrested. The weapons were retrieved next morning from the same place.Gurmeet was earlier involved in a case of fraud along with his brother, and a case was registered against him in Amritsar.Besides, Rural police, other intelligence and security agencies were interrogating the two alleged Khalistani operatives.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pak-based-agencies-spot-talents-suiting-to-their-interests-on-social-media-103249

23-06-2020||Patiala||Amid COVID-19, authority’s instructions to follow safety guidelines irks medical staff at Rajindra Hospital||Days after the Medical Superintendent (MS) of Government Rajindra Hospital issued directions to follow health guidelines properly, the hospital staff — under the banner of Punjab State Medical & Dental Teachers Association — has strongly objected to the directions, here on Tuesday.The MS had to issue the letter only after Civil Surgeon, Patiala — in the wake of a surge in the positive cases among hospital staff — wanted the staff to follow safety guidelines.The Medical Superintendent on June 17 had issued a warning letter saying strict action would be taken for violating the health guidelines.Criticising the said letter, the association leaders said the office order was “demoralising” for the doctors and other staff.The association said the letter should immediately be withdrawn as it was in bad shape and was making doctors themselves responsible for corona infection — while performing their professional duties.Dr DS Bhullar, president, general secretary of the association said at Rajindra Hospital, patients had got an open all side access into the OPDs (outpatient departments), wards and even in emergency.Consequently, the medical staff was being exposed to potential COVID sources all the times.Justifying the issuance of letter, Dr Paras Pandove, Medical Superintendent, Government Rajindra Hospital, said, “I issued orders to the staff only for their safety. I wanted to make sure that infection doesn’t reach to other staff members.” Notably, Government Rajindra Hospital has become a hotspot for coronavirus after 20 positive cases of COVID-19 -- which included doctor, nurses, lab attendants and admitted patients – were reported in a week.Top officials of the hospital had to be quarantined after a steno of the Medical Superintendent’s office had tested positive for coronavirus.The doctors objected to the observation of district health department that medical staff of Rajindra Hospital was not adhering to the safety guidelines and violating the safety protocol.The hospital faculty took it as unwanted interference on the part of district health department. Meanwhile, reacting to the development, Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said he had requested the Medical Superintendent of the Government Rajindra Hospital to tell his staff to take all the necessary precautions.He said, “After the rise in number of positive cases among the staff members, we asked the staff to take necessary precautions to stem the spread of the virus in the hospital.”Finally, the association said their duty was to focus on the treatment of the patients, and the responsibility to take care of potential sources of infection coming from outside was that of hospital administration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-covid-19-authoritys-instructions-to-follow-safety-guidelines-irks-medical-staff-at-rajindra-hospital-103204

23-06-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Remember old Sikh couple dancing on 'Lamborghini'? Their heartwarming love story goes viral||Remember the old Sikh couple grooving to the Punjabi hit number 'Lamborghini' that went viral overnight in 2018?  The Internet's favourite couple have now shared their story on the facebook page of The Humans of Bombay. In the post the couple revealed that they met for the first time at a friend's party and the man did not know how to dance and had himself enrolled in a dance class. Describing his journey of learning dance he told, The Humans of Bombay: “I was always a shy kid who hated dancing. Once at a wedding, a friend’s aunt dragged me to dance. I couldn’t coordinate my feet and hoped no one would notice. I was so embarrassed, I decided to enroll in dance classes in college! The classes were great, but I’d often look at all the couples enjoying themselves and wished I had a real partner...not a random dance partner”.He has also stated that his wife loved to dance back then as well and the first time they danced together was on the track, Lady in Red. It is during this dance that he realised how much he loved her, the post said. At a dinner that they had gone on after a few months he proposed to her to which she replied in the affirmative. The two got married three months later. The much-in-love couple till date, dances at weddings, works out together, plays games and loves travelling as well. “And of course, we’re still ‘that dancing couple’ everywhere we go. We don’t even care if we’re the only ones on the dance floor, and we’re making a fool of ourselves– we love it! We also work out together, and every Sunday, we have a family lunch and then play board games. She’s very competitive when it comes to Ludo and Acquire. Whenever I win she’ll say, ‘You’re just too smart. It’s not fair.’ And then I’ll hug her, and she scrunches her face up!”“I was always a shy kid who hated dancing. Once at a wedding, a friend’s aunt dragged me to dance. I couldn’t coordinate my feet and hoped no one would notice. I was so embarrassed, I decided to enrol in dance classes in college! The classes were great, but I’d often look at all the couples enjoying themselves and wished I had a real partner...not a random dance partner! As fate would have it, I met my wife at a mutual friend’s party after college–who would have thought she loved dancing too! We spoke a lot, went on dinners and started getting to know each other. And a few months later, we were at a friend’s party when the song ‘Lady in Red’ started playing. That’s when we danced together for the first time, and all I could think about was how much I’d fallen for her! She’d often tell me that I made her feel special and safe when I danced with her, and she loved how I’d always open the door for her! So a few months later, we were at a restaurant when I asked her, ‘Will you marry me?’ She said yes, and we went home and woke our parents up immediately to get their blessings. We got married 3 months later. After marriage, we even found a shared love for travelling. We’d love to go on 10 hour drives together, without hotel bookings, not knowing where we’d land up. And of course, we’re still ‘that dancing couple’ everywhere we go. We don’t even care if we’re the only ones on the dance floor and we’re making a fool of ourselves– we love it!

Whenever I win she’ll say, ‘You’re just too smart. It’s not fair.’ And then I’ll hug her and she scrunches her face up! But like every couple, we fight too. Usually, I stay quiet when she’s mad. And she loves that softness about me, so we end up laughing after any argument. Then she’ll say, ‘You are the best’, and that's the only time I raise my voice at her and say, ‘No, you are the best!’ She’s the best!”A post shared by  Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay) on Jun 20, 2020 at 5:14am PDT||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/remember-old-sikh-couple-dancing-on-lamborghini-their-heartwarming-love-story-goes-viral-103182

23-06-2020||Patiala||Sidhu Moosewala case: Two probe officers removed on singer’s request||The Punjab Police have removed two of its investigating officers, who were part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing controversial singer Sidhu Moosewala on Tuesday. The two officers were removed following an application by Sidhu Moosewala to Patiala IG Jatinder Singh Aulakh. The move comes amid allegations against the police department for going soft on the singer. Probe officer Rupinder Bhardwaj, who was SP (PBI) Barnala, has been shifted and replaced by SP Sukhdev Singh Virk who is SP (investigation) Barnala. Others in the SIT now include DSP Raminder Singh and SHO Dhanaula Kuldeep Singh. Aulakh said that now two separate SITs, in Barnala and Sangrur, will probe the Moosewala FIRs and their investigation. “However the two SITs will continue to work under SSP Sangrur. This was done after we received an application from the singer’s lawyer requesting for change of the officer in the Barnala SIT,” he stated.On May 4, after a video showing the singer shooting at a firing range in Badbar went viral on the social media, the police had registered a case against Moosewala and five policemen under Section 188 of the IPC and the Disaster Management Act. Later, stringent sections of the Arms Act were added to the FIR.Since then, the police claimed to have raided several places to arrest the singer. However, on June 6, the singer was rounded up by Patiala police and later allowed to leave following a minor traffic challan.The orders to change the probe officers have raised eyebrows as both the SP-ranked officers are on verge of retirement. Instead of asking a senior IPS to probe the matter, the police shifted the case from one SP ranked officer to another, say sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-moosewala-case-two-probe-officers-removed-on-singers-request-103123
23-06-2020||Our Correspondent||Singers promoting gun culture: Congress||Ludhiana, June 22Taking strong exception to Punjabi singers promoting gun culture and inciting youth for violence through their songs, former president of the District Youth Congress (DYC) Rajiv Raja has urged the police to initiate criminal proceedings against them.In a memorandum submitted to Ludhiana Commissioner of Police Rakesh Agrawal here today, Raja alleged that Punjabi singers such as Jazzy B (Jaswinder Singh Bains) and Diljit Dosanjh were promoting the culture of fire arms and pushing the youth towards crime through their songs and gun-wielding videos.He said a majority of students and youth consider singers and actors as their idols and tended to follow message given by them through their songs. “If immediate remedial measures are not taken to curb this dangerous trend, the future of youth would become dark and they would fall prey to criminal actions,” he added.Raja said he would also meet Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and Cabinet Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to apprise them with threat posed from songs espousing violence and gun culture and to emphasise the need to put such singers behind bars.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/singers-promoting-gun-culture-congress-102827

The police reportedly seem reluctant as the names of some ruling party leaders have cropped up in the case.On June 9, Niranjan Singh, who had also led the investigation into the Jagdish Bhola-led multi-crore synthetic drugs racket, wrote a letter to three district police departments, sources said.He wanted them to share FIRs, probe reports, property details of the accused and interrogation reports of those arrested in the liquor scam. Niranjan Singh also personally met senior police officials to seek records pertaining to seizure of illicit liquor and manufacturing units.The directorate, conducting probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), is looking into at least 12 FIRs registered at various police stations in Patiala, Khanna and Ludhiana.A top cop said, “Given the political sensitivity of the case, nothing can be shared (with the ED) till the government gives the nod.”“There is reluctance by the police to share case files with us. Our probe will identify those pocketing crores by evading excise duty,” Niranjan Singh told The Tribune.“Delay, if any, will only help the accused and create hurdles in the probe. We want to register an FIR and probe the case, but I have received no communication from any SSP so far,” he said.Patiala SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu said a special investigating team (SIT) was already probing the case. “We can share case files, once the SIT completes its probe. Moreover, the property-related documents of the accused are with the revenue department and not with us,” he said.Brewery forced shut, notice to distilleryChandigarh: The Punjab Government has temporarily forced shut production at a brewery citing various irregularities and issued notice to a distillery for violations.

Liquor bottles having no batch numbers were seized at several places. The inspection reports, received by the government, show anomalies were found at almost all distilleries, expect one or two. The rule of having only one entry/exit point was being flouted at some units, while flow meters (used to measure rectified spirit and extra neutral alcohol (ENA) going into the tankers) were found non-functional at many distilleries. A large quantity of ENA, suspected to have been smuggled from various units in the state, was found at the Rajpura illegal distillery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/brewery-forced-shut-notice-to-distillery-in-patiala-102786

He also spoke about a “sudden boom” of illegal distilleries and sale of illicit liquor.“Instead of arresting the kingpin, lower level staff of the liquor mafia have been arrested in cases involving illegal distilleries. Constituting an SIT under a minister who earlier had a stake in liquor business speaks of the government’s intention,” he said in a press conference here. He said the matter should be handed over to the CBI or a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-dullo-raises-liquor-trade-issue-102787

Two Sangrur youths are thus working in a brick-kiln to repay the debt they had taken for their education. Like them, many more are working as labourers across the state despite having degrees.“Since the age of 13, I have been working in a brick-kiln. I worked during night to attend classes in the day, but the government is not doing something for the poor. Only the influential and rich get everything. I have lost all hope and working for more than 15 hours daily to repay the debt of lakhs of rupees,” said Makhan Singh (30) while preparing bricks at Sheron on the Longowal road.He has done BEd, MEd with masters of Punjabi and history and cleared PTET in 2017. Since then, he has been trying to get the job of a teacher. His younger brother Raju Singh (27), mother and father also work with him. Raju did not study as the family did not have the required money.“Many insult me by calling me ‘masterji’ in front of my family. I am feeling guilty for putting my family under debt for my study. Since I haven’t got married till date and waiting for a job, it has delayed the wedding prospects of my younger brother too,” he said.Another youngster Preetpal Singh, who has done BEd, MEd with masters in Punjabi and history and cleared the CTET and PTET, also has the same tale of woes. He tried for a job in private schools also, but did not join due to meagre salary.“There are hundreds of more such educated youngsters in Punjab and they are members of our union. The Punjab Government should at least recruit 15,000 BEd teachers as an immediate measure,” said Sukhwinder Singh Dhilwan, president of the BEd and TET Pass Union, Punjab.Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla said his government had sympathy with the unemployed in the state. “I have been meeting BEd and ETT-pass persons repeatedly and conveying their demands to the Punjab Government.

The ICMR had earlier asked the states to do these studies to determine the scale of Covid in their populations. The SARI/ILI survey was underway in 22 district hospitals and the data for 680 patients had already been received, said Bhaskar. More data was awaited.

23-06-2020||Muktsar||Locusts spotted again, Dept, PAU on high alert||As swarms of locusts reached Sriganganagar district in Rajasthan, the Agriculture Department has been keeping a vigil on the Rajasthan and Punjab border. Locusts can fly around 150-200-km daily and prove harmful for vegetation.Jalour Singh, Chief Agriculture Officer, Muktsar, said, “A big locust swarm of 40 sq km was spotted in Sriganganagar district on Saturday and Sunday, which is now moving towards Bikaner district. Luckily, locusts have not entered our state, but we are keeping vigil in the Malout block, which shares the boundary with Rajasthan. The threat from locusts is expected till the end of August.”He said, “The authorities in Rajasthan are alert and controlling the situation, but farmers don’t have enough equipments. The neighbouring state is sharing every detail with us.”Dr PK Chhuneja, Head, Entomology Department, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), said the locust swarm of one sq km can eat as much food as 35,000 persons in terms of weight per day. “Movement of locusts depend on three factors, including wind direction, speed and availability of vegetation. Monsoon may attract locusts towards the state as rain increases vegetation,” he said.The PAU has issued an advisory in this regard, stating that movement of locusts had started due to rain in the desert areas. “Monsoon is round the corner and it may change direction of the locusts. The coming days are crucial for us,” said a senior official in the Agriculture Department.He said Fazilka, Muktsar and Bathinda districts would be more prone to locust attack as they are located close to Rajasthan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/locusts-spotted-again-dept-pau-on-high-alert-102867
23-06-2020||Moga||Punjab government bans sale of nine pesticides||The state government has banned the sale of at least nine types of pesticides, insecticides and fungicides in the ongoing kharif season with immediate effect.Secretary, Agriculture, Dr Kahan Singh Pannu has also issued an advisory to farmers not to use the chemical formulations of acephate, carbendazim, thiamethoxam, triazofos, tricyclazole, buprofezin, carbofuron, propiconazole and thiophanate methyl on basmati and other crops.He said these chemicals were harmful for human health and were also banned in European countries and in many other Asian countries.He said the department had estimated to grow basmati on 7-lakh hectare during the ensuing kharif season.Dr Pannu has also issued directions to field staff of the department to reach out to basmati growers and motivate them for judicious use of pesticides, so as to improve its quality for export.The export of basmati from the country is expected to touch Rs 40,000 crore this year. It will be an increase of 15 per cent over Rs 35,000 crore last year. The state is expected to contribute nearly 40 per cent of the exports, which accounts to Rs 15,000 crore.Scientists from the department have asked the farmers to grow 1718, 1509 and 1121 varieties of basmati as these were in good demand in both national and international markets.Three years ago, basmati exporters from the state had suffered huge losses as many containers containing varieties of rice were rejected by European nations, Saudi Arabia and other Middle-East countries after traces of pesticides were found in them.Moga CAO Dr Balwinder Singh, and Plant Protection Officer Jaswinder Singh Brar said they had asked all dealers not to keep the banned chemicals, failing which legal action would be initiated against them. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-bans-sale-of-nine-pesticides-102868
23-06-2020||Moga||Rodents pose threat to paddy fields, Punjab Agriculture University experts issue advisory||Experts from Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, today issued an advisory to farmers in the Malwa belt on rodent control during the germination stage in direct seeded rice (DSR) fields.Farmers said rats were creating problems in the fields owing to the persistent dry weather conditions.Agricultural experts said irrigation and puddling of fields in manual rice transplantation naturally destroyed rodent burrows (holes), but in direct seeded rice fields, farmers needed to kill them.The lesser bandicoot rat, Bandicota bengalensis, is the predominant rodent pest species in Punjab, causing a huge damage to various crops. Its burrows could be identified in crop fields from loose heaps of soil. Other rodent species found in crop fields include soft furred field rat, Millardia meltada; Indian gerbil,Tatera indica; Indian bush rat, Golunda ellioti; and field mouse, Mus booduga.“To control rodents during the germination stage, close all burrow openings present within the field, on bunds and in surrounding areas with soil. The next day, insert a paper boat containing 10-10g of poison bait (zinc phosphide or bromodiolone) about 6-inch deep in each burrow and again close it with soil. In case of burrows of B. bengalensis, gently remove the fresh soil from above the burrow complex to locate the tunnel and then put the poison bait deep inside it,” said PAU experts.Since the acceptance of poison bait by rodents depends upon the quality, texture, taste and odour of the baiting material, therefore always prepare rodenticides bait as per the recommended methods —- 2 per cent zinc phosphide bait and 0.005% bromodiolone bait, say the experts. As zinc phosphide bait becomes ineffective due to the release of phosphene gas after coming in contact with water or moisture, this bait should be prepared afresh every time, they said.“Do not to use zinc phosphide in repeated baitings to deal with the leftover population,” they said.The PAU experts said the control of rodents in smaller areas usually became ineffective due to their migration from the surrounding untreated fields.Plant Protection Officer, Moga, Dr Jaswinder Brar said the Agriculture Department had launched a campaign to kill rats in many vulnerable villages of the district, particularly adjoining the Sutlej belt.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rodents-pose-threat-to-paddy-fields-punjab-agriculture-university-experts-issue-advisory-102869

23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Akalis oppose Punseed merger||The SAD today condemned government’s move to abolish Punseed and merge it with Punjab Agro.SAD Kisan Wing chief Sikander Singh Maluka said Punseed was responsible for ensuring propagation of quality seed and ensuring it reached the farmer. He said in contrast, Punjab Agro was mandated with ensuring marketing of horticulture produce. He said any move to abolish Punseed would give a fillip to the seed mafia and could result in many more seed scams as the one which happened recently when spurious PR 128 and PR 129 paddy variety seed was sold to unsuspecting farmers. He said maintaining Punseed was in the interest of the farming community and SAD would oppose any move which tinkered with its present day identity.He also condemned the state government for “betraying” marginal farmers of the state who had borne huge expenses to manage paddy straw last year but were not paid compensation for the same as per the directions of the SC.Maluka said it was unfortunate that the Congress Government had not paid compensation of Rs 2,500 per acre to marginal farmers with less than five acres for not burning straw.Meanwhile, he announced dissolving all employees units of the party on Monday. The new office-bearers would be announced soon. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akalis-oppose-punseed-merger-102879
