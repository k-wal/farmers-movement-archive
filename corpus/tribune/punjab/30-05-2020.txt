30-05-2020||Chandigarh||Stuck in Germany since Jan, PEC students finally return home||For 17 students of Punjab Engineering College (PEC), a five-month internship programme at Karlsruhe (Germany) would remain a nightmare for the rest of their lives.The students, who returned to the city on Friday, were stuck in Germany amidst the Covid-19 lockdown.Sangrur's Shantanu Chawla (21) said they would spend each day hoping to return home. He is one of the students selected to attend the internship programme at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). A third-year student of Production and Industrial Engineering at PEC, Chawla had left for KIT in January this year.“The first two months were good. My internship started from January 7. There were a few Covid cases at that time and the situation was not as grave. However, on March 22, suddenly all flights were stopped and institutes were closed. I was getting 511 Euros per month (approx Rs 41,000) from the KIT University to bear my living expenses. But still I had to ask help from my family, as this was not enough,” said Chawla.He added: “Due to the pandemic, I was advised by the KIT authorities to leave for India as soon as possible. They even booked a flight for me, but unfortunately, the flight got cancelled. Later, as we remained stuck we contacted PEC Director Dheeraj Sanghi and other deans who helped us.”Students claimed to have approached the Indian Embassy, but allegedly received a little help. “We got a confirmation from the Indian Embassy (in Berlin) that there is a flight from Frankfurt to New Delhi on May 28 (as per German schedule). But it was only for the residents of Delhi-NCR, Haryana and Chandigarh. Some of the students are from Punjab,” said Arshvir Singh from Mechanical Branch.“From 17 students, only five or six received the link for the repatriation of that flight. We again approached our teachers in PEC and got a contact of one of our alumni, who was a consulate officer at Consulate General of India at Frankfurt. She helped us in completing necessary formalities. Our Director wrote to the UT Administration, Punjab Government, Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Embassy in Berlin. PEC helped all of us, including Uday Raghuvanshi, Rajat Goyal, Sahil Mehta, Ankit Billa and Gurpreet Singh, board the same flight,” he added.These students landed in New Delhi on Friday and were later brought to Chandigarh. They have been put under 14-day quarantine at a hotel in Sector 17.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/stuck-in-germany-since-jan-pec-students-finally-return-home-92111

30-05-2020||---||Punjab extends lockdown till June 30||Chandigarh, May 30Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday announced a four-week extension in the lockdown in Punjab, till June 30, with certain more relaxations, subject to the guidelines of the central government.Though experts have advised against opening of the hospitality industry and malls, the Chief Minister said the state would take into account the central government guidelines for Lockdown 5.0.The Chief Minister announced his decision after an on-ground assessment of the Covid situation through a Video Conference with health experts, along with top officials and Cabinet Ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Tript Singh Bajwa. The move is also in line with the central government’s decision to extend the national lockdown beyond May 31.Also read: Hospitality services, malls to open from June 8; containment zones to remain in lockdownPhased reopening: What is allowed and what's notCaptain Amarinder later said during his weekly Facebook Live session that the threat of Covid was not over yet, and if necessary, he would continue to take tough measures to save the lives of Punjabis.The Chief Minister ordered distribution of free masks to the poor. He directed Food & Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to ensure immediate steps for the distribution of masks as part of ration kids to the needy and poor, who could not afford to purchase them.The Chief Minister sought an update during the meeting on the state government’s plans for launch of home surveillance and Covid Foot Soldiers deployment to track and trace infections. He was informed by Anurag Agarwal, Principal Secretary (Health & Family Welfare) that both would be launched over the next couple of days. Asha workers and other local women from the community were being hired to undertake home to home surveillance across districts, and they would be paid Rs 2 per head in every household surveyed, he said.As for the tracing and tracking of symptomatic cases who were not reporting to the health authorities, an app was currently being field-tested and would launched in 2-3 days. Youngsters would be asked to download the app to voluntarily report on such cases, said Agarwal, adding that mandatory OTP verification of these Covid Foot Soldiers would be ensured to check false reporting.The Chief Minister later, in his FB session, said non-reporting to health authorities by those returning to the state, especially from abroad, was a big challenge, as it complicated their contact tracing and endangered the lives of others. He revealed that 9,560 of such people had been traced and tested, and some positive cases had been found among these.Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh apprised the Chief Minister during the VC of the screening/testing being done at airports and railway stations to check the spread of the Covid in view of the large influx of people coming from other states. While all entrants to the state were being screened, and had to undergo 14-day mandatory home quarantine, testing facilities had also been installed to undertake random testing at the airports and stations, he added.Those who could not download COVA app would have to fill in declaration forms on the trains, and submit the same at the stations, he said.Underscoring the need to strictly adhere to all health norms, Amarinder said 36,820 people have been fined for not wearing masks and 4,032 persons for spitting in public in just 11 days from May 17 till May 28. As many as 6,061 persons had been fined for not wearing masks in just the last 24 hours, he said, adding that 503 FIRs had been registered in this period for violation of rules.Expressing his concern about possible community spread in his reply to another query, he said this is the threat we face now and he would keep this fact in mind while deciding about relaxations. Referring to cases in Amritsar, in reply to another query by a resident, he said out of 7 cases reported yesterday, six were contact cases.On a complaint by a Ludhiana resident about violation of government instructions by schools, he asked the DC to take strict action against such schools.Responding to a question, the Chief Minister said he was happy to note that 85% of the state’s industry had already started operations with 65% of labour engaged in it. The government was facilitating many multinational IT firms, including Quark, to set base in Mohali and many more would come to Punjab as the situation improves, he said in reply to another query.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-extends-lockdown-till-june-30-92078

What was more embarrassing about the video was that it showed the singer using service weapons to shoot as some cops stood by giving him tips on how to shoot.The development lead to Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta ordering an FIR under section 188 (disobeying orders of a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and also sections of the Disaster Management Act against Moosewala and five policemen, who were also suspended.A second FIR was filed against Moosewala on May 5 after another video showed him using his own weapon at another range, Laddai Kothi.Police added the Arms Act, 1959, charges to both cases on May 17.Police are still looking for Moosewala, who has been missing since the incident.“We have received information that three more accused including Inderveer, Gagandeep and Karam have got interim bail. Only Singer Sidhu Moosewala is absconding now. Our teams are conducting raid to arrest him,” Gurmeet Singh, superintendent of Police of Sangrur’s Punjab Bureau of Investigation, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-moosewala-arms-act-case-three-more-people-given-bail-92077

30-05-2020||---||Free power to farmers will continue till my govt in power: Punjab CM||Chandigarh, May 30Categorically rejecting the allegations of withdrawal of free power to Punjab’s farmers, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Saturday, said his government was ready to willing to forego the portion of fiscal deficit enhancement offered by the Centre but would not compromise with the farmers’ interest at any cost.Dismissing the Centre’s suggestion on replacement of free power to farmers with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) as “totally unacceptable and a direct attack on the federal structure of the nation”, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said he would take up the issue with the Centre for trying to impose such anti-farmer conditions on the cash-strapped state in the guise of extending fiscal support amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a press release by the government read.Asserting that the free power facility for farmers would continue to exist till his government was in power, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said his government would take loans to bridge the fiscal deficit, and the Government of India could not dictate the terms of a sovereign loan being taken by a state government.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh also lashed out at Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Badal for trying to pin the blame for the Central Government’s misdemeanours on the state government, which had unwaveringly been providing free power to farmers since taking over in March 2017, despite the massive fiscal crunch it had inherited from the erstwhile Akali-BJP regime.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh asked Sukhbir to immediately quit the ruling NDA at the Centre, and demanded Union Minister and Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Central Cabinet, pointing out that it was the Government of India that took the decision of directing the states to withdraw free power and also failed to come to the rescue of the state, and any section of its people, in the wake of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and lockdown.Terming their allegations as malicious and mischievous, and totally unsubstantiated, Captain Amarinder hit out at the SAD leadership for not fighting for the rights of Punjab and its people, including farmers, at the Centre or in Parliament, and resorting, instead, to petty and shameless politicking even on such a grave issue of national concern, the press release further stated.“If you have even an iota of shame, you should leave the NDA coalition, of which you are a part, immediately, and join my government is working for the people of the state,” Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said, criticising Sukhbir and Harsimrat over their pathetic attempts to mislead the people of Punjab with their patent double standards, blatant falsehoods, unfounded allegations.He recalled the shocking display of hypocrisy of SAD even over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which they had supported in the Parliament before launching a public tirade against it. It was obvious, said the Chief Minister, that Sukhbir, Harsimrat and their party had no scruples or principles and were only interested in promoting their personal and political interests.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh clarified that the state cabinet had, in its last meeting, given in-principle approval to undertaking certain reforms to become eligible to avail additional borrowing of 1.5 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) amid COVID-19, as mandated by the Government of India.While allowing an enhancement of fiscal deficit of states under the FRBM Act from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, the Government of India had linked a portion of the same to certain administrative reforms.It was for the BJP and its alliance partner SAD to explain why there was an attempt to force such a condition on Punjab, he said.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Friday, had also tweeted on this issue, saying: “Let me reassure our farmers that there is no plan to withdraw free power to agriculture in Punjab. I am cognizant of your economic condition and appreciate the hard work put in by you in every crop to grow foodgrain for the country. Free power will continue!”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/free-power-to-farmers-will-continue-till-my-govt-in-power-punjab-cm-92069
