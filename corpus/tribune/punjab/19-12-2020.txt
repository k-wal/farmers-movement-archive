19-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ agitation: Will decide next course of action in 2-3 days, say protesting unions||Farmer unions protesting against the three agriculture laws on Saturday said they will decide their next course of action in the next two-three days, after the Supreme Court earlier this week pointed out it was thinking of setting up an “impartial and independent” panel of agriculture experts and peasants’ unions to resolve the deadlock.Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said discussions among unions are currently underway to decide their strategy, adding that they are also seeking legal opinion on the matter.“Our meetings are being held for the next course of action. We hope that in the next two-three days, we will have clarity on whether we should be part of a committee as suggested by the court,” Kakka told PTI.Another leader Balbir Singh said farmers will not call off their protests until their demands are met.“We are ready for a long haul. We are here for our rights. We are in the process to decide our stand following the court’s order,” he also said.Thousands of farmers have been staying put at several Delhi border points for the last 23 days, demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.Meanwhile, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) Saturday claimed that 33 farmers participating in the ongoing protests have so far died since November 26 due to accidents, illness and cold weather conditions.According to AIKS, ‘Homage Day’ will be observed in different parts of the country on Sunday to pay tributes to those farmers who lost their lives.Earlier this week, the Supreme Court had acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and mooted the idea of putting on hold the contentious farm laws to enable negotiations with the agitating farmers, which was opposed by the Centre, which said the agriculturists would not come forward for the talks then.The apex court, which made it clear that the issue of farmers’ protest and the right of others to move freely would be dealt on priority at the moment and not the validity of the laws, also said it was thinking of setting up an “impartial and independent” panel of agriculture experts and farmer unions to resolve the impasse.The top court said it was of the view that the farmers’ right to protest should not infringe the fundamental right of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blocking the entire city.The apex court, which said it was worried with the way things are going on, was told by both the Centre and one of the farmers’ unions that the negotiations are not happening at the moment.It also said the farmers cannot keep on protesting without talking to the government. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-agitation-will-decide-next-course-of-action-in-2-3-days-say-protesting-unions-186648

After waiting for half-an-hour, they tried to march towards CM’s residence and police “cane-charged” the teachers, including women.The protesting teachers said the state government was not serious to advertise the jobs and had been dilly-dallying for years now.The protesting teachers asked why Education Department did allow B.Ed graduates to apply for the post of ETT teachers. They demanded the Education department should repeal the provision B.Ed entry and advertise 10,000 new posts immediately.Deepak Kamboj, state president, Unemployed ETT TET Pass Union, said, “Due to indifferent attitude of the government, thousands of ETT TET pass aspirants are without job. The government has failed to provide jobs to the youth over the past three years. The government was bragging ‘Ghar Ghar Rozegar’ while qualified youth were still protesting on roads.”Meanwhile, teachers said they had refused the offer of district administration of a three-member committee under the chairmanship of Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. Till the filing of report, teachers were holding a sit-in near the CM residence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-lathicharge-protesting-teachers-near-cm-residence-in-patiala-186638
19-12-2020||---||Punjab CM flays Centre for intimidating ‘arhtiyas’ with motivated I-T raids||Chandigarh, December 19Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday castigated the Centre for its intimidatory tactics against arhityas supporting the agitating farmers, and warned that such draconian measures will further aggravate the angst of the people against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government.Terming the clearly motivated Income Tax (I-T) raids against some Punjab arhtiyas as an obvious pressure tactic to curb their democratic right and freedom, Amarinder said these oppressive actions will backfire against the ruling BJP.The Chief Minister said it was evident that having failed to persuade, mislead and divide the farmers into ending their prolonged protest against the black Farm Laws, the central government was now trying to weaken their struggle by targetting the arhtiyas, who have been actively supporting the agitation since Day 1.The I-T raids were conducted at the premises of several big arthityas of Punjab within a span of just four days of issuing notices, without waiting for responses to the notices, Amarinder noted, dubbing it a clear debasement of the due process of law. Even the local police were not informed or taken into confidence, as is the normal procedure, and instead, the CRPF was used to provide security during the raids by the I-T teams, he pointed out.“What is this if not a clear case of vendetta politics by the Centre, which is hell-bent on demolishing the farmers’ protest by hook or by crook?” asked the Chief Minister.Among the victims of the night-long raids, which were conducted in the presence of 2 bus-loads each of CRPF personnel, were Vijay Kalra (president Punjab Arthiya Association), Pawan Kumar Goyal (president Samana Mandi), Jaswinder Singh Rana (Patiala Dist president), Manjinder Singh Walia (president Nawanshahr), Hardeep Singh Ladda (president Rajpura) and Kartar Singh and Amrik Singh (arthiyas Rajpura). A total of 14 arhtiyas across Punjab have received notices from the I-T department.“These bullying actions of the government do not augur well for the world’s largest democracy,” he added.Pointing out that even the Supreme Court had upheld the people’s right to protest peacefully, the Chief Minister said the central government’s actions amounted to gross violation of the apex court’s directions and the spirit of the Constitution, which granted every citizen the right to raise his voice.Amarinder reiterated his appeal to the Central government not to stand on ego on the issue but to revoke the farm laws and start afresh with a meaningful dialogue with the farmers and all other stakeholders to come out with more progressive reform legislations that are in the interest of all.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-flays-centre-for-intimidating-arhtiyas-with-motivated-i-t-raids-186624
19-12-2020||Anand (Gujarat)||Why Cong allowed contract farming in Punjab, asks Gujarat CM||Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Saturday alleged that corporates are allowed to enter into contract farming in the Congress-ruled Punjab while the party is opposing the new farm laws.Among other things, the new laws enacted by the Union government provide a framework for contracts between private entities and farmers.Addressing a gathering at Karamsad in Anand district as part of the BJP’s campaign to create awareness about the contentious farm sector reforms,Rupani also claimed that the Congress manifesto spoke about allowing the sale of produce outside Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs).“I must ask Congress, why your government in Punjab, your chief minister (Amarinder Singh) granted permission for contract farming to large companies and distributed permission letters from the stage?” Rupani said.“And now they are out to oppose contract farming?” he asked.“Contract farming is the future. In contract farming, farmers are assured of the price they will get for their produce,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had in the past written letters to chief ministers of party-ruled states seeking that farmers be allowed to sell their produce in open markets, and the same promise was made in the party’s 2019 election manifesto, Rupani further claimed.APMCs will continue to function contrary to the fear that they will be abolished, and the Centre as well as the Gujarat government have earmarked crores of rupees for their modernization, Rupani said.His government gave farm loans at zero percent interest, he said.“If the Congress is so much concerned about farmers, then give loans to them at zero per cent interest in (Congress-ruled) Rajasthan,” he said.He also dared the Congress to state how many farmers benefited from loan waiver in Madhya Pradesh during its rule.“Anti-national elements” who do not want to see the country progress and farmers lead a happy life have joined the agitation against the new farm laws, Rupani alleged.“Farmers are not part of it. Farmers across the country did not participate in the Bharat Bandh call given by the opposition,” he claimed.

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM sets targets for police officers to investigate and submit challans in criminal cases||To enforce strict investigation in criminal cases, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday ordered specific targets to be set for investigation of criminal cases by police officers across ranks.With this, all police officers, from the rank of CPs and SPs down to SHOs, SIs and HCs, would be required to personally investigate and present challans in a set number of cases in a year with strict supervision by senior officials.Regular follow-ups, as well as close coordination with prosecution and law officers, is mandatory as per the Chief Minister's directives.As per the directives issued by DGP Dinkar Gupta—on the orders of the Chief Minister—ADCPs in the three Police Commissionerates and SPs posted in the districts would personally investigate at least six heinous crimes in a year, and submit challans under their own name, and the ACP/ DSP Sub-Divisions have to investigate at least eight cases a year.SPs/DSPs of PBI and Investigation/Detective shall personally investigate at least 18 crime cases in a year, including those of heinous IPC crime, commercial quantity NDPS cases etc, and submit challans under their own name, with all similarly mandated to investigate and submit challans in at least 6 heinous crime cases in a year.The targets also cover SHOs of over 400 police stations, that shall investigate at least 8 heinous crime cases and file challans in a year.The Chief Minister said, that he had been "constrained" to set these targets after observing the investigation and prosecution cases—which should be the key job of all officers— has taken a back seat due to lack of commitment to Law and Order duties, work pressures and lack of supervision by the gazetted police officers who are responsible for enforcing accountability of the Investigating Officers of various ranks.To enforce accountability, Supervisory Officers (SPs/SDPOs and DSPs) have been directed to personally involve themselves with the investigations.CP/SSPs have been asked to ensure that all the SOs posted in the districts comply with the directions set for investigation.The situation was particularly worrying in heinous crime cases, such as murder, attempt to murder, armed robbery/dacoity, Rape, Kidnapping, extortion, POCSO Act, NDPS Act cases of commercial quantity, UAPA Act, IT Act, and other sensation cases involving crimes against women, children and weaker sections of society or crimes having inter-state ramifications.Even in these cases, the Chief Minister said, that he noticed the SOs are not being guided and directed by senior officers efficiently and effectively.Besides this, it was noticed that SHOs and SIs posted at police stations did not personally investigate heinous crime, and that they would hand over the case to lower subordinates which was a gross violation of the provisions of the law.The ACP/DSP Sub-Divisions, and officers of PBI, have to camp out at the scene until the case is solved. This is for cases like murder, rape, atrocities against weaker sections of society, women and children, and other sensitive and sensational cases.They have to guide the SHO during the investigation process, and give notes in the case.As far as investigations by NGOs and Head Constables (HCs) are concerned, the DGP, in line with the Chief Minister’s orders, has directed that directly recruited Sub Inspectors shall investigate at least 8 heinous crime cases, 10 Minor IPC cases and 10 Local & Special Law cases in one year.Promoted Sub Inspectors and Assistant Sub Inspectors posted in Police Stations shall investigate at least 6 heinous crime cases, 10 other IPC cases and 15 Local and Special Law cases in one year, while regular HCs shall investigate at least 5 Minor IPC cases and 10 Local & Special Law cases in a year.The investigations of all Special Reported cases shall be meticulously perused and coordinated by SOs with Prosecution Officers for proper trial management.The DGP has further directed that IGP/DIG Ranges, CPs and SSPs shall ensure meticulous compliance of these directions and send a Compliance Report, along with the list of heinous crime cases being investigated by SOs, SHOs and directly recruited SIs to DBoI Punjab, by 5th January, 2021.Gupta said the Chief Minister had earlier notified the Punjab Bureau of Investigation (PBI) and sanctioned over 125 posts of SPs and DSPs for the detection of heinous crimes.Another 800 posts of domain experts, in the fields of law, forensics, commerce, IT and cyber crimes, had been sanctioned to support complex investigations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-sets-targets-for-police-officers-to-investigate-and-submit-challans-in-criminal-cases-186601
19-12-2020||Bathinda||India’s oldest train Punjab Mail back on track, set for a makeover||The 108-year-old "Punjab Mail" is back on track once again. India's oldest train is all set for a makeover.This train runs from Ferozepur to CST Mumbai, and is known as the lifeline for the passengers from Malwa Region in Punjab going to Delhi or cities en route till Mumbai.The train was suspended due to the nationwide lockdown. It restarted from December 1. Railway officials have also decided to replace its rakes—made by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF)—with Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches, which are faster, and more efficient.A senior railway official, on anonymity, revealed, that ICF coaches are conventional passenger coaches used on the majority of the mainline trains in India.LHB coaches are developed by the Linke-Hofmann-Busch in Germany, but mostly, are produced by the Rail Coach Factory in Kapurthala in Punjab.LHB coaches can travel at a much higher speed than ICF coaches. Maximum speed for LHB coaches is 160 kmph, while ICFcoaches run at the speed of 110 kmph.Moreover, LHB coaches are equipped with controlled discharge toilets- bio-toilets. They also use an Advanced Pneumatic Disc Brake system for efficient braking at a higher speed.Earlier, the 'Punjab Mail' was called 'Punjab Limited', and it was steamed out on June 1, 1921, from Mumbai, heading for Peshawar—now in Pakistan.Before Partition, the train ran from Ballard Pier Mole station in Mumbai to Peshawar, covering a distance of 2,496 km in 47 hours.In 1914, this train started departing from Victoria Terminus presently known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus.After the Indo-Pak partition, Ferozepur Cantt railway station was made as to the terminal station.It was known to be the fastest train of British India.The 'Punjab Mail' was a subject of a couple of eponymous films released in 1939 and 1958, besides featuring in several stories and some Indian novels.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/indias-oldest-train-punjab-mail-back-on-track-set-for-a-makeover-186586

As days pass by, the war of words has only become more intense. Now, the Punjabi singer has shared an audio clip.Sharing the 39-second voice clip on the microblogging website, the singer wrote: "Ek Funny Gal Share Karni c. Mitran Da Naam BLOOD PRESSURE Di Goli Varga Ek Vaari Lagg Jave.. Fer kithey hatda.. Tera ni Kasoor.."In the clip, Diljit said in Punjabi: "Oh my god. I've to share something with you guys. There are 2-3 girls who are unable to digest their food until they chant my name. It's just like a doctor prescribing two tablets in the morning and two in the evening. Only then they digest food. One of those girls has a very bad voice. Don't give them any weight. They will themselves stop shouting. Ok ta ta".Ek Funny Gal Share Karni c 😂 Mitran Da Naam BLOOD PRESSURE Di Goli Varga Ek Vaari Lagg Jave.. Fer kithey hatda.. Tera ni Kasoor... 🤣 pic.twitter.com/5fMyn2oGoB  Fans started speculating that Diljit was mimicking Kangana's voice.Soon after this, Kangana shared a 2-minute video message on the ongoing farmers' protests."Here’s the video I promised, watch when you can," read her tweet.In the clip, Kangana said: "I had given everyone my word that I will speak about the farmers’ protests once the true motivations are revealed, just like the Shaheen Bagh protests. After the kind of mental and emotional lynching and rape threats I have faced online during these 10-12 days, it’s my right to ask some questions to this country. Since the Prime Minister has made everything clear, there is no scope for any doubts, it has been proven that this entire movement was politically motivated and even terrorists had started participating in it.”Here’s the video I promised, watch when you can 🙏 pic.twitter.com/0YZxfQfwB2  She continued, “I have lived in Punjab... I know 99.9% people of Punjab do not want Khalistan. They don’t want a piece of this country, they belong to India. From Arunachal Pradesh to Maharashtra to Delhi, it’s all theirs. They don’t want a small portion, they all are patriots. I don’t have any complains with terrorists who want to break this country, I understand their feelings. But how do these innocent people let these terrorists play with them. Like the Shaheen Bagh dadi couldn’t read but was protesting to save her citizenship, the dadi from Punjab has been hurling abuses at me and trying to save her land from the government, what is happening in this country? Friends, how do we allow ourselves to be so vulnerable before these terrorists and foreign powers? I have a complaint against you. I have to talk about my intentions every day, a patriot has to clarify so many things. But people like Diljit Dosanjh and Priyanka Chopra, no one asks them about their intentions. What is their policy? When I talk in favour of this country, I am accused of doing politics. Ask them as well what is their policy.

19-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP will form next govt in Punjab; to contest all 117 seats: Tarun Chugh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 19BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh is confident that the party will form the next government in Punjab. Talking to The Tribune on issues ranging from the ongoing farmer agitation to the BJP’s relationship with the Akalis and its future plans in Punjab, the senior leader says “preparations have started on a war footing to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in 2022”.Q: As a BJP leader from Punjab, do you think the Centre misjudged the underlying anger among farmers on the three laws?A: Nothing of the sort. Discussions on reforms in agriculture marketing have been going on for the last almost 20 years in political, administrative and academic circles. I wish protesting farmers had seen the bills for themselves instead of getting misled by malicious propaganda of the Opposition parties and people of other vested interests.Even during the Vajpayee government time, the discussions on the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had started and were carried on during the UPA government times, during which as many as 13 states, including Punjab, implemented the new APMC rules.The new APMC Act was passed in 2003, following which new rules were framed which were implemented by many states.The then union agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, in 2012 told the Rajya Sabha that “there are some (reforms) which have already been accepted, for instance, recommendation regarding liberalising agri-procurement…We have requested all Cooperation Ministers in the states to make amendment in the APMC Act”.The Dalwai committee formed during the first Modi government recommended the adoption of the new Agricultural Marketing Act of 2017, which was adopted by 16 states.A second Dalwai Committee was set up in 2018 to protect the interests of producers and sponsors of contract farming. This second Dalwai Committee, recommended another Model Act which dealt with contract farming. This Model Contract Framing Act was circulated to all states/UTs in May 2018.Tamil Nadu and Odisha have adopted this Model Contract Farming Act of 2018. So there is nothing like that the Centre had done something out of the blue.Q: Do you think the crisis could have been averted/handled in a better way by the Centre? A: As I told you, the protest seems to have gone in the hands of people with vested interests who wanted to build an opposition to the Modi government and found an emotive issue of farming for the purpose.Q: Are Punjab leaders, from all parties, also not responsible for the escalation of the crisis?A: The Congress government, led by Amarinder Singh, fanned and supported the initial voices of resentment and gave it a shape of state-wide campaign. The SAD, whose leaders were all along aware and part of the process of making three bills, took to the backdoor to run away from the NDA alliance and added fuel to the fire. Leftist parties have been openly building a propagandist narrative to mislead gullible farmers.Q: What about the BJP?A: We have been making all efforts to make farmers understand the true spirit of the bills, which was to empower them and help them double their income.Q:  The amendments being offered by the Centre virtually rewrite the Acts. Then why doesn’t the government simply repeal them, start afresh and end this agitation?A: The proposed amendments are meant to bring peace and to reassure farmers that the Centre will always protect their interests. They do not alter the spirit of the bills. They are just reassuring and there is nothing wrong in that.Q: The BJP is planning to strike alone in Punjab. Do you think the current situation will affect your position in the state?A: The BJP has been contesting elections in Punjab since 1952. In 1992, when it contested alone, it polled 16.7 per cent votes and won six seats. It is a firmly rooted party in Punjab and our base is expanding. We have started preparations on a war footing to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in the 2022 elections. The organisational structure at 23,000 polling booths is being strengthened by mobilising workers at the grassroot level. We are sure to form the next government in Punjab.Q: Your former ally, Sukhbir Badal, has made some very harsh statements about your partyA: Sukhbir Badal is making divisive and provocative statements that reflect his desperation. He is trying to contain the declining graph of the party after many SAD stalwarts left the party in the wake of his arrogant style of functioning. His remarks against the BJP are at best childish. The BJP has always worked for Hindu-Sikh unity in Punjab and has made sure the brotherhood between the two communities did not suffer even during the worst of times during the militancy days.Q: Do you think after what has happened, what will happen to the BJP tie-up with the AkalisA: The SAD has broken the alliance, not us. Now whether we will re-join hands or not, only time can tell. Moreover, the SAD is all in pieces now. It’s a “tukde tukde” Akali Dal out of which all stalwarts such as Brahampura ji, Dhindsa ji, Ajnala ji have left.Q: What do you think is the future of this agitation henceforth?A: The Centre has addressed all major concerns of farmers. It is ready to hold more talks to dispel any doubts The BJP hopes farmers would soon call off their protest reposing faith in the leadership of PM Modi who has already implemented so many farmers’ welfare schemes including the “fasal bima yojna”.Q: You said 3,000 persons from other political parties have joined the BJP since the agitationA: Many senior leaders from prominent parties are ready to join us. We will contest on the basis of a large number of welfare schemes PM Modi has implemented and highlight how the Amarinder Singh government has become a government of mafias, be it drug mafia, land mafia or liquor mafia, there has been embezzlement in funds of the Central Government schemes, particularly the SC scholarship scam that saw a cabinet minister hand-in-glove with the scamsters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-will-form-next-govt-in-punjab-to-contest-all-117-seats%C2%A0tarun-chugh-186539

Everyone wants to do their bit to show their solidarity with farmers who had been protesting against the Centre for introducing three agri laws at Singhu and Tikri borders for more than 20 days.Poetry has become a medium to nudge the Central Government and vent out one’s feeling for safeguarding rights of agitating farmers.Amolak Singh, chief, Punjab Lok Sbhyacharak, who had gone to participate in the stir, wrote for widows of farmers who had committed suicide, ‘Photoa lai ke ture kaafile, dilli wall vaggiya, darda da dariya’, kise da Jeevan sathi tur gya, kise de jigar da tota, raakh siwe di seene pukhdi, jiyundi lash ve loka’.‘Chall ve putta, dilli chaliye, maa photo chumdi kendi, dilli tera babal baitha, main piche kinj rehndi’, he writes.Amolak said, “It was such an emotional scene, when I saw the kin holding pictures of farmers who had committed suicide. I was pained and then words came out automatically, I wrote what I felt.”The Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak Manch also organised various nukkad nataks for farmers at the protest sites.He concludes the poem, ‘Assi na lain muaavze aaye, assi haa dassan aaye, pehle maran kabool saanu, hakk layi jujhan aaye’.Narinder Kumar, who is an industrialist, wrote a poem “Assi chale jaane aa”. ‘Saada paani mod-de, Saadi mitti mod-de, asi chale jaane aa, apni khaad laija, maaru davayi laija, kali kamaai laija, kisan di khudaayi mod-de, asi chale jaane aa; asi mul mangan nai, hisab karan aaye aa, ajj de nai, chira de sataye aa, apne jhute parche laija, juthe karze laija, saade angoothe mod-de, asi chale jaane aa’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-protest-poetry-takes-centre-stage-to-vent-out-feelings-186463

Live-streaming was arranged for those who could not visit the gurdwara.Cops recover pistol, ‘belongs to follower’A note by Baba Ram Singh in his diary, written after his first visit to the Singhu border on December 9, was read by a preacher.In his diary, Baba Ram Singh had written that he was pained to see the problems being faced by farmers at the protest site amid the cold wave.The 68-year-old preacher had reportedly shot himself at the Singhu border on Wednesday evening. According to a handwritten note in Punjabi, purportedly left behind by him, he was unable to bear the pain of farmers.Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the government should learn a lesson and accept the demands of agitating farmers.“The government should learn from the sacrifice and accept the demands of farmers, which will be the true tribute to Baba Ram Singh and all farmers who had died during the stir,” he said.“Farmers are sitting peacefully and braving the cold under the open sky, but the government is not bothered. A democratically elected government should not take a stubborn attitude as there is no place for stubbornness in a democracy,” he said.Bibi Jagir Kaur, SGPC president, said Baba Ram Singh’s death was a big loss to humanity. “Babaji sacrificed his life to wake up the government as he could not bear the pain of farmers. If the government still does not accept their demands, it is a cruel government,” she said.Sanyukt Kisan Morcha members Manjeet Singh Rai, Baldev Singh Sirsa and others appealed to the farming community and others not to take the extreme step as they could not afford more sacrifices.“It is a big loss for society. We appeal to people not to take such a step. We will not go back till the laws are repealed,” said Rai.Sirsa said it was a wake-up call for the government and it should act immediately to avoid such incidents in the future.Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda, BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni, Bhartiya Kisan Mazdoor Naujawan Union president Rajinder Dadupur and several MLAs paid their last respects to the preacher.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/thousands-bid-farewell-to-karnal-gurdwara-head-sant-baba-ram-singh-186322

He is said to be operating from Kathunangal village in Tarn Taran.Two of his associates, identified as Harjit Singh Jeeta and Maan Singh, were arrested on December 11 after a 140-km chase from Rajpura to the outskirts of Jalandhar. They had come to Rajpura from Amritsar district to take the Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), which was “allowed by Excise officials to be delivered to them”.As they headed back with drums full of ENA in a mini-truck, they saw a police naka near Ropar, which alarmed them. They deserted the truck, before hiding in villages. Followed by joint teams of the Excise and police departments, they were finally nabbed on the outskirts of Jalandhar. They confessed the ENA was being smuggled in the state from Haryana, where trucks of ENA pilfered the spirit at a dhaba in Gohana. Following this, state Excise officials have written to their counterparts in Haryana, asking them to investigate the distilleries that were involved in the malpractice. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illicit-liquor-trade-excise-dept-zeroes-in-on-kingpin-186348

Similarly, the 03307/08 Dhanbad-Ferozepur-Dhanbad Ganga Sutlej Express (daily) would remain cancelled on every Thursday from Dhanbad and every Saturday from Ferozepur till January 28 and 30, 2021, respectively.Trains that would remain fully cancelled till January 31, 2021, included the 04673/74 Jaynagar-Amritsar-Jaynagar Shaheed Express (running four days a week), the 09611/14 Ajmer-Amritsar-Ajmer Express (biweekly), the 05933/34 Dibrugarh-Amritsar-Dibrugarh Express (weekly) and the 02357/58 Kolkatta-Amritsar-Kolkata Durgiana Express (biweekly).Meanwhile, the authorities have extended cancellation and short-termination of trains due to the farmers’ agitation till December 20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fog-hits-rail-traffic-in-punjab-186349

There is no lockdown on BJP rallies, but there is a lockdown on Parliament comprising just a few hundred members, and that too under controlled circumstances. The Covid excuse is patently fake and even ridiculous.”Describing the government’s attitude as a case of “historic blunder,” he said, “The ruling party’s adamant attitude to listen to the country’s ‘annadata’ and to let them die within a few hundred yards of Parliament would be remembered in history as a case of a heartless and conscience-less government at war with its own people?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sukhbir-urges-prez-to-convene-parliament-session-186292

19-12-2020||Chandigarh December 18||30,000 farmers to leave for Delhi on December 26, 27||The Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) today announced that over 30,000 farmers will join the protests at the Delhi borders on December 26 and 27.While a contingent of 15,000 protesters will march from the Khanauri border on December 26, another 15,000 will start march from Dabwali on December 27. The march has been planned to mark one month of protests.Claiming that sacrifices of farmers during the “kisan andolan” would not go waste, the union said these had made people more determined to take the struggle to its logical end.State president of the organisation Joginder Singh Ugrahan and state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said in response to the call of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha, gatherings would be organised on December 20 in villages of Punjab to pay homage to the farmers who lost their lives during the protest. Memorial processions will be taken out on December 21, 22 and 23. After paying homage to the martyrs at the village-level, block-level tribute functions will be held on December 24.A Delhi Chalo campaign committee has been formed under the leadership of Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan to strengthen the Delhi morcha, they said. This committee will organise activities to mobilise people to go to Delhi as well as to strengthen the ongoing morchas in Punjab.Reacting to the remarks made by the Supreme Court on the agitation, the leaders said the farmers had exercised their right amid restrictions imposed by the Modi government.

19-12-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers right in demanding repeal of laws, says P Sainath||Reacting to his name being brought up by the Supreme Court during the ongoing farmers’ protest, journalist P Sainath said he believed that the farmers were right in calling for repeal of the three farm laws. He said, “I will not want to be party to death by committee.”Sainath said he was flattered after the court brought up his name, but it would become an issue if the government actually approached him on the subject.“If that happens, I would want to know how the government understands the rationale for such a panel: What is its mandate, what will it actually look at, what is its composition? Will it be truly representative, what is its status (is the government bound by its findings)?”He said, “The operative part of the APMC or the farm laws is barely four pages. When the government says it is willing to make amendments to 12 of the 14 or 15 points of criticism the farmers have levelled against them, it is accepting how seriously flawed these laws are. It seems pointless to amend 80-90 per cent of such flawed documents (which many, including serious legal minds, are calling unconstitutional). These are sweeping bits of legislation by the Centre on what is, under the Constitution, a state subject.”He said the greatest panel ever set up on farming and the one that produced the closest thing to a blueprint for Indian agriculture for coming decades was the Swaminathan Commission (or more accurately, the National Commission on Farmers) report. The kind of expertise, talent and understanding that that panel had, remains unrivalled and it worked for years. Yet its reports are lying untouched and undiscussed in the Parliament for 16 years. It would be an excellent step if the Supreme Court advised the government to have that report discussed in the Parliament and set up a panel to oversee its speedy implementation, he said.He also asked to call for a special session of the Parliament on agrarian crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-right-in-demanding-repeal-of-laws-says-p-sainath-186297
19-12-2020||Chandigarh||At Tikri, protesters set up camps to brave cold||As the night temperatures dip further and icy winds sweep the North, farmers have started constructing covered structures on road dividers at the Tikri border.Most affected in this bone-chilling cold are the elders. The protest venue has witnessed at least six deaths of farmers due to exposure to cold weather since November 26.“As the night temperatures continue to dip further, we are left with no other alternative but to fortify our living quarters,” says Jeon Singh, an elderly farmer from Sangrur district. Harjeet Singh, a young farmer from Jeonwala village in Faridkot, says: “We are getting help from locals for items like wood. At the same time, we are also making our own purchases for covers of our tents and poles.”People from other regions are pitching in, too, to help farmers brave cold weather. Rubina Sanghera, a Chandigarh resident, says after their group’s first visit to the site of farmers’ protest they have now sent “270 blankets, 500 pairs of warm socks, 40 shawls, 30 jackets and about 80 legwarmers”.Sahildeep Singh, a worker of the Kirti Kisan Union, says: “We are getting similar help from many others quarters. However, we need more help for fighting the cold. Like, at the moment majority of the camps here require geysers for hot water. Normal water is freezing.”Gurpratap Singh, another farmer, says: “We had to pick a few poles from the government sites to make our tents. But what do we do? We young can sit in front of the fires, but, our elders cannot manage. We need the cover also, however, we are making these first for our elders”.Elderly Angriez Singh says: “North-westerly winds during winters are very dangerous. It has snowed heavily on the mountains, so we have to stay prepared for the worst. Even the day temperatures are going to be bad in the coming days”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/at-tikri-protesters-set-up-camps-to-brave-cold-186298

It was an instant hit on Friday.“Looking at the response, we are going to print 10,000 copies of the next issue,” says Ajaypal Natt from Mansa, a physiotherapy teacher. He along with Surmeet Mavi, Gurdeep Singh and Narinder Bhinder conceived the idea. The name, Natt says, was floated by one of us just out of fun. “But we instantly picked that,” he says.The style of the paper, he says, will be conversational. “We want it to read like the discussions taking place in village sath (common place),” he says, adding “we have a platform now to counter all kind of trash being dished out by some sections of media.”The first issue of the paper carried Bhagat Singh’s quote on struggle; photographs from the centre of the struggle; story of a woman farmer, Gurmail Kaur, who died during the protest; some works of art and the lead article gave the message of unity, struggle and victory. The paperwas simultaneously launched digitally on all social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protesting-farmers-launch-bilingual-paper-trolley-times-186303

It has been learnt from multiple sources in the Health Department that many health workers had been allegedly forging details of antigen tests on a regular basis.20 more die in last 24 hoursThe sources said fake entries were possible only in the antigen test unlike RT-PCR wherein samples are sent to a GMC lab. Moreover, the samples and kits are discarded by the staff immediately. Therefore, no evidence is left.A medical officer of the Health Department admitted that he himself entered fake entries by giving details of his family members and support staff. “In mid-September, when testing was at peak, we had to resort to fake entries because there was a lot of pressure of achieving a certain target. Even now, we get messages on a regular basis from the higher-ups that testing numbers are not sufficient.”Saleem Khan (35) of Patiala died of Covid on October 31 in Ambala. However, a test was conducted in his name on December 2 and reported negative. A copy of the record of this “falsification” has been accessed by The Tribune.When asked about the forgery, Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said, “I am issuing show-cause notices to the health staff of Kallon Majra, including the SMO. This is indiscipline and I will take strict action.”Dr Rajesh Bhasker, state nodal officer, said, “I am not aware of the issue. I will ask the district nodal officer to report on the matter.” Dr Manjit Singh, Punjab Health Director, said, “We will order an inquiry into the issue. Action will be taken if anyone is found guilty.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/staff-forge-covid-test-numbers-to-meet-target-dept-to-investigate-186311
