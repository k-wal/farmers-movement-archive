03-10-2020||New Delhi||India not to reopen Kartarpur Corridor on 'health grounds'||India on Saturday decided to continue the closure of the Kartarpur Corridor despite Pakistan reopening it. Citing COVID-19 protocols, and a 'technical issue' the reason behind the closure.Earlier in the day, the Pakistan government had announced, that the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib Corridor on their side has been reopened as the coronavirus situation had improved in their country.But India has crossed one-lakh COVID-19 deaths. The COVID situation has worsened. The decision of reopening would be taken in accordance with the COVID protocol, and easing of restrictions, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.Amid the ongoing pandemic, the government had shut down the Kartarpur Corridor in March. Pakistan had also imposed a ban on its nationals from accessing the Corridor.In June, Pakistan had briefly reopened the Corridor to commemorate Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death anniversary, but India had rejected the offer as COVID was a major concern.The MEA said, that it continued to remain in touch with all the concerned authorities, including Ministries of Home Affairs and Health, on its reopening.Pakistan Ministry of Religious Affairs on Friday issued a notification, allowing Indian visitors to come daily from dawn to dusk.The MEA had pointed out, that Pakistan was yet to fulfil some of the commitments at the time of reopening of the Kartarpur corridor, and in the bilateral agreement signed in October last year.It has been a year, and Pakistan is yet to construct the bridge at Budhi Ravi Channel, but it is ready at India's side. Despite a technical meeting with Pakistan, there is no progress, regretted Srivastava.Meanwhile, Kartarpur Sahib Corridor is a 4.7 kilometre-long passage, which was inaugurated last year between Dera Baba Nanak Sahib in Gurdaspur and Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan's Kartarpur.

As soon as the health officials started the registration process, villagers reached at the brick kiln with sharp-edged weapons to halt the sampling process.A frontline health worker said the villagers pushed around health workers, including women, and dubbed the incident as the worst experience of his life.Notably, health officials have been facing strong opposition from rural areas while sampling.Another health worker said: “They gheraoed us. They abused us. They pushed us. They even took the keys of the vehicles. I have never experienced this kind of behaviour in my life. We are going the extra mile to save their lives but we have to face this.”Sharing the experience of the incident, a female health worker said: “The incident has already instilled fear among us. They were so agitated that they could have done anything to us. It was very scary because they (villagers) were very aggressive.”Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said: “Very unfortunate incident. Our teams are working so hard to save people from coronavirus. Incidents like this demoralise and demotivate our staff.Patiala Civil Surgeon filed a complaint, after which the police have already booked five villagers for manhandling health workers. The accused have been booked under Section 353, 186, 332, 341, 506, 148 and 149 of the IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act.
03-10-2020||Charanjit Singh Teja||It’s a wait & see situation for hoteliers||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, October 2The government allowed hotels, restaurants and resorts to resume services on June 8 but the footfall has been very low during the last three months. Astonishingly, some of the city hotels are offering 50 per cent flat discount for tourists but still the occupancy is not a reason to cheer till date. Despite so many offerings, there are not much takers.The hoteliers claimed that footfall of tourists continued to nosedive due to restrictions on inter-state travel. Now, as government has announced waiver over levy of excise licence fee for the first two quarters of the financial year along with further curbing of restrictions it is all a wait and see thing for the hospitality industry.Will this help?BP Singh Khurana, owner of Khurana hotel at Mahan Singh Gate said, “The occupancy is very low even as the government allowed opening of hotels. We have never seen such a downfall in the business. The outbreak and ensuing lockdown were major challenges for the hotel industry, especially for medium and small-sized units. The lockdown has been a backbreaker. Workers associated with the industry are facing tough time.”The industry suffered a deadly blow as pandemic restricted tourist movement completely. There are about 800 hotels in the city. The hotel associations claimed that a medium-sized hotel provides employment to an average of 15 persons, including the manager, security guards, sweeper, cook, waiters, service boys and laundry service. Thus, over 12,000 persons were directly employed by the hotels and if the indirect beneficiaries and family member of the workers are counted, the pandemic has affected lives of over one lakh people associated with the industry. “Most hotels in the city are medium-sized units and the owners for months didn’t have enough savings to pay power bills, loan instalments, salaries of staff and other maintenance expenses. A number of hotels could be shuttered permanently due to the pandemic,” added Khurana.

At another protest, they gheraoed BJP’s national general secretary Tarun Chugh and showed him black flags to lodge their protest against the farm Acts.‘All parties favoured corporates’ “We burnt the effigies of Sonia Gandhi, Sukhbir Badal and Narendra Modi to give a message to the people that these parties were in the race for political mileage. They always made policies that suited big corporate houses. After Akali Dal’s kisan march, now Congress plans a tractor rally to revive its diminishing political graph,” said Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher.Tarun Chugh, accompanied by senior BJP leader Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, had to face the farmers’ wrath in Harsha Chhina village. The duo was shown black flags. Chugh tried to pacify them by promising them a meeting with the Prime Minister but the farmers kept raising anti-BJP slogans.Jatinder Singh Chhina, state press secretary of the Kirti Kisan Union, said as per the unanimous decision of 31 farm unions, no BJP leader would be allowed to enter rural areas.“When we came to know that Chugh went to Harsha Chhina village, we reached there. He was compelled to stop and talk to us about the farm Acts. He had no convincing reply to our queries,” he said.Meanwhile, Chugh said, “From October 2, on the directions of BJP president JP Nadda, the BJP launched a nationwide drive to apprise the farmers of the features of the farm Acts. In that direction, we started our campaign from Ajnala today. We will go to each and every village to meet the farmers and apprise them of the benefits of the Acts. The MSP and mandi pattern will stay.”

Later, a three-member probe panel was constituted by Chief Secretary Vini MahajanThe report of the panel, comprising IAS officers Jaspal Singh, KAP Sinha and Vivek Partap Singh, with comments by the Chief Secretary, was recently submitted to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.The probe was ordered by the Chief Minister after an inquiry report submitted by a former Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), Social Justice, Empowerment and Minorities, Kirpa Shankar Saroj, had questioned the role of Dharamsot in the alleged misappropriation of the scholarship funds.Rs 7 crore bungling found The minister had also been accused of shielding officials, including a Deputy Director, involved in the scam.Sources said on the basis of the report, the Chief Minister had directed the Chief Secretary to crack a whip on the officials involved in the alleged scam.The sources said the probe panel had detected wrong payment of over Rs 7 crore to private educational institutions. The erring officials in the department, instead of getting a re-audit done from the departments concerned, conducted it on their own, in violation of the rules. The role of a former Director, Social Welfare, and Congress MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, in allowing the re-audit, had not been questioned by the probe panel, it is learnt.On the basis of the findings of the panel, action is likely to be taken against Deputy Director PS Gill, Deputy Controller of Finance and Audit Charanjit Singh, besides two other officials.The inquiry has, however, found the money trail of Rs 39 crore that allegedly went into the accounts of “ghost” institutions. The inquiry has found that private colleges that received the payment and the list also included institutes linked to a former Congress MLA.In his report submitted on August 24, the former ACS, who was recently transferred out of the department, had pointed towards a scam of Rs 55 crore. Of the amount, the department disbursed Rs 39 crore to “ghost” institutions as its records were missing. Another Rs 16.71 crore was wrongly disbursed to private educational institutions despite the Finance Department pointing out recovery of Rs 8 crore from the institutions which had been illegally given the scholarship amount.Instead of probing the disbursal of Rs 16.71 crore, the probe panel is learnt to have looked into the aspect of recovery of Rs 8 crore from the institutions which had been illegally given as the scholarship amount. Meanwhile, Gurkirat Kirpal Singh, Secretary, Public Relations. could not be contacted.

The state’s CFR peaked to 3 per cent, whereas the country’s CFR stands at 1.6 per cent.100 new ambulances for Covid patientsThe state government added 100 new ambulances to its fleet and pressed them into service on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said. The new ambulances have been provided to every district hospitalIn the past 24 hours, 50 persons succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 3,501. The districts which have recorded CFR at 4 per cent are Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar. Of the deaths reported today, Amritsar recorded eight, followed by Ludhiana and Gurdaspur (six each). Dr Rajiv Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, told The Tribune that the main reason for the continuous increase in the CFR was the high incidence of comorbidities in the state’s populace.“There is high incidence of diabetes, coronary ailments and obesity in the state’s populace. Also, delayed diagnosis is to be blamed for the high CFR. We are actively encouraging home isolation so that people get themselves tested as soon as they exhibit any symptom. We are hopeful that the CFR will go down,” he said.The state has been criticised for the alleged low testing rate. The number of tests done per day is just 30,000, and the state’s positivity rate is 6.2 per cent. The positivity rate is higher in the state as compared to other states such as Bihar (2.5 per cent) and Jharkhand (3.7 per cent), where the number of tests done is similar.

Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill has issued a notice to a DSP and an SHO as allegations were levelled against them also. A status report has been sought by Justice Gill in the matter stemming from a land dispute.The notice came on the petition filed against the State of Punjab, the MLA and police officers by Jagjit Singh and his wife through counsel RS Bajaj. They were seeking directions to the Hoshiarpur SSP to protect their life and liberty at the hands of certain village residents. Directions were also sought to register an FIR against the accused persons on the basis of a complaint dated August 24 submitted by Jagjit Singh to the SSP.Bajaj submitted that Jagjit Singh along with his brother Harjinder Singh and his wife Kamlesh Kaur were co-sharers in the land in dispute and were physically cultivating the same, being the owners in possession. They had filed a suit for permanent injunction for restraining the defendants from any interference. Interim injunction had already been granted in the matter by the civil court. Still, there was interference by the other party at the behest of the local MLA.Justice Gill observed specific allegations had been levelled against the local MLA, DSP and SHO as the grievance of the petitioner-senior citizens was not allegedly looked into. In his order, Justice Gill recorded Bajaj’s contention that action was not taken by the police and the petitioners were being pressured to effect a compromise even though the accused inflicted injuries on Jasjit Singh.

It’s a rare social movement to protect the rights of farmers, let us not scuttle it,” AAP state president Bhagwant Mann has told his party men. As a result, the party’s rank and file is participating in farmers’ dharnas, without making a political spectacle. The party is focusing on getting resolutions passed by gram sabhas against the legislations.Bhagwant Mann, AAP State ChiefOur Duty to fight arbitrary lawsWhen farmers are unwilling to get parties’ support or allow their movement to be hijacked, we should exercise restraint. But it is our moral duty to fight the arbitrary laws.Talking to The Tribune, Mann says: “The party cadre is engaged in helping gram sabhas pass resolutions against the farm laws that are intended to hand over the agriculture sector to corporate houses by stopping government procurement of foodgrain. We started this programme on September 30 and many villages in Sangrur and Faridkot districts have passed resolutions. We intend to get 400 gram sabhas on board within this month, making it legally admissible in the court case challenging these laws.”Accusing both the ruling Congress and SAD of politicising the farmers’ protest, Mann says: “Where were they when these draconian laws were being framed or the ordinances passed by the Cabinet? The Congress Chief Minister and state Finance Minister were aware of the agriculture laws being formulated. They have participated in meetings where these were discussed before the ordinances were framed.“Similarly, Harsimrat Kaur Badal never dissented against the ordinances, and the entire Badal clan continued to rally for these laws, without realising it will erode their political base in the state. Once they realised they had been rejected by the peasantry, they started opposing the laws.”The Sangrur MP claims AAP had sent several reminders to the state government to lead a delegation to the PM, as promised at the all-party meeting of June 24, but to no avail. “This shows where the other parties stand on the issue. Our stand has remained the same and we support the mass movement against the intended economic slavery of farmers,” he adds.

||MSP must help farmers get out of debt||There are about 11 crore farming households in India. Of these, 67 per cent own less than one hectare of land. What does that really mean in terms of farm income? One hectare produces about 50 quintals of wheat in Punjab, but it would yield only about 35 quintals in the badly irrigated zones in Uttar Pradesh. At today’s MSP rates, that means a Punjab farmer would make about Rs 1 lakh per hectare in the wheat-producing season, while a farmer from the arid-zones of UP would end up with Rs 70,000.Now, we need to remove their costs to get the profit they would make per hectare. Ironically, the comprehensive cost of producing wheat — as calculated by the government — is lower in Punjab than what it is in UP. So, the Punjab farmer would earn a profit of about Rs 35,000 from a hectare of wheat, while the UP farmer would make only about Rs 15,000.Remember, this is the entire household’s income from agriculture over six months. So, a farming family with less than one hectare of land in Punjab will make just about Rs 6,000 per month, while the small farming household in UP will get a monthly income of just Rs 1,250.Even that is only if the farmers manage to get the minimum support price (MSP) that the government has announced. As the Shanta Kumar Committee reported in 2015, only about 5.8% of agricultural households in India were able to access APMC mandis and get MSP for their produce. Sixteen years ago, the National Commission for Agriculture had recommended that there should be a regulated mandi for every 80 square km, but as of 2017, the national average was one mandi per 434 square km. Even a well-covered state like Punjab has one mandi per 118 square km.This means farmers in most states are entirely at the mercy of local private traders or arhtiyas. In fact, even in Punjab and Haryana, where farmers take most of their produce to the APMC mandis, arhtiyas have a massive role in agricultural marketing. They charge large commissions for supposedly helping farmers find buyers, even when farmers take their crop to the mandis on their own, offload them and government procurers are already present to buy the produce.The Modi government’s new farm bills are supposedly meant to break this iron-grip of the traders and commission agents. By allowing farmers to sell outside the APMC mandis, the government intends to introduce competition amongst traders and help farmers get better prices.This is sheer wishful thinking that is based on a fundamental — perhaps deliberate — misunderstanding of how the farm economy works in India.As farming has become mechanised and heavily dependent on high-yield variety of seeds, heavy fertiliser and pesticide use, input costs in agriculture have risen dramatically. Before the green revolution, when farming was largely dependent on local seeds variants and natural fertilisers, lot of agricultural operations existed outside the sphere of market transactions. Modern farming techniques increased the dependence on the market and monetised agriculture.These processes — high input costs and monetisation — have made the farmer dependent on credit right from the beginning of the agricultural season. When India’s banks were nationalised, 51 years ago, one of the objectives was to increase farm credit. Till this day, small farmers find it difficult to get credit from the organised banking system. An RBI study last year said that 28 per cent of agricultural credit is still provided by the moneylenders, traders and relatives. When it comes to small farmers, nearly 60 per cent have no access to bank loans.It is here that the local traders enter the picture. They are the key source of loans for small farmers. They give it immediately and without any collateral. That is why they not only charge high interest rates, but also tie the farmers to an entire web of obligations. A 2014 study by Sukhpal Singh of the Punjab Agricultural University gives us a clear picture of how this system works, by making farmers dependent on all input purchases from the arhtiyas and their associates. The study showed that arhtiyas and their associates supplied 77 per cent of seeds, 12 per cent of fertilisers, 95 per cent of pesticides, 98 per cent of fuel and lubricants and all of the animal feed that was bought by the farmers. The arhtiyas supplied over 70 per cent of all inputs bought by farmers.As part of the loan agreement, farmers were also made to buy household consumption items from these arhtiyas and their associates. The study showed that over 31 per cent of all domestic goods bought by farmers were supplied by shops owned by arhtiyas or by traders connected to them. Finally, farmers had to sell their product through these arhtiyas and they were paid only after the traders had deducted the loans they had extended. It would appear that the arhtiyas are the problem. But the real reason these traders and commission agents have flourished is because of the farmer’s need for finance. The institutional banking system has failed small farmers and high input costs have pushed them into the arms of the local trader-cum-moneylender.One could argue that big corporates will solve this problem by not just providing capital, but also making inputs cheaper through backward linkages with suppliers and bringing in efficiencies of scale. However, if the organised private sector was so great, what stopped big private banks from entering the space and providing easy credit to small farmers? Why has the government not even pushed public sector banks to break this control over finance that gives immense power to local arhtiyas?It beggars belief that a smart politician like PM Modi doesn’t know this. PM-Kisaan and various interest-subvention schemes are an acknowledgement that the real problem that ties farmers to arhtiyas is that the MSPs don’t give them enough earnings to get out of their perpetual state of indebtedness. The answer to the kisan’s problems is higher MSP that gives 50 per cent more than the ‘comprehensive’ cost of production, subsidised inputs, public investment in rural infrastructure, more mandis across the country, and easy credit from institutional sources.The Modi government’s decision to let corporates solve India’s agricultural problems is a political choice determined by its own vote calculations. But that is an entirely different story, that I will tell another day.
