A total of 27 MCs have allotted contracts for collection of user charges through e-tendering, and the remaining committees personally collect such charges to provide various facilities to the rehri and farhi vendors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-exempts-user-charges-in-markets-for-petty-vendors-from-sept-1-till-end-of-fiscal-301502

They are repeatedly making irresponsible statements that have grave implications on national security”.“I would urge the topmost national leadership of the Congress to state clearly whether they support the remarks on Kashmir and Pakistan made by Congress leaders in Punjab?“Silence on the matter will be seen as implicit support to such objectionable remarks,” Nadda added.Party spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed such remarks could not have been made without the approval of senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. “The remarks made by advisors of Punjab Congress chief clearly show that the party has divisive and anti-India approach towards Kashmir,” he added.“These people earn their livelihood in India but sing Pakistan’s tune,” he said, also wondering why Sidhu, “who hugged the Pakistan Army Chief”, had been made Congress’ Punjab unit chief and “on whose behest”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nadda-attacks-congress-over-punjab-leaders-remarks-on-kashmir-pak-301498

The issues of the old pension scheme, unemployment and the three contentious farm laws spruce from the same.”Addressing the organisers, he said the union would offer outside support if they want to give political colour to their protest.“You shouldn’t have called us if you had wanted us to share the stage with leaders of political parties. We wouldn’t have come,” he said and left.Soon after, Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema left the venue without saying a word after AAP Delhi MLA Ajay Dutt, who expressed support to the protesters, also added that the party’s government in Delhi had passed a resolution seeking repeal of the three farm laws.Organisers while managing the stage said the gathering was organised for the sole purpose of holding a protest to demand reimplementation of the old pension scheme.President of the CPF workers’ union Sukhjeet Singh said, “Anyone can come to the protest site. We have not invited anyone. We do not have an issue if a political leader supports our demands.”The union was supposed to hold a protest march toward the residence of the chief minister but cancelled the program after it was allocated a meeting with the chief minister’s office.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-joginder-singh-ugrahan-lambasts-political-parties-for-states-issues-leaves-stage-during-protest-for-old-pension-scheme-301462
24-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress ministers and MLAs call for action against Navjot Sidhu’s advisors||Taking strong exception to the “anti-national and pro-Pak” comments of two of Navjot Sidhu’s aides, a group of Punjab Congress ministers and MLAs on Tuesday called for strong action under the law against Malwinder Mali and Pyare Lal Garg.The statements of both these newly appointed advisors of Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu were clearly against India’s interests, and detrimental to national security, said ministers Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, along with MLA Raj Kumar Verka.Besides stringent legal action against Mali and Garg, they also urged the Congress national leadership to direct Sidhu to immediately rein in his aides in the interest of the party, as well as the country.“The Congress has made many sacrifices for the protection of the nation’s security and peace, as have our soldiers at the borders. Nobody can or should be allowed to undermine these sacrifices and jeopardise the safety of our country and its people,” they emphasised, citing, in particular, the grave implications such statements could have for the border state of Punjab.The Congress leaders also questioned Sidhu’s failure to put his foot down on such anti-national and pro-Pak diatribe by his close aides, despite the justified uproar it has triggered across party lines.Sidhu’s omission in this regard had given ammunition to the Opposition parties, which were quick to recall the PPCC president’s own bonhomie with the Pakistan prime minister and army chief, they pointed out, warning against the massive damage this could cause to the Congress in the run-up to the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls, which are due in less than six months.In a statement, the four Punjab Congress leaders termed Mali’s statement on Kashmir a dangerous and unacceptable deviation from India’s stated position on J&K.By questioning the unanimous 1994 resolution of the Parliament of India declaring Jammu & Kashmir as an integral of India (which was reiterated in 2012), Mali had blatantly toed the line of Pakistan, which had been trying to stake claim to the region and was in illegal occupation of certain areas, such as PoK, they added.Even Garg’s statement countering Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s criticism of Pakistan reflected strong pro-Pak leanings, they further said, adding that anyone not condemning the continuous efforts from across the border to destabilise Punjab and India was playing into the hands of the enemy. “Drones from Pakistan are dumping arms and drugs into Punjab almost every day. Our soldiers are dying at the border. How can any patriotic Indian not condemn Pak actions in the circumstances,” they asked.Such comments, if not punished, had the potential of becoming a deadly precursor to more anti-national statements, promoted by forces inimical to the interests of India, they warned, citing the continuous threat from across the border to India’s peace and integrity.The Punjab Congress leaders also condemned Mali for posting a controversial and highly objectionable sketch of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, terming it another instance of his anti-party stance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-congress-ministers-and-mlas-call-for-action-against-navjot-sidhus-advisors-301461

Col CM Lakhanpal (retd) said: “Release and flow of water into the Buddha Dariya from the Neelon side of the Sirhind canal should be kept to the minimum to maintain the flow and oxidation process for the degradation of biological waste as an interim measure.

Fazel runs a music institute named ‘Honarestan Tarana’.Ustad Narula, who was in Ludhiana recently, said: “I have not met Fazel personally. After watching my videos on YouTube, he contacted me on WhatsApp and started taking sitar lessons. However, his recent text left me disturbed. Afghan people are trying to raise their voice for their safety and rights. But as their voices are being suppressed, so are their dreams.”Dreams shatteredFazel’s recent text left me disturbed. Afghan people are trying to raise their voice for their safety and rights. But as their voices are being suppressed, so are their dreams.—Ustad Narinder Narula, Sitar maestroIn his message, Fazel further wrote that his department was shut and everything had come to an end. He asked the maestro to tell him about his other disciples, their culture and how they learn music. He made a request to start a programme on Facebook and other social media platforms for helping young Afghan musicians, who are passionate about singing and playing various instruments. Fazel also wrote that artistes in Afghanistan were poor and didn’t have much support from the world but connecting them with others would definitely heal their wounds.Meanwhile, the local industrialists are reluctant to talk to the buyers or middlemen in Afghanistan. Some of them say their stocks are stuck and there is no response from the buyers there while a few others are avoiding to talk, fearing their calls might be recorded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-war-torn-afghanistan-music-a-casualty-301085

You spend amount worth half the prize money, in advance, on booze to please judges and you will win the award,” he had said talking to a group of writers at Delhi Coffee House.This happened way back when Punjabi literature awards had never been questioned on the public platform. Decades on, charges of “plotting, nepotism and politics” dog the Punjabi literary awards.This has been “exposed” in new novel “Khido” (ball), weaved around the “gangs” that control the government institutions which confer literary awards, including Sahitya Akademi and Punjab Language Department.Punjabi writer Jasbir Bhullar, a retired Colonel, has once again brought to the fore the “murky” side of the Punjabi literary awards depicting how writers indulge in “immoral acts, plotting and investing lakhs of rupees to manage the awards”.The protagonist, Harwant Singh Hira, is a writer who holds top positions in literary societies and exploits the situation to gain self-praise. After his death, his protégées continue to rule the roost and win awards employing his trickery.“The disease was present even much before this gang. A simple cold has now become a cancer, which cannot be corrected under the existing conditions,” says writer Gurbachan Bhullar, who has been vocal about such practices in Akademis and has written the preface.The book says: “It is a weird phenomenon and perhaps only prevalent in the Punjabi language that non-writers, who have never written anything in any genre of literature, are part of committees which select writers for the awards. Such non-writers conveniently call themselves as thinkers.”Jasbir says what he has tried to convey through the novel is just the tip of the iceberg.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unmasking-murky-side-of-punjabi-literary-awards-301081

The protesters said their demands weren’t heard by the ministers. Ravinder Singh Rinku (Gurney), state vice-president of the union, said, “The government has delayed the MGNREGApayments, which are meant for various developmental works in rural areas.”He said, “The sarpanch, along with the secretary, has been given the right to issue a cheque of maximum Rs 25,000 for any work. The limit should be increased to Rs 1 lakh, in view of pending works to be carried out.”The government should accept the demands of employees working at various offices, who have been holding regular protests. “The pending resolutions of demands have delayed the works to be carried out in the villages. This is causing inconveniences to the residents,” the protesters said. Rinku said, “We are public representatives like MLAs. However, the government pays us Rs 1,200 per month to a sarpanch. The amount is meagre, and even that has not been paid. We want the government to increase it to Rs 25,000, as we work 24 hours a day.”Meanwhile, the protest will continue tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sarpanch-union-marches-to-punjab-cms-residence-over-mgnrega-dues-301082

They had opined the current format of the selection process might lead to “nepotism, favouritism and arbitrariness”.‘Precautions taken to curb nepotism’Dr Talwar said all premier health institutes hired faculty purely on the basis of interview. The former Director, PGIMER, Chandigarh, said: “AIIMS, PGIMER and other institutes recruit faculty on the basis of interviews by an expert group. I feel the Punjab Government should increase the weightage to 100 per cent.”Asked whether giving more weightage to the interview would leave room for nepotism and favouritism during the selection process, Dr Talwar said: “One has to trust the selection committee. It is very easy to raise questions over the selection process. We have the Vice-Chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences, PGI Director, and two professors from either the AIIMS or PGI on the selection committee. The government is taking all necessary precautions.”He added: “Written tests are conducted up till the post of senior resident. There are no directions from anyone, including the apex court, to hold a written test for the recruitment of faculty. When we want to select candidates for such posts, we have to do an overall assessment, including academic contribution and research aptitude. It has been seen that private universities in the state give more marks in academic pursuits. Therefore, candidates who complete their academic qualifications from government institutes are at the receiving end.”Finally, he said they had done their job honestly, and therefore, it didn’t matter if a few people questioned the process.Meanwhile, Alok Shekhar, Principal Secretary, Medical Education, said best health experts of the country conducted the interview, so there was no question of favouritism.He said, “It can be a coincidence that selected candidates happened to be kin to the retired or serving doctors. But I want to clarify that candidates are selected solely on merit.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dr-kk-talwar-for-100-weightage-to-interview-301083

Similarly, tippers or trucks that are allowed 28 tonnes are carrying 60 tonnes of weight,” the application claimed.State put on noticeIssuing a notice of motion to the respondents of the Union Ministry of Roads and Highways; State of Punjab; along with deputy commissioners, Regional Transport Officers and District Transport Officers of Ropar, Mohali and Nawanshahr; the HC has fixed November 25 as the next date of hearingThe society also alleged that the body size of these vehicles had been increased for overloading, flouting the norms and still the officials concerned failed to take any action against the offenders.According to petition, the Union Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways in 2012, referring to a decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, wrote a letter to all states and Union Territories, asking them to keepa check on the overloading of vehicles and implement the court orders.While the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan had already taken steps in this regard, no action had been taken by authorities concerned in the state, the petitioner claimed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/demanding-end-to-overloading-ropar-transport-society-moves-court-301076
24-08-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Maximum purchase only on paper in Amritsar wheat scam||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 23The main accused in the “missing wheat scam” of Jandiala Guru in Amritsar is believed to have siphoned off crores of rupees given as MSP on wheat that was neither brought to mandis nor purchased. Fake entries for the purchase of 87,100 quintals (1,84,344 bags) of wheat (valued at Rs 20 crore) were made and it was shown to have been transported to godowns in Jandiala Guru.The police and Food Supplies Department, trying to unravel the truth behind the missing wheat from eight godowns, believe the maximum purchase was done only on paper, indicating connivance of sellers, commission agents, auction recorders of the mandi board, agency inspectors and transporters.New stock verification norms soonWhile six persons — arhtiyas from whom the wheat was “purchased”, are being questioned and the records being tallied. The Food and Supply Department has reportedly again written to the Punjab Vigilance Bureau to take over the investigation.The accused Inspector, Jasdev Singh, who is believed to have escaped to Dubai, was allegedly in cahoots with Amritsar-based trader Ravinder Singh Bunty, who was arrested by the CBI recently. Preliminary investigation has shown that the trader, accused of manipulating the e-auction of wheat, would get release orders for small quantities of wheat, but under its garb, huge stockpiles from the eight godowns were being given to him for the sale to private flour mills.As the scam unfolds, Food and Supply Department officials are flummoxed at how the accused Inspector had created his own “fiefdom” in the area by appointing his own security guards at the godowns and wheat was siphoned off easily for three years — 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 — without any supervision.As a result, the government has chargesheeted the Deputy Director of Jalandhar division, all District and Food Supply Controllors posted at Amritsar since 2018-19, one Food and Supply Officer and three Inspectors for dereliction of duty. Assistant Food and Supply Officer Cherry Bhatia and Inspector Rajinder Bains have been placed under suspension. Bhatia was posted as AFSO at Jandiala from 2018-2020; in March 2021, Bhatia had reported there was no shortage of wheat in all these godowns. Bains had remained posted at these godowns from April 2020-April 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/maximum-purchase-only-on-paper-in-amritsar-wheat-scam-301077

The situation became tense when protesters blocked the main entrance to a marriage palace on Fazilka Road, where Sukhbir was holding a meeting with the party’s rural circle presidents and booth-level committee workers.A delegation of farmers also went inside to meet the SAD president, but to no avail. After over an hour, cops escorted Sukhbir out of the palace. Earlier, farmers gathered at the grain market to ask Sukhbir some questions. However, they were not allowed to meet him. When Sukhbir left the venue, irate farmers entered the ‘pandal’ and vandalised chairs and hoardings.On the protest, Sukhbir said: “I told the farmers the SAD is the only party which has raised its voice against the farm laws. The Congress and AAP have failed to do raise their issues. However, some people sent by the Congress and AAP protested against us.”The SAD president today condemned the Centre’s specifications for paddy procurement, saying this was part of a conspiracy to make Punjab’s paddy unfit for procurement. He blamed Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh for not taking up the matter with the Centre when it was at a decision-making stage.“We asked Sukhbir to cancel political programmes until the date for the elections is announced. The political activity is affecting the ongoing stir against the farm laws.” Nirmal Singh Jasseana, a farmer leaderFarmers said they would hold a flag march in Gidderbaha town on Tuesday, where Sukhbir is scheduled to hold a similar programme.

Due to which farmers have been forced to launch an agitation,” he added.In a statement, Cheema said the AAP had been demanding a special session on agriculture for a long time but the ruling Congress was shying away from a discussion.Cheema alleged the SAD-BJP and Congress governments had never taken the agriculture sector seriously, due to which the sector had gone under the control of the Centre.He said just as PM Narendra Modi was “hurting” farmers by “favouring” a few corporate houses, Capt Amarinder Singh was destroying the sugarcane farmers of Punjab.Cheema further said after 2017-18, the government had mocked sugarcane growers by increasing the SAP by Rs 15 per quintal for 2021-22.“While farmers staged protests from time to time seeking arrears worth crores of rupees owed by cooperatives and private mills, the Congress government worked under pressure of the mill mafia,” he said.Cheema demanded the resignation of Cooperative Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aaps-harpal-singh-cheema-seeks-house-debate-on-agriculture-300698

Following the availability of this test at the airport, IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India have resumed direct flights from Amritsar to Dubai and Sharjah. A large number of people had been demanding to start the testing facility at the airport so that they could take a direct flight from Amritsar to Dubai. This initiative of authorities will facilitate thousands of passengers.”While advising passengers, Sameep Singh said although the ban on entry into the UAE from India has not been completely lifted, all travellers are advised to know beforehand whether they have qualified to enter the country or not.Shri Guru Ramdas Jee International Airport Director VK Seth said: “The lab has been set to conduct the Covid-19 PCR rapid test as per the requirement of the airlines flying to the UAE.

24-08-2021||New Delhi||World Punjabi Organisation urges Home Minister to evacuate Hindu, Sikh families from Kabul||The World Punjabi Organisation has appealed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah for early evacuation of 257 Afghan Hindu and Sikh families from Kabul in view of the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan.In a statement, International President of World Punjabi Organisation Vikramjit Singh Sahney said it is the need of the hour to bring the Afghan-origin Sikhs and Hindus safely to India as their lives are in grave danger.The organisation is ready to do the needful for the rehabilitation of those who would come from Afghanistan and provide them training for job-oriented courses free of charge, the statement said.Sahney had last year sent three chartered flights to evacuate 500 Hindu and Sikh families from Kabul, Ghazni and Jalalabad and other areas of Afghanistan.He also thanked the home minister for granting long-term visas to those who had already come to India and requested him to grant them citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act enacted last year, the statement said.The Taliban completed their sweep of the country's south on Friday as they took four more provincial capitals in a lightning offensive that is gradually encircling Kabul, just weeks before the United States is set to officially end its two-decade war.In just the last 24 hours, the country's second and third-largest cities - Herat in the west and Kandahar in the south - have fallen to the insurgents as has the capital of the southern Helmand province, where American, British and NATO forces fought some of the bloodiest battles of the conflict.The blitz through the Taliban's southern heartland means the insurgents now hold half of Afghanistan's 34 provincial capitals and control more than two-thirds of the country weeks before the US plans to withdraw its last troops.

24-08-2021||London||British-Sikh engineer's low-cost washing machines to head to India||A London-born Indian-origin engineer's project to supply low-cost washing machines to countries such as India, where handwashing of clothes remains a time-consuming exercise, has got off to a good start following field research in camps in Iraq.Navjot Sawhney, who set up his Washing Machine Project three years ago to provide energy efficient manual washing machines to low-income regions, has been working with volunteers and partners to conduct research ahead of supplies.The organisation has also launched a crowdfunding appeal on Just Giving to raise 10,000 pounds to aid the delivery process. “At the Washing Machine Project, we believe in the power of innovation to empower lives. That is why we have developed an off-grid, manual washing machine, which saves 60-70 per cent of time and 50 per cent of water, for people in low-income and displaced communities,” notes the charity's fundraising drive. “This idea was born out of a friendship. Nav, our founder, was on a sabbatical in rural South India , making clean cook stoves when he met his neighbour, Divya. It was through their conversations at the end of each day that Nav came to realise the significant burden unpaid labour places on women,” it notes.Sawhney was on a sabbatical from his engineering career in the UK when the idea of a hand-cranked washing machine struck him. “While in Tamil Nadu, I lived in a small village called Kuilapalayam. The community had limited access to continuous electricity, and water was switched on twice a day,” recalls Sawhney. “My next-door neighbour Divya and I became excellent friends. While we talked, she would hand wash her clothes. I was always so shocked at how long and how much effort it would take to conduct the relatively unproductive task,” he said.This led to him coming up with the “Divya 1.5” model of his manual washing machine, inspired by a simple salad spinner. Now 30 of the Divya 1.5 will be used at Mamrashan Refugee Camp in Iraq with the help of the charity Care International. It is expected to positively impact 300 people and save up to 750 hours annually per household, equivalent to two months of daylight hours. Sawhney plans to head to Iraq at the beginning of September to help distribute the machines.Later this year, the Washing Machine Project aims to fulfil orders to refugee camps in Jordan. Eventually, the plan is for these machines to be shipped to other parts of the world, including India and Africa.“It is not just Divya who bears this burden. We have spoken to women and communities in 11 different countries around the world, including Lebanon, the Philippines and Cameroon. In those communities we have met children as young as 6 who have begun helping with this task. This is detrimental not just to their education but also to their childhoods; to being children,” notes the project.“There are many health risks associated with hand-washing clothes, notably contracting infections and water-borne diseases from direct contact with contaminated water sources,” it adds.
