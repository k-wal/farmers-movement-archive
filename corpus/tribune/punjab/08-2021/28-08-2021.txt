Be it the corona period or the current crisis of Afghanistan, the world has experienced it continuously. Hundreds of people from Afghanistan are being brought to India under Operation Devi Shakti,” the prime minister said.India’s complex mission to evacuate its citizens and Afghan partners from Kabul after its takeover by the Taliban has been named ‘Operation Devi Shakti’.“There are many challenges. The circumstances are difficult but we also have ‘Guru Kripa’ (blessings of gurus),” he said.The country has done its utmost to assist those in need in recent years, he said, adding that laws have been made taking inspiration from the teachings of Gurus. “In the past years, the country to discharge this responsibility has worked hard. Keeping the lessons in humanity given by Gurus in the forefront, the country has made new laws for the people who have suffered,” he said, in an apparent reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 and face religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.The prime minister said that current global conditions underline the importance of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ and underscore the need for ‘Aatmnirbharta and Aatmvishwas’.

28-08-2021||---||Jallianwala Bagh Smarak must serve as reminder of people’s right to peaceful democratic protest: Amarinder||Chandigarh, August 28Describing the newly renovated Jallianwala Bagh Smarak as a tribute to the great martyrs and a symbol of inspiration for the youth, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday said the monument must serve as a reminder for the future generations about the right of the people to peaceful democratic protest.In what was apparently an oblique reference to the ongoing agitation of the peacefully protesting farmers, the Chief Minister said the Smarak, along with the Jallianwala Bagh centenary memorial recently dedicated to the people by the state government, should serve to remind our leaders of the inalienable right of Indians to conduct peaceful democratic protests, which could not be stifled, as the British also learnt from the Jallianwala Bagh incident.The Smarak and the Centenary Memorial established by the state government “seek to pay tribute to the great martyrs so that history may always remember their sacrifice and our present and future generations can draw inspiration from their patriotism,” said the Chief Minister, in his brief remarks before Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually dedicated the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Smarak) to the nation through the remote.Captain Amarinder also requested the Prime Minister that the Government of India should use its good offices to bring back the personal effects, i.e. pistol and personal diary of Shaheed Udham Singh Ji, who avenged the injustice of this massacre, from United Kingdom to India. He said he had already written to External Affairs Minister Dr. Jaishankar in this regard.The event was also attended, among others, by several union ministers, Punjab Governor, Leader of the Opposition and the Jallianwala Bagh trustees, along with several MPs and MLAs. Families of the Jallianwala massacre martyrs were also present.The occasion was marked by a 2-minute silence in the memory of the martyrs, following the sounding of the bugle.Describing the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial as “an everlasting symbol of non-violent and peaceful struggle for the freedom of India”, the Chief Minister said that “at another level, it also stands testimony to one of the most barbaric acts of violence and State oppression perpetrated on a group of peacefully assembled people.”The killing of hundreds of innocent people on the fateful day of Baisakhi on 13 April 1919, shook the moral conscience of not only the entire nation but the whole world, he said, adding that the “Khooni Vasakhi”, as the Punjabi poet Nanak Singh who was himself a survivor called it, sounded the death knell of the British Rule in India.  He pointed out that incensed by the inhuman act, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had renounced his knighthood in protest.The Jallianwala Bagh is one of the historic landmarks of Amritsar for the lakhs of tourists and pilgrims who visit the Holy City, said the Chief Minister, expressing happiness that, as the nation observes the centenary of the tragedy, the Ministry of Culture had taken up major upgradation of this memorial and given it more technology-oriented displays, including a sound and light show which will draw more people.Recalling that the story of this sacred monument started in the aftermath of the tragedy, when a resolution was passed in 1920 to build a memorial at the site and subsequently land was purchased by the Trustees, the Chief Minister said that in 1951, soon after India gained independence, the Government declared it as a “memorial of national importance”.Captain Amarinder observed that the State Government had also recently, on 14 August 2021, dedicated a Jallianwala Bagh Centenary Memorial, at a separate location in Amritsar, as a tribute to the great martyrs to commemorate the Centenary. The said memorial bears the names of all 488 martyrs available as per records, he said, adding that his government had also constituted a Special Research team of Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, to identify any missing names of martyrs that need to be inscribed on this memorial, for which sufficient space has been left.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jallianwala-bagh-smarak-must-serve-as-reminder-of-peoples-right-to-peaceful-democratic-protest-amarinder-303326
28-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM slams Haryana govt over brutal assault on peaceful farmers||Expressing shock at the brazen brutality of the Haryana Police, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday slammed his counterpart in the neighbouring state for unleashing such a vicious assault on the peacefully protesting farmers, many of whom were injured in the lathi-charge.Pointing out that this was not the first time that farmers had been subjected to such ruthlessness at the hands of the Haryana Police, Capt Amarinder said it was evident that the BJP-led ML Khattar government had once again deliberately used brute force in a desperate bid to end the farmers’ stir against the draconian farm laws.Such a sponsored attack on farmers was not only unacceptable but outright condemnable, said the chief minister, demanding an apology from the Haryana CM and aid for the injured farmers.“This is no way to treat out annadaatas,” said Capt Amarinder, warning that the BJP would have to bear the consequences of such horrendous actions, and of the apathy of its government at the Centre towards the farmers, in the forthcoming Assembly elections in Punjab and other states.Instead of heeding the concerns of the farmers and repealing the farm laws which were clearly undemocratic and anti-farmer, the BJP had been persistently indulging in offensive acts, even stooping to the extent of insulting them by using derogatory names, he said. The people of India will not forgive the BJP for its shameful treatment of the farmers, many of whom have lost their lives during their protest at the Delhi borders, he added.Having failed to foil their agitation and subjugate their will, the Haryana government had again resorted to physical assault of the innocent and peaceful farmers, who had been braving extreme weather, pandemic and other problems in their fight against the black legislations, which the BJP-led government at the Centre was using to hand over agriculture to their crony capitalist friends, he added.Even earlier, in November 2020, the Haryana Police had ferociously assaulted farmers to stop them from marching to the Delhi borders to join the agitation against the central laws, he pointed out.Citing media reports and viral videos of the baton charge on the farmers on way to protest against Khattar’s visit to Karnal for a meeting, the chief minister also condemned the IAS officer who was reportedly seen giving instructions to the police force to bash up the protesting farmers.He demanded immediate dismissal of the officer and strict action against him, as per the law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-slams-haryana-govt-over-brutal-assault-on-peaceful-farmers-303325

The programme was organised by Congress MLA Sunil Dutti in his constituency last night.He stated that: “Let me tell you at my loudest neither did I take oath nor I made promises. I will raise a model Punjab which will be there for next two decades.” However, he put a condition that it will be possible only if he was empowered to take decisions.In another attack on the Capt Amarinder Singh government, he said “When his tenure will end, (complete its term), a loan of Rs 3.25 lakh will be added to the exchequer.”On high power utility tariff, he said he knew that the faulty PPAs signed at Rs 17 per unit were responsible for this. He stated that the power utility could be made available at Rs 3.25 per unit to domestic users. Power will be available at Rs three per unit if faulty PPAs will be abrogated. Continuing his attack on the government he said it has been giving only assurances to all job seekers such as ETT passed, contractual employees and others. He promised that the industrial policies would be made by enterpreneurs themselves and not the bureaucrats.Earlier, Ajay Mehra from warp knitting industry said successive governments showed them moon and nothing came out. So, their faith eroded in the government and they discontinued taking part in meetings. He stated that farmers were sitting on roads and they were also ready to do so. Farmers are committing suicides and they were on the verge of doing so.Other industrialists stated that bureaucrats made policies for industrialists which suit them.They drew the attention to the assets owned by bureaucrats which far exceed the wealth of industrialists.

Atul Keshap mentioned that his father’s family was lucky in comparison to million others, as they managed to reach India safely.“However, under the circumstances that were created during the time, the experience of travelling to Amritsar by train was extremely traumatic. My grandfather basically decided that he would stay where he was as that’s where his job was, that’s where his land was, that’s where his ancestral properties were. It was when push came to shove that they left immediately with almost no notice and fled. My family’s debt to India is absolutely immense and my father was a very proud Indian throughout his entire life,” Keshap said.Dr Sen served as an international civil servant and was posted around the world with the United Nations. Keshap’s mother, Zoe Calvert, had been in the US Foreign Services when she married Dr Sen. Atul Keshap was born in Nigeria and later raised in the US.Atul Keshap recalled that every summer, for about 15 years, his father would bring him and his brothers to India to visit their grandmother in Panipat. He said his family, like many Punjabi refugees, were resilient, adding that they looked forward and worked hard to invest in their lives in India.“Atul Keshap’s interview will become a part of the Partition museum’s oral history gallery and will be displayed at the Partition Museum coming up at Dara Shikoh library in Delhi,” informed Mallika. She also presented her book, “Divided by Partition United by Resilience: 21 Inspirational Stories from 1947”, to Keshap.The other eminent personalities whose oral history accounts are displayed at the Partition Museum in Amritsar include former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, late Milkha Singh and Hero Group’s Munjal family.Apart from the world’s first Partition Museum set up in Amritsar, the Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust has also set up the first Independence and Partition Museum in Kolkata earlier this year and will be now setting up a museum in Delhi as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsars-partition-museum-to-display-oral-recounts-of-traumatic-event-303194

This is not acceptable. We demand repeal of the black laws,” he said.Sukhbir demanded the Vidhan Sabha session should be held for a minimum of 10 days. “Convening a one-day session simply to fulfil constitutional requirements is a fraud on the people,” he said, adding the government was running away from facing the people.“Capt Amarinder must answer for the corruption of its ministers. He should tell the House why he was not taking action against ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa, Balbir Sidhu, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Shyam Sundar Arora who all were involved in corrupt deals.” He said the CM owed an explanation to Punjabis over deteriorating law and order in the state.Earlier, hundreds of farmers protested against Sukhbir at various locations in the Baghapurana town and its adjoining villages. Some farmers present at the public rally raised slogans against him. But, the police whisked them away. Some of them were also detained. Sukhbir also announced the candidature of Tirath Singh Mahla from the Baghaurana constituency as party candidate. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/be-ready-for-no-confidence-vote-sukhbir-badal-to-capt-amarinder-singh-302888

As the Cabinet was being given a presentation on the utilisation of paddy straw as industrial fuel and how the government proposed to incentivise 50 such industrial units that switched to using straw as fuel, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal is learnt to have raised the issue of how the crores of rupees coming for stubble management have had no impact on controlling stubble burning and pollution.Spike in stubble burning casesIt may be mentioned that to date, Punjab has given over 75,000 machines — stubble management system, happy seeders, super seeders, shredders, munchers, etc, besides balers and rakes for ex-situ management. However, last year, the stubble-burning incidents in the state rose phenomenally over the previous four years. Many attributed this to the poor implementation of the stubble burning management policy as well as to the lack of awareness drives. Last year, farmers’ anger against the three new laws and related protests were also responsible for high stubble burning incidents in the state.According to an affidavit filed by the Centre in the Supreme Court, the number of stubble-burning incidents rose by 44.5 per cent in 2020 (from 52,991 incidents in 2019 to 76,590 last year). Punjab had received 46 per cent of the total funds meant for the purpose from the Centre. As the paddy harvesting is about to start by September-end, concerns over a similar spurt have arisen, which echoed in the Cabinet meeting.Sources said Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra also sought to know what happened to the Rs 800 crore that was received by the state for stubble management last year. “It is a very important issue as people’s health has been affected by Covid-19, and the rising pollution levels will prove disastrous for them. The Cabinet should know how the money was spent, as we hear that there is a lot of ‘hanky-panky’ in the utilisation of funds,” he is learnt to have said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ministers-manpreet-badal-brahm-mohindra-seek-report-on-use-of-rs-800-cr-to-stop-farm-fires-302891

His parents Harish and Jeevan Tara Joshi are still waiting for elite Navy divers to fish out his body and hand it over to them.Officers recall Jayant being a boy brimming with youthful exuberance. He was an officer who could do no wrong, personally or professionally.On August 25, divers retrieved the body of Lt Col AS Batth from the depths of the reservoir. However, there is no trace of Jayant even after the Army pressed into service the state-of-the art diving equipment.Search seems to have lost wayThere seems to be no end in sight. The search seems to have lost direction. With every passing day, our son’s body is rotting and decaying in water. No compassion and respect is being shown to the soldier. —Parents of Capt Jayant JoshiAll efforts being madeAll possible methods continue to be deployed by the Army and Air Force. These include the use of hi-tech equipment, including multi-beam sonar, side scanners and remotely operating vehicles. —OfficialsThe agony, anguish and angst of the Joshis is being directed towards the officers handling the search operations.“There seems to be no end in sight. The search seems to have lost direction. With every passing day, our son’s body is rotting and decaying in water. No compassion and respect is being shown to the soldier,” they claimed.However, officials say, “All possible methods continue to be deployed by the Army and Air Force. These include the use of hi-tech equipment, including multi-beam sonar, side scanners and remotely operating vehicles.”On the day one of the search, the district administration and police sent in divers. However, they were amateurs forcing the Air Force to call professional divers from the Navy.With no periodic updates on the operation, Joshi’s kin have been left high and dry. Misinformation often fills voids of information. This is precisely what happened as rumours of all kinds started doing the rounds forcing Pathankot Senior Superintendent of Police Surendra Lamba to warn people engaged in malicious gossip.Jayant was a student of the prestigious Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi. Later he completed his graduation in electrical engineering. He was commissioned in the 9th Sikh Light Infantry in 2017 and two years later joined the Pathankot based 254th Army Aviation Squadron.The family is distraught. Every dawn brings with it hope. By dusk this very hope slips into oblivion. “We are holding on to hope and belief that our son will be in our midst soon.

The union members gathered outside the district education officer’s office and raised slogans against the state government and department.The leaders alleged senior officials of the department had been laying emphasis on improving Punjab’s standing (nationally) in the NAS so that political mileage could be gained in an election year and as a result, studies of students were getting affected.Resham Singh Khemuana, president of the union, said, “Academics have taken a backseat after the directions of senior officials of the Education Department. Their entire focus is on improving Punjab’s standing in the NAS. Teachers of government schools have been directed to prepare students for tests (conducted on a weekly basis). For department officials, the NAS has become the top priority.”Later, a meeting between the district education officer and representatives of the union remained inconclusive with the former making it clear that as per the directions of the higher authorities, they will remain committed to score well in the NAS. Baljit Singh Sandoha, Deputy District Education Officer, said, “Laying emphasis on the NAS is being done not to wean away students from academics but to improve them.

Rawat had to issue a statement asking the PCC chief to sack his two advisers over their recent controversial remarks.On the other hand, sources close to Sidhu said he was unhappy at Rawat’s statement regarding contesting the 2022 Assembly elections under Capt Amarinder Singh.Recently, Rawat had said Sidhu must understand he was not in the Opposition party, but the president of the ruling party. “By creating two power centres, the party high command has created a state of confusion among the leaders as to who their boss is,” said a senior party leader. Another party leader, MM Cheema, said Sidhu should be issued a stern warning for unwarranted public statements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-congress-crisis-capt-amarinder-camp-ups-ante-against-navjot-singh-sidhu-302902

The very point of a flare-up between the CM and dissidents had been the questionable slow speed of taking decisions when the government and party should be out in the field to list its achievement and counter anti-incumbency.“But with the government moving to address the grievances of employees over the 6th Pay Commission, provide jobs to 104 legal heirs of deceased farmers and farm labourers agitating against the central agricultural laws, initiate the process of terminating the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private thermal plants, waive loans of those from the Scheduled Caste and Backward Caste, landless farm labour and effect course correction in the ‘ghar ghar rozgar’ scheme, at least some of the issues, if not all, are being addressed. The end result of the flare-up should give results. This is the push the high command wants,” observed a senior party leader.Amid the dissident ministers and MLAs’ bid to dislodge the CM, Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat’s statement that the 2022 Assembly elections would be fought under Capt Amarinder Singh’s leadership saw things moving in the CM camp.One of the dissident ministers maintains the CM has to come clear on the sacrilege and police firing cases.Issues being addressedA party leader said with the government addressing staff’s grievances, providing jobs to deceased farmers’ kin, initiating process of terminating the PPAs, some of the issues were being addressed, as wanted by the high command||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-congress-turmoil-capt-amarinder-government-gets-moving-on-18-point-agenda-302913

28-08-2021||New Delhi||Samyukt Kisan Morcha calls for Bharat Bandh on September 25||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, spearheading the anti-farm laws protests, on Friday called for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on September 25.The SKM said the move is aimed at further strengthening and expanding the farmers’ agitation which began in November last year.Addressing a press conference at Delhi’s Singhu border, Ashish Mittal from SKM said, “We are calling for a ‘Bharat bandh’ on September 25.“This is happening after a similar ‘bandh’ was organised on the same date last year, and we hope that it would be more successful than the one last year which was held amid the coronavirus pandemic.Mittal, who was also the convener of the all-India convention by farmers that concluded on Friday, said the two-day event was a success, and saw the participation of representatives from 22 states, of not just 300 farm unions, but also members of organisations that work for the welfare of women, labourers, tribals, as well as youth and students.During the convention, discussions and deliberations took place on the farmers’ struggle that has been going on for the last nine months, and it focused on making their agitation against the farm laws a pan-India movement.“During the convention, it was discussed as to how the government has been pro-corporate and attacking the farming community.“Our demands for repeal of all three pro-corporate farm laws, legal guarantee for MSP of all crops, repeal of Electricity Bill, 2021, no prosecution of farmers under the ‘Commission of AQ Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Bill 2021’ were reiterated during the convention,” Mittal said.On Thursday, the farmers’ protest against the three contentious laws completed nine months since they first arrived at the Delhi borders. The farmers have been demanding the repeal of the laws which they are afraid will do away with the MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.

They can decide within the party constitution. I will see in what context Sidhu said what he said. So far as what Sidhu’s advisers said, we made it clear that it wasn’t acceptable to the Congress,” said Rawat, as Sidhu’s controversial adviser Malwinder Singh Mali quit his role on Friday, a day after Rawat said if Sidhu didn’t sack his advisers he would.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-tells-gandhis-he-cant-be-dummy-chief-rawat-reacts-who-says-he-is-302797

28-08-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Farmers’ kin resolve unshaken, vow to resist contentious farm laws despite loss||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 26Gaura Kor, 71, is unfazed even in the face of extreme grief. A resident of Jhandi village in Patiala, Kor lost her elder son, Major Khan, who contracted Covid-19 in May while protesting at the Delhi border against the three central farm laws last year.Also read: Punjab Cabinet clears jobs for 104 heirs of deceased farmersLeft with the responsibility of a daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, her fortitude in the face of adversity is something that inspires other women in the village to continue the fight, and also support their menfolk.“My father Major Khan died at the age of 42. He was the sole bread-winner of the family. We own just over an acre, but corporatisation of agriculture would sound the death-knell for small farmers like us. As a tribute to his sacrifice, both my grandmother and I regularly participate in the protests,” says 21-year-old Amin Khan.Tribute to deceased fatherMy father died at the age of 42… As a tribute to his sacrifice, both my grandmother and I regularly participate in the protests. —Amin Khan, Granddaughter of gaura korTales like this are commonplace in Punjab, as nine months have elapsed since the farmers have been protesting outside Delhi. A list of 601 farmers who have died during this period — from September 26 to date — has been prepared by the unions under the aegis of Samyukt Kisan Morcha.Referred to as “shaheed” in villages, their families instead of grieving for them, have only firmed up their resolve to continue the protests till the laws are withdrawn.At Kaunke Kalan, near Jagraon, 20-year-old Jaskaran Singh says basic survival for the family has become difficult after his father Sukhwinder Singh died of a heart attack at Tikri on June 25.“We are landless labourers. After my father died during the protest, my mother has taken to stitching, I rear the few dairy animals we own, but my mother insists I do my part at the protest site at the Jagraon railway station every day. We don’t want his sacrifice to go in vain. His death only firmed up our resolve to fight peacefully against the laws,” Jaskaran tells The Tribune.Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the BKU (Ekta Dakaunda), says the government machinery is trying to spread misinformation that crowds at the protest site are dwindling and that the opposition to the laws is waning.“They have failed to see the undercurrent. We are now trying to expand our outreach. Industrial and farm labourers, too, are supporting our cause. Our protest will continue to be peaceful and the massive rally being planned at Moradabad, UP, on September 5 will open the eyes of the Centre,” he adds.Gursewak Singh of Hamidi village in Mehal Kalan, is one such example of how resolved the farmers continue to be against the laws. His 63-year-old father Nirmal Singh Sohi passed away at Tikri recently, and his ‘bhog’ was held today afternoon. “He will get peace only when the struggle is over. That is why I am now going back to the Tikri border. After all, we owe it to those who laid down their lives in the protest to save our future,” he says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-kin-resolve-unshaken-vow-to-resist-contentious-farm-laws-despite-loss-302473
