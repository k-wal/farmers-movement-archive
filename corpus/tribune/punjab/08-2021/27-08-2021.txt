The remnants of the Kos Minars and serais still exist on the stretch, which is presently known as Attari-Tarn Taran Road.The serais (rest houses) were built during the Mughal period on a distance of roughly 18-20 kilometres and served the purpose of night shelters for traders and officials of the darbar. A Kos Minar (mile stone) was built at roughly 1.8 kilometres each and helped travellers as markers of distance.These minars were also central to the efficient post-delivery system developed by Sher Shah as each one had a rider ready with a horse for relay of horses to deliver post. While most of these Kos Minars have withered, a few have survived the onslaught of time.Of the two serais, Serai Amanat Khan has been under renovation by the Archaeological Survey of India for decades now.
