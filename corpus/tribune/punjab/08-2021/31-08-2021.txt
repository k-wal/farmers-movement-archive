31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Police officers have to toe the line of politicians in power: HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court asserted on Tuesday that it was aware of the fact that the police officers had to toe the line of politicians in power. It was also conscious of the fact the police officials suffered if they did follow the dictates and run the risk of being victimised when the rival politicians came to power.The assertion came as Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi ruled reference for initiation of contempt of Court proceedings was not required to be made against investigating officer in “Saini case” Harvinder Pal Singh.“The Majesty of this Court is preserved and upheld not by initiation of contempt proceedings, but by the manner in which it protects fundamental rights of the citizens and extends equal protection of laws and equality before law and justice to all who approach this Court and that is with what I would like this matter of initiation of contempt proceedings to end,” Justice Tyagi asserted.The Bench, during the hearing of a habeas corpus petition filed for release of Punjab’s former top cop Sumedh Singh Saini, had taken exception to an email received on the High Court’s official ID purportedly sent by Harvinder Pal Singh.Addressed to the Chief Justice, it was regarding transfer of Saini cases from the Bench to any other coordinate Bench on account of undue hurry being shown. Justice Tyagi had asserted the Court reserved the right to take appropriate action regarding the email casting aspersion about hurry in hearing of the matter without realizing that any habeas corpus petition raised serious issue of unlawful detention requiring to be heard on an urgent basis.As the issue came up for resumed hearing, Justice Tyagi asserted the email appeared to have been sent by an over-energetic police officer. But the same could not be a matter of his own choice and he appeared to have been ill-advised regarding the same by someone from behind the scene.“I am not only conscious of the harsh reality that the police officers work under tremendous pressure and even risk their lives in their fight against crime, but also aware of the fact that unfortunately one feature of our polity is that the police officers have to toe the line of politicians in power being under double edged sword where they suffer if they do not abide by the dictates and also run the risk of being victimized later on when rival politicians come to power,” Justice Tyagi added. Before parting with the matter, Justice Tyagi dismissed as withdrawn Saini’s plea for advancing the date of hearing his case fixed for September 9.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-officers-have-to-toe-the-line-of-politicians-in-power-hc-304640

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab police register case against SFJ’s Pannu for assassination threat against CM Amarinder||The Punjab police have registered a case against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu of the banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) for allegedly threatening to assassinate Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.The death threat was issued through a video posted on the SFJ’s Facebook page on August 28, police said on Tuesday, adding that the case was registered on Monday.Last month, the Himachal Pradesh police had booked Pannu for allegedly issuing a threat against state chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said the video suggested a criminal conspiracy against Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who was shown in the video as being targeted with bullets.Further investigations were underway to unearth the complete conspiracy, he added.The case was registered against Pannu, his associates, and SFJ members under the relevant sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and the IPC at the state cybercrime police station in Mohali, said Gupta.The DGP said Pannu had been found promoting violent extremist action and threatening assassination of the Punjab chief minister.Meanwhile, the chief minister, in an official statement here, warned Pannu against any attempt to disturb the state’s peace, stability and communal harmony.   He asserted that any bid by the SFJ and its self-styled ‘general counsel” to create trouble in Punjab would be countered with the full might of his government.The CM said, “Nobody will be allowed to disturb the hard-earned peace of Punjab and again plunge our people into the dark abyss of the terrorism days, which took thousands of innocent lives.”He again warned of a befitting response to the SFJ’s disruptive and divisive acts.The land of the Gurus, who had always propagated the ideology of oneness of humanity, Punjab was home to all people, regardless of religion, caste and creed, the CM said.“Pannu’s pathetic attempts to once again fan hatred, divisiveness and violence in the name of religion and in the garb of a peaceful secessionist campaign for the attainment of Khalistan has already been strongly repudiated by the people of Punjab and India,” Amarinder Singh said.All political leaders and parties had condemned Pannu’s Pak ISI- funded campaign for a separate nation, the CM said.     The SFJ had in July issued a threat against Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur.It had claimed that the outfit will not allow the Himachal chief minister to hoist the national flag on Independence Day. The Himachal Police had then registered an FIR against Pannu.   Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistani outfit based in the US, was declared as ‘Unlawful Association’ by the Government of India in 2019 after it was found to be indulging in activities prejudicial to the internal security of India and the public order and having the potential of disrupting peace, unity and integrity of the country.

As per the data collected from the Special Task Force (STF), Ludhiana range, women smugglers have entered this notorious trade from the past few years.Heroin smuggling lures women smugglers the most, followed by opium, poppy husk, smack, charas and other narcotic substances.From March 2017 onwards the STF, Ludhiana range, has registered 37 cases of drug smuggling and arrested 43 women smugglers during four and a half years.Major drug recoveriesFrom these women drug smugglers, the STF recovered 37.38 kg of heroin, 11.5 kg of opium, 460 kg of poppy husk, 160 gm of smack, 10 gm of charas and Rs24.52 lakh drug money.The STF Ludhiana in-charge, Inspector Harbans Singh, told The Tribune that most women smugglers during their interrogation confessed that they entered into this notorious trade to get rich in a short span of time.“Women wanted to earn easy money and got entangled into this illegal profession without predicting the consequences. Many women peddlers have regretted after the STF caught them with drugs,” Inspector added. “Most women caught by the STF are involved in heroin smuggling. Reason could be high profit,” said Inspector.“Some women enter this trade just to assist their husbands or friends, but they cannot leave it,” Inspector added.Shortage of women copsA senior police official requesting anonymity said, “Women are entering smuggling as they hardly come under suspicion at routine police nakas and benefit from this. You will never see any women cops at any police naka. Male cops cannot frisk women.”“Women mostly hide drug in their undergarments. A male cop cannot frisk such suspected women. So, they always go scot-free,” he added. He suggested laying of nakas manned by policewomen to frisk women involved in illegal profession.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/43-women-arrested-for-heroin-smuggling-in-ludhiana-range-in-over-four-years-304451

Otherwise, farmers’ leader Balbir Singh Rajewal would not be offering ladoos to Punjab Chief Minister,” Khattar said at a press conference organised here on the completion of 2,500 days of his government.‘Karnal SDM’s choice of words not right’Regarding Capt Amarinder Singh’s demand for his resignation, he quipped: “Who is Capt Amrinder Singh to ask for my resignation? Rather the Punjab Chief Minister should resign for instigating the farmers.”“In Punjab, Capt Amarinder Singh is instigating the farmers against the three farm laws while in Haryana, (Bhupinder Singh) Hooda saheb and other Congress leaders are doing the same,” Khattar alleged.Khattar asserted that around 85 per cent of the farmers sitting at Singhu and Tikri borders were from Punjab. Farmers in Haryana are mostly satisfied with the Haryana Government’s policies, he asserted.Talking about lathicharge at Karnal, Khattar claimed that the farmers had already decided not to allow the BJP meeting to take place. The farmers should have protested peacefully. The district administration and the police did what was required to maintain law and order, he said.He asserted that the farmers were not getting anything by these protests and the people were not sympathetic towards them. “I am getting calls from people that the farmers need to be dealt with sternly but we are exercising restraint as they are our people,” the Chief Minister said.Answering another query, Khattar said a draft Bill on ‘love jihad’ was being prepared and it would either be brought as an ordinance or a Bill in the next Haryana Assembly session.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-bhupinder-hooda-instigating-farmers-alleges-haryana-cm-khattar-304425

The state’s worker-population ratio remains low at 47.8 per cent.As the state prepares to start its seventh state-level job mela from September 9, the government once again faces the task of high attrition within months of the unemployed youth getting job offers and taking up employment. Though no official data on the attrition rate is available, officials say it is “quite high”.“Despite the state having the highest unemployment rate in the region at 7.3 per cent, (Haryana has 6.4 per cent, Chandigarh 6.3 per cent and Himachal 3.7 per cent), the youth in the state are not willing to take up the jobs on offer. This is mainly because the jobs offered are in retail sector, which is largely unorganised. On the other hand, many youth from Himachal tend to take up these jobs, which shows why unemployment rate there is lower than Punjab,” a senior officer told The Tribune.This time, the number of registered job seekers is 12.28 lakh, whereas the available jobs are 7,277 in the government sector and 2.76 lakh in private. “Since the salaries offered in the unorganised sector are low, the youth from Punjab and even Haryana are not keen on taking or sticking to these jobs. So, this time we have decided to rope in industries from Himachal, especially those located on the areas bordering Punjab, as well as with food service providers Zomato and Swiggy, to offer maximum jobs,” said Rahul Tiwari, Principal Secretary, Employment Generation.With job melas planned right till September 16, the government has given a target to all 23 Deputy Commissioners to ensure that at least 25,000 jobs are offered in each district. “We are targeting to offer jobs to 5.75 lakh youth,” said Tiwari, hoping that this would help many youth get employment here, especially as overseas migration had been reduced to a naught.12,28,896 Registered job seekers10,529 Registered employers7,277 Available govt jobs2,76,480 Available pvt jobs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-attrition-rate-ails-punjabs-ghar-ghar-rozgar-scheme-304248

A total of 21,000 hectares of land is under the maize crop in the district.Sandeep Kumar, sarpanch of Jandla village near Anandpur Sahib, said farmers in his village had sown maize on nearly 100 acres. “The crop, however, was damaged due to pest attack despite spraying pesticide repeatedly,” he added.Manohar Lal, another farmer from the village, said he had sown maize on three kanals of land. When he noticed pests, he got a pesticide from the market and sprayed it thrice but still a major portion of his crop had been damaged, he claimed.According to the experts of the Punjab Agricultural University, fall armyworm was reported to attack the maize crop in the state towards the end of Kharif-2019 season. Dr Harpreet Kaur Cheema, entomologist (forage), said: “Since maize is grown almost round the year, the management of this new invasive pest should be done at the first appearance to minimise the increase of pest in successive generations.”Avtar Singh, Ropar Chief Agriculture Officer, said, “Prima facie, the wrong method and timing of spraying pesticides on the crop by farmers seems to be the problem. Despite training, they tend to make mistakes and use pesticides suggested by local dealers, ignoring farm experts.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pest-attack-maize-growers-seek-relief-from-punjab-govt-304249

The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), along with the agriculture department, will start monitoring air quality from September 10.Experts say the cases may rise this year as farmers are angry over farm laws and the government not paying the Supreme Court-ordered financial incentive. “Despite best efforts, Punjab can manage only 50 per cent of the produced stubble, leaving no option but to burn it. Any action against farmers is challenged by unions,” said a top official attached with the anti-stubble burning drive.In 2013, the National Green Tribunal prohibited the burning of paddy straw, saying: “The guilty would be liable to pay environmental compensation ranging from Rs 2,500-15,000 per incident.” However, farmers continue to burn stubble in the absence of any strict action against them.PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg said: “We are already sensitising farmers not to burn stubble and will start monitoring from September 10. We are trying to reduce the cases this season.”Punjab saw 76,590 incidents of fire in 2020 as compared to 52,991 in 2019 — an increase of 44.5 per cent.State got 76K machines to manage residueAgriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had recently told the Rajya Sabha that between 2018-19 and 2020-21, Punjab was given 76,626 machines under the Central Sector Scheme on Promotion of Agricultural Mechanisation for in situ management of crop residue||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/expect-farm-fires-in-punjab-by-mid-sept-say-experts-304258

Though AY.12 sub-lineage is reportedly responsible for the ravages in Israel, the Health Department said there was no cause for concern.The department explained AY.12 had not been classified as Delta Plus variant. Notably, AY.12 is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2).Dr GB Singh, Director, Health and Family Welfare Department, said the samples were sent for genome sequencing in July, but the results came out a few days ago.“There is no cause for concern as of now, because these are sub-lineages of Delta variants that are already present. Besides, the state has not witnessed any rise in number of cases, therefore, there is no need to worry. In Patiala, four samples were found positive for sub-lineage AY. 4. However, all have recovered,” he said.Dr Rajesh Bhasker, nodal officer, said all districts where sub-lineages of Delta were detected had already been informed to keep tabs on cases.He added the Health Department was prepared to battle a possible third wave. “Most of the preparations for the third wave have already been completed. Besides, paediatric wards for Covid have already been set up across the state.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-delta-sub-lineage-found-in-punjab-304259

Now that Covid cases have subsided, patients have started coming to hospitals, resulting in jam-packed TB OPDs.Ludhiana district alone has reported 1,300-1,400 newly diagnosed cases last month at the Civil Hospital. A few cases of Covid-positive being diagnosed with TB and vice-versa have also come to light.“TB patients received a setback during the Covid waves. Due to travel restrictions, people could not come for treatment. During the second wave, a few changes were made in the procedure of treatment so that medicines of patients are not discontinued. But the real sufferers were the new cases who never reached the OPD due to restrictions,” said Dr Ashish Chawla, Ludhiana District TB Officer.On normal days, the TB OPD receives an average of 100 patients but during the second wave, the number dropped to 40 and now that restrictions have been lifted, the OPD receives nearly 150 patients a day, which include both new and follow-up cases.“After the second wave subsided, we received nearly 1,400 newly diagnosed cases of TB in a month. In addition to this, five-six such cases were diagnosed where patients were undergoing treatment for Covid and when their TB test was done, they were found positive. They were unaware of their TB status. The government has made it mandatory to test all TB patients for Covid and vice-versa,” said Dr Chawla. “TB and Covid have overlapping symptoms and that is the reason the tests were made compulsory,” he said.The patients mostly belong to urban and semi-urban areas and also include the migratory population. Urban population is more vulnerable to the disease because of more population. People working in tight compartments with no proper ventilation and unhygienic conditions are also vulnerable, he added.Ensure proper ventilation: DoctorThe TB patients mostly belong to urban and semi-urban areas and also include the migratory population.

The ruling by Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan came on a petition filed against the State of Punjab and another respondent by petitioner-convict Bahadur Singh through counsel Vijay K Jindal.Justice Sangwan, during the course of hearing, was told that the petitioner had undergone a sentence awarded to him in a drugs case and his further detention in the jail was illegal. Jindal submitted the petitioner in all was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 12 years and was to pay Rs 1.5 lakh fine after facing a trial in an FIR registered in August 1997 under the NDPS Act.Jindal said the petitioner was currently lodged in Barnala district jail and had undergone more than 11 years of actual sentence out of the total 12. As such, he was entitled to certain remissions, which made him entitled for release. But, the state had not granted him remission that he was entitled to, compelling him to continue serving the sentence.The state counsel, on the other hand, submitted that the petitioner could not be granted remission in accordance with the state policy dated April 13, 2001, as he was on bail. It was further submitted that the total sentence, including the remission comes out to be over 10 years.Justice Sangwan asserted that he found merit in the present petition after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the Supreme Court judgments in the cases of Nalamolu Appala Swamy and D Ethiraj, holding that the state could not deny the benefit of remission to the petitioner as per the policies for the period he remained on bail.Allowing the petition, Justice Sangwan directed respondent — Punjab Home Secretary — to pass fresh order within three weeks and to release the petitioner forthwith if he qualified for the remissions in accordance with the Supreme Court judgments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cant-deny-remission-to-convict-on-bail-punjab-and-haryana-hc-304263

Sources in the PSPCL said the amount of pending electricity bills of the government schools in the state had crossed Rs 13 crore. The PSPCL had failed to recover these bills, even after snapping the power supply to many schools.About two years ago, the state government had allotted Rs 3,080 lakh for solar on-grid system in 880 government schools to install 5kW power system in each institution.

He said the Punjab Government must immediately issue directions to the PSERC (Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission) in public interest to revise the tariff being paid to private power plants, making the faulty PPAs null and void.“This will help the Punjab Government give 300 units of free power to all domestic consumers, decrease domestic tariff to Rs 3 per unit and Rs 5 per unit for industry, along with redressal of all outstanding bills, waiving the unjustifiable and exorbitant bills,” he said.The demand for the extension of the session comes in the wake of the government move to curtail it probably to avoid any untoward situation in case the dissidents seek no-confidence motion against the CM.Sources said given the continuing tussle between the warring factions, the visit of party’s Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat to Chandigarh tomorrow — two days ahead of the one-day session — is being seen as a move by the high command to mollify the rival factions and avoid any embarrassment to the party on the floor of the House just months ahead of the Assembly elections.

31-08-2021||Ravi Dhaliwal||MP Partap Singh Bajwa likely to contest Assembly election from Gurdaspur||Tribune News ServiceGurdaspur, August 30Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa’s decision to contest the Assembly elections has not only set the alarm bells ringing among senior Congressmen, but also triggered speculation on the choice of his seat.Nine constituenciesHis proposed re-entry into the state politics stems from the fact that his term as the MP will end on April 9 next year, barely weeks after the result of the state polls would be declared. The MP has already sounded out AICC bigwigs, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Sources say his decision has the concurrence of these leaders. Senior Congressmen are worried that if the MP makes it to the Vidhan Sabha, many of them may get marginalised because his entry is likely to change the state’s political dynamics. “Given his experience, seniority and understanding of Punjab politics, Bajwa has the potential to emerge as the dark horse in the tussle between CM Capt Amarinder Singh and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. His political survival is at stake and when a man fights for his survival, he tends to pull out all stops to remain afloat,” a minister said.Bajwa’s former parliamentary constituency of Gurdaspur has nine Assembly seats out of which two — Dinanagar and Bhoa — are reserved. Of the remaining seven, his best bets are Qadian and Batala. His brother Fatehjung Bajwa is the sitting legislator from Qadian.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mp-partap-singh-bajwa-likely-to-contest-assembly-election-from-gurdaspur-304244
31-08-2021||GS Paul||South seat: Capt Amarinder, Navjot Sidhu loyalists face off in Amritsar||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, August 30The Congress seems to be divided between Capt Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu camps when it comes to allocation of tickets for the ensuing 2022 Assembly poll.Amritsar-South constituency is presently represented by Inderbir Singh Bolaria, a close confidante of Sidhu. Now, Congress leader and former MLA Harjinder Singh Thekedar, who is a staunch supporter of Capt Amarinder, has thrown his hat in the ring.He has already intensified activities in the constituency, especially after the CM’s recent visit to the holy city on the state-level occasion of 75th Independence Day held in Amritsar. Amid the feud between CM and Sidhu, Thekedar had openly shown his solidarity with Capt Amarinder.Associated with the Congress since 1978, Thekedar is confident the party would show faith in him this time. He also hinted that in case of any resistance on his claim, he would not refrain from contesting independently. “I am 100 per cent contesting the 2022 poll from the South constituency, with or without a platform,” he said.On the other hand, Bolaria, who, as a sitting MLA of the SAD-BJP combine, had switched his loyalty towards the Congress in December 2016 and was successful in procuring the ticket for the 2017 elections, said, “We have started a fight to save Punjab and Congress. People like Thekedar are irrelevant and hold no importance. Such people never end up becoming leaders as they will be limited to just petty politics. There are larger issues of Punjab to be addressed,” he said. Bolaria said the ticket would be decided only on merit.Reacting, Thekedar said the natives of the area were not happy as they were devoid of basic civic facilities. “Ask the thousands of families living near the Bhagtanwala dumping ground which has made their lives hell. Except for false assurances, there was no one to take up their problems at an appropriate platform,” he said.Thekedar, who served as an MLA from 2002 to 2007 from the South segment, was lately appointed as the chairman of the Backward Classes Land Development and Finance Corporation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/south-seat-capt-amarinder-navjot-sidhu-loyalists-face-off-in-amritsar-304245

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||'Break heads' order: Khattar says Karnal SDM’s ‘choice of word inappropriate’, defends police action against farmers||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday accused the Amarinder Singh government in Punjab, besides the Congress and the Left, of fuelling farmers’ unrest against the Centre’s three farm laws in his state.Khattar also cautioned the agitating farmers against resorting to violent ways and means of protest which may harm their agitation and turn the society against them.On Karnal SDM Ayush Singh, who was caught on camera purportedly telling police to “break the heads” of agitating farmers, Khattar said the IAS officer’s “choice of word was inappropriate” but defended the police action.Deputy CM and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala had on Sunday promised action against Sinha amid mounting opposition’s attack against the Khattar government over the Saturday lathi-charge on farmers and their demand of strict action against the magistrate.“The government will definitely take whatever action is deemed fit,” he said.Addressing media on the completion of 2,500 days of the BJP-JJP combine government in Haryana, Khattar insisted on the Punjab government’s role in making farmers choose Haryana to protest against the farm laws.“There is a clear hand of the Punjab government in it,” said Khattar, arguing had it not been so, BKU leader Balbir Singh “Rajewal would not have gone and offered sweets to the Punjab CM”.“It’s a harsh reality,” Khattar added.The chief minister also accused the Congress and Left leaders of Haryana of fomenting trouble in the state.“Here in Haryana, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and other Congress leaders besides some Left leaders are instigating farmers to take law in their hands,” the CM said.Khattar also hit out at his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh for seeking his resignation over the police action against farmers protesting against the farm laws in Karnal on Saturday.He said rather Punjab CM Amarinder Singh should resign as “most of the people sitting at the Tikri and Singhu borders—I would say around 80 per cent—are from Punjab”.“Farmers are happy in Haryana,” he said.Cautioning farmers against their frequent agitations at different places in Haryana, the CM said, “It is damaging their agitation and the society at large is turning against them.”He appealed to farmers to adopt democratic means to protest rather than getting violent.“Hindrances in any work will not be accepted. There are limitations on every freedom. There is no absolute freedom,” he said.

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||‘It’s BJP, not Punjab, that’s responsible for farmers’ unrest & wrath’:  Capt Amarinder||Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday slammed his Haryana counterpart for defending the criminal assault on peacefully protesting farmers by putting the onus of their agitation on Punjab, saying that ML Khattar’s remarks had completely exposed his government’s anti-farmer agenda.The Punjab chief minister reminded ML Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala that the farmers were protesting against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting in Karnal when the police rained lathis on them belonged to Haryana and not Punjab.Capt Amarinder was reacting to Khattar’s and Chautala’s allegations of Punjab being behind the farmers’ agitation against the farm laws.Blaming the BJP squarely for the farmers’ wrath, Capt Amarinder said the crisis would not have assumed such grave proportions had the BJP, including the Haryana CM and deputy CM, heeded the farmers’ concerns and empathised with their pain instead of  taking refuge in shameful lies for the horrendous attacks on the peaceful farmers. He trashed Khattar’s claim that the Haryana Police used force only after the farmers disturbed the state’s law and order, pointing out that the viral video of the SDM giving explicit instructions to the cops to bash up the farmers nailed the CM’s lies.“How did the SDM know that the farmers intended to resort to stone pelting etc, as claimed by Khattar?” asked the Punjab chief minister.“Can’t you see that the farmers of your own state are angry with you for your apathetic attitude towards them and your party’s stubborn refusal to repeal the farm laws?” he asked the Haryana leaders, adding that the farmers were fighting for their survival and did not need provocation from Punjab or any other state to protect themselves and their families.The sentiment of the entire country was with the farmers in the matter of the draconian and blatantly undemocratic farm laws, imposed by the BJP-led Central government in the midst of the Covid pandemic, pointed out Capt Amarinder, adding that the BJP’s adamant refusal to revoke the legislations reflected the vested interests of the party and its leadership, which had once again placed their crony capitalist friends over the common man.“Repeal the farm laws instead of blaming Punjab for the mess your party has put the farming sector in,” said Capt Amarinder, warning that the BJP would have to pay for their sins in the upcoming assembly elections in various states, and in every poll thereafter. The Khattar government’s repeated attempts to forcibly end the farmers’ agitation, and the derogatory and obnoxious terms used against farmers by various BJP leaders, will only backfire on their party, he added.Recalling that the farmers had held protests across Punjab for two months before shifting focus to the Delhi borders, the chief minister pointed out that his state had not witnessed a single incident of violence during the period.“Even recently, when sugarcane farmers staged protests, we negotiated with them and resolved the issue instead of using brute force to try and subjugate them,” he added.Responding to Khattar’s remark on farmer leaders giving him (Capt Amarinder) ladoos after the resolution of the sugarcane farmers’ protest, the Punjab chief minister quipped: “You repeal the farm laws and not just the farmers but even I will share ladoos with you.”Capt Amarinder said he and his government were firmly with the farmers in their anti-farm laws stance and were even giving compensation and jobs to the families of those who have died at the Delhi borders because of the BJP’s follies.“A government or a political party which allows such tragic and totally avoidable loss of lives to continue under its watch cannot survive,” he added, sending out a strong warning to the BJP to stand down on its ego and pay heed to the cries of their ‘annadaatas’ before it is too late.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/its-bjp-not-punjab-thats-responsible-for-farmers-unrest-wrath%C2%A0-capt-amarinder-304191
