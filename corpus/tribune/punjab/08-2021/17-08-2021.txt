Now, the pilgrims who offer daswand (10th part of their income) for the services of the SGPC would be benefitted for tax rebate under the Income Tax Act‚Äù, he said.SGPC had filed the application for registration under section 80G of Income Tax to the Commissioner of Income Tax, Amritsar, but it was rejected in 2009 with a perception that SGPC is a religious body working for a particular religion (Sikhs) only.SGPC challenged the order of Commissioner of Income Tax and filed an appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Amritsar. ‚ÄúOur senior advocate Prem Singh, Gunjeet Singh Syal, TS Aurora and Chartered Accountant Gurcharan Singh Syal acted wisely.After 12 years, the case was heard and the Judicial Member Laliet Kumar and Accountant Member Dr. M.L Meena of Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Amritsar granted exemption under section 80G in favour of the SGPC.The lawyers convinced the jury that the SGPC was never created for the benefit of Sikh Religious Community only, but is in service for the public at large as charitable activities were being provided without discrimination of religion, caste, creed, colour, sex and race.It is interesting to note that four doors of famous Gurdwaras (including Darbar sahib/ golden Temple), are opening out in four difference directions to signify and welcome all without any discrimination of class or creed. Similarly, the services of langar (cooked food from community kitchen), medical aid and rescue arrangements in times of crisis and lately, the free vaccination, oxygen supply during the current Covid-19 pandemic was offered without any discrimination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-gets-recognition-for-income-tax-exemption-298551

Women have been studying, working and going out, which will now be stopped all of a sudden.Ahmad Mubasher, who is pursuing PhD from Punjab Agricultural University, said: ‚ÄúWe are four sisters and four brothers. I am feeling sorry for the women of my country as their freedom will be compromised now.‚ÄùBelonging to the North province Baghlan, Ahmad said back in his country, life had stopped after the Taliban gained control. ‚ÄúAll these years, youngsters have been living life on their own terms. Women have been studying, working and going out, which will now be stopped all of a sudden. People in Afghanistan have experience with the Taliban and now fear the worst,‚Äù he said.Ahmad has been in constant touch with his family for the past couple of days, but today he could not get through the call due to network issues.A student pursuing MVSc in veterinary microbiology at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, on the condition of anonymity, said although Taliban had announced that they would not be interfering with the life of people, it was just a farce statement.‚ÄúI am scared after whatever is happening in my country. I am more concerned about my sister and wife. My sister, who is a doctor, has quit her job as she no more feels safe. I will be returning soon to be with my family,‚Äù he said.Another PhD student from PAU said his family had to abandon their house and take refuge in one of their relative‚Äôs place. ‚ÄúTaliban taking away the freedom of women is the worst nightmare that is coming true,‚Äù he said.Abdullah Alishangi, 20, of Kabul who is pursuing MBA from the Punjab College of Technical Education, said: ‚ÄúNow that the Taliban have taken over, they will try to win the confidence of people by taking them along. Earlier, if anybody used to step out of the house, we never used to be sure whether he/she would return home or not. Now, this fear will diminish as the Taliban have taken over and they will try to restore peace and normalcy to win over people. But this will come at the cost of the freedom of women,‚Äù Alishangi said.A brother of three sisters, he is upset as now his sisters would have to follow certain restrictions in their own country. ‚ÄúNow, women will have to wear hijab and require a male escort for travelling. There will be separate space in offices for men and women and no female teacher will teach at boys‚Äô schools,‚Äù he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/afghan-students-fear-for-safety-of-kin-back-home-as-taliban-return-298147

No Record of Rights was prepared or created for the area within the Lal Lakir.Possession has been considered as the ruling point for the ownership of any land within the Lal Lakir. In certain cases, some registered sale deeds have taken place on the basis of Chulha Tax etc.However, in most of the places, the ownership of the area within the Lal Lakir is usually passed on through an informal agreement etc. and the possession is the basis of ownership.Decides to waive off CLU for setting up retail outlets in prisonsThe Punjab Cabinet also approved waiver of (Change of Land Use) for setting up retail outlets (Petrol/diesel/CNG etc.) in 12 locations at various prisons in the state under the aegis of Punjab Prison Development Board (PPDB).With this, the CLU charges of Rs 48,77,258 would be waived off to set up the retail outlets at Central Jails in Patiala, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur besides District Jails of Sangrur and Ropar, New District Jail and District Jail of Nabha and Sub Jail, Fazilka.Approves creation of new block in SAS Nagar districtTo give further impetus to the developmental activities in the rural areas, the Cabinet also approved the creation of New Block Mohali in SAS Nagar district by taking out seven panchayats from Majri Block and 66 panchayats from Kharar Block.
