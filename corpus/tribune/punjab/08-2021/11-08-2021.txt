Members of All-India Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Memorial Trust have also blamed the authorities concerned for delaying the process of making a direct way from Chaura Bazar to the martyr’s ancestral home.Responding to the MC’s letter in this regard, the Department of Local Government on Tuesday asked the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) to release an amount of Rs 50,000 to the Department of Economics and Sociology, PAU, Ludhiana, to conduct a social impact assessment for acquiring 40 sq yards of land required to make a direct way to the martyr’s house from Chaura Bazar. Besides, a memorial would also be constructed by the LIT.Tribhuvan Thapar, a member of the trust, said, “We have been making repeated requests to the authorities concerned to ensure repair of the martyr’s house but to no avail. The government must direct the authorities to ensure repair of the house and beautification of the area at the earliest.”He further demanded that the process to make a direct way to the birthplace of the martyr should be expedited. He also demanded that a security guard be deployed outside the martyr’s house so that nobody could dump garbage there. Notably, the trust members have been complaining about unsanitary conditions near the martyr’s house for a long time but the civic body had failed to take necessary action to date.“We have also deployed workers on our own to carry out repairs outside the house,” said Tribhuvan Thapar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/government-orders-release-of-rs-50k-to-make-direct-way-to-shaheed-sukhdev-thapars-home-in-ludhiana-296118

11-08-2021||Neeraj Bagga||‘Covid-19 considerably brought down bulk sale of basmati rice’: Arvinder Pal Singh||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, August 10The Covid-19 considerably brought down bulk sale of basmati and prompted families to avoid buying superior quality basmati, thus affecting its sale.Arvinder Pal Singh, a proprietor of ‘Lal Qila’ brand, said, “The Covid-19’s direct impact on sales is visible. Bulk sales evaporated and shrinking income forced families to cut down their kitchen budget by avoiding to buy fine variety of basmati.” Long grain aromatic basmati did not remain first choice of masses, said Arvinder, who has been associated with the business, for the past 34 years.He said the crisis taught us to consolidate small consumer packaging. “Housewives rarely compromise on cost when it comes to healthy and nutritious food for their family members. Thus, its wise to focus on packaging in small quantity.”His grandfather Amar Singh had registered the firm ‘Amar Singh Chawal Wala’ in 1901. “The British used to levy 60 per cent tax and the entire business scenario used to be different altogether,” he said. Later, a young nation offered plethora of opportunities and Arvinder’s father Kartar Singh and uncle Pritam Singh steered the company ahead as per changing circumstances. They had set up a rice mill and floated ‘Lal Qila’ brand in 1963.“I joined the family business in 1986. The same year the company started rice export. Now, we are exporting to 77 countries,” he said.Around 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the basmati procurement is being done from Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur, besides the remaining 10 per cent to 15 per cent was carried out from Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. The company gives employment to 700 persons. The firm has two hi-tech rice mills with a capacity of 535 metric tonne per day, which produce white rice, steamed rice and parboiled rice with state-the-of-art machinery to ensure consistency in every grain. To protect environment, their rice mills use rice husk for producing electricity, which partially fulfil their energy requirement. The company has installed solar plants as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-19-considerably-brought-down-bulk-sale-of-basmati-rice-arvinder-pal-singh-295824

11-08-2021||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana High Court: Can ask accused to pay restoration to victim at time of bail||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 10Balancing the crime victims’ rights with those of the offender, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the court can impose on the accused the condition of the restitution of benefit or property to the victim at the time of granting bail. This could be immediately or in a manner as may be agreed to by the victim.Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi made it clear that the condition could be imposed if the accused admitted or there was prima facie unimpeachable documentary material/video footage regarding fraudulently or forcibly receiving a benefit or property from the victim and when they also failed to show their legal entitlement to the same. The imposition of any such condition for the restitution of the benefit or the property by the accused to victim could not be said to fall in the category of ‘impermissible onerous condition’.For illustration purposes, Justice Tyagi asserted if there was video footage from an authentic source regarding the snatching of a cellphone and vehicle by the accused, and the police neglected, failed or was unable to recover the same, would it not be just and proper for the court to impose the condition of restitution of the same by the accused to the victim at the time of granting bail or at the initial stage after taking cognisance?“If the accused was granted bail and allowed to face and delay the trial without such restitution on the ground that the court could award compensation at the time of sentencing him after his conviction, would it not amount to allowing him the enjoyment of fruits of his crime?”“Will not subjecting the complainant to wait till the payment of compensation on the final determination of guilt of the accused by the final disposal of his appeal, which may take years or even decades, amount to illegally depriving the victim of their fundamental right to life and liberty and statutory right to property without any just and proper remedy at the appropriate time?” he questioned.Before parting with the order, Justice Tyagi added even the criminal court, at the time of considering the grant of bail, could direct the accused to disclose their moveable and immovable assets, if the facts and circumstances of the case so warranted. The accused could also be directed to submit an undertaking that they won’t fraudulently transfer the same to defeat any order, which may be passed by the court for the restitution of interim/final compensation to the victim.Even the IO was required to collect evidence during the probe regarding the liability of the accused to the restitution of moveable/immovable property fraudulently received or forcibly taken/occupied.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-can-ask-accused-to-pay-restoration-to-victim-at-time-of-bail-295972

After legal advice, the FIR was registered against the three.The court of Judicial Magistrate Harpreet Kaur, in its judgment, said the then tehsildar did not discharge his public duties in getting the attestation of affidavit in an authorised manner, as there was no record in the Sub Registrar office regarding attestation. Rather, he in criminal conspiracy with the co-accused cheated and committed fraud upon the complainant.Further, the stamp vendor made a mistake of doubling the entry and the accused in criminal conspiracy forged the document to make wrongful loss to the complainant, she observed.The judge turned down Dr Sohan Lal’s request for release on probation on the grounds that he was suffering from brain tumour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tehsildar-ex-smo-get-2-yr-jail-for-fraud-295969

The police claimed that Pehalwan’s murder was orchestrated by a Canada-based gangster and his associate and jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Middukhera was accused of having had his closeness with Bishnoi group. Two days ago, a police team had reached the house of Vinay Deora but found it locked.Sources in the police said Vinay was one of the suspects in Middukhera’s murder as he has been identified from the CCTV footage as the left-handed shooter. They believe Vinay’s brother Lavi was killed earlier by the Lawrence Bishnoi gang and Middukhera’s murder was in retribution for the same.However, opposing this theory, Vinay on his social media accounts claimed that he had nothing to do with Middukhera’s murder and the police were targeting him in a false criminal case to kill him in a “fake” encounter.In Pehalwan case, his father alleged, the police had failed to make any progress even after six months. However, Dr Balkrishan, SP (D), Faridkot, refuted the allegations, saying the police were making all efforts to bring the accused and the investigation was under way. — TNSRuling party backing gangsters: MajithiaMuktsar: Senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Tuesday alleged the Congress was patronising gangsters as it wanted to use them for its benefit in the upcoming Assembly elections.

My father couldn’t trace her. My father had informed the Lakhewali police about the matter on July 30, a day prior to the kidnapping, and also submitted a written complaint. At the time, the accused were issuing threats to kill me and my father.”She said: “My father met a DSP yesterday and requested him to trace my mother, but to no avail.”In a written statement, Sampla said: “Taking strong notice over the suicide of Dalit man, the commission has asked the authorities concerned to submit an action-taken report before August 25. If the report is not received within the stipulated time, the commission may exercise the powers of the civil court conferred on it under Article 338 of the Constitution and issue summon for personal appearance before the commission in Delhi.”SSP D Sudarvizhi said: “A case has been registered against four persons. Further probe had been started.”A senior cop, however, claimed the deceased in his suicide note had sought action against three men and a woman. “He has nowhere written about police inaction,” he claimed. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/muktsar-dalit-man-kills-self-over-police-inaction-295936

With border police districts of Punjab already on a high alert following yesterday’s seizure in Amritsar, Gurdaspur SSP Nanak Singh was holding a meeting with senior officers at his office when he received information that “a big helicopter had fallen at a village of Kalanaur sub-division after hovering in the sky for 10-15 minutes”.Remotely piloted from JammuThe drone was being remotely controlled by the IAF from Jammu, preliminary information gathered by the police revealedThe pilot of the drone, which didn’t have any weapons, apparently lost control and it fell in paddy fields at Khanowal village in KalanaurThe SSP along with his team left for Khanowal.

Tackling the cross-border movement of unmanned aerial vehicles is the biggest challenge in the present times and we are taking preventive measure,” he said.
