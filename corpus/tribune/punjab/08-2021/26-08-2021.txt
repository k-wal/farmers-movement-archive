26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt announces hike in employees’ pay||The Punjab government on Thursday announced to increase the basic pay of its employees by a minimum of 15 per cent and restore certain allowances, a move that is expected to cost Rs 1,500 crore to the exchequer.“With this, the total average increase in salary/pension per employee has gone up to Rs 1.05 lakh per annum,” according to a government statement.This is as compared with Rs 79,250 per annum earlier that the employees were getting after the 6th Pay Commission’s recommendations were accepted with effect from July 1, 2021, it added. It had led to a Rs 4,700 crore bonanza for the employees.The latest decision to raise the pay over and above the basic pay as on December 31, 2015, was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.He also directed all ministers, administrative secretaries and heads of departments to talk to their respective employees for early redressal of their grievances.Employees belonging to several departments have been agitating against the state government over certain recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission.“While all reasonable demands of employees should be resolved following today’s announcements,” he made it clear that strict action should be taken as per rules if the employees continue to agitate.The CM appreciated the efforts of Cabinet minister Brahm Mahindra and others in resolving the grievances of the 2.85 lakh employees and 3.07 lakh pensioners, who will benefit from Thursday’s decisions. This will cost the government exchequer a total salary and pension bill of Rs 42,673 crore per annum.Singh pointed out that all operational allowances have not only been retained but also doubled in absolute terms over what they were being paid earlier. The Cabinet decision has restored common allowances, such as fixed medical allowance, mobile allowance, conveyance allowance and city compensatory allowance (CCA), at the revised rates (2.59 X 0.8) with effect from July 1, 2021.The Cabinet also approved treating of non-practicing allowance (NPA) admissible to doctors at the rate of 20 per cent of revised basic pay as pay, with secretariat pay for employees (working in Punjab Civil Secretariat) to be doubled with effect from July, 2021 and also to be treated as Pay.Government doctors had been agitating against recommendation of the Punjab’s Sixth Pay Commission de-linking non-practicing allowance from the basic pay.Employees covered under the National Pension Scheme have now been given cover under family pension in case of death-in-harness, it said.The Cabinet also decided that service rendered during the probation period shall be counted for the purpose of assured career progression (ACP), as already being done by the Department of General Administration.The decisions taken by the state’s Cabinet are based on the recommendations of a committee of the group of ministers, headed by Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra, to consider the demands of various categories of employees.

The cases of the legal heirs of farmers and farm labourers who have died during the farmers’ agitation against the farm laws were not covered by the policy, necessitating approval and relaxation.With the Cabinet decision, the deceased farmers’/labourers’ mother, father, married brother, married sister, married daughter, daughter-in-law, grandson, granddaughter, next of kin (NoK) etc., as recommended by the concerned DC, would be eligible for employment as a one-time measure.Notably, a committee was constituted under the chairmanship of principal secretary personnel, on the orders of chief minister, to consider the issue.The committee had, on July 26, 2021, considered the cases of 104 candidates and recommended employment to the eligible candidates. In this regard, a letter has been issued by Revenue Department.It may be recalled that, in the midst of lockdown due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the three laws/ordinances were passed by the Government of India on June 5, 2020, which caused a huge outcry among the farmers and farm labourers across the state.Organised protests and agitations by farmers/farm labourers first started in Punjab and then the agitation assumed a nationwide anger. A large number of small and marginal farmers took part in this agitation. The farmers are still agitating on the borders of Delhi.A number of farmers and farm workers have lost their lives while protesting in the cold and inclement weather conditions on roads and under the open sky.Taking note of the problems and hardships being faced by the farmers and farm workers, the Government of Punjab has already provided ex-gratia and financial aid of Rs 5 lakh to the families of the farmers and farm workers who have died during the agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-gives-ex-post-facto-approval-for-jobs-to-104-legal-heirs-of-deceased-agitating-farmers-and-farm-labourers-302432

Nobody can separate us. Such statements are not right,” he said, without directly referring to Sidhu’s advisers.“Punjab is a border state. If any statement is to be given then it should be given responsibly,” Kejriwal said, adding, “We do not want to do politics over such issues.” The controversial remarks by Sidhu’s two advisers—Malvinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg—on sensitive issues like Kashmir and Pakistan came under sharp criticism from within the Congress and the Opposition.In a social media post, Mali had waded into the issue of revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.He had reportedly said if Kashmir was a part of India, then what was the need to have Articles 370 and 35A. He had also said, “Kashmir is a country of Kashmiri people.”Kejriwal was in Gurdaspur on Thursday for inducting former Punjab minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan into the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).AAP’s Punjab in-charge Jarnail Singh, co-incharge Raghav Chadha and the party’s Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann were present.

26-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab decides to raise minimum qualification for Gram Sewaks from matric to graduation||To enhance the efficiencies of the Rural Development and Panchayats Department, the Punjab Cabinet on Thursday decided to raise the minimum qualification for Gram Sewaks from Matric to Graduation.It has okayed amendment to the Rural Development and Panchayats Department (Class-III) Service Rules, 1988, according to an official spokesperson.A decision to this effect was taken in a Cabinet meeting chaired by the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh held here this afternoon through video conferencing.Following the Cabinet’s nod, the “Punjab Department of Rural Development and Panchayats (Class-III) Service (First Amendment) Rules, 2021” will notify amendment to the rules, thus paving the way for fresh recruitment of 792 Gram Sewaks, to be conducted by the SSS Board.Notably, the duties of Panchayat Secretary and Gram Sewaks in the Rural Development and Panchayats Department are of similar nature but the minimum educational qualification in direct recruitment of Panchayat Secretary is Graduation whereas in case of Gram Sewaks, the educational qualification has so far been Matriculation.VET HOSPITAL SERVICE PROVIDERS GET CONTINUATION:Meanwhile, in a bid to provide efficient animal health services in the 582 veterinary hospitals across the state, the Cabinet okayed continuation of the services of Service Providers (497 Veterinary Pharmacists and 498 Class-IV/Safai Sewaks), already working on contract basis, as a stop-gap arrangement for a period of two years, i.e. from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022.This decision has been taken to ensure smooth functioning of the veterinary hospital, besides enabling dairy farmers to avail the best veterinary services for their livestock.The state government has already transferred 582 Civil Veterinary Hospitals back to the Animal Husbandry Department, including the 582 sanctioned posts of Rural Veterinary Officers, from Rural Development & Panchayat Department, to provide efficient animal health services to livestock owners.APPROVES AMENDMENT FOR BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN DBEES AND DPMUS:To bring parity and ensure coordination in the functioning of District Bureau of Employment Enterprises (DBEEs) and District Program Management Units (DPMUs), the Cabinet gave approval to amend notification No. 9/33/2019-1ET/1530612/1 dated July 24, 2019 to replace the words “Additional Deputy Commissioner (Development) and ADC (D)’ with Additional Deputy Commissioner-cum-CEO DBEE”.As per a Cabinet decision of June 6, 2019, Punjab Skill Development Mission was brought under the Department of Employment Generation, Skill Development and Training, which has also set up DBEEs in all districts where Additional Deputy Commissioners are CEOs (Chief Executive Officer) of these DBEEs. DBEEs and DPMU of Punjab Skill Development Mission are working in districts under the direct control of the ADCs who act as nodal officers for the same. However, in many districts ADC (Development) is the nodal officer for skill programmes and ADC (General) is the CEO of DBEE.This dual structure leads to lack of coordination amongst the skill training and employment generation wings of the department.Therefore, for better coordination between DBEEs and DPMU at district level, the Cabinet took this decision to amend the said notification.APPROVES ANNUAL ADMINISTRATIVE REPORTS:The Punjab Cabinet also approved Annual Administrative Reports of the Employment Generation & Training Department for the years 2018-19, 2019-20, and of the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs department for four years viz. 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-decides-to-raise%C2%A0minimum-qualification-for-gram-sewaks-from-matric-to-graduation-302395

But we want to ask why leaders hide from us. He has left the place without meeting us. By holding meetings, leaders only create problems for people. We have already said we will protest. If the state leaders convince the Centre to repeal the three farm laws we would not have to protest like this. We will continue to protest against BJP leaders as long as farm laws are not withdrawn." Kashmira Singh, spokesperson of the BKU (Rajewal), said, "Wherever a BJP leader arrives we will hold protest against him.

But ultimately, the government had its way.In this regard, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had recently issued directions to the state government through its Chief Secretary on a petition filed by the Council of Engineers (CoE) to first get the floodplains of the Sutlej around the site at Mattewara demarcated and only then, take any further action for setting up the industrial park. However, apparently these directions have also been ignored.In a public notice, PUDA has invited ‘expression of interest’ (EOI) for the ‘Modern Industrial Park’ at Koom Kalan for plots in varying sizes from one acre to 50 acres. Eligibility of applicants for seeking the plots would be based on their average annual turnover during the past three years, ranging from Rs 5 crore to Rs 250 crore. The applicants would have to pay a refundable demand survey fee of Rs 1 lakh for a plot measuring up to 5 acres, Rs 2 lakh for 10 acres and Rs 5 lakh for plots measuring 25 to 50 acres.According to the PUDA public notice, the tentative price of the land has been fixed between Rs 1.15 crore and Rs 1.90 crore per acre, depending on the size of the plot. The last date for submission of the EOI would be September 15, 2021.National Green Tribunal directions ignoredIn this regard, the National Green Tribunal had recently issued directions to the state government through its Chief Secretary on a petition filed by the Council of Engineers to first get the floodplains of the Sutlej around the site at Mattewara demarcated and only then take any further action for setting up the industrial park.

The tension between the two camps is far from over,” said a senior leader.We Stand by our word: Rebels We have been authorised by party MLAs to take up pending poll issues. If we are called to Delhi, we will go. —MinistersAfter the meeting, ministers Channi and Randhawa said they stood by what they had stated yesterday. “Being disciplined party men, we have raised our grievances and issues with the in-charge of Punjab affairs who shares our concerns. We have been assured that our issues will be taken up with the party high command. We had been authorised by party MLAs to take up the pending poll issues. If we are called to Delhi, we will go,” said Channi.Rawat categorically denied that the flare-up had anything to do with the PPCC president Sidhu. He said, “There is no threat to the party or government. There is no threat to our victory either. These leaders expressed their concerns and grievances. They said they were not against anyone. They want to go to the polls with a clear roadmap so that we win the 2022 Assembly elections.”Rawat indicated that one of the major grievances of the rebel leaders was about the functioning of the state and district administrations. “If a Congress MLA considers himself insecure and thinks that administration is working against them then it is a matter of concern.

Other districts fairing poorly include Kapurthala (17.3 per cent), Mansa (22.8 per cent), Sangrur (23.17), Fazilka (23.38 per cent), Tarn Taran (23.76), Jalandhar (24.48), Muktsar (28.01) and Moga (29.77 per cent).Health officials cite irregular vaccine supply as the reason behind poor performance of these districts. A civil surgeon, on the condition of anonymity, said initially there was hesitance among people. “Now when residents are keen to get jabbed, the supply is not adequate. Till last week, most districts were getting just 20 per cent of the required doses,” he said.There are, however, some districts which are getting much more doses than the average. Besides Mohali, where 71.31 per cent of the population has been vaccinated, Hoshiarpur’s coverage is 57.14 per cent, followed by Pathankot (55.11 per cent) and Ludhiana (44.55 per cent).It has been reported that Punjab is one of the worst performing states in the country when it comes to vaccinating population above 60. As per government data till August 18, just 22 per cent of the elderly population was fully vaccinated.During a meeting with the Union Health Minister last week, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had sought 55 lakh doses in view of the upcoming festival season.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/skewed-vax-cover-71-per-cent-in-mohali-12-per-cent-in-ferozepur-302154

The workers alleged the decision to bear the cost of vaccination from the labour welfare fund was taken on May 7 under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary. Ironically, the decision came when the Centre had announced the rollout of vaccination for everyone above 18 years from May 1.Sardara Singh, a worker, said: “We are also citizens of India and are entitled to be inoculated free of charge. Why are the funds meant to be spent on our welfare have been used for the vaccination process?”Gurpyar Singh, another construction worker, said: “Having been registered as a construction worker doesn’t mean that we have lost our right to free vaccination. Utilising labour board funds, other than the welfare of workers, is a violation of the apex court’s orders.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fund-spent-on-vaccination-punjab-workers-move-court-302040
26-08-2021||Saurabh Malik||Can spouse register rape FIR against husband? Punjab and Haryana High Court to decide||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 25The Punjab and Haryana High Court will adjudicate whether a legally wedded wife can lodge an FIR against her husband on the allegations of rape. The petitioner-husband has claimed that the offence of rape under Section 376 of the IPC was not made out against him as the respondent-complainant was his legally wedded wife and admittedly “both made physical relations after marriage”.Taking up the petition filed by the husband, mother-in-law and sister-in-law through counsel Arnav Sood, Justice Amol Rattan Singh has not only put the state of Punjab and the complainant on notice, but also directed the trial court to adjourn the matter for the time being. “Till the next date of hearing only and specifically, the trial court is directed to adjourn the matter to a date beyond that given by this court…,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted.The notice, issued by the Bench, was accepted by Punjab Deputy Advocate-General Ramdeep Partap Singh on behalf of the respondent-state. Sood, earlier during the proceedings, referred to “exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC”, which defined rape. Sood submitted the exception made it clear that sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, when the wife was not under 15 years of age, was not rape.He added the other offence, alleged to have been committed by the other two petitioners, was that of criminal conspiracy punishable under Section 120-B of the IPC. When the first offence itself could not statutorily stand, the question of offence punishable under Section 120-B of the IPC also could not stand, Sood added.The petitioners were seeking the quashing of an FIR registered on May 16, 2019, under Section 376 and 120-B of the IPC at Hoshiarpur police station. Directions were also sought for quashing all subsequent proceedings “being illegal and gross misuse of the process of law”.Sood contended it was trite law that the wife above 15 could not file a case under Section 376 of the IPC against the husband. This, the survival of the FIR, was itself illegal and deserved to be quashed. The basis on which the police registered the case against the petitioners was shocking.The FIR was nothing, but gross misuse of the process of law by the complainant-wife “for certain ulterior reasons” which were apparent from the facts of the case. “Thus, the same is liable to be quashed at the onset,” Sood added.Before parting with the case, Justice Amol Rattan Singh added: “Naturally, despite the statutory provision pointed out by counsel for the petitioners, counsel for the parties would be required to address arguments as per the law settled so far on the issue”.No offence after marriage: PetitionerThe petitioner-husband has claimed the offence of rape under Section 376 of the IPC was not made out against him as the respondent-complainant was his legally wedded wife and admittedly “both made physical relations after marriage”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/can-spouse-register-rape-fir-against-husband-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-decide-302041

He said the major challenge before the industry was the change in specifications by the Centre. He said due to the ongoing agitation of farmers, the Union Government had intentionally changed the specifications in the paddy procurement process by reducing the foreign matter content from 2 per cent to 1 per cent and moisture from 17 per cent to 16 per cent. While, the farm unions had been demanding a hike in these. He said this would lead to another agitation and the millers will have to bear the brunt of these differences between the Centre and the farmers.He said the Centre wanted to discontinue the procurement of paddy due to excess grain by adopting such means and it will ruin the industry. He also urged the state government to look into the matter for the cause of the millers.The association state president urged the state government to refund their securities worth Rs 10 lakh each, which had been declared non-refundable just to compensate the defaulter rice millers, who committed fraud with the government. “We have been urging the government to allot paddy to Rice mills after verifying their financial status, so that genuine millers do not suffer and loss could be avoided,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rice-millers-in-punjab-threaten-to-boycott-lifting-302049
