12-08-2021||Gurnaaz Kaur||The cast and crew of the film Shershaah share how they have closely stuck to details of martyr Captain Vikram Batra’s real life||The bravery of Captain Vikram Batra (PVC) and his sacrifice during the Kargil War is known to many. There’s much written about him and now we also have a biopic that not only showcases his legendary act on the battlefield, but also gets one acquainted with his larger-than-life persona.Directed by Vishnu Vardhan, Shershaah has Sidharth Malhotra in the titular role along with Kiara Advani, who plays his beloved Dimple Cheema. Titled after Vikram Batra’s codename during the Kargil war, Shershaah, this is a special film for many reasons. It is a dream-come-true for Vikram Batra’s family, as in 2015 they were approached for a film. Vishal Batra, Vikram’s twin brother, says, “Shabbir Boxwala from Kaash Entertainment proposed the idea. That was also the time when we already had a dream to make a film on the life of Vikram. Dharma Productions came in later and I am delighted that together they have showcased Vikram’s story on the big screen.”Special roleIt is the first time that Sidharth is essaying a real-life character on screen. He says, “Makes it all the more special and also brings with it a lot of responsibility because he is someone who is really revered in the Army.”Kiara, on the other hand, spent time with Dimple and learnt about the many memories she had with Vikram. “It was the best thing to meet Dimple and hear from her first-hand all the moments that they had shared with each other. It’s so beautiful and also a very unique relationship to be with someone who’s serving the nation. You don’t get to meet each other so often. Their courtship was of four years and during that time they must have met each other not even for 12 months. Back in the 90s it was so difficult to communicate. But it just seemed like such a pure love story to understand why someone would then take a decision to remain unmarried for the rest of their life!”After many successful Tamil films, to debut in Hindi cinema, that too with a biopic, normally brings with it a lot of pressure but director Vishnu calls it a lifetime opportunity. “It couldn’t have been a better start than Shershaah. A film based on Indian Army and that too on a hero like Captain Vikram Batra,” he beams.Charming personBoth Kiara and Sidharth say Captain Batra was a very passionate man, According to Sidharth, “He was this very charming, lovable, good-hearted Punjabi boy who used to exude positivity.” And after knowing the love story so closely, Kiara says, “The things that he did charmed her and everyone around him. She was very gracious to share all of that with us. And through her I also experienced what the partner of someone who is serving the nation would go through.”Many of the dialogues and situations in the films are what happened in real life. So, whether it is yeh dil maange more or Vikram’s promise ‘to return after either hoisting the flag or being wrapped in it’ are originally said by him. “We just had to enact it and I think Vishnu and Sandeep have done a fabulous job. It is extremely challenging to tell somebody’s story in two hours. But we hope people get the essence of who Captain Vikram Batra was and why he is so celebrated within the Army,” Sidharth sums it up.(Releasing on Amazon Prime Video today)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/the-cast-and-crew-of-the-film-shershaah-share-how-they-have-closely-stuck-to-details-of-martyr-captain-vikram-batras-real-life-296577

Front house-line in case of scheme areas will not be compounded as per the draft.Besides, Rs 750 per sq ft composition fee has been fixed for non-compoundable building violations in non-residential buildings, as per the draft.As per the draft policy, non-compoundable building violations in non-residential buildings, disclosed voluntarily under sub-section (1) of section 4, may be settled by the competent authority, on as is where is basis (except the mandatory fire safety requirement including setbacks* and parking requirement as mentioned in Schedule-I of the Municipal Building By-laws, 2018, and public safety/security and public convenience will not be compromised) after spot verification as a one-time measure by realising the composition fee.Notably, thousands of illegal constructions have come up against the building by-laws in the city. Moreover, commercial activities are going on in many residential areas of the city but the authorities took no action to provide any relief to people from such violations.Now, questions are also being raised over the government’s policy draft. Kapil Arora of the Council of Engineers said: “Suggestions should be taken from all stakeholders, including residents of Ludhiana. When the by-laws were made, these were not implemented properly, leaving violators to raise buildings against the norms in the city. Now, the government wants to allow regularisation of the non-compoundable violations in buildings. It would be like cheating with law-abiding residents, who had got their buildings constructed as per the rules.”MC’s MTP SS Bindra said: “It is a draft policy and we are examining it. We will give suggestions that parking violations in buildings should not be regularised. All buildings must ensure parking arrangements.” Copy sent to officials of civic bodiesA copy of the policy draft has been sent to the Mayor, Commissioner and officials concerned of municipal corporations, councils, nagar panchayats and improvement trusts in the state and asked them to examine the draft of the policy and send comments by August 16.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/regularisation-of-non-compoundable-violations-in-buildings-punjab-govt-seeks-comments-on-settlement-policy-draft-296549

Dr Payare Lal Garg, ex-Registrar, Baba Farid University of Health SciencesMalwinder Singh Mali, Former teacherIn party circles, the appointments are being seen as not only the first step in setting up his team, but also a subtle message to his detractors. “These appointments have been made by Sidhu. These have nothing to do with the four working presidents — Kuljit Nagra, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pawan Goel and Sukhwinder Singh Danny, appointed by the party high command,” a source said.Before becoming MP, Dr Amar Singh was the adviser to Sidhu during the latter’s term as the Local Government Minister. Dr Singh had to resign as his appointment had reportedly not been regularised by the government.Mustafa, husband of Minister Razia Sultana, had not only gone to court against the appointment of DGP Dinkar Gupta, but has also been siding with the group of ministers loyal to Sidhu.Malwinder Singh Mali, former teacher with the state Education Department, has been critical of Capt Amarinder Singh and praising Sidhu on the social media. He calls himself a political analyst. Dr Garg claimed that the government in the name of employment wanted to snatch land from villagers, which was the only source of income for a large population of the state. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-first-pcc-chief-navjot-singh-sidhu-appoints-4-advisers-296356
12-08-2021||Aman Sood||Regulator nod to cancel 3 PPAs||Tribune News ServicePatiala, August 11Around a fortnight after the Chief Minister asked the power corporation to revisit or cancel all faulty PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), Punjab has managed to relinquish its allocated share of power from Anta, Auraiya and Dadri power stations.This will pave the way for the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to terminate an agreement with these producers working under the aegis of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). The PSPCL had filed a petition seeking permission to relinquish allocated power from Anta, Auraiya and Dadri generating stations of the NTPC in March 2021, which the power regulator had admitted in June 2021. The orders are likely to benefit Punjab by over Rs 115 crore per annum.In its petition, the PSPCL had claimed from the financial years (FYs) 2013-14 onwards, due to addition of 3,920 MW power from independent power producers within the state, Punjab was having surplus power after meeting the demand from its own sources as well as from external sources tied up under various long-term PPAs. “Under the applicable tariff regulations, despite surrender of allocated share of power from a central sector generating station, the petitioner was still liable to pay fixed/capacity charges of the generating station till the time the said allocation was either formally de-allocated or re-ordered,” the PSPCL claimed in its petition.As per details, the PSPCL has paid an amount of Rs 128.99 crore for 2018-19 and Rs 115.11 crore for FY 2019-20 against the surrendered power. Thus, continuing allocation of power from the above generating stations was causing undue financial burden on the petitioner and was leading to higher cost of power purchase, which ultimately gets passed on to consumers.“During FY 2019-20, the petitioner had a surplus of 21,089 million units of power,” reads an excerpt from the petition. “Even upon relinquishment of allocated power from Anta, Auraiya and Dadri generating stations of the respondent, there will be no shortage of power in the state,” it stated.“In view of the above, the commission allows the present petition to the effect that the PSPCL is permitted to relinquish its allocated share of power from these power stations of the NTPC,” ordered the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission.Welcoming the decision, CMD PSPCL A Venu Prasad said this would ultimately benefit the consumers as Rs 115 crore saved would be passed on to them. “We are already examining other expensive PPAs bleeding Punjab financially,” he said.Surplus power from IPPs citedIn its petition, the PSPCL had claimed from the financial years 2013-14 onwards, due to addition of 3,920 MW power from independent power producers (IPPs) within the state, Punjab was having surplus power after meeting the demand from its own sources as well as from external ones tied up under various long-term PPAs.All stations under NTPCThe PSPCL had filed a petition seeking permission to relinquish allocated power from Anta, Auraiya and Dadri generating stations, working under the aegis of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), in March 2021.

12-08-2021||Saurabh Malik||Can’t claim age limit relaxation merely on Punjab CM’s tweet: High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 11Candidates cannot claim as a matter of right relaxation or increase in upper age limit merely because the Chief Minister tweeted in this regard, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has held. The ruling came in a case where the petitioner-candidates were seeking upper age relaxation to apply for police sub-inspectors’ posts.Appearing before Justice Girish Agnihotri’s Bench, Navdeep Singh Brar and 55 other petitioners had conceded that they did not fulfil the criteria prescribed in the advertisement as their age was beyond 28. But their counsel argued that the Punjab Chief Minister had on July 12, 2020, in his official tweet said “the official announcement of the increase in recruitment age from 28 years to 32 for DSPs and Sub-Inspectors will be made in the coming days....”Police recruitmentJustice Agnihotri’s Bench, during the course of hearing, was told that the issue of age relaxation after the tweet was discussed at various levels. It was the considered decision on the state’s behalf neither to increase the upper age limit from 28 to 32, nor to relax the age beyond 28.Justice Agnihotri also made it clear that petitioner-candidates could not seek extension in upper age limit by taking the plea of Covid situation. The assertion came after Justice Agnihotri took note of the petitioners’ prayers for “counting their age as on January 1” in lines of Supreme Court judgment, whereby the period starting from March 15, 2020, till further orders, was directed to be considered as ‘Zero Period’ in view of the pandemic.Justice Agnihotri asserted it was not the case of the parties that the advertisement was initially issued in 2019 or 2020, when the petitioners were allegedly within the maximum age limit.“The selection process apparently has not been deferred or delayed because of the Covid situation. Therefore, the petitioners herein cannot claim their right for extension of upper age limit,” Justice Agnihotri ruled.Dismissing the petitions, Justice Agnihotri further made it clear there was no legal obligation on the state’s part to fill all vacancies that had fallen vacant. The court was in agreement with the state counsel’s contention that the ‘employer’s’ decision whether to fill the vacancies at any particular time depended upon the public need, administrative exigencies and availability of infrastructure or budgetary provision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cant-claim-age-limit-relaxation-merely-on-punjab-cms-tweet-high-court-296360

The names doing the rounds are Dr Raj Kumar Verka, a Balmiki leader, Rana KP Singh, Lok Sabha Speaker, Dr Raj Kumar Chabewal, a Dalit MLA and another MLA from Doaba. Sources did not rule out dropping of two ministers whose names had figured in recent controversies.The party’s top brass would make an effort to address the Hindu and Dalit vote bank issue in the Cabinet rejig. Following the CM’s meeting with Sonia Gandhi, the ministers and MLAs in the Sidhu camp would also be meeting the party leader in New Delhi in the coming days.The appointment sought by five ministers and six MLAs (who are former advisers to the CM) to meet the party president has not been confirmed yet, it is learnt.

Howver, nothing has happened till date.Kamalpreet has returned from the Olympics after securing the sixth position.Jugraj Singh, senior vice-president, Punjab Kisan Union (Ruldu Singh Mansa), said, “It is shameful that the state government has not yet started the work on the promised sports ground and the gymnasium hall in our village.

I personally hold each of them in high regard for their vision and work to envisage a better future for every Punjabi,” he said in a letter.Lok Sabha MP Amar Singh had been advisor to Sidhu when he was the local bodies minister.

12-08-2021||New Delhi||Punjab CM Amarinder meets PM Modi, seeks repeal of controversial farm laws||Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately initiate steps for the repeal of the three controversial farm laws, and amendment to the relevant law for including farmers in free legal aid category.The Chief Minister, who called on the Prime Minister here late this evening and submitted two separate letters, called for immediate review and revocation of the three farm laws that had triggered widespread resentment among farmers of Punjab and other states, who had been protesting at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year.Pointing to the prolonged agitation, which had cost the lives of more than 400 farmers and farm workers, the Chief Minister said the stir had the potential of posing security threats for Punjab and the country with Pakistan-backed anti-India forces looking to exploit the farmers’ disgruntlement with the government.Urging the Prime Minister’s intervention for expeditious redressal of the farmers’ legitimate concerns by the Government of India to explore an enduring solution, the Chief Minister said the continued agitation was not only impacting economic activities in Punjab but also had the potential to affect the social fabric, especially when political parties and groups take strong positions.Captain Amarinder noted that he had earlier, too, sought the Prime Minister’s appointment for a meeting with an all-party delegation from Punjab. He further underlined the need to compensate farmers for the management of paddy straw @ Rs 100 per quintal and also to address the fears of DAP shortage, which could aggravate the farmers’ problems and the crisis triggered by the farm laws.In another letter, the Chief Minister stressed that due to the fragmentation of landholdings, and persistent disputes with lessees and various market operators and agents, the farmers are also facing heightened litigation these days, causing stress on their meagre financial resources.Stressing the need to reduce the farmers’ financial burden as a result of such litigation, he noted that the Central Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides free legal aid to certain categories of persons, who are perceived to be the vulnerable sections of the society. Pointing out that the country’s farmers are also very vulnerable, he said that they are, at times, compelled to commit suicide due to financial problems, even though they remain proud and prefer to till their land even at the cost of their lives.“It is, thus, the need of the hour to amend Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to include farmers and farm workers in the category of persons entitled to free legal services to pursue and defend themselves in the courts to secure their livelihood,” said Captain Amarinder. He felt this step would help reduce cases of farmer suicides and ensure better protection of their legal and financial rights.The Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to advise the concerned central ministries dealing with farmer welfare and laws to carry out necessary amendments to the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, in the larger interest of the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-amarinder-meets-pm-modi-seeks-repeal-of-controversial-farm-laws-296233

Mandaviya assured the chief minister of all help saying while supplies would ease from next month, he would fulfil the state’s requirement by October and ordered the department to immediately increase Punjab’s allocation to meet its urgent requirement.The Chief Minister said that with sufficient supplies, the state government could arrange to vaccinate 5 lakh-7 lakh people daily.He pointed out that allocation of vaccine for Punjab for the month of August currently stood at 20,47,060 doses of Covishield, while around 26 lakh doses of this were required just for those whose second dose was overdue.Citing data, the Chief Minister said Punjab had relatively very less allocation of vaccines (and hence very low per capita vaccination) as compared to the other states, and it needed to be increased to cover more population and catch up with the others. He urged the minister to ensure immediate supplies of both Covishield and Covaxin.As of August 7, Haryana’s per capita vaccination stands at 35.2, Delhi’s at 39.4, J&K’s at 43.7, Himachal Pradesh’s at 62 and Rajasthan’s at 35.1, as against 27.1 for Punjab.The Chief Minister observed that Punjab has, till August 7, received only 1,00,73,821 doses, as against Haryana (1,27,94,804), Delhi (1,06,79,728), J&K (66,90,063), Himachal Pradesh (55,51,177) and Rajasthan (34,954,868).The Chief Minister further sought access for the state to the COWIN portal for analytical purposes.Amarinder also urged Mandaviya to consider favourably Punjab’s request for setting up a Bulk Drug Park at Bathinda. The state government had applied in October 2020 to set up the park over 1,320-acre land at Bathinda, with the Council of Ministers approving attractive incentives for the same, he pointed out.During the meeting with the Union minister, who holds additional portfolio of Chemicals and Fertilisers, the Chief Minister also reiterated his government’s demand for enhanced allocation of DAP stocks to Punjab, as per the revised demand by the state. Suppliers should be directed to ensure that adequate supplies are given as per schedule, he told the minister, reiterating the points he had raised in this regard during his meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/union-health-minister-orders-25-per-cent-increase-in-punjab-vaccine-supplies-in-response-to-amarinders-request-296198
