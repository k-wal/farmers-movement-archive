21-08-2021||Amritsar (Punjab)||Central govt must install anti-drone technologies in border areas: Congress leader Tewari||Expressing concern over weapons and drugs being pushed into the Indian territory from across the border using drones, Congress leader Manish Tewari on Saturday demanded that the central government install anti-drone technologies to stop smuggling of the items into Punjab.The Congress MP said he had written a letter to the Union Home Minister on this sensitive issue.Addressing the media here, Tewari expressed concerns over the current situation in Afghanistan and said the Taliban takeover has given strength to the divisive forces working in neighbouring Pakistan and that it could be harmful for the interests of Indian border states, particularly Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.He said Pakistan spy agency ISI was continuously working to sabotage peace in India and everyone could see the smuggling of drugs and weapons into the Indian territory using drones.Though security forces personnel who are on high alert have successfully foiled many such bids, there are doubts that some of these may be successful in achieving targets, he said.He lauded the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh in “successfully tackling” the Covid-19 pandemic and saving the state’s economy despite the “non-responsive attitude” of the central government.“Punjab CM is sincere and has vast experience. Punjab needs such leadership in the coming state assembly elections, which don’t hesitate in putting individual political interests at stake to save the interests of the state. Captain Amarinder Singh has all such merits,” added Tewari.He said that they firmly stand with the farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws.

After tasting defeat in Assembly poll in 2017, she had been in passive mode but during 2019 MP elections, the BJP candidate Som Parkash had been successful in earning her support. So, it was being considered that she could be the party’s choice for 2022 Assembly elections for contesting once again from Dasuya but her leaving the party like this has stunned the party leadership. She had inherited the legacy of her MLA husband Amarjit Singh Sahi, after his death in 2012 so she had not to struggle to establish herself. Her son, Dr Harsimrat Singh Sahi, also remained the Dasuya municipal council president and all was not well with BJP on his elevation. Later, he went to USA and is presently settled there. Some of her supporters, requesting anonymity, termed it as a ‘not a wise decision’ as there’s not much left with SAD in Dasuya as in the SAD-BSP alliance, the Dasuya seat is left for BSP.BJP district president Sanjeev Minhas resented her decision to leave the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dasuya-ex-mla-bibi-sukhjit-kaur-sahi-quits-bjp-joins-sad-300170

They also threaten the complainants who do not pursue the cases further. A senior police officialBhagwanpuria has around 50 cases registered in different police stations, including that of murder, attempt to murder, the Arms Act and the NDPS Act. Of these, 13 cases were registered in Amritsar alone. Ironically, he has been convicted by the court only in one case of the NDPS Act while he has been acquitted in 16 cases.This has raised many eyebrows as to why the investigations carried out by different agencies of the Punjab Police have failed to convince the courts in pronouncing conviction.The police investigation is usually riddled with loopholes and they fail to prove the charges levelled against Bhagwanpuria. In a case related to seizure of 7-kg heroin, he was acquitted by the court. He was framed on the statement of an accused while he was lodged in the jail during the confiscation of the said contraband. Amandeep Singh Pahwa, Bhagwanpuria’s legal counselA senior police official on condition of anonymity said one of the major reason was that the witnesses in these cases turned hostile due to fear of the gangsters. They also threaten the complainants who do not pursue the cases.He has been convicted in only one case of the NDPS Act in which he was pronounced 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in January 2020. He is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. Bhagwanpuria’s legal counsel, Amandeep Singh Pahwa said, “The police investigation is usually riddled with loopholes and they fail to prove the charges levelled against Jaggu. Sometimes, he’s apparently framed for the crime.”“In a case related to seizure of 7-kg heroin, he was acquitted by the court. He was framed on the statement of an accused while he was lodged in the jail during the confiscation of the contraband,” he said. The police had failed to substantiate their claims in the court.Bhagwanpuria is one of the dreaded gangsters of Punjab. Though he was lodged in jail, his name has been figured in many criminal cases in the recent past. Recently, he purportedly took the responsibility of killing another notorious gangster and his rival Ranbir Singh alias Rana Kandowalia at a private hospital on Circular Road. Tejbir Singh, Kandowalia accomplice was also injured in the firing while one of the shooter also sustained injuries.In a social media message, he warned his rivals of similar fate while taking the responsibility of the murder. He was also booked in the Kandowalia’s murder. He would be brought on the production warrant from the Tihar Jail in next couple of days for interrogation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/notorious-gangster-jaggu-bhagwanpuria-acquitted-in-16-cases-for-lack-of-proof-299983

Their kitchens are set up in cramped places and they often don’t have toilets in their households,” he said.Elaborating on their financial health, Dr Singh said: “The new agriculture technology, involving harvesters, combines and other equipment, has only stolen the livelihood of farm labourers and they are forced to seek loans for their sustenance.”Discussing the solutions to pull the farm labourers out of the existing mess, he said: “Co-operative farming along with providing land for farming to such families on individual basis can be a viable option.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/92-farm-labourers-in-punjab-from-dalit-families-says-expert-300076

Besides Punjab and Haryana, the PGI had also shown interest in the project.After finalising the drawings of the project, the CHB had demanded 25 per cent of the total amount in advance for starting the construction of the flats. However, even after sending several reminders, the CHB was yet to receive the advance payment from the Punjab and Haryana governments and the PGI, said Yashpal Garg, Chief Executive Officer, CHB. Recently, officials of the CHB gave a presentation in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha to Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, Chief Secretary Vijay Vardhan and officials of the Engineering Department.Garg said the Income Tax Department had recently sought information regarding the scheme, but they were yet to get a confirmation from the department.The CHB has decided to construct 10 towers with 28 flats each having a base price of Rs2 crore for each flat. Both governments and the PGI are expected to pay Rs66 crore each for their share of the flats. The project will come up on 6.73 acres at IT Park.Meanwhile, the CHB will soon launch a new self-financing general housing scheme at IT Park.

Breadwinners of hundreds of marginal farmers and farm labourers are also among those who are now searching for petty jobs to meet their daily expenses.Reiterating their stand to not lift the dharna till the three laws are withdrawn, regional leaders of the morcha led by Harnek Singh Dhaliwal and Amandeep Kaur said people supporting the agitating farmers all over India would bring an end to the BJP rule, which had shattered the economy of the nation.The private group has initiated the process to shut its inland container depot after its physical operations remained interrupted due to blockade on the main entry by protesters. Sources at the District Industrial Centre in Ludhiana said around 450 officials had been issued termination notices over a fortnight ago. “It is not only a question of around 1,000 employees only.

The arrests came following a raid on Rode’s house here on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday.The police also claimed to have recovered a “tiffin bomb”, five hand grenades, a box of detonators, two tubes suspected to contain RDX, a .30 bore pistol, four Glock magazines, a yellow wire, Rs 3.75 lakh, 14 passports and two SUVs.Both Operatives of ISI-backed outfitThe police claimed the two were operatives of the International Sikh Youth Federation (IYSF), backed by the ISI in Pakistan. Rode’s brother Lakhbir Singh, who is settled in Pakistan, is learnt to be heading this outfit.The Kapurthala police have registered case against the two under Sections 13, 16, 17, 18, 18B and 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act; 4 and 5 of the Explosives Substances (Amendment) Act; and 25, 54 and 59 of Arms Act at Phagwara Sadar police station.The investigating officials said the Amritsar (Rural) police had on August 8 recovered a similar “tiffin bomb” from Daleke village, falling under the Lopoke police station, indicating a link with this module.More than 20 policemen raided the Hardial Nagar house last midnight, where Rode, recovering from a recent surgery, was present. In the morning, Rode said: “The police scaled our boundary wall around midnight and said they wanted to search the house. After search and they took my son along. They returned after sometime and said they wanted to search the first floor again. They later took away some bags, saying they had made some recoveries. It smells fishy.”Co-accused Gagandeep Singh, a resident of Guru Nanak Pura, Phagwara, was reportedly arrested earlier and an illegal pistol was recovered from him.Kapurthala SSP Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh said as part of the follow-up investigations, Gagandeep revealed the pistol was part of an arms consignment that had been sent from across the border using drones over the past few months.He claimed a major part of the consignment had been stashed away by his aide Gurmukh Brar, editor of a Punjabi newspaper, in Jalandhar. The police raided Brar’s office and claimed to have recovered three hand grenades, a “tiffin bomb”, four Glock magazines and packaging foam material from the office premises.The SSP said preliminary investigations suggested the arms seized were part of a larger consignment sent by the ISI and Pak-based pro-Khalistan groups to carry out terror attacks in Punjab in a bid to revive militancy and disturb peace and communal harmony in the state.BqBid to revive militancy“The arms were part of a consignment sent by ISI and pro-Khalistan groups to carry out terror attacks in a bid to revive militancy in Punjab”— Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh, Kapurthala SSPOperatives of ISI-backed outfit* The two were operatives of the International Sikh Youth Federation, backed by the ISI in Pakistan, claim police* Akal Takht ex-Jathedar Jasbir Singh Rode’s brother Lakhbir Singh, settled in Pakistan, ‘heads’ the outfit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jasbir-singh-rodes-son-aide-nabbed-with-tiffin-bomb-rdx-299934

Last year, one in every 14 patients had died at the institute. The death-patient ratio has worsened during the past two years at the PGI, courtesy Covid.On the contrary, AIIMS, New Delhi, saw lesser deaths in 2021 and its death-patient ratio was 1:20.8 till June.Prof Jagat Ram, Director, PGI, said: “The institute has been admitting serious and critical patients of Covid-19 since March last year. The death rate among severe Covid patients was very high. The PGI is the only tertiary care hospital in Punjab, Haryana and HP. Mostly, the PGI is flooded with patients from various quarters through referrals. We cannot send patients to other hospitals, unlike AIIMS, Delhi, which has an option of referring patients to other hospitals such as Safadarjung Hospital. That is why, AIIMS has a better death-patient ratio than the PGI.”Around 7,122 Covid patients have been admitted to the PGI so far, of whom 1,221 belonged to Haryana and 2,864 to Punjab. A total of 1,713 patients have died due to Covid-19 at the PGI — a mortality rate of 24 per cent.The details of the patients who died during the past three years and the current year in hospitals under the Centre and its associated institutes, along with the death-patient ratio, was presented by the Health Ministry in the Rajya Sabha recently.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pgi-chandigarh-death-rate-way-more-than-aiims-299982

Taking up the matter, the court had directed the placement on record the copies of the FIRs registered against Badal, Capt Amarinder and “their associates”.Justice Tyagi also referred to the FIRs registered against Badal and Capt Amarinder. Reference was also made to Capt Amarinder’s adviser Bharat Inder Singh Chahal’s allegations of police torture.Chahal was made a respondent in the habeas corpus petition seeking Saini’s release. Justice Tyagi observed the notice to respondent Chahal was considered unnecessary. “No relief as such is claimed against him and he has been impleaded only because of the allegations as to respondent BK Uppal, IPS, being his stooge and detainee Saini having been illegally detained and tortured on his instance.”Justice Tyagi added Saini was alleged to have committed offence of forgery under Section 467 of the IPC by ante-dating agreement to sell purporting to have been executed on October 2, 2019. It was on plain paper, and not on stamp paper, to create a defence to attachment of the house allegedly acquired with bribe money taken by Nimratdeep Singh and given to his father Surinderjit Singh Jaspal. “It is doubtful as to whether the allegations as to execution of agreement to sell dated October 2, 2019, to create a defence to attachment of the house satisfy the ingredients of Section 464 of the IPC so as to constitute the offence punishable under Section 467 of the IPC,” Justice Tyagi added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ordering-sumedh-sainis-release-hc-cites-badal-capt-rivalry-299912
