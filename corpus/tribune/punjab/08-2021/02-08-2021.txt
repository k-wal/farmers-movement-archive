02-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mandatory to mention pleas pending in lower courts in bail applications: Punjab and Haryana High Court||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has changed the way bail pleas are filed in each and every case before the lower courts in Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh—it has now made it mandatory for an applicant to specify in the plea whether bail applications under any of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure have, or have not, been filed before any superior court.Justice Manjari Nehru Kaul also ordered that the public prosecutors /prosecuting agency would be duty-bound to apprise the court concerned on the issue after collecting necessary information from the investigating officers.“In case of lapse/default on the investigating agency/prosecution’s part in this regard, it would be construed to be a fraud played upon the Court, which could invite departmental as well as penal action against the erring parties/officials, as the case may be”. The Registrar-General was also directed to circulate the order to “all concerned” for not only information but also “necessary and strict compliance”.The directions came on a second regular bail petition in a house-trespass case registered in August last year under Sections 454 and 380 of the IPC at Hajipur police station in Hoshiarpur district.A report was called from the court below after the petitioner’s counsel, on a previous date of hearing, sought the petition’s withdrawal on the ground that he had since been released on bail by Mukerian Judicial Magistrate First Class.Justice Kaul observed the report clearly revealed that the petition’s pendency was cleverly concealed from the court below. Refusing the petition’s withdrawal, Justice Kaul added the court deemed it appropriate to take suo motu cognizance of the fraud played upon both the high court and the trial court by the petitioner. Notice was also issued to the petitioner as to why the bail should be not cancelled.Justice Kaul further added time and again, more so in the recent past, it came to the court’s notice that the accused clandestinely approached the trial court seeking similar relief in bail matter by either concealing the pendency of a petition before the high court or by misrepresenting facts. Such malpractices were undoubtedly a matter of serious concern deserving to be nipped in the bud at the earliest.Before parting, Justice Kaul made it clear to the courts below in Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh that bail pleas would also mention the outcome if a superior court was at all approached for similar relief. An application not containing the information would not be accepted/ entertained and returned for resubmission with necessary information.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mandatory-to-mention-pleas-pending-in-lower-courts-in-bail-applications-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-291881

02-08-2021||London||Wales gets new riverside site for scattering of ashes by British Hindus, Sikhs||A newly-approved site where Britain’s Hindu and Sikh communities can scatter the ashes of their near and dear ones after funeral rites have become operational by the River Taff in Wales after many years of the campaign.The Antim Sanskar Group Wales (ASGW), formed in December 2016, dedicated its efforts to a fundraising drive since the Llandaff Rowing Club in the Welsh capital of Cardiff got the go-ahead and over the weekend marked its formal opening.“Cardiff Council funded the construction and the Llandaff Rowing Club and members of the Hindu and Sikh communities of South Wales contributed financially to meet the final costs,” said Vimla Patel, Chair of the ASGW.“After many years of hard work we will, at last, have an established and sanctified area where families can come and disperse the funeral ashes of their loved ones,” she said.The issue of the lack of a dedicated site was first brought to the attention of Cardiff Council by Jaswant Singh, County Councillor in 1999. In 2013, the search for a suitable location was given a new impetus by Channi Kaler of the ASGW, who contacted many Hindu and Sikh institutions to find a resolution.“There are more than three generations of Hindus and Sikhs settled in Wales. The first generation of our community tended to take the ashes back to their motherland. However, the later generations, either born or have lived most of their lives here, prefer to scatter the ashes of their loved ones in Wales, with respect and dignity,” explained Patel.“It has taken some time to get the platform in place due to engineering issues, as well as problems caused by the pandemic, but we now have a permanent and managed location that will be used by the current and future generations of the Sikh and Hindu communities,” a Cardiff Council spokesperson said.The new site is now expected to be accessed by British Hindus and Sikhs from across the United Kingdom, with ASGW already aware of such enquiries from different parts of the country.The Hindu Forum of Britain (HFB), an umbrella group for British Hindus, has worked on this issue over the years.“As a part of the ‘Cremation and Crematoria’ in liaison with the UK government and the Hindu community, the Hindu Forum of Britain has campaigned to improve such facilities and had a few new sites registered with the Environmental Agency for dispersion of ashes,” said HFB President Trupti Patel.The group is now working on compiling a register of all such approved sites around the UK for easier access to community groups.

02-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM gives land use approvals to certain industries||To further boost industrial activity in the state, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday gave approval for Change of Land Use (CLU) for certain categories of industries.The CLU will be applicable to green or non-polluting industries and ‘orange’ category industries at a distance of 100 metres and 250 metres, respectively, from Lal Lakir or nearby Abadi (minimum 50 pucca houses) on minimum 6 Karam (30-33 feet) approach road, under the policy of permitting industrial activity in agricultural zone of master plans, an official statement said.“Lal Lakir” refers to land that is part of the village “abaadi” (habitation) and is used for non-agriculture purposes only.The Chief Minister also asked the Town and Country Planning department to relook the ‘red’ category industry, directing it to earmark separate zones for such industry in all the master plans.He further accorded special permission for expansion of the medical oxygen manufacturing plant in Mohali and also asked the Town and Country Planning department to extend liberal support to all such plants in the state to boost manufacturing of medical oxygen.Chairing the 42nd meeting of the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Board through video conferencing, the Chief Minister, who is also its Chairman, said all green, red and orange industrial units must conform to the prescribed norms of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) with zero discharge, or must have consent of potential users for use of treated water.In another decision, the Chief Minister also gave the nod to allow industries in mixed land use zones along highways at a distance of 4 km from corporation limits of Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar, 3 km from other corporation towns and Class-A towns and 2 km from other towns.The decision would go a long way in providing maximum area across the state to promote industrial activity, the statement said.Amarinder Singh also okayed the Board’s proposal for industrial parks in sector 101 and 103 to be developed by both private developers as well as GMADA in SAS Nagar (Mohali) to ensure holistic development of these sectors, with focus on futuristic planning.He permitted the board to allow residential colony in 50 acres in Mullanpur, near here, thereby reducing the minimum area requirement from 100 to 50 acres without disturbing the density norms. This amendment would be instrumental in ensuring proper utilization of left out pockets to provide housing facilities in the upcoming area.

02-08-2021||New Delhi||Kisan Sansad passes resolution against Electricity Amendment Bill||Agitating farmers’ ‘Kisan Sansad’ on Monday passed a resolution against the ‘Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 or 2021’ and demanded that it should be withdrawn immediately.The parallel ‘Parliament session” also “directed” the Government “not to table this Bill or any other Bill containing similar provisions in this or subsequent sessions of the Parliament”. “Electricity being a basic resource for rural production and processing including by farmers, cottage industries, for health, education, and other civic services, the policy should be to provide free, high quality, regular supply of electricity, to enable rural people and farmers to benefit from the same,” it said, following deliberations on the policy directions and perspectives driving the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020, and the specific provisions of the Bill.A statement issued by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha read: “Whereas Electricity Amendment Bill 2021 has not been put out into the public domain by the Government and having received an assurance from the Government delegation on 30th December 2020 that the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 will be withdrawn as per the demands put forth by our farmers’ movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the House notes with shock and dismay that the Government has reneged on its promise of not tabling this or similar Bill whereas such a Bill is listed for Business in the monsoon session”.“Electricity as a form of energy is a national resource and should be seen as a basic entitlement of all especially the poor and marginalised. The Bill will impact tariff on all activities in rural areas by farmers, whether it is shops or dairy farming or flour grinders or other small enterprises, as they would get exposed to commercial charges,” the statement said.“Such privatisation would make electricity—which is a basic service that should be accessible to all citizens—costlier for ordinary consumers, and that the quality of supply to rural areas and for agricultural sector could become worse with the reforms embedded in the Amendment Bill.”“Farmers will end up paying large bills or face disconnection by the DISCOMS, and that in the new regime, delays, and arrears will be run up against farmers and other ordinary consumers; and all of this will be a death knell to crores of farmers who are dependent on groundwater for irrigation,” the statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kisan-sansad-passes-resolution-against-electricity-amendment-bill-291858

Now, it not only wants to regain the lost ground but is also keen to hold on to the Lok Sabha seat, which in all likelihood will fall vacant once Sukhbir jumps into the Assembly poll arena.The Akalis have roped in several Congress heavyweights to counter the BJP, which enjoys considerable clout in Ferozepur Urban, Fazilka and Abohar Assembly segments.Already, five former Congress MLAs and ex-ministers have joined the Akali Dal.

Apart from that Rs 2.72 crore was imposed as the penalty for power theft.The revelation was made after the losses and power violations during the peak of the summer season were assessed. Jasbir Singh, Chief Engineer, Enforcement Wing, said in June alone, officials of the enforcement wing checked around 42,835 connections. During the inspection, 6,041 violations were detected. Collectively, as per the assessment, the violations caused a revenue loss of over Rs 15 crore to the department due to different types of violations.Notably, due to the rise in mercury and paddy cultivation season, the power consumption remained highest this year, touching over 13,000 KV daily supply in the Jalandhar circle. The promised eight-hour power supply to cultivate paddy also remained a distant dream for farmers, causing a shortage of water in the fields. PSPCL officials said the power cuts were imposed across the state owing to a sudden increase in the load.Jasbir Singh also said among the violations, around 683 cases of power theft were also reported for which an amount of Rs 2.72 crore was imposed as penalty to the offenders. “Besides, last month, an amount of Rs 5.38 crore was also recovered from the violators,” added the Chief Engineer.As per the directions of the Chief Managing Director (CMD), PSPCL, A Venu Prasad, the enforcement wing conducted a large number of raids to curb the theft of electricity and revenue loss.Meanhile, the PSPCL has appealed all consumers to help the corporation control the menace of electricity theft by providing information about it . The feedback about theft of electricity can be provided on WhatsApp number 96461-75770.

Later, Warring told them he had twice visited Delhi borders with his family to support the stir. “I have repeatedly said the three farm laws were anti-farmers and these should be repealed immediately. The state government has supported the farmers at every step. Now, the present Congress government is left with just six months and please let me work for the welfare of area,” Warring appealed to the protesting farmers.BKU (Sidhupur) leader Nanak Singh, who was leading the protest, said, “We just asked him to stop his public events.

No woman police official was allegedly attached with the 16-year-old victim for the 17-km late-night journey from Chamkaur Sahib to Ropar.The incident came to light when the girl told about it to Child Line team member Sunita Bawa yesterday.Bawa said the girl, who had been missing from her home for the past few months, was rescued from one Jabbar Singh on July 30 in Mohali district. Jabbar has been booked under the POCSO Act.“The police brought the girl to Ropar at 10.46 pm. To make her feel comfortable, I took her to my house,” Bawa said. “The girl was restless throughout the night. During her counselling in the morning, she narrated her ordeal,” she added.“The victim said she was brought to Ropar by four policemen and two of them, who were sitting in the rear seat along with her, molested her on the way,” Bawa said. The girl said a woman cop joined them at Ropar before she was brought to the Child Line office, she added.On July 31, the girl’s statement was recorded in front of a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the IPC.Child Welfare Committee member Kuldip Chand also recorded the girl’s statement after which she was handed over to her parents.

The decision has been taken on the lines of a similar decision taken by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Sources in the government said the issue had been a bone of contention between the Local Government and the Industries Department, as it was claimed that project approval by the Bureau caused revenue losses and there was no check on technical aspects. The issue had also been raised in Cabinet meetings. Last year, the CM had taken a serious note of a former Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), Local Government, arbitrarily withdrawing concurrent powers vested with the officials in the Bureau for single-window clearance to change of land use (CLU), layout and building plans of projects. The CM had pointed out that the power was withdrawn by the Local Bodies Department, without consulting him. But recently, the CM restored the powers to the Local Government after the issue was reportedly taken up by Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra.As per new instructions, the Bureau has been left with power to approve industrial projects up to 50 acres and institutional projects up to 25 acres in master plans areas, areas outside master plan and areas within local planning areas (LPA).Investment Bureau’s role curtailed||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-singh-restores-powers-of-local-government-department-291534

To give a legal shape to the regularisation in services of such a huge number of employees, “The Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill” has been prepared to be tabled in the next session of the Vidhan Sabha, scheduled for September.A Cabinet sub-committee, with Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, Rural Development Minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi as members, has accepted the final proposal of the Officers’ Committee made for the purpose.The committee has recommended that the Cabinet give its consent to the Bill. The government has already worked out the financial implications of regularising the services of the employees, which will entail an expenditure of Rs 1,846.87 crore.Only employees having completed 10 years of service will be considered for regularisation. The outsourced employees (those who work for the government but are employees of companies who have been outsourced work) will not be considered in this scheme.A similar Act was passed in December 2016, just before the 2017 elections to the Assembly. However, it could not be implemented. The Congress had then promised to regularise the services of these employees in its election manifesto of 2017. Sources told The Tribune regularisation of employees will be done only against the sanctioned posts in various government departments and in boards and corporations and PSUs.However, those working on posts created in some projects and schemes of central government, World Bank and other such agencies, will not be considered for regularisation.Ashish Julaha, secretary general, Contract Employees Action Committee, Punjab, which has been spearheading the protests, said he was apprehensive about the number of persons whose services would be regularised.Panel accepts proposal May benefit only 10,000: UnionWe are apprehensive about the number. If only staff with 10 years of service are to be considered and only sanctioned posts will be filled, the number may be less than 10,000. — Ashish Julaha, contract employees action committee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-set-to-regularise-66k-staff-291541

The Indian hockey team will figure in an Olympics semifinal for the first time in 49 years.The quest for a semifinal spot, dating back to 1976, has ended. The Indian men beat Great Britain 3-1 in the quarterfinals in Tokyo on Sunday, fighting back waves upon waves of attacks from the British in the final quarter, to enter the semifinals of the Olympics for the first time since 1972.Journey since ’72India last reached semifinals in 1972, when they ended up with a bronze medal. The slide started four years later in Montreal, when hockey made the move from grass to astroturfThe Indians must next beat world champions Belgium in the semifinals on Tuesday to ensure a medal for themselves. The second semifinal will be played between Australia and Germany the same evening. After leading Great Britain 2-0 until nearly the end of the third quarter, India were made to fight hard to keep their lead. The frayed nerves in the Indian camp were finally settled in the 57th minute, when Jalandhar lad Hardik Singh scored on a counterattack to restore his team’s two-goal advantage with less than three minutes to go.India at OlympicsTwo other fellow Punjabis, Dilpreet Singh and Gurjant Singh, had scored a goal each in the first two quarters to give India a 2-0 lead. As Great Britain attacked back in desperation, Sam Ward scored in the last minute of the third quarter, opening the door slightly against the Indians — before Hardik slammed it shut.India goalkeeper PR Sreejesh stood strong in the goal in the latter half of the match, making several fine saves to keep his team’s lead. Hardik’s goal was the 16th by a player from Punjab in Tokyo, out of the total 19 scored by India.After Great Britain started off better, getting their first penalty corner as early as the third minute, the Indians settled into a rhythm and surged ahead in the seventh minute when Dilpreet sent the ball into the goal through the pads of the British goalkeeper Oliver Payne. Simranjeet Singh had created the chance by snatching the ball from a British defender and passing it through.India doubled the lead early in the second quarter when Hardik intercepted a pass just outside the British D and sent the ball to Gurjant, who collected the ball, turned around and sent it into the goal between Payne’s pads.Gurjant had an opportunity to make it 3-0 in the 35th minute, but his reverse-hit was blocked by Payne.India last reached the semifinals of the Olympics back in 1972, when they ended up with a bronze medal. The slide started four years later in Montreal, when hockey made the move from grass to astroturf — and India failed to make it to the semifinals for the first time ever.India’s hard-luck story for an Olympics semis spot started in 1976 — they were tied with Australia for the second spot in Group A, but Australia went into the semis after winning their playoff match. Two legends, Ric Charlesworth and Surjit Singh, had scored in regular time in this playoff game, won 5-4 by Australia on penalties. The man to miss India’s penalty was Ajit Singh, 1972 bronze winner and father of Gagan Ajit Singh, who represented India twice in the Olympics (2000, 2004).India did win gold in 1980 at Moscow, but there were no semifinals in that tournament: Only six teams were in the hockey fray because of the US-led boycott of the Olympics in Moscow over USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan the previous year. India won gold after beating Spain — one of five western European countries participating in Moscow — in the final after the round-robin stage.India declined rapidly after that. West Germany pipped India to the semis in 1984 on goal difference. India needed a draw in their last group match in 1988 to make it to the semis but lost 0-3 to Great Britain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/india-in-mens-hockey-olympic-semifinal-after-49-years-291582

A significant number of these was related to Covid-19. The fact came to the fore in the latest report prepared by the state government.The report, prepared on the basis of the Civil Registration System, suggested “excess” deaths could be 2.8 times the reported Covid deaths. However, the state said the ratio was lower in comparison to other states from where data had been reported in the media.On the basis of the average number of deaths registered during 2016 to 2019, 2,81,517 fatalities were expected between March 2020 and June 2021. However, the registered deaths in Punjab during the period stood at 3,34,173, pointing to 52,656 “excess” fatalities, indicating a 18.7% rise during the pandemic months.Officially, the state has reported 16,052 Covid-related deaths between March 2020 and June 2021. Another important fact that established that a significant number of the “excess” deaths was due to Covid was the monthly trend of deaths registered in the Civil Registration System of Punjab.A jump was seen from May to December 2020, with an even sharper rise from March to May, 2021. These were the months when people were dying in large numbers due to Covid. About 30.5% of these deaths had been reported among confirmed Covid cases in Punjab. One reason for the low percentage of Covid deaths in Punjab could be attributed to immediate or delayed mortality from undocumented Covid-19 or non-Covid deaths secondary to the pandemic, such as from delayed care or behavioural health crises, the report stated.“Covid death reporting was better in Punjab compared to other states, except Kerala from where data has been reported in the media.
