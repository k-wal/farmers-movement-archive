20-08-2021||Anandpur Sahib||Punjab CM launches Rs 520 crore debt relief scheme for 2.85 lakh farm labourers & landless farmers||Asserting his continued support to the farmers agitating against the three black farm laws, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday launched a Rs 520 crore debt relief scheme for 2.85 lakh farm labourers and landless farmers.‚ÄúI hope and wish a day will come when India will be free from poverty, which Rajiv Gandhi dreamed about,‚Äù said the chief minister, dedicating the important scheme to the state on the 77th birth anniversary of his close friend.Noting that Rajiv was a close friend, Capt Amarinder said the former prime minister used to always ask when the day will come when people will have their own houses to live and India would be free from poverty.He, therefore, thought it apt to launch this scheme on the birth anniversary of Rajiv, said the chief minister, adding that the Congress had been fighting for the people for the last 130 years.The chief minister said his government had decided to waive off loans amounting to Rs 520 crores of farm labour and landless farmers with respect to the principal amount against their cooperative loans as on July 31, 2017, and simple interest at 7% p.a. on the above amount till 6th March, 2019.It is noteworthy that the state government had earlier waived off Rs 4700 crore worth of loans (up to Rs 2 lakh of crop loan each) for 5.85 lakh small and marginal famers.Declaring that his ‚Äúheart is with the farmers who are protesting at the Delhi borders‚Äù, the chief minister made it clear that he does not agree with the stand taken by the Central government, who are not listening to the farmers.‚ÄúWe have amended the Constitution 127 times, so why are we not doing it now? Why is the Government of India standing on prestige on the issue of the farm laws,‚Äù he asked, adding that he had categorically urged the prime minister and the Union home minister to ‚Äúrepeal the legislations‚Äù.The chief minister said he had been asked to stop Punjab farmers from going to Delhi ‚Äúbut I never stopped as everyone has the right to protest in the national capital; protest is a democratic right‚Äù.‚ÄúThese small farmers are not fighting for themselves but for their coming generations,‚Äù he said, questioning why the Centre could not see the pain of the protesting farmers.These farmers are mostly those who own an average of 2.5 acres of land, he pointed out, recalling that during a visit to Poland long back he had seen that country increasing the land ceiling from the existing 40 acres to 100 acres as families could not feed themselves with such small land holdings.‚ÄúSo you can imagine what will happen to those who have just 2.5 acres,‚Äù he remarked, asking ‚Äúhow will they feed their families if the new laws are imposed on them?‚ÄùPointing out that around 400 farmers had died, he said his government was giving Rs 5 lakh to the families of the state‚Äôs farmers who had lost their jobs.In addition, they were being given jobs, and 200 had already got their appointment letters, he said, adding that the Centre need to protect the MSP and the market system as well as the age-old relationship between the farmers and the Aarhtiyas in the interest of the nation.In a token gesture to launch the scheme, the chief minister personally handed over cheques to 21 farm labourers and landless labourers, with ministers and MLAs set to disburse the cheques to all others over the next few days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-launches-rs-520-crore-debt-relief-scheme-for-2-85-lakh-farm-labourers-landless-farmers-299856

Tough time for commuters?We will try to ensure that the commuters face the least harassment. We have ensured a proper deployment of staff to guide the commuters on the alternate routes and ensure smooth flow of traffic. ‚Äî Jagmohan Singh, DCP (law and order)The call for bandh had been announced yesterday by the Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee over the issue of pending dues of sugarcane from the mills and no enhancement in the State Agreed Price (SAP) of sugarcane for the past four years. Though the state government announced to hike the SAP by Rs 15 per quintal today, it has further agitated the farmers.‚ÄúThe government has played a cruel joke with us. By announcing a meagre Rs 15 per quintal hike, they have ridiculed us. The state government did not have any one of us for representation during finalising this amount. We were expecting the SAP on sugarcane to be hiked to Rs 370 from the existing price of Rs 295 to 310 (varying according to variety). Haryana is already offering Rs 358 per quintal,‚Äù fumed Manjit Rai, president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Doaba).He added: ‚ÄúWe will now have an intensified protest. We had plans to block only the road, but now we will also block the rail passage. Also, all 32 farmer unions of Punjab have offered us support. Our protest tomorrow at the site may have more than 30K farmers and it will go on indefinitely till all our demands are met to our satisfaction. We will also have our meeting at the site tomorrow morning and we may jam the entire state‚Äù.The Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee chooses the site at Dhannowali strategically as the NH and the railway crossing here are very close by and both the dharnas can be managed simultaneously. In the past few years, whenever the farmers announce to hold a protest here, the response remains massive and the dharna goes on for hours and even gets extended to the next day.Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said the police authorities had been directed to make proper security arrangements. The city police have planned diversions to ensure that the public does not suffer much. The diversions have been planned via Pathankot Chowk to Rama Mandi, from Partappura side for those coming via Nakodar Chowk, and via Cantt Road to Phagwara.DCP (law and order) Jagmohan Singh said: ‚ÄúWe will try to ensure that the commuters face the least harassment. We have ensured a proper deployment of staff to guide the commuters on the alternate routes and ensure smooth flow of traffic.‚ÄùAbout the plans of the farmers to block rail traffic too, he said: ‚ÄúIt will be too early to comment on that.

20-08-2021||A man sailing on two boats||A party with two engines||Former MLA Ashwani Shekhri, a senior Congress leader from Gurdaspur, who is known for his alliance with Capt Amarinder Singh, expressed satisfaction. Shekhri, who is a chairman of Punjab Health Systems Corporation, was in Patti to lay a foundation stone of a Mother-Child Ward at the Civil Hospital recently. Harminder Singh Gill, who represents the Patti constituency, managed the event. While addressing the gathering, Gill said we (Congressmen) we are a train with two engines. ‚ÄúOurs win is sure in the 2022 Assembly elections and we need not worry,‚Äù said Shekhri. A person in the gathering said what if the two engines pull the train in diffirent direction, which is the actual ground situation. Gill had faced this type of situation during the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections when he contested from Khadoor Sahib.In 2013, the AICC had appointed Partap Singh Bajwa as chief of the PPCC, and Capt Amarinder had opposed him. Gill left the Capt‚Äôs camp and joined Bajwa. In 2014, the Congress had appointed Capt Amarinder as PPCC president, who decided to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Amritsar. He assured Gill to accompany his cavalcade at the time of filing his nomination papers. Gill waited for hours with his supportes for Capt Amarinder, but he never showed up. At the end, Gill went on to file his nomination with a handful of supporters. This happens with a person who sails in two boats and similar is the situation this time for Congress MLAs.A man of rare qualitiesDr SS Lauhuka is among a few persons who is known across the region due to his public welfare activities. He has been elected as a councillor thrice in Tarn Taran. He is a parton of the Citizen Council , Tarn Taran. This social organisation has been solemnising mass marriages since 1990 every year. He is district chief of the All India Tonkkashtrya Sabha and also of the District Consumers Welfare Forum, which protects the interests of consumers.The district administration had nominated him as the member of certain committees with the police welfare. All these activities are his hobby. He is closely associated with LIC and was recently honoured with gold medal by the the latter for his social services. He always remain ready to help the needy, especially school students and provides them stationery.Endless wait for justiceThe custodial death of Pardeep Singh may be considered to be the rare of the rarest cases in the history of Indian judiciary. Pardeep Singh, a student of Class IX, was beaten to death by Goindwal Sahib police in the custody on December 22, 2001. The police alleged that he was ‚Äòarrested‚Äô with intoxicanting tablets and he died during interrogation. After facing resentment from residents, the police registered a case against cops for custodial death. Later, the case was cancelled for lack of ‚Äòevidence‚Äô and other loopholes. Joginder Kaur, mother of Pardeep, who has no source of income, came out on the road and filed a complaint in the court challenging the police theory. A social organisation ‚ÄòPardeep Katal Kand Action Committee‚Äô was formed with efforts of a Tarn Taran-based social worker, which helped Joginder. After years of hearings, the court had awarded 10-year jail term to Assistant Sub-Inspector Harbhajan Singh. Despite being declared a Proclaimed Offender (PO), Harbhajan, not just went on performing his police duty, but was also promoted as a Sub-Inspector by the Police Department. He retired with all the pension benefits. The voice of the Pardeep Katal Kand Action Committee went unheard. The committee had been demanding compensation for the family of the victim as per the orders of the court and locate the policemen who had been helping the PO all this while. The committee had written to the Deputy Commissioner regarding the same and the latter asked the Khadoor Sahib SDM Khadoor to take necessary action on June 12, 2019. The SDM prepared a report after more than one year and replied to the DC on July 10, 2020 expressing their inability to take action against the erring official. It‚Äôs yet to be seen how much more time it will take to deliver the justice to aggrieved family.Contributed by Gurbaxpuri||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-party-with-two-engines-299687

Around 660 lakh quintals of sugarcane would be crushed by mills.With the increase in sugarcane rates, state farmers will get a higher benefit of Rs 230 crore against the previous year. Besides, on the demand of the Punjab cane growers, the rate of variety Co-0238 would also be purchased at Rs 325 per quintal.Chairing a meeting of the Sugarcane Control Board here through video conferencing, the Chief Minister constituted a Cane Development Group, headed by Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa with Rana Sugars CMD Rana Gurjit Singh, Punjab State Farmers‚Äô Commission Chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar, Cane Commissioner Gurvinder Singh and PAU Sugar Research Centre, Kapurthala, Director Dr Gulzar Singh as members.The group has been mandated to find ways and means to enhance the production of sugarcane and promote advanced cultivation technologies to ensure an improvement in sugar recovery.The Chief Minister asked the Agriculture Department to work closely with farmers to bring more area under cane cultivation to improve the viability of mills, besides giving a push to state government‚Äôs ambitious programme of crop diversification.On his part, Randhawa emphasised the need for modernising cooperative sugar mills to reduce the cost of production and allow cane growers to fetch better remunerative prices. The state has as many as 16 sugar mills, of which nine are in the cooperative sector. The cane crushing capacity of these mills is 56,000 tonne per day. If run at full capacity, the mills can crush sugarcane from an area of 125 lakh hectares, whereas the present area is 0.93 lakh hectares.The crop has the potential to generate high number of job in the rural areas, both in harvesting and processing.The meeting was attended ACS Development Anirudh Tewari, Principal Secretary KAP Sinha, RCS Vikas Garg, Commissioner Agriculture Balwinder Singh Sidhu, Director Agriculture Sukhdev Singh Sidhu, Nahar Industrial Enterprises CMD Amloh Kamal Oswal, besides representatives of various cane growers‚Äô associations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cane-sap-up-by-rs-15-quintal-in-punjab-299556

Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh is writing a DO letter to the Prime Minister on the issue, raising concerns of the state on the new stringent norms for procurement.The Centre has proposed that foreign matter allowed in paddy be reduced from 2 per cent to one per cent; percentage of damaged/discoloured grains be reduced from 5 per cent to 3 per cent and moisture content from 17 per cent to 16 per cent.Refraction in rice to be accepted from the miller has been reduced to 20 per cent from earlier 25 per cent in raw and to 12 per cent from 16 per cent in parboiled rice.The limit of damaged grains has been reduced by one per cent, which means rice which has more than 2 per cent (in raw and 3 per cent in parboiled) damaged grains will not be accepted. The red grains will no longer be allowed (earlier it was 3 per cent) and grains having moisture content of over 14 per cent (till now it was 15 per cent) will not be allowed.In paddy, crop having over 16 per cent moisture cannot be purchased (current limit is 17 per cent).
