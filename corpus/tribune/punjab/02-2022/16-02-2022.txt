16-02-2022||Ludhiana||Something may be true in what Ashwani Kumar said in his resignation letter: Manish Tewari||Congress MP Manish Tewari on Wednesday said there may be some truth in what former Union law minister Ashwani Kumar wrote in his resignation letter to party president Sonia Gandhi and the same concerns have been raised by G23 leaders in 2020.Kumar on Tuesday resigned from the Congress after a 46-year association, saying he can best serve national causes outside the party fold.Tewari was a part of the G-23, a group of dissenting Congress leaders who have demanded organisational overhaul.The Anandpur Sahib MP said the resignation of Kumar “was a matter of great concern for most of us”.“He is a good person, a very good lawyer who has excellent arguments. Something may be true in what he has said in his resignation letter. These concerns were brought to the notice of the party high command by the G23 group in 2020. But his eye is on a Rajya Sabha seat,” Tewari said.He lashed out at former Congress state unit chief Sunil Jakhar and said those raking up the Hindu-Sikh issue in Punjab are playing in the hands of Pakistan’s ISI.At a press conference here, Tewari said the people of the state have never resorted to sectarian politics and they believe in “Punjab, Punjabi and Punjabiyat”.“But what has he (Jakhar) done for the Hindus so far,” Tewari asked and claimed that he was the only elected Hindu MP from Ludhiana since 1952 and even in 2019 he had been elected from Sri Anandpur Sahib, the birthplace of Khalsa.Expressing his pride in being a Punjabi, Tewari said he had never come across anyone who would resort to sectarian politics “like those who are raking up the Hindu-Sikh issue for their own vested interest”.He, however, exuded confidence that the Congress will return to power in Punjab with a thumping majority. Tewari said he has been campaigning for his party candidates in various assembly segments of the Anandpur Sahib parliamentary constituency.Early this month, Jakhar had claimed that 42 MLAs wanted him to be the chief minister of the state after the unceremonious exit of Amarinder Singh last year.Jakhar was among the frontrunners for the chief ministerial post. But the Congress preferred Charanjit Singh Channi, who became the first chief minister of Punjab from the Scheduled Caste community.Following this, the AAP accused the Congress of doing politics of caste and religion while the BJP had questioned the “selective secularism” of the grand old party by “refusing” to make Jakhar the chief minister “because of his religion”.To another question, Tewari said, there should be no politics on turban. “Our turban is too sacred for us to be dragged into politics as it is our honour and dignity”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/something-may-be-true-in-what-ashwani-kumar-said-in-his-resignation-letter-manish-tewari-370455

The collision was so powerful that Sidhu's side airbag also exploded.The Kharkhoda police have registered a case against the truck driver allegedly for rash and negligent driving under Sections 279 and 304 of the IPC on the complaint of Mandeep Singh Sidhu, brother of Deep Sidhu whose original name was Sandeep Singh Sidhu.Read also:Girl with Deep Sidhu in SUV tells police truck driver ahead was 'speeding rashly' and applied sudden breaksDeep Sidhu cremated amid pro-Khalistan slogans in Ludhiana; people attend last rites in large numbersThe police handed over the body of the deceased after the autopsy conducted by a board of three medical officers at the civil hospital here and video recording was made of the process. The cremation was held at Threeke village in Ludhiana on Wednesday evening.Sonepat SP Rahul Sharma said the crime team visited the accident spot at night and recreated the accident scene on Wednesday morning.“As we have discussed with the doctors who conducted the autopsy, talked to co-passenger Reena Rai and consulted primary investigation reports of the team, the case, so far, seems to be of rash and negligent driving,” he said.The driver side of Sidhu’s vehicle was badly damaged after hitting the rear of the truck. The primary investigations revealed that the truck was moving at the time of the accident, the SP said.The driver and owner of the truck have been identified and the driver would be arrested soon, he added.A partially used liquor bottle was recovered from Sidhu’s vehicle, the SP said. Blood samples of the deceased were taken. Viscera and blood samples would be sent to forensic laboratory, he added.“It can’t be concluded right now whether Deep Sidhu was drunk or not. We can say anything on this after receiving the FSL reports of viscera and blood samples of the deceased,” the SP maintained.SP Sharma further said Deep Sidhu along with his friend Reena Rai in a white Scorpio vehicle entered KMP expressway from Badli toll plaza at around 7.15 pm and the CCTV footage is available.He said Reena was admitted to a hospital in Delhi. She had come to India from USA on February 13. “Our team was in Delhi to record her statement,” the SP added.Inspector Jaspal Singh, SHO, Kharkhoda, said as per the postmortem report the main cause of death was deep head injury. As per the primary investigation, the vehicle airbag on Sidhu’s side was opened but it exploded due to strong collision, while the airbag saved the life of the co-passenger, he said.Two teams have been sent to arrest the accused truck driver, who was from Mewat, the SHO added.Earlier, the family members and scores of Sidhu’s followers arrived at the civil hospital to receive his body. Heavy police force was deployed at the hospital. The followers of the Deep Sidhu raised slogans and showered flowers on the ambulance in which the body was taken away after the autopsy. #deep sidhu||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/deep-sidhus-accident-head-injury-main-cause-of-death-airbag-burst-due-to-collision-370445

I told him he shouldn’t say that because Referendum 2020 was coming up. Then he said, ‘So what? Then I’ll be the prime minister of an independent nation’.”Surjewala said at a press conference that these were “shocking revelations” and demanded an explanation from Kejriwal.

16-02-2022||Chandigarh||Priyanka by his side, Channi says ‘won’t let UP, Bihar, Delhi ‘de bhaiye’ enter Punjab’; row erupts||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi has courted controversy during a poll rally by asking people not to let the “bhaiyas” of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi enter the state, a remark apparently aimed at AAP leaders.The word “bhaiyas” in reference to people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is generally considered offensive.In a video circulating on social media, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was seen beside Channi clapping when he made the remarks during a roadshow in Rupnagar.“Priyanka Gandhi is the daughter-in-law of Punjab. Will not let the ‘Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi de bhaiye’, who have come here to rule, enter the state,” the incumbent chief minister of Punjab said.His remark was met with criticism by the Aam Aadmi Party.AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal termed his Punjab counterpart’s comments “very shameful”.“We strongly condemn the wrong comments made against any individual or any particular community,” he replied when asked during a press conference to comment on Channi’s remark.Kejriwal added that Channi had earlier taunted him over his skin complexion, calling him ‘kala (dark)’. When Bhagwant Mann said Priyanka Gandhi also belongs to Uttar Pradesh, Kejriwal said she too is then a “bhaiya”.BJP leader Tejasvi Surya shared the video of Channi on Twitter and targeted Priyanka Gandhi Vadra over this.“Priyanka Vadra Ji calls herself a daughter of Uttar Pradesh when she visits the state and claps when people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are insulted in Punjab. This is her double character and face as well,” Surya said. #punjab elections 2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/priyanka-by-his-side-channi-says-wont-let-up-bihar-delhi-de-bhaiye-enter-punjab-row-erupts-kejriwal-terms-punjab-cms-remarks-as-very-shameful-bjp-targets-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-chandiga-370438

16-02-2022||Praful Chander Nagpal||IPL: Fazilka’s ‘Narine Jalalabadiya’ ready to soar||Fazilka, February 15Two days after Ramesh Kumar, aka ‘Narine Jalalabadiya’, was picked up by the IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders, he’s excited. “I’m on my way to Mumbai in an aeroplane,” says the 23-year-old, who is yet to play any recognised representative cricket and was bought by KKR on the basis of online videos and recommendations from Punjab veteran Gurkeerat Mann.After Shubman Gill, Ramesh has made the sleepy border town of Jalalabad in Fazilka district proud as he became the second player from the region to be bought in the IPL mega auction.Ramesh’s story is quite amazing. Belonging to the very poor Sansi community of Rajasthan, he started playing the game at age 16, facing opposition from his father who thought “cricket is a game of affluent people”.His father Manga Ram, who cannot read or write, is a cobbler and shoe-polisher in Jalalabad, and mother Narmo Devi is an itinerant vendor who sells bangles in different villages, ground around on foot. The two have been working hard to make both ends meet and raise their three sons.During the IPL auction, Ramesh was listed as a batter and only a handful of people knew about who he was — those in the KKR camp. He’s a left-arm spinner and can turn the ball both ways. “I can bowl six different deliveries with the same action in an over,” says Ramesh. This ability became his ticket to the IPL, the richest cricket league in the world.He started aping West Indies spinner Sunil Narine after watching him on TV, but he played with the soft ball in tennis-ball cricket tournaments in Punjab and then across India.To leatherHis Instagram handle has the name ‘Narine’ because after someone posted a video of him bowling online with the caption ‘Narine Jalalabadiya’, the name stuck. Ramesh says that a video of his bowling action was sent by a friend to Mann. Mann liked what he saw and shared it with Abhishek Nayar, the KKR assistant coach.Last year Mann called Ramesh to Punjab’s Ranji Trophy nets and found that the tennis-ball specialist could bowl well with the leather ball, too.“Mann paaji and Nayar sir were instrumental in taking me to this level,” says Ramesh.Ramesh bagged 11 wickets in three matches in the JP Atray Tournament, and 12 wickets in four matches for Kapurthala in the Katoch Shield.Nayar then called Ramesh to the KKR trials last month, and Mann helped him put his name up for the IPL auction with a base price of Rs 20 lakh, the lowest category. His name came up in the final stage of the auction on Sunday, and he was snapped up by KKR.‘500 a day’He recalls the time he travelled for tennis-ball tournaments, making Rs 500-1000 a day. “You must have seen my videos (on YouTube) paaji. I am basically a tennis-ball player. Since I could turn the ball away and turn back in, people advised me to play with a leather ball. They would say ‘you might make it big’,” he says. “But I didn’t have the support that I needed to pursue the game professionally. I used to play the odd leather-ball game but mainly it was all tennis-ball cricket.”“I used to bowl with a Cosco ball (used in tennis), which is very light. The leather ball is much heavier and it is harder to make it turn but I am slowly getting better. I am sure the IPL stint will help my game in a big way,” he adds.“It started with me playing all across Punjab. When I performed I got calls from other states too. Sometimes I made 500 rupees in a day, sometimes it was 1,000. It was just about enough to run the house and manage my travel expenses,” he says. Ramesh wants his parents to stop working now. “They have finally agreed to not work anymore. I never wanted them to do this work in the first place but it had to be done out of necessity,” Ramesh says.Tough life“I migrated from neighbouring Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan in search of livelihood around three decades ago,” says Manga Ram, Ramesh’s father. “I never knew luck would shine on me in such a way that my eldest son would be picked up for the IPL and bring fame to my family, which struggled to earn two square meals.”Manga Ram used to advise his son not to select cricket as his career. “I thought it was a game of affluent people,” he says. “But now he can make a career in cricket and has proved me wrong.” — With agency inputs #Cricket #IPL||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/fazilkas-narine-ready-to-soar-370328

He said “only Congress workers and leaders” would be adjusted against hundreds of posts in boards and corporations. “I will ask the new CM and Punjab affairs incharge to ensure party workers, the backbone of the Congress, are adjusted,” he said.Speaking at an election rally in support of sitting Rajpura MLA Hardial Singh Kamboj today, he said if anyone wanted to hear lies, they should listen to speeches of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Akali leader Sukhbir Singh Badal.“When I talked about the problem of drugs during my visit in 2013, they (BJP, SAD and AAP) did not believe. They said the problem did not exist. Modi now says mothers in Punjab will not tolerate deaths due to drugs,” he said.“I raised questions over lack of preparedness for Covid-19 and the same AAP and BJP mocked me. This led to thousands of deaths across the country due to lack of infrastructure. The mohalla clinics being widely publicised by Arvind Kejriwal suddenly vanished,” said Rahul, terming the SAD, BJP and AAP different sides of the same coin.Accusing former CM Capt Amarinder Singh of playing into the hands of the private companies, Rahul alleged despite being asked to slash power prices, he sided with private thermal companies. “Once I got to know Capt Amarinder is hand in gloves with the BJP-led central government, we replaced him with a CM who understands the pulse of the common man,” he said.Addressing a rally in Mansa, Rahul said the party would break the monopoly in bus, cable and mining businesses by providing bus permits to the youth, lowering cables rates to Rs 200 per month and fixing the rate of sand at Rs 1,200 per trolley.Targeting PM Modi, he said fuel prices had been on the rise despite a drop in the international market rates. Only a handful of industrialists were benefitting from it, he claimed as he questioned the Centre for not lowering the prices when CM Charanjit Channi had slashed these by Rs 10 on petrol and Rs 5 on diesel. Slamming the AAP, he said those seeking vote saying ‘ek mauka do’ would destroy Punjab. #rahul gandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cong-govt-will-end-monopoly-in-transport-cable-mining-rahul-370171

At Ropar, Channi said party nominee Barinder Singh Dhillon would also be in his new Cabinet.In her address, Priyanka claimed AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal used to be an RSS member, like PM Narendra Modi, and both were luring people citing the development models of Delhi and Gujarat even as nothing was visible at both places. Priyanka reiterated she was the daughter-in-law of Punjab and that Punjabi blood ran in the veins of her children.Appreciating CM Channi’s works, she said he had shown grit by taking bold decisions for the development of the state in his 111-day tenure. Without naming anyone, Channi said Punjabis should come together and oppose the “entry of those from UP, Bihar and Delhi who have come to rule in Punjab”.In Amritsar, Priyanka held a roadshow along with PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sunil Dutti, the Congress candidates from Amritsar East and North constituencies, respectively.She was received by Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu, party supporters and workers. Insiders say the star campaigner’s presence had been necessitated in both constituencies where the stakes are high.

When this issue became politically sensitive, they failed to resolve it and gave contrary statements in Punjab, Haryana, Centre and in courts,” Kejriwal asserted, while mocking SAD president Sukhbir Badal for accusing him of moving the Supreme Court for seeking Punjab river waters for Delhi.Blaming the BJP and Congress for “compromising” with the country’s politics, the Delhi CM said, “There should be no politics on national and internal security issues.” He assured a fair and independent probe into the sacrilege incidents. — TNSLEADERSPEAKPM’s remarks on Sukhbir avoidableSukhbir was made Deputy CM after due consultation with the BJP leadership.

Reacting on the issues, Mohit says their government had ensured ample funds for the constituency and his father was instrumental in getting many projects. One of the youngest politicians in the polls, Mohit is fighting on the Congress ticket from Patiala Rural, where his father is the sitting MLA. Thirtyone-year-old Mohit says he always wanted to carry forward his father’s dream of nurturing his constituency.AAP’s Dr Balbir says he will always remain the common man’s leader, rather than a politician. “Patiala Rural people will dethrone the Congress. When I visit the villages and urban areas, people tell me how they have felt ignored for over a decade. They are ready to teach a lesson to the traditional parties,” he adds.“A visit to any village is enough to show the kind of development that has happened. I am getting ample support and people are eager for a change,” he says.SAD’s Jaspal Singh Chatha is banking on the “good work” done by the party in Punjab during its 10-year rule. He is visiting the constituency telling people not to vote for the Congress and instead try the SAD-BSP alliance. “We will ensure more employment opportunities for our youth,” he says. Facing stiff competition, incumbent Mayor Sanjiv Bittu, who is contesting on the PLC ticket after switching sides from the Congress, is riding on the BJP vote bank in addition to the charisma of Capt Amarinder Singh. He has been urging people to vote for him as the BJP at the Centre will ensure ample funds for the state and the constituency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/four-debutants-from-patiala-rural-vie-to-outdo-each-other-370180

He said Modi was a man with 56-inch chest, who could do the surgical strikes in Pakistan to avenge the Uri and Pulwama attacks.Promises curbs on illegal miningOur government will end illegal mining, improve law and order and end the drug menace in the state. — Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterHe stressed the NDA government had been running the country for the past about seven and a half years, but there was not even a single charge of corruption on any minister. “I urge you to bring the alliance to power to end corruption in the state. Congress leaders are entangled in corruption cases and infighting. The AAP has failed in Delhi on all fronts. Even the SAD, AAP and Congress are now promising to provide loans and other facilities to those who want to go abroad, but I assure you the BJP government will provide better opportunities to the youth so that they can stay and work here,” said Rajnath, addressing a rally in favour of party nominee from Muktsar Rajesh Pathela Gora.In his 26-minute-long speech, Rajnath also tried to strike a chord with farmers and Sikhs, mentioning the great works done by Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh. He also highlighted the scrapping of Article 370 and construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.In Faridkot, he slammed the Akalis, Congress and AAP for rampant corruption in the state. He accused the AAP of promoting liquor in Delhi, saying the party’s slogan of making Punjab drugs-free was a big lie. “It is only the BJP that will eradicate the menace of drugs in the state, as you have already tested the Congress and Akalis,” Rajnath said. #rajnath singh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rajnath-vows-to-root-out-corruption-in-punjab-370182

Similarly, he added, the FCRA approval had been granted to Darbar Sahib to facilitate hassle-free donations by devotees from abroad. Besides, the langar was exempted from the GST.Nadda pointed out PM Modi, soon after taking over in 2014, formed a SIT to probe the anti-Sikh riots and punish the guilty. “If Congress leaders come to seek your votes, ask them why they did not punish the culprits of the 1984 riots,” he added.Nadda also addressed public rallies in support of the party candidates Vandana Sangwan in Balluana and Puran Chand Mujaidia in Jalalabad.Meanwhile, farmers staged a protest against Nadda. They also blocked the road leading to the venue. Due to the protest, Nadda had to waitfor some time at a private school, where his helicopter had landed.

16-02-2022||Ravi Dhaliwal||Sujanpur: Dinesh Babbu banks on Congress infighting, Rajput votes||Sujanpur, February 15Ex-Deputy Speaker and three-time BJP MLA Dinesh Babbu has evolved a two-pronged strategy to romp home for the fourth successive time.First, he is carefully nurturing the Rajput vote bank. Secondly, he hopes to ride on the infighting in the Congress.In the 2017 polls, Naresh Puri, incumbent Congress candidate, contested as an Independent and queered the pitch for Amit Mantu, official nominee. It’s payback time for Mantu now, who joined the AAP after being denied ticket. Insiders say the votes he’ll garner now will have a direct bearing on the Congress’ final tally. To compound matters for Puri, senior leaders have deserted him, a development which is being used by Babbu to his advantage.Meanwhile,SAD-BSP has a few takers in this predominantly Hindu seat, where the Rajputs have over 60,000 votes. Like Babbu, Mantu is a Rajput and he too will bank on this vote bank. Puri is a Khatri while SAD-BSP’s Raj Kumar Gupta is a Mahajan. Both these communities don’t hold much influence.While Congress’ Puri paints a picture wherein jobs will be generated, Babbu harps onRs 1-crore given to him by Sunny Deol from his MPLAD funds. All four nominees say they will do something about 27,000 acres in Dhar block. “This is a sensitive issue. Any nominee who uses it to his advantage will get the maximum votes,” said an official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/babbu-banks-on-congress-infighting-rajput-votes-370186

16-02-2022||Saurabh Malik||Divorce must for better future of couple if cruelty involved: HC||Chandigarh, February 15The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that granting divorce was “a necessary step” in the process of healing and moving towards a healthier future for a couple, whose marriage had broken down irretrievably, was not consummated and involved cruelty.False dowry caseThe Bench also ruled that efforts to “harass” and “torture” a husband amounted to “cruelty”, which was a ground for divorce. The assertions came as the Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma granted divorce to a man, whose wife stayed with him for just 15 days and lodged an FIR alleging demand for dowry. Their marriage could also not be consummated.The Bench asserted the wife had lodged an FIR after accusing the appellant-husband and his family of demanding dowry just after three months of marriage. But her testimony before the family court, regarding dowry-less marriage, demolished her case.Speaking for the Bench, Justice Verma added the wife initiated criminal proceedings just after living 15 days in her matrimonial home and after merely three months of the marriage and that too “without having patience to wait and make efforts to reconcile the dispute amicably”. It was clear that she was trying to inflict mental cruelty under the garb of criminal proceedings, which entitled him to divorce, said Justice Verma.Justice Verma added the High Court, too, tried to reconcile the dispute amicably. The husband was ready to pay Rs 15 lakh as a permanent alimony, but the respondent-wife was not ready for a divorce by way of mutual consent. It was also an admitted fact that the marriage was not consummated from the first day. The court was of the considered opinion that the wife had made every effort to harass and torture the husband, which itself amounted to “cruelty”.Justice Verma added the analysis and evaluation of the entire evidence made it evident that the wife had resolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable hell for the husband. It was also clear that the marriage had broken down irretrievably as they were living separately since May 2015 and there was no chance of their coming or living together again.“In the present case, granting divorce is a necessary step in the process of healing and moving to a healthier future of both the parties,” Justice Verma added, while allowing the divorce plea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/divorce-must-for-better-future-of-couple-if-cruelty-involved-hc-370189

Erstwhile, the Jan Sangh or Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates emerged winners in 1957, 1967, 1969, 1985, 1997 and 2017. Sandeep is the fourth member of Jakhar family to contest elections as a Congress candidate, his uncles Sunil Jakhar and Sajjan Kumar Jakhar and grandfather Bal Ram Jakhar had in total won seven elections since 1972.The poll scenario is different from 2017. The BJP’s ex-ally the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has fielded Fazilka former MLA Dr Mohinder Rinwa and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which fielded Atul Nagpal of Fazilka in 2017, has given ticket to Deep Kamboj, a new entrant. With this, the contest has become four-cornered. Most of the close associates of jailed-liquor baron Shiv Lal Doda, who supported Arun Narang in 2017, were campaigning for Rinwa this time.To make arrangements for Modi’s rally on February 17, the BJP has roped in its Rajasthan affairs incharge Arun Singh and Union Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary, who are consulting Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Shekhawat for the show.Meanwhile, activists of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), who burnt effigies of PM Narendra Modi at various villages, said they would continue to protest outside the SDM offices on Wednesday.SAD chief Sukhbir Badal and MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal have visited Abohar thrice for campaign and no senior leader of the AAP or Congress from other places has so far addressed any meeting here.In an attempt to wrest the seat from the BJP, Sandeep Jakhar, who had organised 75 cleanliness and city beautification camps so far, presented a report card in each village besides Abohar town, giving details of development works worth Rs 718 crore that were reportedly carried out in the past few years. The BJP and SAD counter the claim asserting that funds were received from the central government. #arun narang #narendra modi #sunil jakhar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/narang-bets-on-pm-modis-rally-to-retain-seat-jakhar-on-social-work-370191

16-02-2022||New Delhi||Cobbler's son in Punjab's Fazilka lands up with a 20 lakh IPL contract||A contract of Rs 20 lakh may not sound like much when deals worth crores were sealed at the IPL auction but for tennis-ball sensation Ramesh Kumar, it has ensured that his father doesn’t have to make a living as a cobbler and his mother no longer needs to criss-cross villages in Punjab’s Fazilka district to sell bangles.Ramesh, who is better known as ‘Narine Jalalabad’ in tennis-ball circles, was already a Youtube star due to his exploits with both bat and ball. Post the auction and the signing with Kolkata Knight Riders last weekend, his remarkable story has reached a wider audience.Even as a tennis ball ‘nomad’, he requested his ageing parents to stop working but they would “never listen” to him. An IPL deal, however, has finally convinced them that their son can have a future in the game and they need not slog.“They have finally agreed to not work anymore. I never wanted them to do this work in the first place but it had to be done out of necessity,” Ramesh, who once blasted a 10-ball 50 in a local tournament, told PTI.He also plans to use the IPL money for the education of his younger brothers.The phone has been buzzing non-stop since KKR made a winning bid for him at the auction but Ramesh remains grounded and focussed.“Life has not changed yet paaji, life will change when I perform in the IPL. The way I see it, I have finally got the platform I needed,” he said.The 23-year-old from Jalalabad plied his trade in tennis-ball tournaments across India for seven years but it was only last year he got a taste of ‘leather’ ball. Ramesh impressed in Punjab Cricket Association’s district level tournament following which he was called for the Ranji Trophy camp.He owes his career to senior Punjab batter and IPL regular Gurkeerat Mann who helped him reach the KKR trials in Mumbai.KKR assistant coach and former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar was also convinced about his rare talent at the trials which eventually led to Ramesh’s signing at his base price.Having not played proper cricket at any level, it remains to be seen if Ramesh will be ready for his big break at the IPL but if T Natarajan can play for India after making his name in tennis-ball cricket, ‘Narine Jalalabadi’ too fancies his chances.Ramesh fondly recalls the time he travelled the country for making Rs 500-1000 a day in tennis ball events, a career that also made him board his first ever flight.“You must have seen my videos (on youtube) paaji. I am basically a tennis ball player. Since I could turn the ball away and turn back in, people advised me to play with leather ball too. They would say ‘you might make it big’.“But I didnt’ have the support that I need to pursue the game professionally. I used to play an odd leather ball game but mainly it was all tennis ball cricket.“It started with me playing all across Punjab, when I performed I got calls from other states too. Sometimes I made 500 in a day, sometimes it was 1000. It was just about enough to run the house and manage my travel expenses,” he said.Having got the stage he was desperately looking for, Ramesh now feels playing for India is also a possibility though he knows he has a long way to go.He needs to improve his skills and fitness drastically.“Paaji I used to bowl with cosco ball which is very light. The leather ball is much heavier and it is harder to make it turn but I am slowly getting better.
