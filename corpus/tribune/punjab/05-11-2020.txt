Earlier, the board was only looking after the affairs of the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib,” he told PTI.Hashmi said earlier several other agencies and departments were involved in the matters related to the corridor and now it has come under one department.    When asked why no administrative or other role has been given to the PSGPC, Hashmi said the Sikh body is fully involved as it is part of ETPB.     The Kartarpur is a true example of Sikh-Muslim friendship as well as interfaith harmony, he said.“The ETPB is the custodian of all Sikh Shrines in Pakistan and PSGPC is an official body to carry out the rituals in Gurdwara Sahiban, including Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, as per Sikh Rehat Maryada,” he said.Hashmi further said the PMU has been established to look after the day-to-day running of affairs like management, accounts, etc., and coordinate the efforts of all stakeholders.“The government of Pakistan has spent 17 billion rupees on phase one of the Kartarpur Corridor Project so far. About 875 acres land has been acquired for Gurdwara Darbar Sahib,” he said, adding that the second phase will be launched soon.In November last year, the two countries threw open a corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India with Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative.Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India.It is the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur. — PTI

However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the 'severe' category.

The Bench, vide order dated September 25, directed that the elections were to be held and appointed an observer. It also fixed a last date by which the elections were to be held.Independent of that, the current office-bearers of the Ludhiana District Cricket Association filed an anticipatory bail application as an FIR had been lodged against them regarding defalcation of funds etc.The Bench observed some relief was granted to them regarding their impending arrest. The Bench also directed that the court could not be oblivious of the argument raised by counsel for the petitioners that the Senior Superintendent of Police, Barnala, had been association senior vice-president for long. As such, there could be possibility of covert tinkering of the election process due to the influence of district administration officials, if any public official participated in the election process as a candidate.It further ordered that no person holding public office would be permitted to participate in the election process as a candidate unless he had either played Ranji Trophy or participated as a player, at least, in a district-level tournament. The Bench observed the contention was that these observations were null and void.“At the very outset, we put it to senior counsel as to how the High Court writ jurisdiction can be invoked to declare any order of the Single Judge to be non-binding. He has relied upon judgments... None of these judgments hold that a decision of a Single Judge in a petition for anticipatory bail can be brought into question by way of a writ petition,” the Bench asserted while dismissing the petition as being not maintainable.

Given that a lot of additions have taken place, including special light arrangements, documentary telecast, lazer show and a light and sound show, the power capacity was bound to increase. However, for the same arrangements were not made. The restoration work and allied services worth Rs 19.36 crore is being carried out by the Union Ministry of Culture, supervised under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and executed by National Buildings Construction Corporation (India) Ltd. An ASI official said the renovation job had already been completed. Now, it was incumbent upon the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust to get sanction for the power required to the run the show. “We were eager to hand it over to the trust, but the delay happened for the want of adequate power load capacity. Earlier, the electric load capacity was around 100 Kv and a transformer was there with a capacity of 120 Kv. Now, since the load will be nothing less than 220 to 250 Kv, a 330 Kv transformer has to be there. We have already intimated the local authorities to obtain the necessary sanctions for power load as soon as possible,” said the official.

Smoggy conditions prevailed in many parts of the state on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.At one point of time on Wednesday morning, Patiala recorded “very poor” air quality at 326 while, at the same time, Delhi air quality was 325.With over 30,000 farm fires in Punjab, the air quality has taken a hit across the state. “I was travelling home in my car with my family after a function and could not see anything on the road at around 10.30 am,” said Ludhiana resident Naresh Handa.Similar views were expressed by residents in Patiala, Malerkotla, Khanna and Mandi Gobindgarh. “There was unease in breathing inside the house too. Despite air purifier in my room, it was tough,” said Malerkotla resident Waseem Anwar Khan.Even as Punjab claims not to be solely responsible for Delhi’s poor air quality, the situation in Patiala, Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh districts is almost similar to that in Delhi. The air quality in these districts is ranging from “moderate” to “poor” with more deterioration likely in the coming days.The comparative data of the air quality recorded till Tuesday evening shows that Punjab’s average AQI was 255 with Patiala worst with 283, Amritsar 239, Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh at 239 each, Jalandhar 274 and Khanna at 248.While a reading of 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 is severe.With much of the Malwa belt yet to go full throttle on stubble burning, the situation is expected to deteriorate further over the next week. The period between October 15 and November 15 is considered critical as most farmers harvest their paddy crop during this period.Interestingly, the Malwa belt, comprising Patiala, Sangrur and Mansa districts, is yet burn leftover crop stubble as crop harvesting is still under way there. Clearly, the state is in for some really tough days ahead, said Agriculture Department officials.Patiala AQI worse than DelhiPatiala recorded “very poor” air quality at 326 while, at the same time, Delhi’s air quality was 325.

We can only carry out checks and collected nine samples last week.”Selling adulterated sweets and other items is a common practice during the festive season. A member of a city-based NGO said: “During festivals, adulteration is rampant. Despite the Food Safety and Standards Act-2006 in place, nothing seems to have changed on the ground. Sellers keep exploiting gullible people. Even the administration seems least bothered.”Punjab tops the country when it comes to adulterated processed food. Of the 26,077 samples of processed food found to be adulterated in the country in 2018-19, Punjab had the highest — 3,403. As there are no laboratories near Bathinda, samples are sent to the forensic lab in Kharar and the results take a fortnight or more to come.

So much so that Amarinder even changed the venue of his today’s sit-in from Rajghat to Jantar Mantar at the instance of the Centre. It is also strange that Amarinder is questioning the role of Punjab’s Governor in Delhi. He should have first visited the Governor in Chandigarh and then asked him why he was not forwarding the Bills passed recently by the Vidhan Sabha and then only made a programme to call on the President.”He added, “It is unfortunate that instead of trying to resolve the grievances of farmers and getting inbound goods trains to Punjab restarted, Amarinder was indulging in a drama. If Amarinder is really worried for the farming community, he should declare the entire state as a mandi for agricultural produce. Now, the Congress Government in Chhattisgarh has passed a Bill in this regard, which is signed by the Governor as well.” — TNS

He alleged the CM played a significant role in clearing the passage for the implementation of the Central farm laws in the state.State youth wing president and MLA Meet Hayer said the Capt Amarinder Singh government had totally failed in handling the issues faced by the people of Punjab, especially the farmers, and that he was not capable of running the government.Cheema said if Capt Amarinder was serious about the issues and concerns of farmers, he should immediately hold talks with the farm organisations and assure them of procuring their crops on MSP, adding that he should also take up the issue of resumption of the freight trains to Punjab, which were suspended by the Centre.

The SIT opposed the supplying of the document’s copy on the ground that challan was yet to be filed against the accused.While the public prosecutor on the behalf of the SIT demanded the court that prior notice be issued to the prosecution agency while deciding any application moved by the accused or any person in the case to get the copy of any document from the court, the latter rejected this demand of the prosecution, saying there is not such legal provision. The court clarified that no copy of challan was supplied to the accused who had not been challaned as yet. — TNS
05-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cops not raiding probable hideouts of accused: HC||The police visit only the residence or the workplace of the accused and not the places where he can be found, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted. An affidavit claiming that the Phagwara police could not arrest accused in a case as it was infected with Covid-19 has also failed to find favour with the Bench.The rap for apparently carrying out a far-from-satisfactory probe came after the Bench was told the police had gone to the house and the workplace of the accused. But arrest could not be carried out as he was not found at those places. Taking up the matter, Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi asserted the allegations were very serious. The court was surprised at the reasons mentioned in the affidavit filed by the Phagwara Deputy Superintendent of Police for not taking action.“From the pleadings and arguments of the state counsel, it comes out that the police, in order to arrest an accused, only visit the residence or the workplace of the accused and not the places where the accused can be found. This prima facie shows the attitude of the police qua the investigation being done in the present case, which is far from satisfactory,” Justice Sethi asserted. The Bench also adjourned the hearing of the case to November 4 after the state counsel sought another opportunity to file a better affidavit to explain its conduct. The counsel added it would also give details of the status of the investigations and the efforts made by the police to arrest the accused “so as to investigate the FIR properly to unearth the truth”.The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after Kusum Sharma filed a petition against the state of Punjab and other respondents. In an affidavit filed during the course of hearing, she stated that the respondent-accused was the brother of an ex-mayor of the Phagwara Municipal Corporation. He was seen freely roaming within Phagwara and the fact could be verified from CCTV cameras located within the city. The petitioner’s counsel further submitted that the respondent was seen accompanied by a gunman attached with his brother. — TNS

This development comes after a talk between the Railways Minister and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, said sources. There is strong possibility of deadlock over goods train movement in the state ending soon.The state government has assured the Railways unobstructed operations in the state to ease out the state’s power crisis and critical essential supplies situation.

So the government has decided to make them join back at the centres. As per a communication sent to all civil surgeons on Tuesday, though the Covid duties assigned to the health officers remain important, it had been observed that the performance of HWCs was going down in terms of footfall and daily reporting. Tele-consultations had also shown a downward trend during the past month.“In this regard, you are requested to kindly ensure that CHOs must attend their respective HWCs at least four days a week and do their routine work. Covid sampling duties may be assigned to all CHOs on a rotation basis so that the work of HWCs does not suffer,” it said.Meanwhile, the state reported 527 cases and 14 deaths in the past 24 hours.

05-11-2020||Naina Mishra||Diwali, winter can lead to second Covid surge in region||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 4A majority of population here still remains susceptible to Covid-19 exposure, and the Diwali festival and winter could push up transmission, leading to a second surge in the region.According to experts, the two reasons that will contribute to the second surge of Covid cases in winter will be gatherings of people in the lower-income group and the tendency of a virus to survive for a longer period in a colder climate.Besides, the Diwali festival can work in favour of the second surge, as air pollution caused by crackers will help aerosols of the virus produced by an infected person to remain afloat in the air for longer than 10-20 minutes, resulting in increased transmission of Covid-19.“The burning of firecrackers releases gaseous pollutants SO2, NO2 and huge amounts of ambient particulate into the atmosphere that generate dense clouds of smoke. These air pollutants stimulate the ACE-2 receptors on respiratory nasal cells, thus increasing permeability of the SARS-COV-2 virus to easily enter these cells and establish infection in the nose, throat and lungs,” said the UT Director of Health Services, Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang.‘25 per cent residents may have been infected’Dr Rajesh Kumar, former Head of School of Public Health and Community Medicine, PGI, says around 2.5 lakh to 3.5 lakh people in Chandigarh may have been infected, which comprises 25-35 per cent population. The estimation is based on the hypothesis that for every Covid positive case, there will be 20-30 undetected cases.“Since this virus is novel, not many people have antibodies against it and still, a vast majority of the population is susceptible to the exposure. The virus does not have a free run when at least 60 per cent of the population has been infected, which, in turn, acts as a barrier for transmission. At the onset of winter, people belonging to the lower-income group tend to stay indoors in public spaces with less ventilation. A virus once introduced may remain for a longer period of time and circulate among a large number of people. There is no definite trend for the Covid-19 virus but most flu viruses tend to survive longer in cooler climate,” said Dr Kumar.Need to overcome mobility, mask fatigueDr Rajesh Kumar, former Head of School of Public Health and Community Medicine, PGI, said: “If barriers of transmission such as the use of mask are adopted by people without any fatigue, the second surge may not be of a greater degree than the first one. The more people will mix with each other, the more will the virus spread.”UT’s appeal to residentsDr Amandeep Kaur Kang, Director of Health Services, UT, says: “People should stay indoors and desist from bursting firecrackers this Diwali so that we can protect elderly persons and patients with co-morbidities. If we add smoke to the air by bursting firecrackers, then it could turn out to be a recipe for disaster. Even those who have recovered from the Covid-19 virus will become vulnerable if we do not restrain ourselves during Diwali.”
