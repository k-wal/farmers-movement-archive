16-04-2020||---||Tonnes of grains for needy, moved from food baskets of Punjab and Haryana||New Delhi, April 16Tonnes of foodgrain has been moved from grain producing northern India to part of the country which need to provide grain to the poor and needy during this lockdown period.As the lockdown commenced on March 24 the first task was to provide foodgrain for 80 crore citizens under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Northern Railways has despatched 15.75 Lakh Tonnes of foodgrains which is 137 per cent higher than last year. It has lifted 53 per cent of foodgrain during the lockdown period, a big chunk of it from Punjab and Haryana.Stocks of wheat and paddy (rice) are maintained by the Food Corporation of India. Major loading stations during the lockdown period are Karnal, Kurukshetra, Rohtak, Jind, Moga, Amritsar, Muktsar, and Ludhiana. Loading is also being done from Uttar Pradesh—Barabanki, Lucknow, Sultanpur, Chandauli, Varanasi besides Badli in Delhi, Dehradun in Uttarakhand.The task meant continuous lifting of foodgrain from surplus states Punjab and Haryana to deficient states and needs seamless synergy across the country to allow Northern Railways to speed up matters.The Northern Railways has drawn up a chart showing how it loaded a record 51 rakes of grain. Each rake has anywhere between 18 and 24 wagons, each of which can carry about 54 tonnes. The normal demand is 15 rakes a day.The need for loading more rakes arose after the government announced to provide additional 5-kg foodgrain per person to NFSA beneficiaries.Deficient states are permitted to lift 3 months’ stock from Food Corporation of India on credit hence the rush.Not just the speedy despatch of these foodgrain rakes, the other issue is of managing adequate supply of empty covered rakes from across the country and moving them to Punjab and Haryana.For this operating officers of Northern Railways are working with 450 Section controllers, 5000 Station Masters, 400 Guards, 200 shunting staff, 3000 Pointsmen and about 1,000 crew to ensure unloading and loading at terminals.In this lockdown period, moving staff from house to control-room and offices is being done through emergency vehicles and workman special trains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tonnes-of-grains-for-needy-moved-from-food-baskets-of-punjab-and-haryana-72035

16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab staring at revenue loss to the tune of Rs 22,000 crore||With Punjab staring at revenue losses to the tune of Rs 22,000 crore for the financial year 2020-21, given the COVID-19 crisis, all state Ministers on Thursday decided not to take their salaries for the next three months.The Chief Secretary has appealed to all government employees to take voluntary cuts in the wages to help the state meet the unprecedented contingency.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Finance Sub-Committee, constituted recently, under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, to take stock of the fiscal implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown/curfew triggered by it. The committee is tasked with finding ways to generate revenue to compensate for the losses and meet the costs resulting from the current crisis.Finance Minister Manpreet Badal informed the meeting that of the Rs 88,000 crore revenue receipts estimated to be raised by the state for FY20, only Rs 66,000 crore would now be generated in the light of the lockdown, which had brought all business and tax receipts to a standstill and also resulting in lower GST collections.An official spokesperson said after the meeting that all the ministers in the state had voluntarily decided to donate their entire salaries, for the next three months, to the CM’s COVID Relief Fund.Later, on the directives of the Chief Minister, who was not in favour of imposing any salary cuts on employees, Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh issued an appeal asking “all government employees, and all employees of PSUs, local bodies, Boards and corporations, to volunteer to contribute their pay and allowance to the government mission to combat COVID-19.”The Chief Secretary suggested that grade A&B employees should contribute 30%, grade C should contribute 20% and grade D should contribute 10% of their monthly emoluments for April, May and June 2020 to the CM’s Relief Fund to strengthen the government’s efforts to deal with the deadly pandemic and the huge losses resulting from the current crisis.The meeting discussed several measures to mop up revenue in the prevailing situation, due to which the state was witnessing a massive financial crunch, that was likely to continue for another couple of quarters at least. The Chief Minister urged the committee members to look at innovative measures to tackle the crisis.Badal informed the meeting that with all manufacturing almost completely shut, and no taxes/duties forthcoming on account of Transport/Excise/Stamp Duty etc, the state was set to lose out on Rs 22,000 crore against revenue receipts. He said with GST collections to be much lower during the year and with the Centre yet to clear a significant amount of the state’s pending GST arrears, things will continue to worsen in the coming months, he warned.The state is also yet to receive any special financial package towards COVID relief from the Centre, he pointed out.The sub-committee will meet again in a day or two to further discuss measures to generate more revenue and cut down expenses across departments to meet the costs for COVID related medical and relief operations, in addition to the routine government expenditure, said the spokesperson.The chief minister meanwhile appreciated the efforts made by the government employees to contain the COVID 19 epidemic in Punjab. He also thanked the general public for their cooperation in these difficult times.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-staring-at-revenue-loss-to-the-tune-of-rs-22-000-crore-72029
16-04-2020||Chandigarh||Coronavirus: Punjab cops don't buy excuses, 8,000 curfew violators arrested||Stepped out to buy medicines.This is among the commonest excuses people give when caught violating lockdown orders, according to Punjab police.Despite the coronavirus lockdown, nationwide people are allowed out of their homes if they need to buy essential items or medicines.But Punjab police don't always buy these common explanations. Result: 8,269 arrests so far for violating the curfew imposed to enforce the lockdown.In addition, Punjab police have detained 13,000 curfew violators, for a few hours each time, in “open jails” like stadiums. About 3,600 vehicles were impounded, an official said.Altogether, 5,672 FIRs have been registered, police said.Over 45,000 Punjab police personnel are on lockdown duty, which also includes distribution of food packets and keeping vigil at grain markets since the beginning of procurement season this week.Officials said most people go by the book, complying with the curfew imposed in the state – two days before the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25.But some make excuses.“People try to step out of homes under the garb of some medical emergency,” an official said. He gave the example of a man who said he was out to buy medicines for his pregnant wife but carried no prescription with him.In Rupnagar district, an official said, people have begun producing medical prescriptions when stopped. But at times these are up to a year old.Buying milk and groceries is another common or excuse, police said.Drones are also being used to detect curfew violations, and have helped in the registration of 20 FIRs. From a height of 200 metres, a drone can keep an eye on localities spread over two kilometres across, an official said.In one case, a drone caught some people out playing cricket amid the curfew.Hard-pressed cops also complain about people who dial the helpline number when they should not.“Despite having sufficient rations, many people make calls for food and other essentials,” an official said.In Bathinda, police got a call from a man who said he was part of a group of 15 people who had run out of food and wanted to return to their homes in Bihar.Police claim they found no such emergency when they reached the place, and the caller apologized.The largest number of arrests for violating curfew orders has been made in Amritsar district (891), followed by (581), Mohali (559), Tarn Taran (534), Fazilka (488) and Hoshiarpur (460), according to Punjab police data.Cases were registered under section 188 (disobedience to an order promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act.Punjab had reported 186 total coronavirus cases till Thursday morning. Thirteen people have died. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coronavirus-punjab-cops-dont-buy-excuses-8-000-curfew-violators-arrested-72010
16-04-2020||Amritsar||Coronavirus: 41 Pak nationals stranded in India return through Attari border||Forty-one Pakistani nationals, who were stuck in India following the closure of borders due to the COVID-19 lockdown, on Thursday returned to their country via the Attari-Wagah border.The Indian government has been facilitating the repatriation of 180 Pakistani citizens, who were stranded in different parts of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.SAFMA activist Rajinder Singh Ruby said that 263 Indian citizens have also been stranded in Pakistan, including many students. They have been asked to “stay put”, in line with the government’s policy, until some arrangement was made for their return.“We were in touch with several Sikh pilgrims who got stranded at Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore. They told that they had conveyed this to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to help them reach India," he said.All Pakistani nationals were screened as per the international norms before they were allowed to cross over to Wagah. As per directions, only asymptomatic ones could be allowed to return. They would undergo self-isolation on reaching Pakistan.Showing gratitude towards Indian and Pakistani governments for taking prompt steps for their return, Karachi resident Mohammad Hussain said, “I came to this side through Wagah border for Mumbai on March 8 to attend Urs ritual. Meanwhile, the lockdown was imposed. We faced difficulty but it was acceptable as jaano ki hifazat pehli priority hai (protecting lives is the first priority). It was reasonable to implement restrictions to break coronavirus chain,” he said.Nankana Sahib resident Bhupinder Singh said that he came on February 22 as a tourist with his family and was now happy to go back.“Reaching back, my first move would be to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Janam Asthan, Nankana Sahib and initiate ardas for ‘sarbat da bhalla’. As India did, Pakistan too should help Indian citizens, who got stuck in Pakistan due to lockdown, to reach their homes,” he said.Karachi resident Vilayat Ali said that on February 16 he came to New Delhi along with his daughter who had to undergo plastic surgery.“We are happy and going back after successful medical treatment here. We had two months of medical visa. My daughter was discharged on March 20, but before we couldn’t finish official formalities to get back to Pakistan and we got stranded due to COVID lockdown,” he said.Peshawar resident Raja Singh and Karachi resident Mansur Ali came here to meet their Indian relatives and were happy to reunite with their families back home.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coronavirus-41-pak-nationals-stranded-in-india-return-through-attari-border-72006

16-04-2020||Chandigarh/Shimla||Gujjars in Punjab, Himachal face hardship amid coronavirus crisis||Nearly 1,000 families, mainly comprising pastoralist Gujjars, have been stranded in parts of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh along with 10,000 livestock and are facing livelihood crisis owing to ongoing lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic.They rued on Thursday that they have been facing hardships as locals reported to be refusing to buy milk from them, fearing they might be inflicted with coronavirus. Also, the governments asked them to settle down and stop their livestock migration.Himachal Ghumantu Pashupalak Mahasabha, Vice President, Lal Hussain said the government in the state was not allowing interstate and intrastate migration of people fearing the spread of the virus."We have been told by the local authorities that migration of the Gujjars won't be allowed till April 20 as their final destinations in the Chamba district have been declared corona hotspots," Hussain told IANS over the phone.He said after April 20 the administration would review the situation and take a call on their migration.The Gujjars normally start migrating along with the livestock, mainly buffaloes, from the plains of Punjab and some pockets of the Kangra district in Himachal Pradesh by the first week of April towards interiors of the Chamba district, which has a huge concentration of the Muslim Gujjars.This is an annual phenomenon. By the end of September, they start the migration from the hills to the plains. In the plains, they largely settle along with the seasonal rivulet Swan in the Hoshiarpur district and pockets in the Gurdaspur district.It takes them about 30 to 40 days to reach their destination with their livestock. Their main source of livelihood is by selling milk.But Hussain said owing to the fears of coronavirus most of the families stranded in Punjab have been facing financial crunch owing to the locals refusing to buy milk from them."And if they are buying, the rates are abnormally low. Against the normal rate of Rs 50 a litre, one is buying at a rate of Rs 10 to 15 a litre. Also, if someone is daily selling 50 to 60 litres milk a day, the daily sale has come down to 15 to 20 litres," he added.Earlier, there were reports that the Gujjars were threatened by locals amid fear of having proximity with members of Tablighi Jamaat, who have been labelled as 'super-spreader' of coronavirus.Himachal Ghumantu Pashupalak Mahasabha President Raj Kumar, who is based in Palampur in the Kangra district, told IANS over the phone that even 'Gaddis' has been temporarily barred from migrating to the higher reaches of the state.He said the Himachal government should make adequate arrangements to stock fodder as a preventive step.They mainly reside in lower hills of Kangra, Mandi, Kullu, Chamba, Shimla and Kinnaur districts in winter and move to higher hills along with the livestock by trudging 500 to 600 km to higher reaches every summer.As per official figures, Himachal supports 12 lakh goats, eight lakh sheep and buffaloes each.Livestock is integral to the sustainability of the economy of pastorals in Himachal.According to the state's Economic Survey report, the contribution of major livestock products in 2019-20 was 15.30 lakh tonnes of milk, 1,516 tonnes of wool, 105 million eggs and 4,600 tonnes of meat.In Punjab, 80 per cent of milk is distributed to the towns and cities by the dairy farmers, comprising the migratory Gujjars. Punjab's Milkfed, Amul and NestlÃ© account for the remaining 20 per cent.Acting tough on the people reported to be refusing to buy milk from the Muslim Gujjars, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh directed the Deputy Commissioners to resolve the issue as social ostracising would not be permitted.Punjab Industries Minister Sunder Sham Arora on Wednesday said the Gujjars in Talwara in Hoshiarpur district would not be allowed to face any difficulty on account of selling milk by them.In a statement in Chandigarh, he said he was apprised the Gujjars were facing some difficulty in selling milk and facing a hard time in getting food for their families.He said problems have been resolved and ration and other essentials have been made available to them.At the same time, he said some of the Gujjars went to Himachal. But due to lockdown, the Himachal government did not allow them entry, and they had to return.A spokesperson for the Himachal's Animal Husbandry Department said the seasonal migration of sheep breeders is going on but not of the Gujjars in the Chamba district.The department has set up five transit camps for providing veterinary aid and other logistics to the sheep breeders. So far 280 flocks have entered the Chamba district.The spokesperson said in a statement that the nomads have been given priority and free movement of livestock has been allowed.He said that the Himachal Pradesh Milk Federation and Kamdhenu Hitkari Manch are processing milk regularly.A daily procurement of milk by the federation has increased to 80,000 litres from the earlier procurement of approximately 65,000 litres.He said permits are being issued for transporting fodder from the neighbouring districts. Since the start of lockdown, approximately 35,000 quantal dry fodder has been received in the state.As far as the marketing of milk of the Gujjars, 28 Gram Panchayats in Chamba district where they are based are currently coronavirus hotspots and, therefore the sale of milk is affected.The people in these areas have been advised to prepare products like ghee, cheese, etc. from the surplus milk, said the spokesperson.

16-04-2020||Vijay C Roy||Less than 1% industry operational in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 15During the phase I of lockdown, which ended on April 14, less than 1% of industries across different sectors were operational in Punjab. These have been given permission to continue operations till April 20, when the new guidelines, issued by the Centre today, will come into effect. Industry experts feel the Centre’s decision to allow certain types of manufacturing and services to resume operations with restrictions from April 20 would spur economic activity partially in the state.According to data, out of 2,52,741 industries in the state, around 2,150 were operating in the first phase of the lockdown. The units which were operational are spread across sectors such as food processing, pharmaceutical, rice processing, medical equipment and kits such as personal protection equipment (PPE), sanitiser and textiles.Some of the major units which were operational were ITC (Kapurthala), JCT, HMEL, Sukhjit Starch, Trident, NFL, Hindustan Insecticide, Sportking, Verka milk plants, Shiva Texfab and Garg Acrylic.The maximum number of units were operational in Ludhiana (416), followed by Faridkot (392) and Ferozepur (288).“Initially, the permission for starting operations of 2,150 units was given till April 14, but now it has been extended till April 20. Since the new guidelines issued by the Centre will come into effect from April 20, we will allow only those units which adhere to these norms. It may be modified to suit local conditions. We hope new industries will also come forward for permission as the Centre has announced to relax some norms,” said Sibin C, Director, Industries and Commerce, Punjab.During the first phase of the lockdown from March 24 midnight to April 14, the Central government made exceptions for certain kind of industries manufacturing essential commodities, food processing, public utilities such as petroleum and LPG and medical equipment.He said the state would support those units which would diversify into making masks, PPE and ventilators.Six industrial units from Ludhiana have already got approval for supplying PPEs for health workers. Three units have received approval for supplying N95 masks.“Besides, there are 6-7 units in the state which have developed prototype ventilators and are waiting for approval from the department concerned. Once they are accorded approval, they will start operations commercially,” he added.As the Centre has allowed makers of IT hardware, farmers and industries in the rural areas to resume operations after April 20, the industry expects it will spur economic activity in the state partially.Naredco president Niranjan Hiranandani said phase-wise opening of economic activity with precautions is the right step and it would refuel the growth trajectory.Industries operationalDistrict No. of industries(including other districts)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/less-than-1-industry-operational-in-punjab-71932
16-04-2020||Shivani Bhakoo||Over 415 industrial units begin production in Ludhiana||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, April 15The state government has allowed industries to start their operation (not mandatory, own choice) while following guidelines to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Over 415 industries have started their production in the city. These industries are both from essential and non-essential sector.We are receiving many applications on a daily basis seeking approval to run units. Departments like the PPCB, Labour, Factory and Health will give a nod to run factories. Officials/staff of these departments can raid or inspect any factory premises to check if procedure is being followed or not. Mahesh Khanna, General Manager, DICIf the Department of Industries (DIC) is to be believed, a random checking is being conducted at these units to ensure that the government guidelines are being followed properly.In garment sector, many units have started making masks and PPE kits, which comes under the essential sector. Even in non-essential sector units, including cycle and auto parts, it is being ensured that labour/work-force has proper sanitation facilities, food, rooms, visit by doctors and maintain proper distance while taking other precautions.The DIC General Manager, Mahesh Khanna, said, “We are receiving many applications on a daily basis seeking approval to run units. Departments like the PPCB, Labour, Factory and Health will give a nod to run factories. Officials/staff of these departments can raid or inspect any factory premises to check if procedure is being followed or not.”Though industrialists are finding it difficult to retain labour during this time of crisis, they say production would start if even if returns are minimum. At least overall expenses should be taken care of, they added.Vikram, one of the cloth manufacturers in the Focal Point area, said, “I paid Rs 6,000 for buying a thermometer. Obviously, we will start production only if we get returns. How can we spend on doctors, labourers stay and food if we don’t get returns? the manufacturer asked.“Labourers are throwing tantrums at this hour simply because they feel that production has been hit and there are no orders. How can they compel employers to pay their wages?” said Rahul, a migrant from UP. “I have been allotted a quarter on the factory premises where electricity is free. I thank my stars that at this time, my employer is taking care of everything otherwise my counterparts are in trouble because neither can they go back nor they have money to pay room rent, power bills and for other expenses,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/over-415-industrial-units-begin-production-in-ludhiana-71656

Dairy owners rue that not only have their sales dwindled significantly, but also the rates of milk in the wholesale market have come down drastically. Also, transportation of green fodder, wheat husk (tudi) and cattle feed has also got affected, resulting in increased diet cost of cattle, which the farmers claim that they won’t be able to bear for a long time.According to the dairy farmers in the Malwa region, on one hand, production cost has increased owing to curfew restrictions and on the other hand, rates in the wholesale market have dropped drastically.Talking to The Tribune, Atma Singh, president of the Malwa Dairy Farmers’ Association, said, “Earlier, milk was sold for Rs45 per litre and above in the wholesale market as against below Rs30 per litre at present. Owing to the arbitrary stance of wholesale buyers, we have to sell our milk at lowered rates and if we try to bargain with them, they tell us to spill the milk wherever we want. Many farmers have even curtailed the diet of their mulching cattle, but it will end up affecting the health of cattle.”“Initially, we faced a lot of trouble when supply of cattle feed was cut completely, but later with the administration’s intervention, things improved,” said Singh.Vikramjit Singh, another dairy farmer at Naam Dev Road in Bathinda, said, “I have more than 80 mulching cattle. At this juncture, I can neither sell them nor would I be able to bear the increased production cost for a longer duration.”Another dairy farmer said, “After hotels, restaurants and confectionery shops stopped buying milk after curfew, things have turned upside down for me. The price of green fodder, cattle feed, wheat husk etc have seen a jump of 40 to 60 per cent approximately.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/double-blow-for-dairy-farmers-in-punjab-milk-prices-down-input-cost-up-71601

Combines were seen in various areas, which were being sanitised by the village panchayats before use.According to the farmers of Mohali, the lockdown has hit them hard this season due to the shortage of labour and less outcome of the crop following heavy rains in the recent past.Due to the unavailability of labourers, farmers are shifting to combines in some areas. They believed that there was a huge difference in the production of wheat straw by using manual and machine harvesting method.Mehar Singh, state president, Bharti Kisan Union Ekta, said harvesting with combines reduced wheat straw production to only 50 per cent as compared with manual harvesting. He said now, majority of the farmers were opting for combines as several migrant labourers had already returned to their states due to the lockdown. However, combine harvesting is faster and cheaper than manual harvesting, but due to less wheat straw production through combines, small farmers have to buy straw for their cattle.Malkiat Singh Khatra, a farmer from Thedi village who owns 24 acres, said, “There is no clear picture from the administration and commission agents (arhtiyas) about the procurement and permission of taking tractor-trolley to the grain markets. We don’t know whether we have to collect the curfew pass or agents will provide it to us here. Secondly, we have no idea about the fixed quantity of wheat per trolley. The lockdown has added to our woes.”Surendar Singh, a farmer from Cholta Khurd, said farmers were unable to get their faulty agricultural equipment repaired as workshops were shut.District Magistrate Girish Dayalan had prohibited harvesting through combine machines between 7 pm and 6 am in the district. However, it can be done from 6 am to 7 pm.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/labour-a-worry-as-wheat-procurement-begins-71690

He, however, added that it would be done in accordance with the Centre’s relaxation in retail businesses that would be announced on April 20.A senior official in the Excise and Taxation Department said even as there were reports that certain liquor licencees were selling their stock amid the curfew, it would not lead to any loss of revenue. “Our estimate is that it will lead to just 15 per cent of the stock being sold. It is only when the vend replenishes its stock that the state earns excise duty. In case, the Centre allows relaxations in unaffected areas, we are ready to open the liquor vends,” he said.Meanwhile, officials say the financial position of the state is grim. Revenue generation and cutting down Punjab’s expenditure by almost Rs 1,500 crore can help the state tide over the financial crisis. While revenue generation is being planned through a gradual revival of economic activity and reopening of government services in cities that have had no case of Covid-19, the state also plans to cut down on its expenditure by imposing severe austerity measures.In low spirits||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/liquor-vends-in-punjab-may-be-opened-in-green-zones-71596

The centralised dashboard of the app, an initiative aligned to the social distancing guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, shall also give alerts on pass issuance, expiry and validation.This system enables secretaries of market committees across the state to generate mobility passes for the farmers by the purchase centres as well as by the arhtiyas. The software generates the required number of passes automatically, based on historic data available with the Mandi Board.The arhtiyas shall distribute these mobility passes to their farmers to enable the latter to come on the designated date at the purchase centre concerned. The farmer shall also receive an SMS with pass number and link to download the app.Vishwajit Khanna, Additional Chief Secretary, Development, said apart from the e-pass system, an m-pass system had also been developed in the e-PMB mobile application. A unicode SMS is sent to every arhtiya at the time of pass issuance. The arhtiya can allocate the passes to trolley drivers through the in-built m-pass system. The drivers can then download the m-pass using the SMS received on his number, and use this m-pass at police nakas for permitted mobility.Ravi Bhagat, Secretary Punjab Mandi Board and Special Secretary Governance Reforms, said with features such as geo-tagging, geo-hashing, alerts and emergency support, this technology would help the government manage mandi operations well.Pranay Jivrajka, Co-founder Ola, said, “By helping the government connect with the farmers using our technology platform, we are able to put our capabilities to the best use when the nation requires innovation and collaboration to quickly come out of this national crisis.”Mobile App to check overcrowdingThe OLA app, installed on mobile phones of farmers, will alert them about the rush spots at the mandi gates to check overcrowding.

With the footfall at the Golden Temple and other major gurdwaras seeing a drastic fall, there is a considerable dip in the offerings received in “golak”, one of the major sources of the SGPC’s income.An official said since the curfew was imposed, the Golden Temple’s “golak” has been receiving only about Rs 10,000-15,000 a day against Rs 20-25 lakh. Even the online donations have witnessed a fall.During the normal days, one month’s collection of the Golden Temple, Gurdwara Baba Deep Singh and other 40 gurdwaras is no less than Rs 12 crore. The “karah parshad” collection alone is over Rs 10 lakh per day.During 2019-20 (till March 31), an amount of Rs 85 crore was received, including cash offerings and online donations.Since the lockdown was enforced, Rs 5 crore has already been spent on serving langar to the needy in Punjab, Haryana and other states.Finding itself in a fix, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal has appealed to the Sikh sangat to spare a part of their income for gurdwaras and as the harvesting process is on the way, farmers have been asked to donate a portion of their produce, especially wheat for langar.Longowal said despite constraints, the SGPC would continue to at least provide food to the deprived sections. “With a drastic fall in donations and offerings, it has become difficult to run the affairs. We need raw food on a daily basis in our kitchens to serve the needy,” he said.The SGPC has been providing cooked food to around 2.5 lakh people daily through 80 gurdwara, which prepare 75 quintals of dal and 10 quintals of rice daily. An estimated 300 quintals of wheat flour is consumed in a day.No supply at PDS rates yetOn the intervention of Union Minister Harsimrat Badal, the Centre had given its nod for the supply of wheat and rice for langar at PDS rates. The PDS rate of rice is Rs3 per kg and wheat Rs2 per kg. The order has not been implemented so far, said SGPC vice president Rajinder Singh MehtaRs 5 cr already spent on serving needyDuring 2019-20 (till March 31), an amount of Rs 85 crore was received, including cash offerings and online donations.

16-04-2020||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Closed offices, no passes, farmers made to wait with produce in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, April 15The tall claims made by the state government about arrangements for procuring wheat in the rural areas of the district have fallen flat, as at many grain markets, the market committee offices were lying shut down. Resultantly, farmers kept waiting to sell their produce on day one of the procurement.Exposing the preparedness of the district administration, some farmers alleged that they had not got passes to sell their produce, whereas at many grain markets, no market committee officials were seen present.Shingara Singh Mann, district president of the BKU (Ekta Urgahan), said “Farmers usually bring a combine harvester machine to the fields, harvest the crop and then take it directly to the grain markets to sell it further. This practice is adopted because most farmers don’t have the space to store their produce at their homes. Now, since only 50 quintal of crops can be sold at a time, most farmers are in a fix.”Mann said: “In villages, no arrangement has been made for wheat procurement, as many farmers are without coupons and also officials are not present at the grain markets for purchasing the crop.”Jagmail Singh of Jhumba village said: “It is afternoon now and I have been waiting for the market committee officials to come to the grain market since 10 am, but no official has arrived so far.”Jagsir Singh, a farmer, said: “Since farmers are allowed to bring 50 quintals of crop to the grain market at a time, they have to store the remaining crop in their houses. This adds to the financial burden.” DC B Srinivasan said: “The process will be streamlined after April 17.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/closed-offices-no-passes-farmers-made-to-wait-with-produce-in-punjab-71588
16-04-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Wheat procurement: Confusion over tokens mars Day 1 in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 15The first day of procurement was marred by confusion over the release of e-tokens, with many mandi yards, especially in rural areas, still unprepared to receive the grain.Procurement began in just 7-8 per cent of the 3,700 odd mandis today.Though the state government termed it “teething troubles”, farmers and commission agents remained panicky as they tried to adapt to the first-ever technology driven procurement process.At many places, the commission agents complained that e-tokens were released for a wrong date. These are necessary to allow the farmers to get their produce from their villages to the mandis and are issued after the commission agent feeds the phone number of the farmer in the “e-PMB” app of the Punjab Mandi Board.Procurement has only begun in the Malwa region, while harvesting in the Doaba and Majha region is expected to start next week, following which the market arrivals will begin.As many as 8,213 tonnes of wheat arrived in 252 mandis today, of which 3,645.5 tonnes was sold. Though a sizeable section of commission agents, led by Ravinder Cheema, gave a call for the boycott of the procurement proces s over e-reporting of MSP paid to farmers on the PMS portal and non-release of their dues of Rs 200 crore, the state government responded sharply, threatening to cancel the licence of agents, who tried to halt the procurement operations. Cheema said they were only exercising their “democratic right to protest”.In Khanna, the largest grain market of Asia, about 500 quintals of wheat was procured till evening, Harbans Singh Rosha, president, Arhtiya Association, Khanna, told The Tribune: “There have been initial glitches in getting e-tokens. But once the system stabilises, the problem will be resolved. These are difficult times, but I am sure that the procurement will be smooth,” he added.In Makhu, Vijay Kalra, who is the vice-chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board, admitted problems in getting e-tokens and gunny bags, but said these would stabilise soon. In Sadak Mandi near Faridkot, where 300 odd bags of wheat were procured till late afternoon, Pankaj Aggarwal, a commission agent, complained that there was still too much confusion among farmers on how to get the e-tokens.Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary of the Bhartriya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), said farmers in Mansa, Bathinda, Barnala, Patiala and Faridkot faced a lot of problems in getting the e-tokens.”Vishwajit Khanna, Additional Chief Secretary, Development, saidthe problems were just initial hiccups. "Today, we issued 6,500 e-tokens. As many as 18,000 e-tokens will be issued tomorrow and 35,000 on Friday. I can assure you that each and every grain will be procured," he said.Arhtiyas stay awayWith arhtiyas going on strike, farmers are facing the heat. Saudagar Singh Ghudani, BKU (Ekta) said, “As the arhtiyas have gone on strike, farmers will not be able to bring or sell their produce in mandis.”Will cancel their licences: Mandi BoardMohali: Ravi Bhagat, Secretary, Mandi Board, said a section of arhtiyas had threatened to boycott the procurement operations, which would not be tolerated. He issued directions to all secretaries of the market committees to initiate strict action immediately against such persons. He pointed out that the board had already issued necessary directions to cancel the licences of erring arhtiyas and warned them of further action.
