They differ from others of the same genus on the basis of the number of antennal segments,” the DST said.New species are typically named after some distinguishing attribute or location but are often named after scientists as a means of honouring their research contributions to biology, especially in the fields of evolutionary and organismal biology, ecology or systematics.“The two new species, the first ones spotted with 10-segmented antennae among this rare genus, were discovered by a team led by Prof. Himender Bharti of Punjabi University, Patiala. The discovery has been published in the journal ZooKeys,” the DST added.The genus is currently represented by 14 species of which eight possess nine-segmented antennae, while five possess 11-segmented antennae and one species has recently been reported with eight-segmented antennae.In India, the genus was so far represented by two species with nine and 11-segmented antennae respectively.“The newly discovered ant species with 10-segmented antennae discovered, establish an old world lineage that contains a species emerging as the only model organism among the ant subfamily,” the statement added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-university-scientists-find-two-new-species-of-rare-ant-in-kerala-tamil-nadu-202595
23-01-2021||---||Capt announces shagun hike for daughters of construction workers from Rs 31,000 to Rs 51,000||Chandigarh, January 23Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has announced a hike from Rs 31,000 to Rs 51,000 in the Shagun amount for the marriage of daughters of construction workers in Punjab from April 1, 2021, while also approving Rs 1,500 in financial aid to such workers or their family members who test positive for Covid.This was decided  by CM while chairing the 27th meeting of the Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) Welfare Board through video-conference on Friday evening.Further, to ease the process of availing the Shagun benefit, the Chief Minister has approved modification in the existing conditions to make valid marriage certificates issued by any religious body - gurdwaras, temples and churches – acceptable for the purpose. While 50% payment can be availed in advance the rest will be provided on submission of the marriage certificate by the competent authority under the revised rules. Daughters of those registered with the Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) Welfare Board are eligible under the scheme.The Chief Minister also announced compensation worth Rs 2 lakh in case of death of a worker in an accident while working in construction activity even if he/she was not registered with the Construction Board, provided he/she is otherwise eligible to be registered as a construction worker.According to an official spokesperson, Amarinder also announced extension in time-frame from the existing six months to one year for submission of application for benefits under various welfare schemes as many workers could not apply in time due to the Covid situation.Further, the construction workers have been allowed to prefer an appeal to the Secretary Board within a period of 120 days instead of 90 days in case their pension application is rejected by the Screening Committee. Under the Balri (female child) Birth Gift scheme, the Board has also decided to enhance the time limit for submission of application from six months to one year from the date of the delivery of the girl child of the beneficiary.In another relaxation to rules for availing benefits under various schemes, construction workers can now submit any two of the four government documents, namely Aadhaar card, PAN card, voter card and ration card. Many workers could not avail benefits earlier for lack of a birth certificate, which was the only acceptable proof prior to this amendment.The Board, at its meeting chaired by the Chief Minister, also announced a hike in the annual stipend, to Rs 35,000 from Rs 25,000 for boys and to Rs 40,000 from Rs 30,000 for girls pursuing degree/postgraduate degree courses in pharmaceutical/paramedical studies. Hostel stipend has also been increased to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000 per year for boys and Rs 55,000 from Rs 45,000 for girls studying in degree/postgraduate degree courses in pharmaceutical/paramedical studies. For medical and engineering students, the hike in annual stipend for boys is from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 and for girls from Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000, with hostel stipend increased to Rs 70,000 and Rs 80,000, respectively. Also, to encourage meritorious children, the Board has now approved that a claim must be made within one year instead of six months from the declaration of results in case of these meritorious children or from the receipt of the award by sportspersons from district, state or national authority.Further, the Board has now allowed construction workers to renew their membership within a period of one year to enable them to continue to apply and avail financial benefits under various welfare schemes during the grace period of one year. A series of relaxations have also been announced with respect to insurance and other benefits in the case of death or disability, as well as LTC benefits, reimbursement for medical aids, financial assistance for cremation and last rites, aid for mentally retarded/handicapped children, maternity cover, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-announces-shagun-hike-for-daughters-of-construction-workers-from-rs-31-000-to-rs-51-000-202572

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmer unions hold meeting to reconsider govt proposal to put farm laws on hold||A meeting of 32 Punjab farmer unions opposed to the Centre's farm laws was held at the Singhu border here, a major protest site, to reconsider the government’s proposal to put the contentious legislations on hold.This comes a day after the government asked farmer leaders to revert by Saturday in case they agree to its proposal to suspend the legislations for 18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks between the government and farmer leaders, the 11th round on Friday saw both sides hardening their positions. They could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting.Also read: Adani Group says being targeted through false propaganda, manufactured online campaignThe government asked farmer unions to revert by Saturday in case they agree to the suspension proposal and the talks can continue only thereafter.This followed a big climbdown made by the Centre in the last round of talks on Wednesday when it offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi borders.Farmer leaders, however, said they would settle for nothing less than a complete repeal of the laws, enacted in September last year, which they find pro-corporate, and a legal guarantee for the procurement of crops at government-fixed MSP (minimum support price).They said their tractor parade would go ahead as per the plans on January 26 and unions had told the police that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The farmer unions are adamant on taking out their tractor parade on Delhi's busy Outer Ring Road on January 26, even as Delhi Police urged them to hold it outside the national capital, a request that was publicly rejected by the unions.A meeting between a group of farm leaders and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is scheduled later on Saturday to discuss alternative routes for the tractor parade.Talking to reporters after the meeting on Friday, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government had always maintained a sensitive approach towards farmers and their interests, but some forces were definitely at work to keep the agitation on and those forces certainly did not want farmers to benefit."No resolution is possible when the sanctity of an agitation is lost," he had said while adding that no decision could be reached in the interest of the farmers if vested interests got an upper hand.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on MSP for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

For mere Rs80, one can proudly express his or her support for the farmers agitating on the Delhi border.And there are a sizable number of supporters, at least going by the number of flags on SUVs, cars and two-wheelers plying in the tricity.The road stretch from the Sohana gurdwara to the Airport light point in Zirakpur is dotted with countless roadside flag sellers. A majority of flag sellers said they were selling 25-30 flags each per day for a price ranging from Rs80 to Rs120 per piece. The sale goes up considerably on weekends or holidays whenever there is any related event lined up in the vicinity.Daily wage earners, their wives and idlers form the bulk of these sellers who pocket Rs500-600 by evening without breaking a sweat. All they have to do is patiently wait for customers on the roadside.Delhi-bound farmers on their tractor-trailers also take this road for their journey to the protest site. Jasvir Singh of Thaska village in Mohali could not resist the temptation to deck up his tractor.Residents of Hanumangarh Balmukund, 24, and Sushant, 22, too, stopped over to give a dash of yellow to their swanky SUV. A fluttering flag in front of the windshield can be a big distraction and may hinder the view, but he doesn’t mind it as, “Farmers’ cause is bigger than anything else. I am the son of a farmer. If I will not support him, who else will?”The canvas for making these flags is brought from Patiala, Amritsar and Ludhiana. Local printers, too, are cashing in on the opportunity by offering on-the-spot delivery of the material.Bumper stickers, badges and banners are also available with the roadside sellers, but the flag still remains the ultimate symbol of farmers’ protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/vendors-cash-in-on-farmers-protest-202399

The youth was presented at a press conference by union leaders. TNSAlso read:At the end of the over four-hour-long meeting, that saw discussions for barely 30 minutes, Tomar asked the unions to reconsider his offer and to get back by Saturday, if they decide in its favour. Thanking the unions, Tomar said: “Even though there was nothing wrong in the laws, for the benefit of farmers and respect for their agitation, the government came up with several proposals.”He said: “You (unions) launched agitations even as you were engaged in talks with us. We didn’t object. The vision (at your end) was lacking.” Later speaking to the media, the minister claimed there were forces which did not want the talks to succeed. “The government made several proposals to end the stir, but when the purity of the movement is lost, no solution is possible,” he maintained.Sources say Tomar is believed to have told the unions that they should not have issued a statement rejecting the proposal ahead of the talks today.He also hinted at “differences” among the unions regarding the government’s offer. Fifteen Punjab unions are said to have voted in the favour of the Centre’s offer yesterday.Unions, meanwhile, said they would now concentrate on the agitation and prepare for the tractor parade.

23-01-2021||---||Government job for deceased farmers’ kin: CM||Chandigarh, January 22Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today announced jobs for one member of each of the families of the state’s farmers who had lost their lives in the agitation against the “black” laws.Hitting out at the Centre, the Chief Minister said it should repeal the laws, sit with farmers and frame new laws after taking all stakeholders into confidence. Pointing out that the Constitution of India had already been amended so many times, he asked why the Government of India was adamant about not taking back the farm laws.Slamming the central government for pushing the laws through Parliament with brute majority without any discussion, the Chief Minister said the entire country was paying the price for this. “Is there a Constitution in the country? Agriculture is a state subject under Schedule 7, so why has the Centre interfered with a state subject?” he said, adding that “it went ahead and enacted these laws without consulting anyone, becauseof which we all have landed in this situation”.Asserting that “we are with the farmers and will stand by them,” the Chief Minister said during the 20th edition of his Facebook Live #AskCaptain session that the Punjab Government and every person in Punjab stood with farmers.The sad part, said the Chief Minister, was that “we are losing our farmers to the cold every day, with an estimated 76 farmers dying so far”. In addition to the Rs 5 lakh compensation being given to the families of the deceased farmers, his governmentwould also give a job to a family member, he added.Replying to a question by a Ferozepur resident, the Chief Minister said the Akalis and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were spreading lies on the issue of the high-powered committee on the agricultural reforms, as exposed by an RTI response. Pointing out that Punjab was not even included initially in the committee, he said it was only after he wrote to the Centre that Punjab’s name was added, by which time the first meeting had already taken place without the state’s representation. The second meeting was attended by Manpreet Badal as financial issues were discussed, while in the third and final meeting, no politician was invited.On the NIA notices to some farmers and supporters of the farmer agitation, the Chief Minister told the news editor of a New Zealand Punjabi weekly that it was a wrong step and he would be writing soon to the Union Home Minister on the issue.‘Centre interfered in state subject’Slamming the Centre for pushing the laws through Parliament without any discussion, the Chief Minister said the entire country was paying the price for this. “Agriculture is a state subject under Schedule 7, so why has the Centre interfered with a state subject,” he asked, adding that “it went ahead and enacted the laws without consulting anyone”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/government-job-for-deceased-farmers-kin-cm-202190

The state has applied for the final clearance for this amalgamation with the apex regulatory bank, Reserve Bank of India.Once the amalgamation is done, the PSCB will be among the largest banks operating in the state with 804 branches. This amalgamation would then allow the banks to function like any other commercial bank and ensure a robust rural credit system.Together, the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) cater to nearly nine lakh farmers and they lend almost Rs 12,000 crore each year to farmers. Punjab’s Council of Ministers had approved this amalgamation of these banks with the PSCB in December 2018.Facing loss of Rs 700 croreVikas Garg, registrar, Cooperative Societies, told The Tribune that they had already received the in-principle approval for amalgamation of these banks. “However, some conditions were imposed by the RBI, which have now been fulfilled and we have applied to the RBI for its final nod. It is expected before the end of the financial year in March,” he said.As of now, the 20 DCCBs are district-wise independent authorities. After the merger, they will become branches of the PSCB. Garg said this merger of the DCCBs would help arrest the declining profit and enable them for better human resource management as well as tax management.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/district-coop-banks-set-to-be-merged-with-pscb-202199

They held a meeting with the management committee, but the school is not ready to redress their grievances.HC ruling ‘flouted’While talking to the media, Sanjeev Abrol, Harsh Kumar, Ashish Sharma, Sarbjit Singh, Rajiv Khullar, Yogesh and Sanjay Gupta said the school management was pressuring the parents to deposit the 12-month fee, otherwise the names of the students would be struck off. They said it was a clear violation of the Punjab and Haryana High Court orders by which only tuition fee, that too from August 1, 2020, could be charged.The parents said they had submitted a memorandum to the DC, who directed the DEO (S) to look into the matter. The DEO (S) further directed the school management to charge only Rs 1,300 tuition fee from parents instead of Rs 3,000. They claimed that the management also approached the DC against the DEO’s order, but the DC office sent a mail to the school that only recommended fee should be charged. However, the school was still asking for Rs 3,000 fee for each student, they said.Pawan Sachdeva, president of the managing committee, said they were charging only tuition fee and too at a 20 per cent discount.When asked about the directions of the DEO (S) in this regard, he said these had been stayed by the DC. However, DC Amrit Kaur Gill said the DEO (S) order had not been stayed rather it would be enforced strictly as parents of the students were facing problems.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/parents-protest-school-order-to-pay-exorbitant-fee-202200

Our first batch will move from Khanauri (in Sangrur) and another from from Dabwali (in Sirsa district),” Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said on Friday.Also read: Tractor parade to go ahead as planned on Republic Day: Farmer leadersConsidering the kind of enthusiasm among people, over 30,000 tractors owing allegiance to our union will be part of the parade, he said.Tractors would carry flags of the union and posters with slogans of “Kisan Ekta Zindabad”, “No Farmer No Food” and “Kaale Kannon Radd Karo”, said Kokrikalan.Kokrikalan said they would also take some trolleys to accommodate women during the tractor parade.Several women will drive tractors as part of the parade.Many batches of farmers owing allegiance to different farm bodies would also leave for Delhi on January 24, farmer leaders said on Friday.Farmer unions have held several tractor rallies across the state to mobilise people and prepare for the proposed parade in the past few days.Farmers had also announced to display tableaus during the parade to showcase the plight of the farming community, they said.One such example was seen during a tractor march in Moga on Thursday, where a tableau was mounted on a trolley, showing a farmer ploughing a field with a pair of bullocks.“Along with bullocks, a model of farm expert MS Swaminathan was also created to seek the implementation of the Swaminathan commission report. We will take this tableau to the tractor parade,” said Moga-based artist Manjit Singh, who made the tableau.As farmer bodies have given a call for a peaceful tractor parade, farmer unions have issued directions to their village and block-level leadership to ensure discipline during the march.“Our union’s block-level and village-level leaders will lead the tractor march and rest will follow them,” said Kokrikalan, adding that volunteers would be deployed to keep a check on the situation.In Haryana, farmers from Karnal, Ambala, Rohtak, Bhiwani and Kurukshetra would leave for Delhi, said farmer leaders.Meanwhile, ahead of the proposed tractor parade, the demand for flags of different farm bodies has also gone up.Several vehicles sporting the flags could be seen in Punjab and Haryana. In the wake of the farmers’ agitation and their plan to hold a tractor parade on the Republic Day, the Haryana Police on Thursday decided to cancel the leave of its personnel till further orders.Senior Haryana Police officers were keeping a close eye on the developments related to the farmers’ stir, police sources said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi’s borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops.They claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system. But the Centre says the MSP system will remain and the new laws only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.

23-01-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||'Main bas katt liya, paaji,' says Diljit Dosanjh as he skipped Vogue interview because of his limited English||Punjabi singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh on Thursday revealed how he once sneaked out of a magazine interview as he noticed the interviewer asking everyone the questions in English.  Back in 2019, Diljit had appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine with Kareena Kapoor Khan, Karan Johar, and Natasha Poonawalla.While he posed for pictures, he never actually gave an interview.Taking to BBC Asian Network in 2020, Diljit said that he chose to sit out the interview because he did not feel confident about speaking in English."It is a flaw. Everyone has flaws. Mine is that I do not know English. Yes there was an English madam who wanted to take my interview for Vogue. They called us especially to London to click our pictures. I was so bewildered even when I was on the plane. I was like these people are giving us tickets, booking hotels, just to click photos. Click it anywhere yaar," he had said.A post shared by VOGUE India (@vogueindia)  "When the photos were done, madam ji said she had to do interviews. She was interviewing everyone in English. Main bas katt liya paaji wahan se (I just left the place). I said thank you, just click the photos please," he had added.Earlier speaking about his struggle with English language, Diljit had said: “See, if I get offered a Hinglish film, I cannot really take it up. When I do a Punjabi film, I am able to take a scene, interpret it my way and offer variations. I already struggle with Hindi because of my limited vocabulary. I try to watch Hindi films, pick up a word or an expression but usually, I end up delivering the dialogue I have been given. You cannot do your best unless you have control on the language. But I am not going to let this pass… I am already working towards improving my Hindi and I am not going to die an English illiterate.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/main-bas-katt-liya-paaji-says-diljit-dosanjh-as-he-skipped-vogue-interview-because-of-his-limited-english-202094
