Why did you and your party support the laws wholeheartedly all these months?” he asked Harsimrat and the SAD.Dubbing the SAD as a fake champion of the farmers, the chief minister said unlike the Akalis, who had been playing double games on the farm laws’ issue, Rahul and the entire Congress had been steadfastly fighting for their rights from the outset. “You should be ashamed of playing with the emotions and the lives of the farmers, without none of us can survive a day,” he remarked, asserting that his government will not allow the interests of the farmers to be trampled by the likes of the power-seeking Badals and Kejriwal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-slams-sad-and-aap-over-false-claims-on-farm-laws-being-approved-by-committee-201229

Apart from pending hearing of many cases, litigants who want to file cases are approaching us but since hearing is not taking place, we cannot file new cases.""I have the number of cases pertaining to non-payment of salary from Bathinda, Muktsar and Moga while other advocates also have cases lying pending with them related to job termination among other industrial dispute cases. Our work has also been affected for the past one year," added Jindal.Advocate Ashok Bharti said: "We request the honourable High Court of Punjab and Haryana to make appointment or transfer of judge at labour court in Bathinda so that litigants do not suffer any further and their cases can be heard and settled soon. Since, it's been almost one year now many litigants have stopped coming to us albeit they keep enquiring about their cases via over phone calls, there are some needy ones who keep visiting us in the hope of speedy redressal of their cases."Deputy Commissioner Bathinda B Srinivasan said: "I will take up the matter with concerned authorities and get it resolved on priority basis."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/litigants-suffer-as-bathinda-labour-court-remains-non-operational-for-a-year-201186

The relatives of martyrs have been asked to submit documents to ascertain their antecedents. Today, 11 persons submitted relevant documents, claiming to be the descendants of the martyrs.Confusion over exact numberA state-level function has been scheduled to honour the martyrs’ kin on January 25 at Anand Park in Ranjit Avenue where a separate memorial would be unveiled.The administration has appealed to the public to approach the Deputy Commissioner’s office by January 22 if they have information about the martyrs’ kin. Besides, all MLAs, councillors and sarpanches have been approached with the list.DC Gurpreet Singh Khaira said efforts were being made to ascertain the list’s genuineness. “We are trying to reach out to the kin of the martyrs. It was quite a cumbersome process to identify all, given the fact that the list didn’t have proper contacts and addresses,” he said.However, confusion over the number of deaths and the uncertainty over their names remains with multiple lists projecting different figures. Historian VN Datta, who authored the pioneering work on Jallianwala Bagh (1969), has mentioned that around 700 persons were killed.His daughter and associate professor Nonica Dutta, Department of Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said her father had zeroed in on this estimate on the basis of local police records. Quoting Dutta’s research, she said at the meeting of the Imperial Legislative Council held on September 12, 1919, Congrerss leader Madan Mohan Malaviya had stated 1,000 persons had been killed in the massacre. “My father had also questioned both the official and Congress estimates. There is no clarity on the number of martyrs to date,” she said.The list of the dead and injured prepared by the British then for the purpose of awarding compensation has several discrepancies. Lying at the DC’s office, the list has 501 individuals with many marked as “unidentified”. The list was pruned to 492, as several serial numbers were left blank.A recent study by the Partition Museum Trust put the number at 547 with the names of 45 not known. A board in the precincts of the Jallianwala Bagh earlier put the death toll at 379 and around 1,500 injured. This was published by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust. Also, it was inscripted at the martyrs’ well from where 120 bodies were recovered later on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/101-yrs-on-official-list-of-492-jallianwala-martyrs-out-200778

We will release this data nationwide to show how the government has turned a blind eye towards the farmers’ woes. The entire world is already watching us,” said Rajewal.“During a meeting with the central team engaged in discussions with us recently, I gave them the figures of 125 martyrs. There was not even a whimper of acceptance or regret, showing the insensitive behaviour of the officers dealing with the issue. The number of deaths has increased and our team had collected the data of deaths on Delhi borders. We will now be collecting the figure from all districts in our state.”Assigned the duty of collecting the data from the state, farmer leader Pargat Singh said, “We have the data of about 85 farmers who died on Delhi borders since the first day we came here on November 26 last year. After initiating the exercise of collecting data from across the state, we have got a rough figure of more than 130. We are preparing a detailed list with the help of our workers in different districts.”“Besides deaths due to suicide, other common reasons for casualties are cold weather, particularly during night, pneumonia and cardiac arrests,” said farm activist Gurdev Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/over-130-have-died-since-nov-26-during-farmers-agitation-bku-200780

Agency sources contended the NIA did not intend to harass anybody — be it independent person, activists or farm leaders — involved in the protest. “They all have been asked to come as witness and give clarifications on the information, which the agency already has,” said a senior NIA official.The NIA has summoned nearly 40 persons as witnesses including farm leaders, Sikh activities, journalists and those engaged in the Punjabi entertainment industry.Some of them, including farm leader Baldev Singh Sirsa, have refused to join the NIA investigations after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha decided that the protesting farmers, who have received the NIA notice, would not appear before the agency. In its notices, the NIA has said they were required to appear before the agency, as “it appears they are acquainted with the circumstances of this case”.Meanwhile, security cover in and around the NIA headquarters has been stepped up by barricading the road facing the building and deployment of additional force. Officials in the agency said the steps had been taken as precautionary measure in view of an alleged video where Pannu is seen and heard instigating farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dozen-quizzed-over-farm-stir-funding-200781

Reason: The mining mafia has illegally dug up sand from the area at a large scale in the past few days.Though local residents alleged that the sand from the river was dug up by the men of the contractor who had been awarded the work to de-silt the river, the latter denied the allegations. Now demanding a check on the illegal mining in the area, residents of adjoining villages have started a chain hunger strike near the site.Contractor blamedA visit to the spot revealed that sand was dug up from a vast area of the river adjoining the left bank. As no sand has been left near the studs, villagers said these would be washed away whenever water flows in full stream during monsoon, flooding the nearby villages.Bharati Kisan Union (Kadian) district chief Gurnam Singh Maawi, a resident of adjoining Jassara village, said: “We noticed the rampant digging of the riverbed on Friday and brought it to the notice of the authorities. But nothing has been done so far.”Two held in FazilkaKarnail Singh, a resident of Rasidpur village, said: “The contractor was supposed to lift sand from the middle of the river from less than one acre of the area. Instead, hundreds of tippers were loaded with sand being dug from areas adjoining the bank of the river and this has weakened the foundation of the studs.”Deepak Gupta, the contractor’s supervisor, said: “We started working here on January 12. Till now, we have just levelled a stretch of the riverbed to make a path for tippers. The missing sand was lifted before we even started working here.”Sukhwinder Singh Kalsi, Xen, drainage, said: “The contractor is supposed to de-silt the riverbed at a distance of 300 feet from the riverbank. I have already received a complaint from the villagers. I will look into the issue.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/flood-threat-in-chamkaur-sahib-as-miners-rob-sutlej-of-sand-200815
