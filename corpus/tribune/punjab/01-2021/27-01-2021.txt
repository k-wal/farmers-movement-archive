Jugraj then agreed to climb up the flagpole to hoist the flag,” Mehal said about his grandson. “He is innocent.” He expressed fear that the police would now conduct raids at their house to catch the young man.Jugraj is son of Baldev Singh who has three other children. The family owns 3 acres of farmland in the village.Wielding sticks and clubs and holding the tricolour and union flags, tens of thousands of farmers atop tractors broke barriers, had clashed with police and had entered the national capital from various points to lay siege to the Red Fort.After entering the Red Fort, protesters put up the ‘Nishan Sahib’ and a farmer flag on a flagpole, which triggered massive outrage across the country.The ‘Nishan Sahib’ flag, a symbol of Sikh religion, is seen at all Gurdwara complexes.

For this fearless fight, Government of India, awarded him “Shaurya Chakra” in 1993. Besides Balwinder Singh Sandhu and his wife Jagdish Kaur, his elder brother Ranjit Singh and his wife Balraj Kaur had also received the Shaurya Chakra,” a senior NIA official said.During the initial investigation by Punjab Police, it was revealed that the killing was executed under a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan based Khalistani Terrorist Lakvir Singh Rode and his handlers in Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, the officials said, adding that the killing was executed through Sukhmeet Pal Singh alias Sukh Bhikariwal, resident of Bhikariwal village, Kalanaur, Gurdaspur, a gangster-turned-terrorist.“Considering the gravity of the offence and its inter-state and international ramifications, the Ministry of Home Affairs directed NIA to take up the investigation of the case.

27-01-2021||Chandigarh||Not involved in Jan 26 Delhi violence: Lakha Sidhana||Gangster-turned-social activist Lakhbir Singh aka Lakha Sidhana on Wednesday distanced himself from the violence during the tractor parade in New Delhi on Republic Day and he and some farmer leaders only marched up to the Outer Ring Road in the national capital.Denying his involvement in the incidents at the Red Fort, he said it is a matter of investigation how people reached there despite so much security.“I am pained at the incidents that took place on Tuesday but I am not involved in these. There is no video, photo or other evidence that shows that I instigated people. We had marched towards the Outer Ring Road under our farmer leaders in a peaceful manner. We never had any agenda of going towards the Red Fort,” Sidhana, who is in his 40s, told PTI over phone.He said nearly 20 farmer leaders went till Ring Road with their cadres in a peaceful manner and returned soon after.On being asked that they were not allowed to go up to the Ring Road, Sidhana claimed popular sentiment was in support of it as farmer unions had announced first on January 2 and then on January 17 that they will carry out the tractor rally there.He accused the government and police of conspiring against the farmers’ agitation and distanced himself from the allegations of instigating protesters, saying he always called for peace.He also denied the allegations that he shared the stage with Punjab actor Deep Sidhu at the Singhu border on Monday night, claiming that he had just spoken there to calm down people who wanted to take out the march on the Outer Ring Road.Sidhana, a native of Punjab’s Bathinda, has been camping at the Singhu border since November 26.He has dozens of criminal cases registered against him in Punjab and went to jail several times but has claimed in the past that he had quit the crime world. Since then he is said to be involved in social work.He had earlier dabbled into politics during the 2012 Punjab assembly elections, contesting on the symbol of the now-defunct People’s Party of Punjab, which was formed by the state’s current Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal after quitting the Shiromani Akali Dal.Later, Badal joined the Congress and contested the 2017 assembly polls on the party ticket.Tens of thousands of farmers had broken barriers to storm the national capital on Tuesday.Clashes broke out in multiple places, leading to violence in well-known landmarks of Delhi and its suburbs. While there were no exact estimates of how many farmers were hurt, Delhi Police officials said 86 of their men were injured through the day. Of these, 41 were injured at the Red Fort.A protester died after his tractor overturned near ITO, one of the major flashpoints of trouble.In a statement, the police said protesting farmers violated the conditions agreed on for their tractor parade.“The farmers began tractor rally before scheduled time, they also resorted to violence and vandalism,” Delhi Police PRO Eish Singhal had said.

27-01-2021||Chandigarh||Violence at Red Fort an insult to nation, says Punjab CM Amarinder||Deploring the Republic Day violence in Delhi, especially at the Red Fort, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday termed it an insult to the nation and said it had brought shame to the country and weakened farmers’ agitation, but made it clear that he continued to stand with the farmers as the farm laws were wrong and against India’s federal ethos.Stressing that the Red Fort is a symbol of independent India and thousands of Indians had given up their lives for Independence and to see the national flag flying atop the fort, the chief minister said Mahatama Gandhi had fought the entire war of independence through non-violence.“My head hangs in shame at what happened yesterday in the national capital,” he said.“Whoever has done it (indulged in violence at Red Fort) has brought shame to the country and Delhi Police should investigate and take action,” he said, adding that the Centre should also probe the involvement, if any, of any political party or nation, while making sure that no farm leaders are unnecessarily targeted or harassed by the police.The chief minister declared that the future of Punjab’s youth lay in peace and recent developments had slowed down investment in the state.Even as he demanded action against the perpetrators, who he said were not farmers but misguided youth indulging in symbolism, the chief minister said that such problems will continue to take place if the government fails to listen to the voice of the people.A government for the people and by the people cannot ignore the will of the people, he said, adding that the performance of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre will not be acceptable in the next elections to the majority in a country where 70 per cent of the population is of farmers.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) should realise that stability and secularism, encompassing all minorities, is the key to inclusive growth of the nation and playing the Hindutva card will not lead to progress, he remarked.“The farm laws are wrong, which is why we passed our own laws,” Capt Amarinder said, pointing out that agriculture is a state subject, yet “we were not asked before introducing the Ordinances”. Categorically rejecting allegations of his government being in the know on the issue, he said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was spreading false propaganda and the fact was that Punjab was not even initially included in the expert committee as the Centre knew the state will oppose their laws.Punjab had nothing to do with the policy decision taken by the Central government, he said, pointing out that even when the state was eventually included in the committee after he personally wrote to GoI, there was no discussion or consultation on the farm ordinances.In fact, the draft report received later from the Niti Aayog, to which his government gave point-by-point response, also made no mention of the ordinances, he added.Lamenting that the Governor had not yet forwarded the state amendment Bills to the President for assent, he said the laws were passed in the state assembly under Article 254(II) of the Constitution, as the BJP had done in the case of the Land Acquisition Act.“If it could be done for the BJP, why can’t they do it for us,” he asked, questioning the biased attitude towards the Congress government in Punjab.“Why have state governments at all, if their powers are to be systematically reduced,” asked Capt Amarinder, pointing out that the Anandpur Sahib resolution, passed 50 years ago, had demanded strengthening of the federal structure but it is instead being weakened further.Reiterating that the farm laws will be death knell for the economic empowerment of the future generations of the farmers who are protesting against the legislations, the chief minister said private corporates were even now functioning in Punjab and could continue coming into the state without destroying the established system of MSP, Arhtiyas and PDS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/violence-at-red-fort-an-insult-to-nation-says-punjab-cm-amarinder-204128

27-01-2021||---||How extremist elements hijacked farmers' rally and Deep Sidhu’s role in chaos||Chandigarh, January 26Amid slogans of 'Raj karega Khalsa', actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu handed over a 'kesri' flag to a man to hoist on the ramparts of the Red Ford on Tuesday afternoon -- the Republic Day.Also readOpposition blames Centre for capital siege, hopes farm unions will reclaim the agitationSamyukta Kisan Morcha calls off tractor march after Delhi violenceI feel ashamed and take responsibility: Yogendra Yadav on violence during tractor paradeViolence brought a bad name to farm protest: Rakesh TikaitDespite being shunned by farmer unions at various stages of the ongoing anti-farm law agitation, Deep Sidhu has been attempting to take a leadership role in the movement for the past several months.Pushed to the periphery of the agitation, Deep Sidhu bounced back one day ahead of the planned tractor march of Tuesday. He was seen campaigning for the march on the Outer Ring Road. The position taken by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee in favour of sticking to the original plan of holding the parade on the Outer Ring Road, along with another extreme Left-leaning body Bharti Kisan Union (Krantikari), which is part of the 32 farmer organisations, gave Deep Sidhu the opportunity to push for not following the new route agreed upon.On Monday evening, Deep Sidhu took over the main stage at Singhu, and along with gangster-turned-social activist Lakha Sidhana, announced they would hold the march “inside Delhi”.According to sources, they also had support from certain extreme Left-leaning elements among the 32 organisations in the plan for not following the agreed upon route. They had a plan ready by Tuesday morning. First, they started a march of their own much before the official march of the farmer unions, and positioned their 'henchmen' in large numbers at a road turning towards central Delhi. From there they directed other tractors towards the Red Fort instead of the agreed route. At one point of time, volunteers of farmer unions tried to intervene in this, but they were outnumbered by the Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana group.This contingency had been foreseen by farmer unions long back. Around a month ago, during a meeting of the 32 farmer unions, one of the leaders had termed Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana as “enemies of this struggle”.Since the start of the agitation, the common concern among the 32 organisations was that the two were pushing the “struggle” towards a communal path.Rajinder Singh Deepsingh Walavice-president of Kirti Kisan UnionThe Centre has been trying from the very beginning to paint this movement in a communal colour. They are master of religious games, but in this struggle led by farmers, they are for the first time at the receiving end. Deep Sidhu has served them well.Deep Sidhu, who has acted in a few Punjabi films, surprised everybody last year when he raised a question over the leadership of the farmer unions and announced to launch his own 'morcha' at Shambu.During the last Lok Sabha election, Deep Sidhu was campaigning to strengthen the BJP, and had even posed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he was the election agent of the party’s Gurdaspur candidate Sunny Deol. He was accused of being an “RSS agent” by farmer unions in Punjab.The 'Shambu morcha', as he called it, soon started receiving “live streaming” support from some pro-Khalistan channels and Deep Sidhu would often attack the 'Leftist' leadership of the unions. He would cite the example of Jews and motivate people to fight for a “Sikh homeland”.A question being raised now is over his shift from supporting “Hindu Right” to “Sikh Right wing”. He himself gave the explanation that it was Naxalite-turned-Khalistan proponent Ajmer Singh's books on Sikh history that changed his perception. Farmer unions, however, openly allege that Sidhu is a “front man” of Ajmer Singh.As farmer unions gave no space to Sidhu during the agitation, after November 26-27 -- when farmers reached at the doorstep of Delhi -- Sidhu in a TV interview asked people to go back as the “Communists” wanted to use their children as cannon fodder. Soon, however, he was seen backtracking from the statement.Around two weeks back, in a letter sent to the unions, he expressed a desire to get associated with their platforms. However, the plea was rejected.***We only hoisted the Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest, India flag not removed : Deep SidhuDeep Sidhu has posted a video on his Facebook page saying, “We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest.”He said in such a protest, people’s anger flares up and you cannot blame one person for inciting the protesters.Also readTractor parade becomes violent; farmers enter Red Fort, hoist flag32 farmer unions from Punjab not responsible for violence: RajewalHe said they went to the Red Fort as a symbolic protest and didn’t remove the Tricolour, but hoisted the Nishan Sahib as a sign of “unity in diversity”.He also said that today’s incident shouldn’t be seen in isolation as the farmers’ protest has been going on for the past few months.Sidhu said the protesters didn’t go to Delhi to hurt anyone or damage government property and should not be termed as communal elements or hardliners.He said the protest was peaceful and symbolic and the emotions of the people should be understood and no one person should be blamed for the mobilisation of people or protest.He added India’s flag was not removed from the flagpole, and they only hoisted the Kisan Mazdoor Ekta’s flag and the Nishan Sahib.Deep Sidhu had campaigned for BJP's Sunny Deol during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.Two agitators hoisted their own flags after climbing the flagstaff at the Red Fort where thousands of protesters stormed, creating a major law and order issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/how-extremist-elements-hijacked-farmers-rally%C2%A0and-deep-sidhus-role-in-chaos-203993
27-01-2021||Vishav Bharti||Once a small breakaway faction, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee now at centre of Delhi struggle||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 26Around 15 years ago, when a small group led by Stanam Singh Pannu broke away from parent organisation Kisan Sangharsh Committee, nobody beyond the majha area of Punjab even took notice of the development. But over the years, due to its struggles, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) gained momentum and emerged as one of the main farmer unions of the state.Once a small group of majha, now the KMSC has strong presence in almost seven or eight districts of Punjab. Once an activist of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Pannu, who hails from Piddi village near Tarn Taran district, has been active in the farmers’ movement for the past almost three decades. He along with some other members broke away from the CPM around two decades back and formed the Kisan Sangarsh Committee.            However, Satnam Singh Pannu developed differences with leader Kanwalpreet Singh over the “dictatorial attitude” in the organisation and formed Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee Punjab in 2007 after his demand for election for the office bearers of the union was turned down.Now the organisation has presence in almost seven or eight districts, including Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar and Fazilka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/once-a-small-breakaway-faction-kisan-mazdoor-sangharsh-committee-now-at-centre-of-delhi-struggle-203986
27-01-2021||---||MHA orders additional forces in Delhi as farmers lay siege to the Red Fort, break Tikri Border barricades||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 26The Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered additional forces to be deployed inside Delhi after clashes erupted in several parts of the national capital during a tractor rally on Tuesday, official sources said.The directions come after a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Ten of the 15 companies would be from the Central Reserved Police Force, official sources said.Meanwhile, Delhi Police Commissioner has ordered his force to deal with “trouble making” protesters who still remained in the national capital with a strong hand, sources said.They said some people still remained at the ITO, one of the scenes of chaos.Additional forces have also been stationed at the Red Fort, another scene of chaos.As an immediate measure the Home Ministry suspended internet connection around the most volatile Singhu, Tikri and Nangloi areas until midnight on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, thousands of farmers broke barricades at Nangloi and entered the city to march towards the Red Fort, where thousands of protesters had reached earlier on Tuesday after breaking barricades, flashing weapons, damaging public property, and threatening to run over cops with speeding tractors. A farmer from Uttarakhand, Navneet, died when the speeding tractor he was driving turned turtle, said the Delhi police, even as several farmers sat on a dharna at ITO beside the body of the deceased.Unprecedented scenes of chaos and vandalism erupted across central Delhi on Tuesday as the two month farmer agitation turned violent and went out of control of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body that had promised a peaceful tractor parade on the Republic Day. The morcha and the Delhi Police had arrived at a 37-point understanding before the tractor parade permission was granted. None of the agreed upon points were honoured, as was clear from the start of the day with the farmers breaking into Delhi from all borders even before the Republic Day parade on Rajpath had concluded.At Ghazipur Border, thousands of farmers broke into Delhi’s arterial roads and reached ITO intersection right next to the Delhi police headquarters. The ITO looked like a war zone for hours with farmers on tractors ramming across and many clashing with the police, which lobbed tear gas shells to contain the crowds.Several protesters defied police appeals not to move towards the Red Fort and stormed the historic structure before hoisting saffron flags aloft the Red Fort in visuals that enraged netizens and commoners alike.Farm union leader Yogendra Yadav’s video appeal to the farmers to maintain peace and return to the decided route went unheeded.“If we violate peace, we will not win. We appeal to farmers to return to the path of peace. Do not undermine the peaceful farmers’ protests,” said Yadav as the union leaders washed hands off the protesters.Another farm union leader Rakesh Tikait alleged he had identified the miscreants and these agitators were part of a political party.While government ministers condemned the violence and the unfurling of a specific flag at the Red Fort with culture minister Prahlad Patel leading the charge, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said violence was no solution and asked the government to repeal the farm laws against which the farmers have been agitating for over two months now. A host of Congress leaders including Kumari Selja and Sachin Pilot demanded the laws be rescinded.HOW THE TRACTOR PARADE WENT AWRY10:00 am: Farmers break barricades at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur Borders to enter Delhi’s arterial roads; this even though the R Day Parade was on. The agreement with the police was that the police will remove the barricades once the R Day parade ends10:30 pm: Farmers at Ghazipur Border break the first barricade at Ghazipur check point and move in towards Delhi violating the route agreement under which they were to take a U turn towards Anand Vihar and return to the highway.11:00 am: Farmers at Ghazipur break the second barrier at Noida Link Road and move past Akshardham towards central Delhi ITO, saying “we will conquer the Red Fort. 11:15 am: Ghazipur Border was the most volatile with section of farmers using tractors to break concrete barricades; some Nihangs flashed swords at cops but were prevented by other protesters12:00 pm: Farmers from across all borders mainly Ghazipur reach ITO, clash with police to march towards India Gate and Red Fort.

27-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||32 farmer unions from Punjab not responsible for violence: Rajewal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 26Amid growing criticism of violence by a section of farmers in Delhi, the leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of farmer unions agitating against the three farm laws, on Tuesday said the the 32 Punjab unions were following the set routes. It is the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Commitee that broke the rules and routes, they added."The rest are all following the set routes. The first group that broke the set routes was not part of the Punjab platform and since Monday farmer leaders from SKM were pleading with them not to do this," said Kavitha Kuruganti.Balbir Singh Rajewal also said that the 32 unions from Punjab are following the route and rules. Rajewal criticised the violence and distanced himself from those indulging in violence, saying they were not part of the unions from Punjab.Though the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Commitee (KMSC) may not be  a part of the platform of the 32 Punjab unions they participate in the SKM meetings.Kavitha said, "Though they (KMSC) sit in the (SKM) meetings, on the issue related to the route of the parade they had separately negotiated with the police all day on Monday. And they did not listen to any SKM leader asking them not to force their way into Delhi."While farmers took centrestage at the ITO and Red Fort, official sources said the SKM and its leaders were lauded by Union ministers for peaceful conduct of the agitation.“Therefore, the responsibility that the agitation remains peaceful was also the responsibility of the unions and farmer leaders, which they failed today," they said.Samyukta Kisan Morcha issued a detailed statement condemning the violence."We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts," the umbrella body of farmer unions heading the agitation said  Unions said despite their efforts, "some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts"."Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength, and that any violation would hurt the movement", the statement said."We dissociate ourselves from all such elements that have violated our discipline. We appeal strongly to everyone to stick to the route and norms of the Parade, and not indulge in any violent action or anything that taints national symbols and dignity. We appeal to everyone to desist from any such acts," the statement said. Meanwhile, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait claimed that those who were trying to create trouble had been identified. He said, “They belong to a political party, and we have identified them.”Tikait appealed to protesters to keep to the parade's planned route. He said in a tweet in Hindi: "Farmers should maintain discipline. Parade on the designated path. Anybody who has forgotten the route and moved toward Delhi should return to the 'dharna'".किसान अनुशासन बनाये रखे। निर्धारित रास्ते पर ही परेड करे। अगर कुछ लोग रास्ता भूलकर दिल्ली की और चले गए है। वह वापस अपने धरने पर पहुचे।#KisanParade @ANI @PTI_News  Given below is a detailed statement from the SKMWe thank farmers for the unprecedented participation in today's Farmers Republic Day Parade. We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts.Despite all our efforts, some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts. Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength, and that any violation would hurt the movement.The long struggle for more than 6 months now, and more than 60 days of protest at Delhi borders also seemed to have led to this situation.We dissociate ourselves from all such elements that have violated our discipline. We appeal strongly to everyone to stick to the route and norms of the Parade, and not indulge in any violent action or anything that taints national symbols and dignity. We appeal to everyone to desist from any such acts.SKM has been trying to get a full picture of all the events with regard to the several Kisan Parades that were planned today and will share a fuller statement soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/32-farmer-unions-from-punjab-not-responsible-for-violence-rajewal-203969
