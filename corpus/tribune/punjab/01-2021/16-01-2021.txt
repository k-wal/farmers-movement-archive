16-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC transfers Rohingya refugee boy from Amritsar to Nuh camp||A mother will be united with her son in a refugee camp at Nuh. Acting on a habeas petition filed by the mother, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the son’s transfer from Amritsar to Chandeni Rohingya Refugee Camp in Nuh tehsil of Mewat district “to enable him to stay with his mother”.The direction by Justice Gurvinder Singh Gill came on a petition against the Union of India and other respondents by the mother through counsel Bhanu Pratap Singh for directions to produce her son and to set him at liberty.During the course of arguments, her counsel, however, confined his submissions to the transfer of petitioner’s son from Amritsar, where he was presently detained in a center. Bhanu Partap Singh told the court that the petitioner’s son had allegedly entered India without proper documents and passport. He was stated to have been later registered as a refugee. His main contention was that both the petitioner and her son be kept at one place till they were deported, if they were to be detained.Appearing before the Bench, Additional Solicitor-General of India Satya Pal Jain said the Union Ministry of Home Affairs or Union of India had no objection in case the petitioner’s son was transferred from Amritsar to Chandeni Rohingya Refugee Camp provided the States of Punjab and Haryana did not have any objections.Responding to a court query, the law officers representing Punjab and Haryana stated both the States possibly could not have any objection to transfer the petitioner’s son to enable him to stay with his mother.“In view of the position, the present petition is accepted. Additional Director-General of Police (Prisons), Punjab, is directed to do the needful for arranging for the conveyance and for ensuring that the petitioner’s son is taken from Amritsar, where he is presently detained in a detention centre and consigned to Chandeni Rohingya Refugee Camp, Nuh tehsil,” Justice Gill concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-hc-transfers-rohingya-refugee-boy-from-amritsar-to-nuh-camp-199437

During the lockdown period, 17 lakh free food kits were distributed to the poor.He also lauded the endeavour of the Food and Civil Supplies Department to plug leakages in Public Distribution System with the introduction of ePOS machines using biometrics, to ensure that ration only goes to the rightful beneficiaries.Captain Amarinder Singh said that as part of the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgaar te Karobar Mission’, the state government had so far facilitated more than 15 lakh placements/self-employment.Of the total 15.08 lakh jobs provided to the youth, 58,000 have been given government jobs (including contractual) and 5.69 lakh placed in the private sector, while 8.80 lakh youth had been facilitated to take up self-employment ventures till date, from April 1, 2017 when the Mission was launched, he informed.Speaking on the occasion, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar said that the Amarinder Singh-led government in the state had ensured timely lifting, procurement and payment of farmers' produce.E-pos machines, smart ration cards were among the other landmark initiatives undertaken by the state government, said Jakhar.He further said that cooperative societies must also be given benefits of the ration depots scheme.In his virtual address from Ludhiana, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu thanked the Chief Minister for the increase in the margin money paid to FPS owners for distribution of food grains from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per quintal retrospectively, from April 1, 2016, thereby fulfilling the long pending demand of the FPS owners.Punjab Youth Congress president Barinder Singh Dhillon said that this landmark initiative under the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar te Karobaar Mission’ would provide ample job avenues to the youth.Notably, the Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Punjab, had invited applications for granting 7,219 Fair Price Shop (FPS) licenses in the state with 987 urban and 6232 rural vacancies.The department has followed a very transparent mechanism in granting these licenses.Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu; Principal Secretary Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, KAP Sinha; Director, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Ravi Bhagat; and Additional Secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Jaspreet Singh also attended the function.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-kicks-off-allotment-of-fair-price-shops-under-ghar-ghar-rozgar-te-karobaar-mission-199394

The court has summoned both accused police officers on February 9.The SIT had nominated Saini and Umranangal as accused in the case of murder and attempt to murder of Behbal Kalan in September 2020. In the chargesheet, the SIT claimed both police officers had been found guilty in the case on the basis of documentary evidence and the statements of witnesses. A week after the killing of two Sikh protesters in police firing at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, an FIR was registered on October 21, 2015, at the Bajakhana police station under Sections 302, 307 and 34 of the IPC and Sections 25, 27, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act. The complainant in the FIR was Iqbal Singh Sahota, director, bureau of investigation-cum-chairman, SIT, which was constituted on the directions of the Punjab DGP.Earlier, no police officer was nominated as an accused in the FIR but later, the SIT had nominated many police officers as accused in the case.In the supplementary chargesheet, the SIT has relied upon 22 phone calls, allegedly made between the then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and IGP Paramraj Singh Umranangal, to buttress its claim that the former DGP was a part of the conspiracy of “unprovoked” firing on protesters.The firing on the protesters at both places was a part of an already hatched conspiracy. The accused police officers did not procure necessary permission from the duty magistrate or SDM before resorting to unprovoked firing on the protesters, the chargesheet alleged.The SIT claimed that its investigation had found that Umranangal was in constant touch with Saini and after getting directions from him, he told then SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma and others to use force on the protesters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/chargesheet-filed-against-sumedh-saini-paramraj-singh-umranangal-in-police-firing-case-199078

This saving will help the state power utility to come out of the red and reduce its annual revenue requirements. Courtesy the saving, the PSPCL after several years hasn’t paid the late payment surcharge on power it buys from other power generators. The power utility had paid Rs 41.54 crore as late payment surcharge last year, and Rs 55.37 crore in 2018-19. By reducing its cost of borrowings and increasing its overdraft limits, the state power utility managed to pay the charges for buying power from other private and government-owned power generators on time. This helped the PSPCL save Rs 140 crore as it got a two per cent rebate for making timely payments. “Another Rs 50 crore has been saved as late payment surcharge, which we were paying each year to power generators such as NPL, NTPC, etc,” said A Venu Prasad, CMD. Each year, the state power utility would buy power worth Rs 29,000 crore, besides generating its own power at the state-owned plants, getting supply from the three private power plants, etc. Prasad told The Tribune this year the external borrowing was much less, and that the PSPCL had managed to reduce the cost of interest on borrowings by negotiating with financial institutions and getting the interest rate reduced from 11.5 per cent to 8-8.5 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/better-fund-mgmt-helps-pspcl-save-rs190-cr-199086

Parvendar (25) was shot dead by contract killers hired by his fiancée Prem Kumari on January 4 last year. His body was found in a drain on the outskirts of Peshawar. Talking to The Tribune over phone, Harmeet said Prem Kumari and her accomplices had recently procured bail from the high court. Harmeet claimed that since he belonged to a minority community, he feared he might not be able to pursue his brother’s case as the authorities appeared to be going soft on the accused from the majority community. “Today, I received a call from the Peshawar jail. The man on the other side introduced himself as Mohammad Ibrahim, who had shot my brother. He threatened me with dire consequences if I did not compromise in the case. I was aghast that he used the jail’s phone to threaten me fearlessly.” “I have appealed to Pakistan PM Imran Khan and the Chief Justice to take cognisance of the incident as my whole family is under threat,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sikh-anchor-in-pak-claims-threat-from-brothers-killers-199062

However, they were immediately stopped by the cops from marching towards Raj Bhawan, forcing the party leaders to stage a dharna near the Congress Bhawan.Addressing the protesters, Jakhar said the central government was behaving in an arrogant manner and did not have any respect for democratic practices and public opinion. “It is the arrogance of the central government that is preventing it from repealing the laws which have been outrightly rejected by the farming community across the country,” Jakhar said, while warning against the prolonged stalemate on the issue.He said it was after a long struggle by the Congress that constitutional institutions had been set up and strengthened, and now the BJP was trying to undermine all such institutions as it had hardly any value or respect for them. “Arrogance of the central government was not only challenging but undermining the democratic and constitutional institutions of the country,” he said.Paying glowing tributes to the farmers who laid down their lives during the ongoing protests, party leaders said they were the martyrs of the movement and held the Modi government responsible for their martyrdom.“The way the central government was responsible for pushing our soldiers into the death trap in Galwan heights by the lack of will and planning, in a similar way the government is accountable for pushing our farmers to death,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/march-to-punjab-raj-bhawan-foiled-cong-protests-at-party-office-199068

He alleged Bhupinder was included in the committee under an agreement with the CM.Mann claimed when farmers refused to appear before the committee, the CM changed his stance and took his man out in view of public outrage. “Bhupinder should now clarify whether he decided to come out of the committee after listening to his heart or at CM’s insistence,” he added.He said the Congress government initially supported the “black laws” by forming a committee and misleading people of the state by not telling them about the dangers of the laws. When people started protesting, he passed a resolution in the Assembly to mislead them again.Mann said Capt Amarinder had assured people of fighting a legal battle against the laws, but despite a battery of lawyers with the Advocate General, no legal action had been initiated so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-remark-on-bhupinder-singh-mann-proves-collusion-aap-199072

They said they would not part way with their land their remaining portion after acquisition would be of no use, and also the compensation was meagre.The farmers raised slogans against the central and the state governments. They said the Centre aimed to acquire land from 11 districts without addressing their concerns.Committee chief Sukhdev Singh Dhillon said, “The multiplication factor for the acquisition of the land is low. The compensation applicable as per newly released notification is meagre.”The state government, in a notification this week, modified multiplication factor rates for land acquisition. According to it, the market value of the property to be acquired will be multiplied by one in case the land falls within 5 km from the outer boundary of any municipal corporation. It will be multiplied by 1.25 in case the land falls within 5 km from the outer boundary of any council or committee.

He alleged that the Modi government was out to “finish the federal structure of governance” to promote a few corporate houses.“What the protesters are doing is 100 per cent justified. The new farm Acts will not only kill farmers, it will also finish arhtiyas and result in an end to the public distribution system, which provides free foodgrains to 67 per cent of the poor,” Sidhu said, adding that it was wrong to term the agitating farmers anti-national or Khalistanis, when all they were demanding was the rollback of the laws.Claiming that the Centre was responsible for rising debts of Food Corporation of India (FCI), Sidhu attributed the FCI’s attrition to the government’s policy of poor allocation. “FCI’s debt stood at Rs 91,000 crore from the time it was set up to 2014, when Modi took over. Now the debt is Rs 4 lakh crore,” he said.He also accused the central government of providing undue help to corporate houses. “Silos are owned by a certain business group in many states. Their total storage capacity is 8.5 lakh metric tonnes. The government gave a 30-year contract to a particular company with a clause that even if a silo has only 5 per cent stock, the government would pay full rent. In addition, maximum support price (is given) to silos, which is an out of turn arrangement and an increase in rent with market rate. Why is there no such arrangement for farmers?” he questioned.Later, a Centre-appointed committee recommended that silos be converted into procurement centres. “This will kill arhtiya system. Procurement will only be done by this certain business group. The government wants to give 25 lakh metric tonne storage that too on FCI land across the country to a corporate house,” Sidhu said. He also accused the central government of trying to reduce the number of people entitled to foodgrain from the public distribution system. “When the entire country’s stock will be controlled by one corporate, the poor will have to buy grains at prices fixed by them,” claimed Sidhu.On his role in the state government, Sidhu said this was not the right time to talk about his own political future but “think about ways and means to strengthen the agitation led by farmers”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-arm-twisting-stir-backers-navjot-sidhu-199074

Some people are saying that the national flag should be hoisted at the Red Fort, some are saying the Parliament will be stormed,” Rajewal said, accusing “anti-farmer forces and government agencies” of trying to malign and scuttle the peaceful agitation of farmers and common people. Morcha leaders also condemned inflammatory statements by an organizstion called ‘Sikhs for Justice’“We urge farmers to be aware of such organisations which are breaking the unity among us," they said.Though Samyukta Kisan Motcha leaders said they are yet to finalise the contours of January 26 tractor march, BKU leader from Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Tikait, has already announced programme for the day. He said on Thursday that farmers will hold a simultaneous parade from Red Fort to India Gate on Republic Day.  “The Republic Day Parade has been cut short, it will now be from Rastrapati Bhawan to India Gate, I am told.

16-01-2021||Akhara||Dens of  belief: Akharas of Amritsar||The city has 12 Udasi Akharas, but only a few are now functional. Some of these shifted to Haridwar and Rishikesh after the formation of modern organisations to manage the gurdwara affairs, while some are now sands.Earlier, Udasi and Nirmala saints associated with these akharas used to manage the Sikh shrines till 1920, the foundation year of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). The akhara chief gives his seat to unmarried saints only. In modern days, several saints now find any inheritor to run it. So, after the death of mahants, people caught hold of these properties.History of Sikh akharasSikh Historian Kahan Singh Nabha mentioned in his ‘Mahan Kosh’ that in the mid 18th century, eminent Udasi saint Mahant Nirvan Pritam Das noticed that saints face inconvenience during their visits at Sikh shrines and gurpurbs. To provide boarding and lodging facility in 1779, Pritam Das established a Panchayti akhara. He also constructed some akharas at Kashi Kankhal (Haridwar) and Hindu pilgrimage sites. Later, Mahants of Nirmala sect also established their akharas for educational and spiritual purposes in the city and other holy cities. However, most of the mahants believe that these were established by Sri Chand, the elder son of Guru Nanak Dev.Akhara Tehal DasIt is located on Katra Jallian, on the road heading towards Jallianwala Bagh. Once a prominent akhara, it lies abandoned now. The incumbent mahant resides at Malwa village. The samadhi (tomb) of Mahant Tehal Das is located at the plaza outside the Golden Temple.Akhara Kashi WalaIt was located near Sultanwind Gate and established by Mahant Narain Das in 1795. The akhara provides lodging facilities for devotees in the holy city.Akhara Shatte WalaThe original name of the akhara was Parag Das, given after one of the mahants. Due to a balcony over the old building gate, it came to be known as Akhara Shatte Wala. It is located near Chowk Parag Das.Akhara Bala NandBala Nand was the successor of Tehal Das. He established a separate akhara in 1775. A great scholar of Sanskrit, Jalle Wale Sardar Albel Singh provided funds to run it. In 1888, akhara head Bishambar Das constructed a three-storey colossal gate, which is mind-boggling enough for the tourists. It also has beautiful frescos on its walls and rooms. The Sikh history is depicted through the paintings by Udasi saints. The akhara had a tradition of teaching Sanskrit, which was alive till 1984. “Later, the universities introduced Sanskrit courses and students don’t visit the akhara anymore,” said a custodian.Akhara Brahm ButaThe oldest akhara in the city is Akhara Brahm Buta. It’s located on the northern corner of the Golden Temple. The historians believe that Baba Shri Chand stayed here when he visited the city during the regime of fourth Sikh master Guru Ram Das. Nirban Santokh Das was one of the prominent mahants of the akhara during the Misl period that fought against Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1762. The same mahant had constructed Hansli (water channel) to feed the sarovar of Darbar Sahib in 1783. According to the history written inside the akhara, Maharaja Ranjit Singh was born with the blessing of Mahant Santokh Das. Later, the maharaja allotted a large property to them.Akhara BibbeksarIt was established by Mahant Balak Nath on the backside of gurdwara Bibbeksar Sahib in Katra Ramgarhia, now known as Kulfi Mohalla. Maharaja Ranjit Singh gave grant for erecting the akhara’s gate in 1825. The huge doorway still exists, but in a rueful state. The mahants have another akhara in Haridwar.Akhara Kashi Wala of Gheo MandiThe akhara was founded by Mahant Sharan Das during the Sikh empire. Maharaja Ranjit Singh gifted the land at Tung village. It is still a centre of Udasi sect’s activities.Sanglan Wala AkharaThe akahra was established by Mahant Pritam Das in 1788 in Bazaar Mai Sevan. Two heavy iron chains were installed on the main gate, so devotees named it Sanglan Wala Akhara. It owns good property near the Golden Temple, including the temple of Laungan Wali Devi near Town Hall. Mahant Pritam Das was a well-known Udasi saint, who also constructed a temple inside it. Astonishingly, the old fane is still intact.Dhuna: Most of the akharas have a hearth, where saints of Udasi sect do sadhna and yagya.Gerua flag: Gerua (a red ochre) colour flag topped with peacock’s wings can be seen waving at every Udasi dera and akhara.Frescos and buildings: There was a tradition with Udasi saints to depict the Sikh history and mythology with the wall paintings murals and frescos inside their deras. The deras in city are enriched with the wall painting, though the inner circles of akharas are not open for all due to their spiritual beliefs.Chitta AkharaIt is located in Bazaar Mai Sevan. It was established by Mahant Ganga Ram Viakarani, an expert of Sanskrit and Gurmukhi grammar. Chiefs of Sikh misls gave him grant to run langar near the Golden Temple. A major tourist attraction, several classic frescos are painted on its walls. At present, Damodar Das is the mahant of the akhara.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dens-of-belief-akharas-of-amritsar-198715
