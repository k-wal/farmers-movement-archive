01-01-2021||New Delhi||Cold wave to abate in north India, temperatures likely to rise by 3-5 degrees Celsius from Jan 3: IMD||North India, which has been reeling under severe cold wave, is likely to get some relief from January 3 as temperatures are expected to rise by three to five degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.A western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation lies over Afghanistan and its neighbourhood at the middle and upper tropospheric levels is likely to move slightly eastwards to central Pakistan and its neighbourhood during the next 48 hours and remain practically stationary there during the subsequent three or four days.There is also an induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan."Under the influence of these systems light/moderate fairly widespread rainfall/snowfall over the western Himalayan region is likely during January 4-6. With its peak intensity on January 4 and 5, there is a possibility of heavy rain/snow over Jammu and Kashmir. Hailstorm at isolated places is also likely over western Himalayan region during this time," the IMD said.Minimum temperatures over the north Indian plains are between one to six degrees Celsius except at isolated places in  south Haryana and north Rajasthan where it is between zero to minus one degree Celsius."These are very likely to increase gradually by three to five degrees Celsius over these regions during the next three days and no significant change (is expected) thereafter for the subsequent three days," said the IMD."Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are prevailing over many parts of the plains of northwest India and adjoining central India. These are likely to continue over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during the next 24 hours and abate thereafter," it said.Dense to very dense fog in isolated pockets are likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and north Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours of January 2 and 3, and likely to abate thereafter, the IMD said.

01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab: Protesters unload dung-laden trolley outside BJP leader's house||A group of people unloaded a dung-laden trolley in front of a Punjab BJP leader's house in Hoshiarpur on Friday, prompting Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to warn those protesting over the new farm laws not to take law in their hands.Some people, believed to be farmers, unloaded the trolley in front of the residence of former Punjab minister Tikshan Sud in Hoshiarpur.They also raised slogans against the Centre for its alleged callous attitude towards farmers' demands.Annoyed by the act, BJP workers led by Tikshan Sud staged a dharna on the Rai Bahadur Jodhamal road in Hoshiarpur seeking action against those responsible for it.Meanwhile, Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Kumar Sharma condemned the incident.He said some mischievous persons under the garb of farmers “attacked” the residence of Sud, only to disturb peace and brotherhood in the state.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh too took a serious note of the incident and said invasion of privacy will bring a bad name to the peaceful agitation of farmers and defeat its very objective.He warned protesters not to take law in their hands in their fight for the farmers' rights.After months of showing exemplary restraint and not indulging in any violence or lawlessness in Punjab as well as at the borders of the national capital, some protesters are losing restraint despite being categorically asked by farmer leaders to keep the protests peaceful, said the CM in a statement.He urged the protesters to exercise restraint and express solidarity with farmers in the same spirit of self-discipline as has been demonstrated so far by farmer organisations.The chief minister said such acts have the potential of vitiating the atmosphere of peace and destroy harmony amongst people of diverse castes, religions and communities.Traumatisation of families of political leaders or workers through such acts may lead to a law and order problem in Punjab, he said.A large number of farmers are protesting at the borders of Delhi for over a month, seeking repeal of three new agriculture laws.

At the Shahjahanpur border, young protesters danced to anti-government protest music coming from speakers installed in tractor-trolleys late on Thursday night. Significantly, the celebration forced the police personnel of both states---Haryana and Rajastha---deployed at the border to swing into action late in the night. “Some minutes before the new year, a group of young protesters suddenly took out tractor-march at the border to celebrate the occasion and started raising anti-government slogans. Thereafter, several youths danced to songs from the DJ (speakers) fitted in tractprs by playing Haryanvi songs ‘Modi ji thaari taup kadai sa hum Delhi aage’ and punjabi song ‘Pinda-pinda vich paro trolley kaam nahi chalna canter naal’,” said Ashok Arya, a leader of All India Kisan Sabha.Arya said more than 100 farmers broke the barricades in the day on Thursday, prompting the action. Police remained on their toes until celebrations ended, he said.  “We are upset over the martyrdom of more than 40 farmers during the ongoing protest but a special langer at Tikri border was organised on the first day of 2021 for which people of Delhi and nearby area of Haryana were invited,” said Pargat Singh, a farmer leader, adding that the battle had reached at decisive stage and they were confident of their victory. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda also visited the protest site at Tikri.

01-01-2021||Shimla/Chandigarh||Chandigarh, most of Punjab and Haryana, colder than Shimla; read why||Chandigarh and most of the plains in Punjab and Haryana were on Friday colder than the 'Queen of Hills' —Shimla.The reason: the sun is shining brightly in Himachal Pradesh these days while a thick blanket of fog refuses to lift off from most parts of the northern Indian plains.Many places on the plains—Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Ambala and Hisar were colder than hilly tourist destinations Shimla, Kufri, Dharamsala and Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh, the Met Office in Chandigarh said.Chandigarh, located in the Shivalik foothills, recorded a minimum temperature at 6.1 degrees Celsius, while Shimla, located around 7,000 feet above sea level, saw a low of 6.8 degrees, Kufri 4.8 degrees, Dalhousie at 7 degrees and Dharamsala 3.2 degrees Celsius.Shimla, the Queen of Hills, is recording the 'warmest' days owing to long sunny spells, while cities like Chandigarh, Amritsar, Karnal, New Delhi and Lucknow, located in the plains, are reeling under a severe cold wave as the sun remains fogged out. Some parts of Delhi recorded 1.1 degree Celsius, coldest so far this season.Hill destinations have been experiencing long hours of sunny weather for over a week and the day temperatures in most places have risen. The dry weather would prevail till January 4, the Met office in Shimla said.But nights and mornings are intensely cold.Data accessed from the weather bureau indicates the weather in hill destinations of Shimla, Kufri, Narkanda, Chail, Kasauli, Dharamsala, Palampur, Dalhousie and Manali is 'warmer' in the day, perfect for a break from the biting chill of the plains."What a pleasant sun in Shimla. In Delhi, basking under the sun these days is a rare occasion," said tourist Sahil Khanna."We are enjoying the long sunny days," his wife Shilpi added.Manmohan Singh, director of the meteorological department in Shimla, told IANS that the maximum temperatures increased by one-two degrees due to prevailing dry weather.He said the humidity level of plus 80 per cent causes fog."In the plains it is more than 80 per cent. However, in the hills it's around 50 per cent these days."Hisar in Haryana shivered at minus 1.2 degrees Celsius, while it was 0.2 degree in Narnaul, 4.4 degrees in Ambala and 3.5 degrees in Karnal.Punjab's Faridkot recorded a low of 0.2 degree Celsius."It will be bright and sunny till January 4, when there are chances of widespread snow and rain in the state," added Singh.

01-01-2021||New Delhi||Protesting farmers stay put in severe Delhi cold as stalemate continues||Thousands of farmers dug in their heels at protest venues outside several Delhi gateways, undeterred by the biting cold and firm in their resolve to not return home till their demands are met, as the New Year dawned with the minimum temperature dipping to 1.1 degrees Celsius.The government and the farm unions had reached some common ground on Wednesday to resolve the protesting farmers' concerns over the rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.After the sixth round of negotiations between three union ministers and a 41-member representative group of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi borders, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said at least 50 per cent resolution has been reached with mutual agreement on two out of four items on the agenda and discussions would continue on the remaining two on January 4.Security remained tight at the national capital's borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border points, where the farmers have been camping for more than a month now, braving the severe Delhi winter.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 1.1 degrees Celsius on Friday, the lowest in 15 years for the month of January.Meanwhile, the Samkyukt Kisan Morcha is likely to meet during the day to discuss its next course of action.There is, however, no question of withdrawing from the two issues which are legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) and repealing of the farm laws, senior farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni has said."The government has addressed our demands to drop penal provisions against farmers in an ordinance relating to stubble burning and to put on hold a proposed electricity amendment law," he said.The sixth round of talks was originally scheduled for December 9, but it was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah. Tribune Photo: Manas Ranjan Bhui."But, we want to make it clear that there is no alternative to our two remaining demands which include repeal of the three agriculture laws and legal guarantee for MSP," Chaduni added.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the protesting farm unions, has issued a statement saying the Centre's appeal to farmer leaders to suggest an alternative to repeal of the laws is impossible."The new laws will hand over control of agriculture markets, farmers' land and food chain to corporates," it added.The sixth round of talks was originally scheduled for December 9, but it was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough. The protests have also led to traffic congestions, forcing the police to divert vehicular movement.Taking to Twitter on Friday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed owing to the agitation and suggested them to take alternative roads."Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement. Jhatikara Borders is open only for LMV (Cars/ Light Motor Vehicles), two-wheelers and pedestrian movement," it tweeted."The Chilla and Ghazipur Borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Apsara, Bhopra & Loni Borders."Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli & Mangesh borders closed. Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba and GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44," it said in a series of tweets."Available Open Borders to Haryana are Jharoda (Only Single Carriageway/Road), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders," the Delhi Traffic Police said in another tweet.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middleman and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers.In Jind, 14 khap panchayats adopted resolutions to boycott BJP Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assembly. They have also decided to boycott BJP's public meetings, and said they would hold up black flags to BJP lawmakers visiiting the district.  They also called for a boycott of products made by the Ambani and Adani Groups, as well as Patanjali. — TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protesting-farmers-stay-put-in-severe-delhi-cold-as-stalemate-continues-192232

While the pandemic reeled in the spotlight in the beginning, rendering people incarcerated at their homes, but agreeably, the year has ended on an unexpectedly much better note with the down-in-the-history books movement by the farmers which prompted people to come out of their abodes and support them.Scholars, poets, literary persons have seen this movement as a big turning point in the politics and history of Punjab. Satnam Channa, a writer and presenter, said that the movement has given a turn to everything. “There was a time when singers used to face flak because of the kind of lyrics they would use in the songs, mention of weapons in the same. But when the movement started, they were the ones who sang several songs dedicated to the farmers,” he shares, before adding, “they would earlier go to stage to earn money, but now went to the protests to contribute something.”Channa also said that this is the actual ‘sabhyachar’ where people have united which was unseen before. “This is our culture. The new year has started with people telling that humanity still exists,” he expresses. While talking about his plans and resolutions, he revealed his plans to direct a film on the farmers protest and highlight the topics that would awake the society.Des Raj Kali, a noted writer, said that perception towards the youth changed in the year. “We had always seen youngsters running after IELTS, falling prey to drug menace, but the movement made us see an altogether different youngsters who has patience and is also sensitive towards others problems,” he says, adding that youngsters sat with the farmers, listened to them, understood their problems and connected with them.“It is a very positive sign of the state. Politically and culturally, the state had become impotent. There was stagnation all over, but we will see an enlightened Punjab in 2021,” he tells. “Ohtho Punjabi trolley vich chaanan bharke leyounge (Punjabis will bring trolleys full of light and hope for the future of the state),” the writer hoped.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-stir-seen-as-the-game-changer-192089

Agitated over the delay, about 60 students of the local CT Institute allegedly locked the campus yesterday and burnt photographs displayed in the reception area. The management admitted that it had withheld 1,100 degrees since 2017 as Rs 39 crore was due towards SC students.Members of the Joint Association of Colleges (JAC) today held a meeting with the local administration. JAC president Jagjit Singh said the Jalandhar Deputy Commissioner had assured them that he would take up the matter with the government.He, however, said: “We will not give degrees till we get our dues. We want the students to protest against the state government, not us”. The JAC, which represents 1,650 colleges of Punjab, has been openly telling Dalit students to clear the dues to get their degrees. JAC chief patron Satnam Singh Sandhu and chairman Dr Gurmeet Singh Dhaliwal said they had met the minister concerned and other authorities, but to no avail. An amount of Rs 1,850 crore was due for which there had been no assurance either from the state or the Centre, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-scholarship-fund-degrees-withheld-in-punjab-192007

Dismissing the allegation that there was a “Congress-backed plot” to damage mobile towers as “atrocious,” the CM asked, “Are we responsible for the farmers’ angst against the BJP?” Pointing out that following an appeal by him, the number of such incidents had come down, he said, “This clearly exposes the lies being shamelessly mouthed by Sharma”.

However, the expenses of farmers are also not less. They spend around Rs 67,000 daily only to make themselves heard in a 9-km area through a sound system and to make proper lighting arrangements for gathered protesters at the Singhu border. With each farmer contributing as per his capacity and funds also coming from other sections, farm organisations have formed an expense approval committee — which has members from various organisations — in order to maintain transparency in the utilisation of funds. The committee has also been sanctioning funds to make proper arrangements of cleaning, treatment of injured in various accidents, repair of vehicles and helping langar committees. Some farm leaders also pooled money from their pockets to purchase a mobile for a poor youth, who lost his phone during the stir.  “Farmer organisations are getting funds as each member is contributing. Money must be utilised with transparency. We have formed a committee for this. Around Rs 67,000 is our daily expense on sound and lighting system in 9-km area,” said committee member Raminder Singh Patiala.  He said the organisations had decided that after the end of the protest, the remaining funds would be distributed among the families of farmers who lost their lives during the protest.  After some residents tried to blame farmers for lack of cleaning, the organisations, apart from deputing volunteers, also offered to bear the expenses if government authorities needed to be hired to clean the area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-form-panel-for-proper-use-of-fund-192016

He warned against attempts being made to meddle in affairs of the state, stressing it was a pre-conceived assault on the federal structure of the nation.“The Congress has always stood for autonomy of constitutional posts. But the activism being manifested by the Governor tantamount to baselessly trespassing the state’s domain,” Jakhar said, adding that it should be clear that Punjab is neither West Bengal nor Puducherry where incumbent Governors have chosen the path of unconstructive political activism. Such erosion of constitutional propriety will be resisted in Punjab, he said.Rubbishing the BJP’s attempts to project Punjab as a state with a law-and-order problem, Jakhar said the state under CM Capt Amarinder Singh had remained peaceful, unlike in neighbouring Haryana. He alleged BJP leaders had been more bothered about corporates and towers than the farmers struggling to make ends meet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/governor-move-to-summon-chief-secy-dgp-ill-advised-jakhar-192017

Addressing mediapersons in the city, he said: “The Central Government is resorting to authoritarianism and making moves which are against the federal structure. There have been attempts to interfere in state affairs and shifting of power base from the state governments to the Centre. But the Akali Dal has started holding meetings with leaders of different parties in the country to forge an alliance.” When asked if the SAD would consider an alliance with the BJP in future, Sukhbir said: “They have not only violated the basic principles of coalition dharma, but also backstabbed us at a crucial juncture. So there is not even an iota of possibility to forge an alliance with the BJP in future.” Standing by his ‘tukde-tukde’ remark, Sukhbir said, “The BJP plays politics of creating division on communal lines and there have also been attempts at linking farmers’ movement with Khalistani elements lately.”  Earlier, the SAD president addressed a gathering of party workers and senior Akali leaders. “We will win the Municipal Corporation elections with a big margin. After winning the Vidhan Sabha elections and forming government in the state in 2022, we will distribute Rs 100 crore each to every halqa for developmental works,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/modi-govt-must-shun-stubborn-stance-sad-192018

While Tony Sandhu, former footballer; Mangi Bagga, former Captain of Indian kabaddi team; and Manjinder Singh, international kabaddi player, were the first to set things up, a bustling stream of international and Indian sports luminaries from the US, UK, Seechewal, Ludhiana and Tarn Taran also lined up to offer sewa. They wash clothes and cook food for the ‘sangat’.  Sandeep Singh from Nangal Ambian, an international kabaddi player, returned from England to come to Singhu.

The Union Agriculture Minister requested farm leaders to get them rid of the situation,” he said.Rajewal said it was because of the support of the youth and farmers of Punjab that the government completely agreed on the power Bill and stubble burning issues.No consensus on any issue: ugrahan“But our main demand is still unaddressed, which is to repeal the three farm laws. We don’t want anything less than that,” he said. He said they now wanted a way out of the situation and hopefully, the meeting on January 4 would find a solution.However, BKU (Ugrahan) dismissed the claim of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar that both parties had reached a consensus on 50 per cent of the issues. Joginder Singh Ugrahan said no response was received on the farmers’ demand to repeal the three farm laws as well as to make MSP and government purchase of all crops a legal right in all states. Instead, the government kept praising the new laws and was firmly against withdrawing them in the meeting. In fact, the reality was different from the claim that there was a consensus on two fronts.“In order to protect farmers’ rights from being exploited by corporates, it becomes necessary that MSP and government purchase be made a legal right for all crops. There is no way to guarantee such rights without legal safeguards. The government is only giving assurances for fixing the MSP and is abdicating its responsibility by claiming there is no budget for government purchase,” he said.“It is definitely feeling the pressure of protests under which it is compelled to sit on the table with farm unions. The government has been forced to acknowledge the strength of struggles of the farmers,” Ugrahan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-wants-honourable-exit-from-farm-issue-unions-192024

This haunting figure defines state’s struggle during the pandemic of 2020.Amid crumbling tertiary healthcare system and highly privatised primary healthcare, the state’s Health Department was still trying to figure out how to fight the global pandemic when the first case was reported on March 5.In this context, imposing lockdown was the only option the government had to deal with the situation. Soon, curfew followed. These two measures paralysed the state. Subsequently, endless rows of migrant workers were seen marching back to their native states.The state did try to send them home with dignity on Sharamik trains, but the long march of migrants reminded people of the Partition, which is still etched in the minds of the citizens of this region.Since March 5, 5,350 persons have died due to the virus. The number of cases has crossed 1.65 lakh.The crumbling healthcare system and the hefty fee of private hospitals left people with no option, but to stay at home. This mistrust led to rumours that doctors were harvesting organs from the bodies of patients succumbing to Covid.The virus not only took away lives, but also left deep scars on society — the march of workers from Punjab, the hostility witnessed at the cremation of “hazoori ragi” Bhai Nirmal Singh Khalsa and private hospitals shutting shops.Things to look forward to||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lockdown-migrant-crisis-hit-punjab-hard-192031

Singh, who will now have his base in Chandigarh, was the joint general secretary (organisation) earlier, and was mostly seen in action in Rajasthan.The BJP has also appointed the party veteran V Satish as a “Sangathak (organiser)”, with the responsibilities, including SC-ST Morcha coordination, as he will look after the Parliamentary office coordination. Additionally, the national joint general secretary of BJP Shiv Prakash, with base in Bhopal, will look after the party’s affairs in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal.  Saudan Singh’s task has been cut out as the ripple effect of the farmers’ agitation is also showing impact in Haryana where the saffron outfit is in power in an alliance with the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) led by the deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala.In Himachal Pradesh, the BJP will be bracing up for the Assembly elections in 2022 amid the recent trends of the incumbent governments voted out by the people.   Hathras gangrape incident in western Uttar Pradesh had for a while shown the BJP’s weakness in lacking credible Dalit leadership. The western UP has also been seen emerging as a laboratory of young Dalit leadership, which is seen in the rise of Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan.The BJP leadership will be counting upon the veteran Satish, who has vast experience in the RSS and the party, to work on the strategy to consolidate support base among the Dalit, which is seen electorally formidable in the western UP, while the state will go to the Assembly elections in 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-ropes-in-party-veteran-saudan-singh-to-look-after-punjab-haryana-affairs-191993
