The steam generated in the boiler will be circulated through pipes to special vessels to be used for cooking.Each vessel would have a capacity of preparing at least two and a half quintal of food at a time.SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said that this mechanism would not only curtail the fuel cost and the preparation span by half in comparison to traditional cooking method, but also check emission of heat or smoke in the langar hall.The ‘sewa’ (voluntary service) of setting up the project has been entrusted to Sant Baba Baljinder Singh, head of Gurdwara Rara Sahib.He informed that the equipment would be imported from Germany. "Apart from it being efficient and cost effective, the steam methodology also helps maintaining the nutrition value of food. The reason being it would auto-cut as it attains the requisite temperature,” said Baba Baljinder Singh.Since the work on providing the CNG supply line to the Golden Temple is underway, it will be more efficient to run the steam cooking system at the shrine’s kitchen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/golden-temple-to-soon-offer-steaming-hot-langar-to-devotees-200208

18-01-2021||---||Do these farmers look like secessionists, terrorists: Capt to Centre over NIA notices||Chandigarh, January 18Condemning the issuance of NIA notices to several farmers and their supporters in the midst of the anti-Farm Laws agitation, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday said such arm-twisting tactics would not weaken the resolve of the farmers to fight for their rights and their future.“Do these farmers look like secessionists and terrorists?,” asked the Chief Minister, slamming the BJP-led government at the Centre for resorting to such reprehensible and oppressive tactics in their desperation to undermine the peacefully protesting farmers’ fighting spirit. But these measures will not succeed in destroying the resolve of the farmers, rather the Centre will only end up provoking them into stronger reaction, he said, questioning the intent of the Government of India, which he said seemed bent on pushing the farmers over the edge through such intimidatory actions.Amarinder warned that BJP’s most powerful minds will not be able to control the situation if things get irretrievably out of hand.Instead of resolving the crisis triggered by the draconian legislations, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led central government was resorting to victimisation and harassment of the protesting farmers and their supporters, the Chief Minister pointed out, dubbing it a regressive step that would lead to further hardening of the farmers’ stance.It was obvious, said the Chief Minister that the BJP-led NDA government neither cared for the farmers and their concerns, nor understood their psyche. “Punjabis are fighters by nature, they are imbued with the fighting spirit which makes them among the best warriors in the world,” he said, adding that the Centre’s coercive actions will only provoke the farmers from Punjab to react negatively.Amarinder expressed shock over the Government of India’s unrelenting opposition to the farmers’ genuine and justified demands and its total failure to empathise with the cause and concerns of the farmers who have been braving the record cold of Delhi, with many of them succumbing to the harsh weather and prolonged exposure. Not only had the Centre been standing on ego in its adamant refusal to repeal the black Farm Laws, it was actively and shamelessly indulging in strong-arm tactics to suppress the voice of the farmers, he said, pointing to the IT notices issued to several big Arhtiyas of Punjab about a month ago and now the NIA notices that were clearly aimed at pressurising the farmers into withdrawing their stir.These low-level actions will not suppress the voice of the farmers, or those millions of Indians who are supporting the ‘annadaatas’ in their battle for survival, said the Chief Minister, adding that if the Centre had any shame left it should immediately withdraw the Farm Laws and sit down across the table with all the stakeholders, especially the farmers, to usher in an era of genuine agricultural reforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/do-these-farmers-look-like-secessionists-terrorists-capt-to-centre-over-nia-notices-200182
18-01-2021||New Delhi||Narinder Kapany: Unsung hero who coined term ‘fibre optics’ and touched billions of lives||Fibre optics – say the words and people think of high-speed internet cables. More knowledgeable ones might also know it is the science of transmitting light through flexible fibre. But very few would even have an inkling that the man who coined the term “fibre optics” was born and educated in India.Fewer still realise that the contributions of Narinder Singh Kapany find application in the lives of billions of people on this planet, in ways big and small.Kapany died in the US last month, a trailblazer in the field of fibre optics, a role model for optical engineers but an unsung hero, unknown to so many whose lives he touched with his innovations.   Kapany, 94, passed away peacefully in Redwood City, California, a world away from Moga in Punjab where he was born and the hill town of Dehradun where he grew up. He graduated in 1948 from Agra University, later receiving his doctorate from Imperial College, London, in 1955.The wide applications of the field that has gone on to revolutionise the internet age stand on the shoulders of Kapany who demonstrated that light transmission is possible with flexible fibre bundles.Credited with coining the term “fibre optics”, Kapany was a true visionary in his field who earned over 100 patents, say scientists. His seminal research in fibre optics, lasers and solar energy have found applications in bio-medical instruments, defence, communications and pollution-monitoring. Inspiration struck early."When I was a high school student at Dehradun in the beautiful foothills of the Himalayas, it occurred to me that light need not travel in a straight line, that it could be bent. I carried the idea to college," Indian physicist Shivanand Kanavi quoted Kapany as saying in his 2003 book ‘Sand to Silicon: The Amazing Story of Digital Technology’.Kanavi is among the several scientists who believe Kapany's contribution may have gone unnoticed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences which grants the Nobel Prize.While Chinese scientist Charles K Kao was one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009 “for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibres for optical communication”, it was Kapany who first demonstrated successfully that light can be transmitted through bent glass fibres, Kanavi said.In his illustrious career as scientist, engineer and entrepreneur, Kapany authored four books on fibre optics and entrepreneurship. In 1999, Fortune named him one of seven 'Unsung Heroes' in their 'Businessmen of the Century' issue.  The first breakthrough came in 1953 when Kapany, along with his PhD guide Harold Horace Hopkins at Imperial College London, became the first to successfully transmit high-quality images through fibre bundles. With Hopkins, Kapany carefully assembled 10,000 to 20,000 fibre bundles, each the diameter of 1/1000 of an inch, as fine as a single strand of the average human hair, and showed light guidance and imaging through a 75-centimetre-long fibre.The duo published their results in the journal Nature on January 2, 1954, and there was no looking back after that.Following this pioneering feat, he came up with the term “fibre optics” in a famous article for Scientific American in 1960. "If light is directed into one end of a glass fiber, it will emerge at the other end. Bundles of such fibers can be used to conduct images over a tortuous path and to transform them in various ways," Kapany wrote, describing the potential applications of the field.Kapany realised that bundles of thin glass fibres could bend more easily. "Initially, my primary interest was to use them in medical instruments for looking inside the human body. The broad potential of optic fibers did not dawn on me till 1955. It was then that I coined the term fibre optics," he told Kanavi, who is an adjunct faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.  The principle behind fibre optic technology is the concept of total internal reflection in which light, when beamed through a glass slab at specific angles, reflects it back completely.Indian Institute of Technology professor Deepa Venkitesh explained that optical fibre is nothing but hair-thin silica glass drawn to kilometres of length.“Now if you launch light correctly into this fibre, the light bounces multiple times at the interface and is trapped in the fibre, propagating until it reaches the far end of the fiber," the fibre optics researcher told PTI.She said the importance of fibre optics had grown in this era of working from home.“The backbone that enables high-speed connectivity in front-end mobile devices is in fact the humongous fibre optic communication network that spans the globe," Venkitesh said."Kapany's key contributions are the demonstration of a system utilising optical fibres for the purpose of transmission of an image over a reasonable distance and the coining of the term fibre optics and sort of introducing the field to a wider audience through an article in the Scientific American," added VR Supradeepa, associate professor, Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.  He said it is hard to find areas which had not been affected by advances in fibre optic communication."Any application which involves the internet and similar computer networks is built upon fibre optic communication. The field has come a long way since the early demonstrations by Dr Kapany. From his demonstrations of the first static optical fiber link over a fiber bundle, we now have multi terabits (1 trillion bits) per second communications over a single fibre strand," the IISc scientist added.Science writer Jeff Hecht noted in his book, ‘City of Light: The Story of Fiber Optics’ that Kapany was the lead author on 46 scientific papers and co-author of 10 more in the years between 1955 and 1965. "That represented a staggering 30 per cent of all the papers published on fiber optics during those years, including reports on medical treatment," he said.After migrating to the US, Kapany first worked at Rochester University, then at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.In 1961, he founded Optics Technology Inc successfully taking it public in 1967 - the first Sikh Indian to take a company public in Silicon Valley. He created the Sikh Foundation in 1967 which pioneered the display of Sikh arts at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC, and at the Rubin Museum in New York.Kapany, who is survived by wife Satinder Kaur, two children and four grandchildren, was witness to the horrors of Partition during his years in Dehradun.Sharing his firsthand accounts with the 1947 Partition Archive, a non-profit organisation, he recalled a mob turning up at their home and demanding that he hand over a Muslim domestic help.“They were shouting and said, ‘You have a Muslim living here, give him to us',” he recalled in his interview with the organisation. But he was prepared to use his double-barrel gun to protect the house help."I think there were some wise people there who found that I meant it. I wasn't going to let anybody hurt him," he said.Kapany's last book, a memoir titled ‘The Man Who Bent Light’, is expected to be available in spring this year.

To avoid any hurdles during implementation, the department has already taken consent from the medical and dental teachers’ association for the new arrangement.Experts claimed that time-bound promotion would solve the issue of faculty shortage as re-designation without pay scales would automatically create more senior faculty, which in turn increases PG seats.In the absence of the policy of time-bound promotions, many professors had been working on the same post for over a decade. Consequently, governments had to re-employ around 40 professors in two state-run medical colleges in Patiala and Amritsar.Dr Diwan Bhullar, state general secretary, Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association, said it was the long-pending demand of the faculty.“We have been facing a lot of embarrassment as our students — who had been teaching in other colleges where time-bound promotions already exist — have become our seniors. The policy should be implemented immediately,” he said.Meanwhile, DK Tiwari, principal secretary, medical education, said: “The process to implement the policy is on.

Villages of Rajgarh, Nanhera, Chamaru and Bathonian, besides a few others, are the “hotbed of illegal mining”. More than two dozen FIRs have been registered in the past three years but so far there are no reports confirming the trade.Transported to Mohali, Kharar sitesSources said just to keep their record “up to date”, the police register a case on the basis of a complaint by mining officials and “the matter ends there”. Despite political hullabaloo, “no probe has been completed to nail the mafia kingpins”.Illegal sand mining is rampant on a large scale in Ghanaur town, posing a serious threat to the existence of several villages in the area. So far, over half a dozen villages have lost sand worth over Rs 100 crore in the past few years.At Chamaru village, around 40 km from the district headquarters, mining activity is going on clandestinely round the clock. “Loaded trucks and tippers can be spotted in the village throughout the day and night. Police and mining officials know who is behind all this but nobody dares to report,” claimed a villager.At a number of spots The Tribune team visited in Ghanaur, many sand dredging machines and earthmovers were extracting sand not only from a vast tract of land but also from private land and from around the land adjoining Ghaggar, endangering its embankments.Interestingly, after a conversation with the local Shambhu police about illegal mining, The Tribune team received a call from a local politician, who requested this correspondent not to report the issue.Rajgarh, Nanhera, Chamaru, Bathonian Kalan in Ghanaur have become illegal hubs of mining. “Sand excavated from these villages is shifted to ready-for-construction sites to as far as Mohali, Kharar, Patiala and Sangrur. To date, despite over 20 FIRs in the Ghanaur belt, no investigation has ever been completed,” rued a villager.Ghanaur DSP Jaswinder Tiwana said he would check the probe report in all FIRs. “Whenever the mining department sends us any complaint, we immediately register an FIR,” he said. Sources say despite illegal mining, the rate of a tipper of sand is around Rs 4,200-4,500, priced around Rs 3,500 two years ago. “Only one group is allowed to sell sand in this area,” said a local policeman. “In the past four years, lakhs of cubic metres of sand was illegally shifted from various villages, and still no FIR or challan identifies those who pocketed the money,” he said.Ramandeep Singh Bains, XEN, Drainage (cum- mining officer), Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib, said they acted on complaints filed by public and asked police stations concerned to register FIRs. “In Ghanaur, in the past one month we have already registered four FIRs, including one in Chamaru,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illegal-mining-unchecked-ghanaur-loses-over-rs-100-cr-sand-199908

In the past, the event has benefitted as many as 3,000 girls, whose applications were picked by draw of lots. This year, the event will be organised under the joint aegis of the Baba Deep Singh Sewa Seva Samiti and the Sriganganagar Chamber of Commerce with cooperation of educational institutions.Sidhu’s road to fameGurdaspur: This week, Navjot Singh Sidhu returned to his roots in Patiala after a decade. The fact that he addressed a press conference is known to everybody. What remains unknown is that he spoke to the media barely yards away from the driveway that catapulted him to fame. In 1983, after an unimpressive debut against Clive Lloyd led West Indies, where his flawed technique against the rising ball was exploited to the hilt, Sidhu converted this driveway into a makeshift pitch. His aides used to sprinkle water on the concrete surface, and later, bounced golf balls at him as fast as possible. The result was that he slowly learnt the art of playing a fast ball to perfection. After four years of practising with golf balls, he created a record by scoring five successive half-centuries in the 1987 World Cup. After that, there was no looking back for him in cricket.Contributed by Raj Sadosh and Ravi Dhaliwal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lohri-with-leprosy-patients-199912

Constructed in 1930, the theatre used to attract a lot of visitors, including many from across the border.Its iconic building has remained a landmark of the town for ages. The cinema hall had been lying closed from the past few years as it had been incurring losses and struggling to survive in today’s scenario, where old screens paved way for multiplexes. When the Hussainiwala-Lahore border was open for trade and transit, the cinema hall used to attract a lot of Pakistani visitors, who were fond of Indian movies. However, the closure of the trade route in the aftermath of the 1971 Indo-Pak conflict came as a severe blow to the theatre. Later, the introduction of VCDs, cable TV and DTH satellite service providers proved to be the death knell for this cinema hall.“Before the onset of hostilities in 1971, when the border was open, traders from Pakistan used to come to Ferozepur to buy and sell various items. Besides business, there was one more thing that used to attract them: Indian movies,” said Hari Om, an octogenarian. Traders flocked to the cinema hall to watch their favourite film stars such as Shammi Kapoor, Dharmendra, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand on the silver screen, he said, adding that visitors from Pakistan were also great fans of Meena Kumari, Mumtaz, Madhubala and Surriya, who hailed from Pakistan. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/its-curtains-for-oldest-cinema-hall-of-ferozepur-199913

Tinu said, “The Congress government and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal are deviously trying to divert attention from facts by giving deadlines to private institutions to issue certificates to students. The SAD will take all private institutions which do not issue degrees to SC students to task but at the same time, it will not let the government loot SC students to the tune of Rs 2,440 crore.”Tinu said even as the government had not spent a single rupee from the budgeted amount of Rs 2,440 crore, it had again announced a budgetary provision of Rs 600 crore for the SC scholarship scheme for the year 2021-22. “This amounts to sprinkling salt on the wounds of the Dalit students,” he said, adding the Congress government had destroyed the future of four lakh SC students by adopting an anti-Dalit policy. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-why-didnt-congress-release-rs-2-440-cr-grant-for-sc-pupils-199914
18-01-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Amid tussle with Centre, Punjab’s tax collections slide by 20 pc||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 17Punjab’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection for the first three quarters of the year is less than 50 per cent of the targets set for this fiscal.The state’s GST collection from April to December is just Rs 7,881.50 crore, against the annual target of Rs 15,858.68 crore. Last year, the GST collection in the same period was Rs 9,851.82 crore. This shows a nearly 20 per cent fall in collections on a year-on-year basis. Rs 3,300 cr to be added: CommissionerPunjab has been hit hard by the Covid-induced lockdown and the Centre is shying away from releasing the GST compensation to the state. The Centre is yet to release Rs 8,800 crore to Punjab as compensation after Rs 1,385 crore was released in December for the previous months. A compensation of Rs 1,336 crore was added for the month of December alone, as the state collected Rs 1,067 crore as GST against a protected revenue of Rs 2,407 crore.Punjab’s financial health has been depleting since April 2020 as the Centre has failed to release its dues. The Centre had guaranteed 14 per cent annual increase in GST compensation in lieu of the state government subsidising its taxes after the GST rollout. But after the Centre announced its inability to pay the compensation for GST last year, Punjab was left with no option but to concede to the Centre’s offer of settlement, wherein the state would get Rs 8,359 crore of the total borrowings to be made by the Centre.The state has also been permitted to opt for additional market borrowings, though it appears unlikely that the state will be able to meet its annual target.The good news, however, is that the state’s VAT, excise and CST collections are higher in the first three quarters than the corresponding period last year. As against total collections of Rs 4,137.59 crore between April and December 2019, the collections this fiscal were Rs 4,474.02 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-tussle-with-centre-punjabs-tax-collections-slide-by-20-pc-199915

Agriculture experts say the prevailing cold weather during the day, followed by fog at night has proved to be conducive for the growth of wheat.“The present atmosphere would lead to quick maturity of the crop and the yield is expected to be increased by one-two quintal per acre,” said Fazilka Chief Agriculture Officer Surinder Singh, adding that last year the average yield of wheat was recorded at 20 quintal per acre, which could be increased to 21-22 quintal per acre this time.Wheat has been sown in 2.10 lakh hectares in Fazilka district this year.“Though farmers are at the receiving end in context of the new farm laws, ‘Waheguru’ has blessed them with a conducive environment for the crop,” said Parmpal Singh, a farmer from Theh Qalandar village.Sandeep Kumar, a resident of Shajarana village, said low temperature would be of great benefit for the late-sown variety of wheat.Lal Chand Jhinja, a resident of Beganwali village, said low temperature had also prevented the crop from the attack of various diseases such as sucking pest and fungus, resulting in increase in the yield.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/low-temperature-a-boon-for-wheat-crop-say-experts-199892

He has written the names of at least 116 persons in golden colour who have died in the farmers’ struggle in the past five months.Since the farmers’ movement is gaining strength by the day in the northern parts of the country, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, Komal thought of preparing a big flag emblematic of the support of the artists’ community.The flags of farmer organisations are in great demand these days. The youth in particular are hoisting it on their vehicles and atop their houses across the region.Komal said the movement of farmers could be compared with the ‘Flag Satyagraha’ of 1923 led by Mahatma Gandhi, in which the nationalist flag was hoisted along the Ravi.The ‘Flag Satyagraha’ began from Nagpur and Jabalpur and continued for several months in 1923. Demanding the right to hoist the nationalist flag caused an outcry across India, especially after Gandhi was arrested by the British government. Ultimately, the British negotiated an agreement permitting the protesters to conduct their march unhindered along with their flags. Other notable ‘Flag Satyagraha’ was organised in Mysore in 1938.The flag prepared by Komal weighs 5.25 kg. The length of the flag is 27.25 metre while the width is 4.50 metre. He has left an open space on the flag to carry out a signature campaign in favour of the repeal of the controversial agriculture laws.In the middle of the flag, the artist has drawn the picture of a typical farmer showing his hard work and dedication to work in the fields. He has drawn this picture using green colour, which is symbolic of ‘patriotism’ in the farmers’ movement.After filling the open space of this flag with the signatures of common people, this flag will be taken to Delhi for hoisting in the proposed January 26 tractor march, Komal told mediapersons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/moga-artists-big-flag-captures-stir-mood-199893

He said this amounted to unleashing political terrorism on all those agitating peacefully.The MLA said the government had tried all tactics to derail and torpedo the farmers' agitation by calling them Khalistanis, terrorists, Naxals, etc., and accusing them of being funded from countries like China and Pakistan. He said when all theatrics of the Centre failed to dampen the spirit of farmers, it was now hitting below the belt and misusing NIA to summon people in fabricated FIRs registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).Khaira particularly mentioned the names of youth icon Deep Sidhu, Baldev Singh Sirsa, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, who have been part of the farmers’ agitation since the beginning. He said the Centre was now resorting to intimidation to ensure people do not support the farmers’ agitation. Khaira claimed almost more than two dozen such activists and farm leaders had been targeted by NIA through bogus notices. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nia-notices-its-political-terrorism-says-sukhpal-singh-khaira-199909

However, some activists of Sikh outfits have decided to oblige the agency.NIA has summoned around 40 persons for examination as witnesses in a case related to Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) under section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Baldev Singh Sirsa, a farmer leader and head of the Lok Bhalai Insaf Welfare Society, has flatly refused to appear before the NIA. On the other hand, Paramjit Singh Akali and Palwinder Singh Amarkot, members of Sikh Youth of Power of Punjab, have left for New Delhi to join the NIA investigation.“We were called as a ‘witness’ in a case that was registered against someone else. We have no hitch to clarify our stance as we are representatives of a Sikh organisation.

Such international financial institutions will also face the ire of the farmers. The advocacy of these laws by the IMF was a clear proof that along with big corporates, these laws had the backing of the imperialistic institutions, he said.Union state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said the imperialistic policies of these institutions in the third world countries in the name of globalisation lie behind the enactment of these laws. The connection of anti-farmer laws with the Bali conference held in 2013 had become crystal clear, he said.Both leaders claimed that it was a matter of utmost importance to remember that in this conference, the Government of India was directed to wind up the entire structure of the procurement of foodgrain by the government and also to open the grain markets for the multinational corporate houses.Further, they said, in compliance with these directions, the Modi government constituted the Shanta Kumar committee which, in turn, recommended the winding up of FCI. The Modi government had simply put these recommendations into practice by enacting these laws.They also said in order to expose the hand of imperialism behind these laws, the financial institutions’ effigies will be burnt at the Delhi Morcha and throughout the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bku-to-burn-imfs-effigies-tomorrow-for-backing-farm-laws-199888

Later, Manshahia can be seen pacifying protesters who are objecting to the switch-over to the Congress.Led by Punjab Kisan Union leaders Makhan Singh, Kuldeep Singh and Jagtar Singh Sandhu, farmers and labourers protested the visit of the Mansa MLA at Joga village on January 15.He was holding a meeting with party workers in relation to the Joga Municipal Council elections when farmers and labourers gathered there and protested against him. Protesters claimed many years had passed since Independence but successive governments had not made any concrete policies for the farmers and labourers. They also announced that in future as well they would continue to protest and gehrao politicians coming to their village.“It was unfortunate that when I was holding a meeting at Joga village, a few people started raising slogans and staging a protest without any reason,” Manshahia said.In another development, Mazdoor Mukti Morcha state president Bhagwant Singh Samao today announced their support to the farmers’ agitation. He said they would start round-the-clock protest outside the offices and houses of the ministers for 15 days over the non-fulfillment of promises made to the poor by the state government.

18-01-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear pleas on farm laws after recusal of member from panel set up to resolve impasse||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday the pleas relating to controversial farm laws and the ongoing farmers’ protest at Delhi borders.The apex court may take into account the matter of recusal of a member of the committee set up by it to resolve the impasse. The top court would also hear the plea of the central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers which seeks to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of Republic Day on January 26.In an “extraordinary” interim order on January 12, a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde had stayed the implementation of the new farm laws till further orders and had constituted a four-member panel to listen to the grievances and make recommendations to resolve the impasse.The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana.The court had said it would hear the pleas against the farm laws after eight weeks when the committee would give its suggestions to resolve the impasse after talking to the protesters and the government. The court’s efforts seem to have hit a hurdle as Mann recused himself from the committee on January 14. A bench, also comprising justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran, may take into account the issue of recusal of Mann from the committee and take remedial actions like appointing a person to replace him in the panel. On Saturday, farmer union, Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti, filed an affidavit requesting the top court to remove the remaining three members of the committee and select people who can do the job “on the basis of mutual harmony”.The farmers’ body said the principle of natural justice is going to be violated as those appointed to the four-member committee “have already supported these laws”.It has also sought dismissal of a plea of the central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march on January 26.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.Enacted in September 2020, the government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers’ income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and “mandi” (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out a repeal of the laws. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-to-hear-pleas-on-farm-laws-after-recusal-of-member-from-panel-set-up-to-resolve-impasse-199757
