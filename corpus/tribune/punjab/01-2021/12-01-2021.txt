12-01-2021||Lahore||Pak court sentences three to two years of jail for vandalising Gurdwara Nankana Sahib||Pakistan’s Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday awarded up to two years imprisonment to three accused involved in vandalising Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in the country’s Punjab province.Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, also known as Gurdwara Janam Asthan, is a site near Lahore where the first Guru of Sikhs, Guru Nanak, was born.In January 2020, a violent mob had attacked the Gurdwara and pelted stones in the name of religion and threatened to destroy the minorities worship place (Gurdwara Janamasthan) to build “Ghulaman-e-Mustafa” shrine there.    However, police had controlled the situation.“On Tuesday a Lahore’s ATC handed down two years jail term to prime accused Imran Chishti and imposed a fine of 10,000 Pakistani rupees. Two other accused – Muhammad Salman and Muhammad Ahmed – were convicted for six months. However, four other accused were acquitted for want of evidence,” a court official told PTI. All the suspects were present in the court when the sentence was announced. Strict security measures were taken to handle any protest by the religious elements in the wake of their conviction.Imran Chishti, a government employee working in the Fisheries Department, and other suspects were arrested under terrorism and blasphemy charges following the attack on the gurdwara last year. They faced charges under sections 295A, 290, 291, 341,506, 148 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code and 7-ATA (anti-terrorism act).According to the FIR, Chishti had incited the Muslim mob in the name of religion. He wanted to settle his family issue and created a law-and-order situation in the Nankana city. Police said Chishti had deliberately misled the area Muslim people against the Sikhs for his “family matter”.Convict Chishti is the elder brother Mohammad Hassan who married a teenage Sikh girl, Jagjit Kaur, in September, 2020 after allegedly abducting and converting her to Islam. The Muslims and Sikhs of Nankana Sahib, some 80 kms from Lahore, had a face-off over the matter.Chishti had claimed that Hassan has been beaten up by police for “lawfully and consensually” marrying the daughter of the gurdwara’s granthi. Jagjit Kaur has been living in Darul Aman (government shelter house) in Lahore. Her new name is Ayesha. She reportedly has refused to convert back and return to her house. Hassan has been pressured by police and authorities to divorce her.India had strongly condemned the incident of vandalism at the revered Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.Hundreds of protesters had also thronged the streets near the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi demanding that Islamabad provide adequate security to Sikh shrines and community members there.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandhak Committee, the apex body which manages Sikh shrines in India, had also urged the Pakistan government to take stringent action against the culprits who attacked the gurdwara - one of the holiest sites in Sikhism. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pak-court-sentences-three-to-two-years-of-jail-for-vandalising-gurdwara-nankana-sahib-197486

It was his wish that there must be some contribution of the painters’ fraternity in the farmers’ protest as they were fighting for the rights of the common people too, he asserted.“I have started the painting 15 days ago but some work was kept pending so that I can complete it at the Singhu border,” said the artist who has come here on his special vehicle.“I have shown the protest episode-wise in my painting,” he said.“In the first scene, I painted the farmers sitting on a railway track in Punjab and after that they came on the road, which is the second scene,” he said.“I have also shown how the farmers entered Haryana and how the government tried to stop them by using water cannons, by digging roads, etc.,” he added.The artist has also used some symbols in the painting and painted a snake with a lizard in its mouth to show the condition of the Union government, which, he claimed, was not able to take a decision over repeal of three farm laws.“I appealed to the government to fulfil the demands of the farmers as soon as possible so that they can go to their homes happily,” he said.Besides farmers, hundreds of protesters, including women along with their children, have also reached the Singhu border.Gurbachan Singh (76) from Amritsar said they reached the Singhu border on November 26 last year and their only demand is the repeal of three black laws.“We will not step back till the Union government does not repeal these laws. We are ready to stay here till their last breath,” said Gurnam Singh of Moga.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhiana-artist-showcases-farmers-protest-in-18-ft-long-painting-197469
12-01-2021||New Delhi||Lohri 2021: Here are some interesting facts, significance about harvest festival||Lohri, the harvest festival celebrated on January 13 every year, marks the end of winter and the time to harvest rabi crops.As the festival is around the corner, enthusiastic people across the country are gearing up to lit the bonfire, whirl around it singing Punjabi folk songs, and popping sesame seeds, popcorn, jaggery, and rewaris. But, before you wish a happy Lohri to your close ones, here are the significance and interesting facts about the joyous festival.The occasion holds great significance among farmers, as they thank the almighty for a bountiful harvest of crops and forth on the occasion."Lohri is also known as Maghi, as it is celebrated in the month of 'Maagh' and historically, during the 19th century, revenue for winter crops was collected on this day or Sankrant," told Gurnek Singh, a member of Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee.Traditionally, Lohri is also called as 'Lohi' in Punjabi. In houses that have recently had a marriage or childbirth, the celebrations of the festival are observed at a grand scale, otherwise, people usually have private Lohri celebrations, in their houses.The major part of the festival is its folk songs. While whirling around the bonfire ladies performer 'gidda' and sing 'Sundar Mundariye' song which has words to express gratitude to 'Dulla Bhatti.' The tale behind the main song is known by a very few."The theme of many folk songs of this festival is Dulla Bhatti, a man who lived in Punjab during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar", 75-year-old Sheila Taneja from Amritsar told ANI.Continuing the tale, she said "Bhatti was regarded as a hero in Punjab for rescuing girls from being forcibly taken to be sold in the slave market of the Middle East. Amongst those, he saved two girls named Sundri and Mundri, who gradually became a theme of Punjab' folklore.""During the celebrations, children go around homes singing the traditional folk songs of Lohri with Dulla Bhatti's name included. One person sings, while others end each line with a loud "Ho!", she added.It is then followed by offering prayers to the mother earth, the sun deity, the fire, and the fields for prosperity, health, and good harvest, according to Gurnek Singh.In states like Punjab and Haryana, kite flying competition is also observed. Markets are filled with aromatic traditional delicacies like gajak, peanuts, and popcorns. The vibe turns completely joyous when everybody dances to the beats of dhol, and dives into the scrumptious feast served.Hence, with the hope that the large flames of the bonfire will carry the prayers of the people to God and bring warmth to the fields to help crops grow, people commemorate the day by exchanging greetings and gifts to their relatives and friends.

Expecting appreciation but caught in crosshairs of newly launched scheme and fearing losing votes, senior Congress leaders have turned into foot soldiers and are visiting each house to convince residents about the benefits of the scheme.“We would not avail the benefits of the scheme as it is against us. In self declaration, there is a condition that if anyone gets proprietary rights under this scheme, he could not lease out, gift, sell or transfer the ownership of the land to any other person for 30 years. It’s unacceptable. We will also circulate the copies of the scheme to make all aware. If the government wants to help the poor, it must not set any condition,” said Vijay Sahni, a senior leader of the SAD (D) from Sangrur.“Though all want to take benefit of the scheme, there is confusion over the conditions and the government must clarify to prevent any problem,” said Parminder Singh, a local resident.

While the SIT is pinning largely its case on these three accused (Mohinder Pal already died in Nabha jail) for them writing and pasting these posters, the CFSL report is a big clog in progression of its case in the local court.Around 75 persons underwent various tests, including forensic psychological assessment, handwriting, polygraph, palm/finger prints examination and layered voice analysis tests at the CFSL between September 2016 and August 2018 during the investigation in three sacrilege incidents at Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala between June and October, 2015.On June 20, 2018, the Punjab DGP had written to the Director, CBI, informing him that after the questioning of Mohinder Pal, it was found that he was the main conspirator in the theft of Guru Granth Sahib and sacrilege incidents.

In a statement issued from the party headquarters, Hayer said the minister was at loggerheads with the AAP because it was standing with farmers. He said instead of listening to unemployed teachers, Singla was torturing them and following the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Hayer said the Modi-led Central Government was harassing the farmers in severe cold. Similarly, the Punjab Education Minister could not see unemployed teachers sitting outside his residence in this harsh weather. He said instead of blaming the AAP, the Education Minister should learn from the Delhi Government on how teachers are valued.Hayer asked the Education Minister to address the problems of unemployed teachers who had been protesting outside his house for the past 12 days.Taking a dig at Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Hayer said, “Will minister Singla explain as to why Capt Amarinder did not seek time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a meeting regarding farmers’ issues till date? Will Singla explain why Captain did not say a word about the farmers’ demands when he met Union Home Minister Amit Shah? What was the deal done with Amit Shah?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-to-punjab-government-help-dont-harass-jobless-197171

A 45-year-old farmer, Harpinder Singh, alias Neetu Khalsa, of Abul Khurana village in Muktsar passed away last night at a hospital in Ludhiana. He, too, had gone to the farmers’ stir on the first day it started, but returned from there in last week of December after developing some health issues.Jagdish Singh, a numberdar, had been with protesters at the border from day one. Though he had come back to his village, he went back about 10 days ago. He was an activist of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur). His father has served as village sarpanch. His family owns about 35 acres in the village, said sources.Gurdas Singh, a close relative of the deceased, said, “He (Jagdish Singh) was staying in a trailer. He had gone to answer nature’s call in the morning when he collapsed. We took him to Civil Hospital, Bahadurgarh, where the doctors declared him brought dead.”Meanwhile, some farmers in the village said the deceased had last night informed his son about developing some health issue. The deceased is survived by wife, two sons and parents. Villagers said the body reached the village in the evening and cremation would be held on Tuesday.Neetu Khalsa, too, passed away last night at a hospital in Ludhiana. He had returned from the protest site in the last week of December after developing some health issues. Sources said the deceased was first taken to a hospital in Bathinda and then to Ludhiana, where he passed away last night.The deceased had less than 10 acres and owed a huge amount to a private bank, said sources. He was cremated in the village. Among those present there included former AAP MP Sadhu Singh and senior SAD leader and former Malout MLA Harpreet Singh.Purushottam Singh Gill, a BKU leader, said both Jagdish Singh and Titu Singh had been camping at the border for the past many days and suffered a heart attack that led to their death.Civil Surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya said Jagdish Singh was brought dead to the Civil Hospital in Bahadurgarh this morning and the exact reason of death would be clear from the postmortem report.

Further reprimand by it over not entering into consultations with the farmers during the presentation and passing of these laws is a confirmation of the dictatorial attitude of the central government, corroborates its indifferent attitude and establishes further that the peasant struggle is legitimate,” they said.Ugrahan said it was clear by now that peasants all over India had declared these laws to be against their interests and that they were unconstitutional.

There is nothing illegal or provocative about these songs. However, in the garb of protests, many singers in Punjab and abroad have either penned highly provocative lyrics or their videos contain objectionable scenes. These paint a distorted picture of the ground reality,” said a senior police official.He said the police were merely keeping an eye on the content of songs and cataloguing did not necessarily mean the singers would be booked. “Most singers have released songs on the popular sentiment of the farmers’ protests. But organisations such as banned terror agency Sikhs For Justice was trying to use the platform to incite violence or seek support for Khalsitan movement. That is against the law,” said a senior police official.The dossier besides naming several Punjabi singers also mentions a Pakistan singer for a violence-inciting song. It mentions views against each song and records the kind of comments made on the content. Ninder Ghugianvi, an author of several books on Punjabi folk songs , said it was unfortunate many singers were exploiting people’s sentiment over the farmers’ protests by promoting gun culture, gangsterism or making fun of police."“Legal action against them is justified. However, songs in praise or support of the ongoing farmer’s struggle should not be objected to,” he said.Patiala SSP Vikramjit Duggal, who had booked singer Shree Brar, said action was taken against the singer as he had shown and encouraged jail break in a music video.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cops-keep-track-of-punjabi-songs-released-during-stir-197146

12-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab imposes special infra development fee on fuel, immovable property purchase||The Punjab cabinet on Monday gave approval for levying Special Infrastructure Development (special ID) fee on sale of petrol, diesel and immovable property.The decision, which is aimed to give further impetus to overall infrastructure development across the state, will yield an additional revenue of Rs 216.16 crore.The collection from special ID fee will be deposited in the development fund of Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB), as per a government statement.The special ID fee would be imposed at the rate of Rs 0.25 per litre each on sale of petrol and diesel within the state.Likewise, special ID fee at the rate of Rs 0.25 would also be levied for every 100 rupees of the value of purchase of immovable property within the state, according to the statement.The cabinet, which held its meeting under the leadership of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, also gave approval for certain amendments in the Punjab Infrastructure (Development and Regulation) Act, 2002 through promulgation of an Ordinance and thereafter introducing a Bill—the Punjab Infrastructure (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2021 in the Vidhan Sabha.To effect the imposition of special ID fee, an amendment would be made in the existing provision by inserting a new Section 25-A on levy of special fee.The decision to impose the special ID fee on fuel will further make petrol and diesel costlier in Punjab in comparison to neighbouring Chandigarh and Haryana, according to a fuel pump owner in Mohali.In another decision, the cabinet gave approval for acquisition, conservation and use of Mubarik Manzil Palace, Malerkotla in district Sangrur.To facilitate the acquisition of Mubarik Manzil Palace, the state government will provide Rs 3 crore to Begum Munawwar-ul-Nisa, the owner of the property, as consideration for transferring the property with all its rights to the state government.The chief minister said this decision would be instrumental in preserving the rich legacy of the state and to reconnect younger generations with the glorious past.Begum Munawwar-ul-Nisa had written to the state government saying that the more than 150-years old palace, spread over an area of 32,400 sq ft, is a valuable heritage property and needs to be properly conserved for future as an integral part of history of erstwhile Malerkotla state and Punjab.She said she desired to hand over the palace to state for acquisition, conservation and use.

12-01-2021||New Delhi||SC hints at staying implementation of farm laws; order on Tuesday||Pulling up the government for poor handling of farmers’ agitation against farm laws, the Supreme Court on Monday said it intended to stay the implementation of the contentious laws and set up a committee to find an amicable solution to the problem."We are extremely disappointed with the way the government is handling the issue. Last four times you said negotiations are on. What negotiations are you talking about?.. If you have some sense of responsibility, and if you say you will withhold the implementation of laws, we will form a committee to decide,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Attorney General KK Venugopal.The court’s comments came after Venugopal said farmers' organisations had rejected various offers made by the government."People are committing suicide. People are calling names. People are suffering in cold and the pandemic," noted the Bench, which also included Justice AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.“We don't see why there should be an insistence that the laws must be implemented at any cost…Our intention is clear. We want an amicable solution to the problem. That is why we asked you last time, why don't you keep the laws on hold? But you keep asking for time. We are not on the merits of the law. We are not on repeal,” it said.The Bench posted the matter for passing a formal order on Tuesday.During hearing on petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws and those seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads, the top court described the situation as “very delicate”.It said, “We are doing this because you have failed to solve the problem. The Union of India has to take the responsibility. The laws have resulted in a strike and now you have to solve the strike.”"It will not help you to say that this was started by the last government… We have given you a very long rope. Don't lecture us on patience. We will decide when to pass the order,” it told the government. It also commented that the law was acted without much consultation.Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta vehemently opposed the court’s proposal to stay the implementation of the farm laws, saying farmers from other parts of the country supported the laws.Venugopal said: “A law cannot be stayed by the Supreme Court unless the Lordships find that it violates the fundamental rights or constitutional schemes. Law has to be without the power to legislate, only then it can be stayed. No petitioners have raised any such issues”."Kindly remove the impression that we didn't do enough. We gave our best. But the farmers groups have been non-cooperative during talks," Mehta submitted."We have an apprehension that someone will do something a day which will lead to breach of peace. Each one of us will be responsible if something goes wrong. We don't want anybody's blood on our hands,” the Bench said.As a lawyer said he had full faith in the top court, the CJI asserted, "Whether you have faith or not, we are the Supreme Court of India. We will do our job."The CJI said it was for the police to deal with the situation not the court.The courts made it clear that it can’t restrain peaceful protest, saying it was for the police to deal with the situation, not the court. "We want to ensure there is no violence or bloodbath in the streets. If somebody breaks the law you take action".“We should not be understood that we are protecting any law breaker. If someone breaks the law, they will face the consequences. We are not encouraging breaking of law. We propose to pass this order to prevent loss of life and property,” the Bench noted.The farmers’ unions were represented by senior advocates Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves. Dave said he needed to take instructions as there were 400 farmers' bodies involved in the agitation."Don't create an odd situation where the unions went to the government, but won't go to the committee," the CJI told Dave, who sought a day's time to respond. It asked Phoolka to persuade the women and old farmers to leave the protest site due to the cold and COVID19.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing a Delhi resident, cautioned the court against the possibility of protests getting scaled up to demand repeal of the laws following the stay order.On behalf of the Delhi government, advocate Rahul Mehra alleged it was the ego of certain governments, which was not allowing a fair dialogue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-hints-at-staying-implementation-of-farm-laws-order-on-tuesday-196935
