30-01-2021||---||Farmers' protest: Jakhar ridicules AAP demand for deployment of Punjab police at Delhi borders||Chandigarh, January 30Ridiculing the demand of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for deployment of Punjab Police to protect the agitating farmers at the borders of the national capital, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief, Sunil Jakhar, on Saturday said even the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cannot enter a state without permission. In any case, “Congress was not running an anarchist government in Punjab like Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, where street politics by the ruling party had long replaced real governance”, he added.The PPCC chief was reacting to AAP spokesman Raghav Chadha’s statement asking that Punjab Police be positioned at the Delhi borders for the safety and security of farmers from attacks by alleged BJP goons, who he said had the protection of Delhi Police.“Don’t you know anything about the principles and rules of police jurisdiction?” the PPCC chief remarked, asking Chadha to stop making a mockery of the sensitive and grave situation prevailing in the national capital with his frivolous and senseless statements. “How can a state police force enter Delhi or any other state, when even a central agency like CBI has no such authority or jurisdiction,” asked Jakhar.Unlike the AAP government in Delhi, which clearly had no scruples about trampling the law in favour of political theatrics and drama, the Congress government in Punjab believed in following the rule of the law, he added.Further taking a dig at the AAP leader, Jakhar asked, “Why doesn’t your AAP government in the capital send out the Delhi Home Guards, who report directly to the state government, to protect the farmers sitting at your doorstep?”“And with 66 MLAs spread around the city, why don’t you help out the farmers instead of wasting your time giving advice to Punjab government,” he further quipped.Trashing Chadha’s comments on the protection provided by Punjab Police to various leaders etc, Jakhar asked the AAP spokesperson if he knew more about individual threat perceptions in Punjab than the Chief Minister or his government. “Why don’t you leave the job of running Punjab to us while you concentrate on managing the situation in Delhi, where all the problem is happening?”The PPCC chief also lashed out at the AAP leader on Chief Minister Captain, Amarinder Singh’s Pakistan remarks, warning against ignoring or undermining the Pak threat in Punjab. “Either you are completely ignorant about the situation on the ground in Punjab, which you are dreaming of ruling, or you are deliberately choosing to play it down,” he said, in response to the AAP allegation that the Chief Minister was trying to protect the BJP by linking Pakistan to the Red Fort attack.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-protest-jakhar-ridicules-aap-demand-for-deployment-of-punjab-police-at-delhi-borders-205566
30-01-2021||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana HC to resume physical hearing in phased manner||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 30Nearly 11 months after the Punjab and Haryana High Court shifted to virtual mode of hearing following the Covid outbreak, it has decided to resume physical hearing in a phased manner.To begin with, it has set up three courtrooms for physical hearing keeping Covid protocols in mind. Available information suggests the number is likely to go up to five in the coming days.The decision comes just about three days after it was reported in these columns that much bigger Allahabad High Court with 95 judges never really went into restrictive functioning and continued with physical hearing throughout the Covid period with some interruptions in between.As of now, the Allahabad High Court has the highest number of pending cases at 7.71 lakh. It is followed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which is facing a pendency of 6,44,679 cases. The problem of plenty is expected to worsen in the coming months in the absence of physical hearing of cases and new appointments of Judges.High Court Registrar Vigilance-cum-PRO Vikram Aggarwal said the High Court was in regular touch with all the authorities. The decision to gradually increase physical hearing of cases, and ultimately to start complete functioning through physical mode, would be taken accordingly.He added it was notified on January 26 that limited physical hearing would commence shortly in addition to the present system of hearing matters through video conferencing.A list of more than 1,100 criminal appeals, where the accused were in custody, was also published for being taken up for physical hearing in the first instance. But till date not even a single application was received from the parties concerned for physical hearing of the cases in the list.As of now, all Benches were functioning through video conferencing and nearly 1,500 cases of all categories, including the pending ones, were being listed daily for hearing. Registrar Aggarwal added nearly 50,000 out of 1 lakh listed during the period of restrictive functioning were disposed of. Ordinary filing of cases was going on since June 2020 and the cases would also be taken up for hearing as soon as normal functioning resumed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-hc-to-resume-physical-hearing-in-phased-manner-205564

Earlier, it was disrupted in Fatehgarh Sahib district.The shooting was taking place near Punjab Bagh area in Patiala on Saturday.Protesting farmers insisted that actor Janhvi Kapoor should make a statement in support of farmers who are agitating against the Centre’s three new farm laws.“We had earlier told them that they would not allow shooting of the film here. But they still held a shooting. We stopped it again today,” said a protester.“We have no grudge against any person. If she (actor) gives a statement in support of farmers only once, we will allow the shooting,” protester further said.The shooting was disrupted for a brief period, said a police official, adding it resumed later.On January 23, a group of farmers had earlier halted shooting in Patiala.Earlier this month, shooting of ‘Good Lucky Jerry’ had briefly come to a halt at Bassi Pathana in Fatehgarh Sahib after a group of farmers had insisted that Janhvi make a comment on the ongoing farmers’ protest.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been camping at Delhi’s borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops.They claim the new laws will weaken the MSP system. But the Centre has been seeking to assure them, though with little success, that the MSP system will remain intact and the new laws will only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-disrupt-shooting-of-janhvi-kapoors-good-luck-jerry-in-patiala-205557

Lambasting the BJP national general secretary over his remarks on the ‘Republic Day grace’, he said the BJP, which had systematically ripped the Constitutional fabric apart over the past 6 years and most notably over the draconian Farm Laws, had lost all moral and ethical right to talk of the honour of the R-day.“What was wrong in my statement that ‘maligning the farmers’ (for the Red Fort violence) could cause the morale of the armed forces, 20 per centof which is from Punjab, to go down? How does that amount to insulting the Republic Day grace and my own Army background?” asked an angry Amarinder, hitting out at Chugh for misleading the people with baseless allegations.“What happened to the grace of the R-day when the central government, which the BJP leads, trampled over the federal and Constitutional rights of the states to unilaterally bring in the Farm Ordinances without consulting anyone? Where is the grace in letting the poor farmers, who are feeding you along with the billion plus people of India every day, shiver out in the cold on the roads, with many of them dying out there?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/what-do-you-know-of-the-grace-of-the-national-flag-amarinder-asks-bjps-chugh-205553
30-01-2021|| London||4-year-old British Sikh girl joins Mensa club of high IQ kids||A four-year-old British Sikh girl has become one of the youngest in the UK to be accepted into the elite Mensa membership club of children with a high intelligence quotient (IQ).Dayaal Kaur, who lives with her family in Birmingham, displayed exceptional learning abilities from very early on and had mastered the entire English alphabet by the time she was just 14 months old.She expressed an enthusiasm to appear for the Mensa test, conducted online from home due to the coronavirus lockdown, and achieved an IQ score of 145, which puts her in the top one per cent of the UK’s population in the “very gifted or highly advanced” category.“We are delighted to welcome Dayaal to Mensa, where she joins a community of about 2,000 junior and teen members,” said John Stevenage, British Mensa’s chief executive.“Her family can make use of the supportive parents’ network that has developed, and we hope that as she grows up, Dayaal makes many lifelong friends and experiences some of the many learning and network opportunities that Mensa offers,” he said.The journey to this recognition has not been an easy one for the family as they struggled to convince local experts that Dayaal needed access to the gifted intelligence programme within the education system.Her father, Sarbjit Singh, himself a teacher as a Health, Well-being and Pastoral Lead, persisted to prove that his daughter indeed was gifted.“Now there is official documentation that proves that she is way beyond her level. As parents, it is natural for us to consider our child is special, but in this case there is actual proof that she is one in a million,” said Singh.“There is a big debate to be had about how we cultivate our youth and provide the right kind of support and education so that we don’t lose future inventors and high achievers,” he said.Dayaal, whose dream for now is to become an astronaut and also to have a stable full of horses, took the test just before her fourth birthday in October last year.Her parents explained what the online process would involve, and she readily agreed in her usual spirit of “coming alive” in any kind of learning scenario.In her assessment, expert Lyn Kendall recommended that Dayaal’s “ability and maturity” meant that it would be worth considering accelerating her beyond her peer group in a classroom setting.“I am so glad we persisted because otherwise Dayaal would have been lost in the system and got frustrated when she didn’t feel like she was being challenged enough to learn new things constantly,” said her proud father, who was born and raised in Birmingham and whose family traces its roots back to Hoshiarpur in Punjab.“Dayaal is equally enthusiastic when we are reading about Sikh history and has a fascination for icons such as Banda Singh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh so we try and do our best to make that learning fun. She hasn’t yet been to India, but we hope to go as a family someday post-lockdown,” he said.Meanwhile, Dayaal has been celebrating her big achievement with her father, one-year-old sister Kalyaan and solicitor mother Rajvinder Kaur as she has worked out that she is a “genius now”.As with most families, the Covid-19 lockdown has been tough because she has had to curb her sociable side but can’t wait to return to the nursery and play with her friends again. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/4-year-old-british-sikh-girl-joins-mensa-club-of-high-iq-kids-205528

They decided that even if one member of each household does not visit the protest site, then they would have to face a complete social boycott.Around a dozen villages in Bathinda and Mansa unanimously passed a resolution. One family member of each family in the village would go to the protest on a rotational basis or else they would have to pay a fine. Panchayats in Phul, Phooli, Kotbhaktu, Kararwala and others passed the resolution in support of the farmers’ agitation.Sukhwinder Kaur, sarpanch Kotbhaktu village, said: “Today we have organised a meeting of villagers at grain market. In which, a decision was taken, that one member of each house would go to protest on rotational basis, and if one does not go then he has to give a fine of Rs 300 daily, and then also after one week, he does not go, then the family would face social boycott in the village, but all the people were unanimously ready to go to the protest.”Phooli village sarpanch, Chamkaur Dhaliwal, said: “Village panchayat today held a meeting in the village in which they had motivated the farmers and villagers to go and support the peaceful agitation at Delhi. It has been unanimously decided that everyone from each house would go to the protest and if someone can’t go, he would financially support agitation”.On Friday, the panchayats of Virk Khurd, Nangal Kalan in Bathinda and Mansa had also passed similar resolutions.Apart from this, BKU Ekta Ugrahan leader Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha also held meetings in the Mansa district to mobilise the villagers to move to Delhi borders for protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1-family-member-at-protest-site-villages-in-bathinda-mansa-pass-resolution-to-revive-farmers-agitation-205520

This is true more of the 32 Punjab unions which have been very rigid about political entries into farmers agitation.Also read: ‘Mahapanchayat’ at Baghpat: How BJP leadership miscalculation strengthened farmers’ agitation, Jat bonding in UP, HaryanaBKU digs its heels in at Ghazipur border, more supporters pouring inBajwa, however, told The Tribune today that he did not visit Ghazipur as a political leader.“When I saw tears in the eyes of Rakesh Tikait, I felt it was my duty as the son of the soil and as the son of a farmer to go and stand with Tikait. I also feel that now is the time for political parties and leaders to intervene, play a constructive role and help resolve the ongoing stalemate in national interest.”Bajwa was welcomed on the stage by BKU faction at Ghazipur but he chose not at address the crowd and just register his presence for moral reasons more than political.“We are with the farmers and we want the matter to end amicably so that the situation doesn’t further deteriorate. Disruptive forces are waiting in the wings to take mileage,” said Bajwa.Asked if he would visit other borders where farmers are agitating, Bajwa said he had received calls from some leaders and would go and meet them in the near future.“Farmer leaders have been asking me to visit for a ground assessment of the situation. I do plan to visit other borders as well,” said the former Punjab Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab.Bajwa was the first Congress leader to initiate the anti farm law debate in the Rajya Sabha last September and had said his party would not sign on the death warrants of farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/partap-bajwa-deepender-hooda-welcomed-on-tikaits-protest-site-stage-205484

30-01-2021||Even as videos showcasing violence and news of breaking of barricades began doing the rounds early on the morning of Republic Day||The glorious side of tractor marches||At least 40,000 to 50,000 tractors paraded across the pre-set path at the Singhu alone. People climbed atop bridges, trucks, tractors, trolleys and trees to take in some of the action. The day witnessed thousands of tractors taking part in the march sheeted in Tri-colours in what has to be the biggest-ever show of farm diversity in the country’s history. It wasn’t until they came into an internet zone that they realised something had gone amiss in Delhi even as tractors marched peacefully in front of their eyes at Singhu and Tikri.Elderly men recalled protests during the British era saying they had never seen anything like this before in their lifetime. Women congregated by the roads cheering on the moving cavalcades. Meanwhile, huge clumps of police and paramilitary forces lined the borders to hold the march.Many considered the parade a wedding between Delhi and Punjab, of Indian national pride and tribute to freedom struggle martyrs, which were the reigning themes of decked up tractors. Elderly men dressed as grooms (with sehras tied on their heads as well as tractors), Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and Udham Singh’s photos enveloped the vehicles. Some even spent lakhs on tractors and were rueful of the fact that their hard work never made it to TV due to the pictures of violence ruling the discourse for the day.— Aparna Banerji||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/the-glorious-side-of-tractor-marches-205322

In collaboration with Khalra Mission, the PHRO today announced free legal aid to the farmers booked by the Delhi Police for the Red Fort incident.“It appears the police deliberately led the farmers to the Red Fort. A ruckus was created when the Nishan Sahib was hoisted there. This cannot be an offence. The Tricolour was not touched. Most protesters were illegally detained on the spot. Since then, their whereabouts are not known,” activist Sarabjit Singh Verka said.Hakam Singh, a lawyer with the Punjab and Haryana High Court, said at least between 80-90 youths from Punjab had not returned to their camps at Singhu and Tikri. “A group of lawyers is trying to trace them. We are in touch with the police, farm unions and hospitals,” he said.Lawyers under the banner of Panthic Talmel Sangathan too offered legal aid to the farmers. “We are scrutinising the FIRs. Most farmers were booked under the Damage to Public Property Act, Epidemic Diseases Act and Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act,” an advocate said.Akal Takht officiating Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said: “Nishan Sahib is the symbol of the Sikh identity. Hoisting the flag does not constitute an offence.”A report from Moga said 12 farmers of Tatarie Wala village in Moga district were among those missing. The village panchayat identified them as: Amritpal Singh, Gurpreet Singh, Daljinder Singh, Jagdeep Singh, Jagdish Singh, Navdeep Singh, Balvir Singh, Bhag Singh, Harjinder Singh, Ranjit Singh, Ramandeep Singh and Jaswant Singh.

A caravan of 50 tractor-trailers laden with ration was flagged off for the Singhu border.Nirmal Singh Reona, a farmer leader, said panchayats had decided that 20 persons from each village would proceed to the national capital and stay at the dharna site. After four days, another batch of 20 persons would replace them. The entire expenditure for the trip and the stay would be borne by the village panchyat.Appealing to other village panchyats of the district to pass such resolutions, Reona said the farmers were determined to continue the agitation until the three agricultural laws were repealed. He stressed the farmers’ agitation would be further intensified. Farmer unions have now started mobilising support by holding meetings in villages of the Malwa region by exhorting farmers to reach the Tikri border in large numbers. Some panchayats have made it mandatory to send at least one member per family to the protest site at Delhi borders and those failing to do so would be liable to pay money.At Nangal Kalan, one of the largest villages in Mansa, panchayat members have announced that at least one member per family has to take part in the agitation at Delhi borders and spend a minimum of seven days, if any family fails to do so then it has to pay Rs 1,500 as fund to the panchayat. Virk Khurd village in Bathinda has also made a similar announcement.“Rumours were doing the rounds that the R-Day incident would mark the end of the agitation. Our decision will put an end to such rumours. We have made it mandatory for one member per family to visit Delhi sites and spend minimum 15 days there. Those failing to do so would be fined Rs 1,500,” said Manjit Kaur, Virk Khurd sarpanch.Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha, president, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) in Mansa, said: “Our spirits are not down and we will fight this battle till it reaches its logical end. Groups of farmers have already left to Delhi borders to join their farmer brothers.”Sarup Singh, general secretary, BKU (Lakhowal) Bathinda unit, said: “While groups of farmers left for Tikri border, another group has also reached Ghazipur to support BKU (Tikait) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait as well.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/villages-vow-to-rally-behind-protesters-205166

The aim of the raids was to check the quantity and quality of the foodgrain procured by FCI for the central pool.The raids began late last evening and continued till late evening today. As many as 25 godowns in Punjab (seven of FCI, 10 of Punjab State Warehousing Corporation, seven of PUNGRAIN and one of Central Warehousing Corporation) and 10 godowns in Haryana, were checked by at least 10 teams of the central agency.Information gathered by The Tribune suggested that the teams were checking only the wheat and rice samples from the grains procured in 2019-20 and 2020-21 season. “They have checked the moisture content in stored wheat and rice, did the physical verification, checked the weight of the bags of grains and took samples for further investigation,” a senior FCI officer said.A statement issued by CBI said they were checking the quantity and quality of foodgrain procured by FCI.Sources in FCI said the teams were trying to ascertain if the stocks found here were all procured from the two states for the Centre, or if these were bought at cheaper rates from Bihar and then passed on to FCI by claiming higher Minimum Support Price (MSP).The raiding teams did not take the local police or civil administration into confidence before conducting the raids, sparkin strong reactions from the state government. Food and Supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said if it was aimed at targeting Punjab, it was highly condemnable. “Let us hope it is only an administrative decision to raid the godowns,” he said. Raids were conducted at godowns in Ludhiana, Bathinda, Fazilka, Moga, Sangrur, Tarn Taran, Muktsar, Barnala and Kapurthala in Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cbi-raids-25-godowns-in-10-districts-takes-grain-samples-205167

Senior Punjab Police officials said there was no official communication from the central agencies about the raids. Under the rules, a raiding or visiting police team has to inform the local police station of the area concerned and take their personnel along.However, a lack of trust seemed to have developed over the past few days following the farmer protest. Also, Punjab is ruled by a Congress government, while the Delhi Police come under the BJP-led Union Home Ministry.BJP leaders had been accusing the Punjab Police of looking the other way at the start of farmer protests and subsequently not providing security to party leaders during their events in the state.The situation had escalated to a point where Governor VP Singh Badnore had to summon the Chief Secretary and DGP over alleged attacks on state BJP leaders and workers.In the past, the Punjab Government had locked horns with the CBI over sacrilege cases and banned the agency from registering cases against state government officials without prior permission. The CBI had closed the investigation in the cases last year but the government withdrew the blanket permission to the CBI only during the farmer protests.Before the protests, the Punjab Police had worked in tandem with the National Investigation Agency, Delhi Police, Haryana Police and other security agencies in nabbing a number of drugs smugglers, arms dealers and some alleged terrorists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/central-agencies-keep-punjab-police-out-of-loop-205170

Miscreants might have been brought from other places by vested interests to foment trouble,” he said, adding that locals calling the farmers traitors was not something he could believe to be true.Govt scanning FIRs on union leadersSources in the government said the Congress government was examining the FIR slapped on the farm leaders. Meanwhile, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee has offered legal aid to farmer leaders who have been named in FIRs registered by the Delhi Police, provided the leaders agree to the offer.Calling for an immediate end to the vilification campaign launched against farmers in the wake of the Red Fort violence, the Chief Minister warned that maligning the farmers in this manner could lower the morale of the armed forces, 20 per cent comprisedPunjabis.

30-01-2021||Chandigarh||High Court rejects bail in bogus tax refund case||In an out-of-the-ordinary case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has rejected bail in a case where refund was received for tax never received by the revenue authority. The Union of India’s stand in the matter was that a scam of more than Rs 150 crore came to light as a result of information collected by a software.Bills procured without purchaseJustice Avneesh Jhingan asserted bills were being procured from Delhi-based firms which had no purchases. The tax not deposited for these transactions was utilised for not only availing input tax credits, but for getting refunds by showing sales to export units. “In other words, the refund was received for the tax which was actually never received by the revenue,” Justice Jhingan asserted.The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice when Rakesh Arora filed a petition against the State of Punjab for grant of bail after being arrested under the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.Justice Jhingan observed only State of Punjab was arrayed as a respondent. But senior panel counsel for Union of India Sourabh Goel appeared. He submitted that the Union of India was a necessary party. Among other things, he contended that the petitioner had changed his identity. He could be identified and arrested when certain documents were found during investigation. Justice Jhingan further observed the facts emanating were that “business intelligence and fraud analytics” was used for taking data from GSTIN. The Goods and Services Tax Department had information that three firms were engaged in availing and passing bogus input tax credits. The firms issued bills worth Rs 158 crore, involving Rs 13.39 crore of tax and availed fake input tax credit of Rs 21.60 crore, and claimed a refund of Rs 5.02 crore.Justice Jhingan added the veil created for establishing firms was required to be pierced. The fact that the petitioner remained behind a smokescreen by withholding his identity and true identities of partners of the firms could not be ignored. To state such a person, if granted bail, would not flee or abscond was a risky proposition to be accepted.Justice Jhingan further added the GST was introduced with the object of ‘one nation, one tax’. “There is a chain of sellers and purchasers who are inter-connected, as the purchaser gets the credit of the tax paid or suffered by the seller. The chain can be within the state or Pan-India. One non-genuine or bogus link in the chain has an impact on all,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-rejects-bail-in-bogus-tax-refund-case-205181

The amount is to be paid from “his personal pocket”.This is the first time in recallable past that an IAS officer of Principal Secretary-level has been asked to shell out exemplary costs from his pocket. Taking up the matter, Justice Sehrawat reiterated that further adjournment would not be granted in the matter “for any reason whatsoever”.Justice Sehrawat was hearing a petition filed against the State of Punjab and other respondents by Himanshu Kukkar and other petitioners through senior advocate DS Patwalia and Salil Sabhlok.Justice Sehrawat asserted the counsel for the state sought adjournment to complete the instructions, after the counsel for the petitioners addressed substantial part of his arguments. It was further pointed out by the state counsel that nobody had assisted her from the department with regard to the case before the Bench.Dubbing the attitude of state officers as totally callous and indifferent, Justice Sehrawat asserted the court on the previous date had not left any doubt that the case would be taken up for final hearing.Despite that, respondent-Principal Secretary to the Government of Punjab, Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, did not ensure that the state counsel was properly instructed so that she could be ready for the arguments in the matter.“Lest any severe prejudice be caused to the cause of state, this court intends to grant adjournment. However, such adjournment has to be with an exemplary cost,” Justice Sehrawat added while fixing the case for March third week.Justice Sehrawat further added the cost would be deposited with Poor Patients’ Welfare Funds, PGI, Chandigarh, within a period of two weeks from today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-principal-secy-told-to-pay-rs-2-lakh-costs-from-pocket-205183

The department has to submit a report by March 4.The commission is said to have taken the step after Dr Jatinder Singh Mattu, state president of Dr Ambedkar Employees’ Federation, filed a complaint regarding alleged fake SC certificates.In his complaint, he alleged when many general category candidates could not make it to the merit list, they got made fake SC certificates and opted in the SC category to get jobs. The Education Department had, erroneously, allowed the candidates to change their category after the results of the recruitment were out.The department, through a notice issued on December 16, had given a time window to the candidates to change their categories during the counselling.However, the department clarified that it gave a chance to change the categories only after it received request applications in this regard.Dr Mattu said, “As many as 400 candidates, belonging to the general category, opted for the SC category after the department allowed them to change the category. This raises a suspicion on how so many candidates applied for the wrong category despite being highly educated.”Deep Banarsi, press secretary, ETT-TET Pass Unemployed Union, said, “Why did the government allow changing one’s category when the result was already out? An inquiry should be conducted.”Finally, the SC commission, in its directive, said it would be binding on them to take action against the department if it failed to comply with the order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/probe-fake-schedule-castes-certificates-panel-tells-education-dept-205187

The medical university could fill only 68 vacant seats in the fifth and final round of counselling, which concluded today, leaving 496 vacant.Though many dental colleges have offered a huge waiver in tuition fee, they have failed to attract sufficient number of students.colleges fear closureManagements of some dental colleges are fearing closure, as is the case with nursing colleges in the state. They rue IELTS has come as a big hurdle in the way of state dental and nursing institutes. Earlier, nursing and dental graduate degrees were preferred by young girls planning to go abroad, but now, after passing IELTS, most of the aspirants prefer to go abroad on a study visa.For the fifth round of counselling, the BFUHS had even invited applications from new candidates who had not applied or registered earlier. Despite some dental colleges offering waiver and concession in tuition fee to lure students, there were very few candidates who applied afresh for admission to vacant seats.The management of some dental colleges said they were facing closure, like the one faced by nursing colleges. They rued IELTS had come as a big block in the way of state dental and nursing institutes. Earlier, nursing and dental graduate degrees were most preferred by young girls planning to go abroad, but now, after passing IELTS, most of the aspirants prefer to go abroad on a study visa to pursue nursing there.The economic condition of most of the nursing colleges, in the absence of adequate number of students, can be gauged from the fact that more than 75 nursing colleges in Punjab are defaulter in paying the miscellaneous annual charges to the BFUHS.Other than causing a huge financial loss to dental colleges, the remaining vacant about 500 BDS seats was a big economic loss to the state economy, said a member of Private Medical and Dental Colleges’ Association.For a four-year BDS course, a student has to pay Rs 1.65 lakh and Rs 2.2 lakh per year tuition fee on the government and management quota seat, respectively, with a 10 per cent increase in the fee every year. It is loss of over Rs 43 crore to the state economy when 500 seats remain vacant.In Punjab, there are 15 dental colleges, including two government, at Amritsar and Patiala.

30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ agitation: SAD asks party workers to rush to protest sites at Delhi borders||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday asked its party cadre to rush to the three farmers’ protest sites on Delhi borders in large numbers to give a further boost to the ongoing agitation.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal also spoke to farmer leader Rakesh Tikait and discussed ways to shore up more strength and support for the farmers’ agitation in Delhi, especially in view of the “combined onslaught against farmers by the BJP and the Centre”, a party statement said.Consequent upon the telephonic conversation with Tikait, Badal instructed the Akali cadre to rush to Delhi borders in larger numbers than before and lend strength to the peaceful movement, it added.While many Akali contingents have already joined the farmers in the gathering, more are on the way in large numbers, Badal said.Senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia also appealed to SAD and Youth Akali Dal (YAD) workers who had returned to Punjab during the past one week to go back to the protest sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, the statement said.It said Badal on Friday sent an Akali delegation comprising senior leader Balwinder Singh Bhunder, SAD Delhi president Harmit Singh Kalka and the DSGMC chief Manjindner Singh Sirsa to the site of the farmers dharna led by Tikait.The leaders had extensive talks with Tikait and discussed ways to lend more strength to the agitation, it added.The delegation assured Tikait of “whole-hearted support in terms of men, material and morale” to the farmers’ cause, the statement said.Majitha said more partymen need to be at protest sites when the government wants to crush the agitation.“I know a large number of you have been camping on the Delhi borders since the last two months. However, the central government is making attempts to crush the ‘kisan andolan’ (agitation) in league with the BJP government in Haryana,” he said.“We must ensure this nefarious design to silence the voice of the ‘annadaata’ and disrespect the sacrifice of eighty martyrs (farmers) does not succeed at any cost. No sacrifice is too big to ensure a win for the peasantry as well as ensuring peace and communal harmony,” the statement quoted Majitha as saying.The SAD leader also condemned the “crude attempts” being made to suppress the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws “by letting loose lumpen elements on peacefully agitating farmers at Ghazipur on Thursday during the course of which farmer leader Rakesh Takait was targeted”.“Similar attempts were made at Singhu border on Friday,” he alleged.Majithia said such scenes were “extremely unfortunate” in a democracy.“Coercive steps like cutting off water and power supply to the dharna sites and stopping food from reaching them would only strengthen the kisan andolan even further.”              He said it was also condemnable that the “central government was instigating communities to fight against each other and also fomenting fights between farmers as well as farmer organisations”.He appealed to farmers, farm labourers and people to maintain peace and communal harmony “despite grave provocations”.Majithia also denounced the manner in which the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was being “misused” against farmer leaders and journalists.He said the UAPA had been framed against those challenging the unity and integrity of India and should not be used to persecute innocent people.“Doing so amounts to dictatorial conduct,” Majithia added.Farmers should not be singled out for fighting for the repeal of the three agricultural laws as well as the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report in letter and spirit.Majithia, whose party had snapped ties with the NDA over farm laws issue, said the central government had not taken any action against those indulged in wrongful acts on Republic Day in Delhi “which has sent a clear message to the people that state agencies were behind them.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-agitation-sad-asks-party-workers-to-rush-to-protest-sites-at-delhi-borders-205133

At some places, the raids were stopped for some time and then resumed.Raids were conducted on a total of 45 godowns.A statement issued by the CBI said they were checking the quantity and quality of foodgrains procured by the FCI from Punjab and Haryana.The CBI is primarily also checking if the foodgrains stored in the godown were actually procured from farmers here, or if goodgrakns procured at very low prices from other states were being passed on to the central pool, after claiming the high MSP of foodgrains.Unconfirmed reports suggest that in at least two godowns of Punjab, the raiding teams have found rice bags from Bihar, passed off as paddy procured from Punjab on MSP.In Haryana the raids were conducted in Sirsa and Shahbad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cbi-raids-40-fci-godowns-in-punjab-10-in-haryana-205011
