28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Jalandhar NIT develops service robot for use in hospitals and by security agencies||A multi-purpose service robot ‘Cutebot' has been developed by Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, for multiple uses, including in a hospital environment as well as by security agencies for surveillance.The robot is also enabled with a wheeled mobile platform.Doctors and medical staff can interact with patients of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases through the audio-visual screen of the robot while sitting in their rooms as it is equipped with a camera and voice communication system, an official statement said on Thursday.They can help in guiding patients on medicines and also deliver refreshments in the isolation wards.For security personnel, it can help in surveillance and in some other required areas, it said.The robot has been designed jointly by Kuldeep Singh Nagla, Associate Professor and a specialist in robotics and automation, and Professor LK Awasthi, director of the institute.It was recently unveiled by Chairperson of Board of Governors of NIT Jalandhar Subhash Chandra Ralhan here.The robot can carry around 15 kg weight in the hospital environment besides doing some other jobs.Nagla said Cutebot can be controlled both through the internet and wire-based joy stick within a radius of 25-30 meters. It moves at a variable speed with a maximum of 22 meters per minute.It can easily maneuver between two hospital beds. After continuously working for a minimum of two hours, the robot can be recharged. It can also adopt independent UV light disinfector on its platform, he said, as per the statement.Besides, it can further be used as an electronic cart to carry garbage, hospital waste and other materials in the hospitals. It can also be used as a station inside the hospital wards to monitor the activities around the patient.The same robot can be used in domestic environments to attend to elders or disabled persons, in hotels and marriage ceremonies to serve food, among others.“Interestingly, the robot can easily be modified to control from several hundred kilometres through the internet just by changing the software. This up-gradation may prove to be suitable for security agencies while working in operational fields,” Nagla said."Costing between Rs 2 to Rs 2.5 lakh after mass production, the Cutebot is unique because of its low cost as compared to other such robots available in foreign markets,” said Prof Awasthi.He said it could rotate its head, which is a screen, more than 360 degrees to communicate.He said the institute had transferred the technology to a Gujarat-based company for its mass production and commercialisation.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for Atmanirbhar Bharat, the faculty and students of the institute have filed more than 50 Intellectual Property Rights in the form of patents, copyright and designs during the last couple of years, he said.He also said that during the pandemic time, the institute had transferred five technologies to the industry and products invented by NIT Jalandhar are in the market now. These are air purifiers, facemasks, ultraviolet cleaner, among others, Awasthi added.

28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Understand the government’s fascist plans: Joginder Singh Ugrahan||BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) has called on all the supporters of the struggle to identify the dangerous intentions of Modi government in its conspiratorial action of hoisting the flag at Red Fort and to fight and make them unsuccessful.The organisation has strongly condemned the nefarious efforts of the Modi government to mobilise Hindu communal elements and to falsely propagate against the Morcha at the Singhu border and its wicked attempt to spread police terror at the Ghazipur border, calling it bewilderment of the Modi government.Addressing a massive rally of the convoy at the border, the state president of the organisation Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the Modi government through its agents and by misleading some unknown sections had carried out the flag hoisting operation at the Red Fort so that the farmers struggle could be defamed so that, this peasant struggle could be presented as a struggle for the rule of a particular community and the struggle could be brought under attack by eroding the widespread support for the struggle created among the people across the country.This government, which specialises in hatching such heinous conspiracies, now wants to defame the struggle and tear apart the organisations by crushing them with fascist attacks.Therefore, by filing false cases, arresting hundreds of people and intensifying communal fascist mobilisation against the struggle in the country, a grand conspiracy is being hatched.In such a scenario, all the struggling people and organisations should further strengthen their unity and solidarity and expand their numbers at all the borders and at the same time strongly call out the support base of the Morcha in the states.Addressing the rally, a dozen leaders of the organisation, including state leaders Jaswinder Singh Longowal and Harinder Kaur Bindu, called for the complete expulsion of government agents from the struggle and at the same time he appealed to the people to have faith in victory in favor of the struggle by identifying the wrong leadership and those who differentiate between the ranks.The leaders emphasised that the fog of communal and patrician propaganda should be dispelled by focusing on the demands of the struggle. He said that plans have been made for action in the coming days which will be announced soon after consultation with the leaders of the United Front.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/understand-the-governments-fascist-plans-joginder-singh-ugrahan-204636

28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Javadekar trying to shift blame for Delhi violence: Amarinder Singh||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday slammed Union Minister Prakash Javadekar over his “disgraceful and desperate” attempt to shift blame for the violence that broke out during the farmers’ tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day.Singh alleged that the agitating farmers were instigated by supporters and members of the BJP in collusion with the AAP which led to the parade descending into chaos as a section of protesters broke prior agreement with the Delhi Police and indulged in violence and hooliganism.Javadekar had on Wednesday blamed the Congress for the violence and alleged that India would not tolerate its flag’s insult at the Red Fort. He also claimed that the Congress had always worked to incite farmers during the ongoing agitation.“Workers and supporters of the BJP and the AAP, and not the Congress, have been caught on camera waving the ‘Nishan Sahib’ at the Red Fort,” said Singh while replying to Javadekar’s allegations.Amrik Micky, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member, was also spotted at the violence site, alleged Singh.Singh’s comments came even as Delhi Police named actor Deep Sidhu in an FIR in connection with Red Fort incident.The Chief Minister said not a single Congress leader or member was seen at the Red Fort indulging in any kind of lawlessness.He said farmers, too, were not responsible for the violence, which was caused by “anti-social” elements who had infiltrated the tractor parade.The Centre should also get a free and fair probe conducted into the possible role of any political party, or even a third country as was being alleged by the BJP’s own leaders, to ensure that the guilty were punished and the genuine farmers were not unnecessarily harassed, he added.The Chief Minister also lashed out at Javadekar for accusing Congress leaer Rahul Gandhi of inciting violence.“Did Rahul Gandhi ask anyone to climb the Red Fort? He did not. It was the BJP and the AAP men who did that,” Singh said, adding that Gandhi had promptly condemned the violence and made it clear that it would not solve the crisis.“These allegations are nothing but an attempt to cover-up the BJP’s role in the violence and the central government’s utter failure to manage the situation, which they had created in the first place with the unilateral implementation of the black farm laws,” he said.The Union Minister had said the opposition party could not escape its responsibility as it was in power in Punjab while adding that the state government should have arrested criminal elements as a preventive measure as people drove their tractors from there to the protest venue in Delhi.Permission for the tractor march was officially given by the Delhi Police and there was no reason for the Punjab government to prevent farmers from joining the rally, said the Chief Minister.“How could I stop peaceful farmers from going to their own national capital to exercise their democratic right of protest,” the Chief Minister said.If there was a ban on the movement of farmers to the Delhi borders, the Central Government, of which Javadekar is a part, should have directed their BJP Chief Minister in Haryana to stop them on the way, he said.Pinning the blame for the violence on the Punjab government or on the Congress was clearly a “diversionary tactic” on the part of the BJP leadership, he stated.Singh pointed out that all those months when the farmers were blocking railway tracks in Punjab, he had been reaching out repeatedly to the central leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of ministers, to intervene and resolve the crisis.“But nobody heeded us, nobody listened to me or to the agitating farmers, fighting for their survival,” he said.This “insensitivity” of the BJP and the Central Government to the pain and anguish of the farmers was causing a “heavy loss” for the nation, said the Chief Minister.

I urge PM @NarendraModi Ji to ask Ministry of Home Affairs to include Punjabi as one of the official languages of J&K. pic.twitter.com/005i1PZwj1When Jammu and Kashmir came into existence as an independent state, Punjabi was a widely spoken language there and is now the mother tongue of all the Punjabis in the Jammu region, besides being spoken by the Punjabi community living in Kashmir Valley, he wrote.The Chief Minister pointed out that under the Jammu and Kashmir Languages Bill, 2020 which was passed by both the Houses of Parliament with voice vote in September 2020, Kashmiri, Dogri and Hindi were included in the list of official languages in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in addition to the existing Urdu and English.Unfortunately, Punjabi was not included in the list of languages, which are not just official languages now of the UT but will also be taught in schools as compulsory subjects. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/include-punjabi-as-official-language-in-jammu-and-kashmir-punjab-cm-amarinder-204566
28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu hits out at farmer leaders; objects being called 'traitor'||Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who has been accused by farm bodies of trying to defame their agitation and termed a “traitor”, has hit out at farm leaders for allegedly spreading false propaganda and hatred against him.The 36-year-old Sidhu, who is in the eye of a storm for being among the protesters who put up a religious flag atop the Red Fort on Republic Day, claimed that youth did not agree to follow the route which was decided by farmer leaders and the Delhi Police.He claimed people “on their own” marched towards the Red Fort from all the Delhi borders on January 26 and that not many people took the route as decided by farmer leaders.Slamming the farm leadership for accusing him of being a “BJP and RSS man”, he said, “Will RSS or BJP’s man put up the ‘Nishan Sahib’ and a farmer flag at Red Fort? At least think over it”.Sidhu was present at the Red Fort when a religious flag and a farmer flag were put at the flagpole at the historic monument, triggering massive outrage.He sought to dismiss the claims of several farmer leaders who accused him of inciting protesters to head towards the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor parade January 26.“I am seeing that false propaganda and hatred is being spread against me,” Sidhu charged in the latest video uploaded on his Facebook post.Sharing details about what happened on the night of January 25, Sidhu said youth and many people had told farmer leaders that they (farm leaders) had invited them to hold a protest inside Delhi on January 26 and that they had now changed their stand at the last moment.Sidhu said he reached the Red Fort after its gate was broken.Thousands of people had reached there, but there was “no farmer leader” present there, said Sidhu while claiming that nobody indulged in violence or damaged any public property.They put up the ‘Nishan Sahib’ and a farmer flag at the flagpole to register their protest, said Sidhu adding that many people were carrying ‘Nishan Sahib’ flags, farmer flags and the tricolour.“If you say by doing, so I have turned traitor then those who were present there were traitors too,” said Sidhu.“If you impose all these things on one person and give him a certificate of traitor then I think you should be ashamed of yourself,” said Sidhu.“Had our farmer leadership and each person taken a stand and said that look, what our farmers had done and if the rights of these farmers are not given, then these farmers can do anything, there would have been a huge pressure on the government,” he said.“But I was given a traitor certificate by our own men,” he rued.Farmer leaders on Wednesday had called Sidhu as a “traitor” and had given a call for his boycott in the state. They had also dubbed him as an “agent” of the government.Sidhu said “lakhs of people” could not come on the call of only one person, while rubbishing the accusation of farmer leaders that he had incited people to head towards the Red Fort.Stating that he did not bring any disrepute to the farmers’ agitation, Sidhu further accused the farmer leaders of being “arrogant” and said that they wanted whatever decisions they take should be accepted by all.“You are so jealous and so arrogant that you do not listen to anyone. Whatever decision is taken must be accepted by all,” he said, adding, “If I reveal deep secrets, then there will be no way to flee (for farm leaders).”         He also alleged that the government would send people after him to hurt him.On January 26, Sidhu, hailing from Punjab’s Muktsar district, had sought to defend the action of protesters at the Red Fort, saying they did not remove the national flag and had put up the ‘Nishan Sahib’ as a symbolic protest.Sidhu was also a close aide of BJP MP Sunny Deol, who contested from the Gurdaspur seat in Punjab during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. He remained with Deol during the poll campaigning.Deol had distanced himself from Sidhu in December last year after he joined the farmers’ agitation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-actor-deep-sidhu-hits-out-at-farmer-leaders-objects-being-called-traitor-204562

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Centre wanted farmers to get provoked, says Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Thursday alleged that the BJP-led central government wanted the farmers to get provoked and turn violent so that their ongoing protest against three new agriculture laws got maligned.It was referring to the violence that erupted in Delhi during the farmers' tractor parade on Republic Day.The party said the violence was not in the national interest.The Maharashtra BJP, however, termed the Sena's allegation against the central government "baseless".In an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Sena said, "The farmers' agitation against the three farm laws has been going on in a peaceful manner for the last 60 days. The protesters have been camping on Delhi borders, seeking repeal of the three new laws. There was neither any division among the protesting farmers, nor did they lose their patience.”"The central government could not do much about it. It wanted the farmers to get provoked and turn violent so that their protest gets maligned. On January 26, its wish came true. But it also brought a bad name to the country,” the Sena alleged.“It is easy to say that the farmers took the law into their own hands. But they have been seeking withdrawal of the farm laws. What about that?” it said.The self-respect of farmers from Punjab is troubling the Centre, the party claimed."It is not correct to blame only the farmers for the violence in Delhi. What the government wanted was brought to reality, but farmers and the police suffered due to it," it added."Who will hold the government accountable for what happened?” the Sena asked.It alleged that the BJP's "intelligence machinery" found that the violence was pre-planned and "terrorists have taken over the agitation"."The leader of the violent protest was one Deep Sidhu, associated with the BJP. Farmer leaders have said that Sidhu was instigating the farmers for the last two months, but everyone showed patience," the Sena added."The farmers want three agriculture laws repealed. But why is the government adamant?" it asked.Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said the Sena's charge against the Centre was “baseless”.“It is unfortunate that some people don't see beyond politics and want to spread anarchy in the name of farmers' protest,” he said.The tractor parade on Tuesday that was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of Delhi as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.Delhi Police have registered several FIRs in connection with the violence.

While the voting for the local bodies election is scheduled on February 14, a large number of teachers have already been deployed on the poll duty.Claiming that schools had reopened for offline classes only on January 7 after remaining shut for the past about nine months, it said the teachers be spared from the election duty for the benefitof the students.Krishan Kumar, secretary, School Education Department, said sparing the teachers from the election duty was more relevant in view of the ‘Mission Shat Pratishat’ for 2020-21, aimed at empowering schools to achieve 100 per cent results despitethe pandemic in the state. This mission was launched by the Chief Minister on November 7, last year.At the time when the teachers’ presence in the schools is of utmost importance for the students for their better performance in the final exams to achieve 100 per cent results, it is better if the non-teaching staff be assigned the election duties, read the secretary’s letter.It is better if the teachers be exempted from poll duties so that they can continueto conduct offline classes in the last three months of the academic year.Last week, over 100 teachers and heads of various government schools in the district were assigned the election duties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/exempt-teachers-from-poll-duty-punjab-education-department-urges-dcs-204244

Four of its senior judges have retired this month and two elevated as Chief Justices. As of now, the High Court has 36 vacancies of judges and will be working at almost half its sanctioned strength of 85 after the retirement of four more judges later this year. Among the top 10 judges, Justice Nirmaljit Kaur retired today after attaining the age of superannuation.Case count risingAs of now, the Allahabad High Court has the highest number of pending cases at 7.71 lakh. It is followed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which is facing a pendency of 6,44,679 cases. In the absence of new appointments of judges and the physical hearing of cases, the problem is expected to worsen in the coming months.The High Court went into restrictive functioning mode in March last year following the apprehensions of Covid outbreak. After initial hiccups, it is currently hearing over 1,200 cases daily through videoconferencing — a formidable task because of the odds. But primarily matters involving an element of public interest or urgency are being taken up.An order passed by the High Court now says that limited physical hearing will commence shortly in addition to the present system of hearing matter through videoconferencing. In the first instance, all criminal appeals which are already admitted for the final hearing where accused is in custody will be heard. But advocates are sceptical about significant reduction in the arrears till more courts go into the offline mode. In any case, the High Court is expected to witness an unmanageable flood of litigation once it reopens for normal “physical” operations.Available information suggests much bigger Allahabad High Court with 95 judges against the sanctioned strength of 168 never really went into restrictive functioning and continued with physical hearing throughout the Covid period with some interruptions in between.The National Judicial Data Grid — the monitoring tool to identify, manage and reduce pendency of cases — suggests 1,03,994 of the total pending cases in the High Court here up to a year old; 2,31,637 are pending between one and three years; 92,551 between 10 and 20 years, and 10,519 cases are awaiting adjudication for the last 20 to 30 years. The collegium has recommended five advocates for elevation.

Puzzled but not the one to lose her cool, Justice Nirmaljit Kaur — who went on to deliver landmark judgments in high-profile matters such as the acquittal verdict in Salman Khan’s chinkaras’ poaching case — told the security to call up the police. What surfaced after the call was one of the worst scandals to rock the Indian judiciary. It was alleged after a probe that the money was meant for delivery at the residence of Judge Nirmal Yadav. The matter, which came to be known as ‘cash-at-door scam’, is still pending before the trial court.

The attempts to taint the farm organisations, united under the banner of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, will hit the bargaining power of the unions with the Centre over the three farm laws. These are the views expressed by agricultural experts and sociologists in the region, who feel that the farmer unions will have to re-strategise their struggle.Reinvent strategyPeople will be cautious in supporting them, till farmer unions reinvent their strategy… even if it is a conspiracy, it will affect the outcome. Unions will have to counter this immediately. — Parmod Kumar, Director, IDCTuesday’s events, they say, might erode some support for the struggle. Parmod Kumar, socio-political expert and director of the Institute for Development and Communication, says the farm struggle was in the domain of a legitimate movement till Tuesday. “Now, a large section of people will be cautious in supporting them, till they reinvent their strategy. Even if it is a conspiracy, it will affect the outcome. Farm organisations will have to counter this immediately and effectively,” he adds.Eminent farm economist Ranjit Singh Ghuman says what happened in Delhi on Tuesday was unfortunate. “Though the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has immediately dissociated itself from the errant organisations, it has had an adverse impact on the movement. Farm unions will have to use all democratic instruments to once again restore their image as peace-loving protesters, so that they can restore their own bargaining power with the government,” he says.Dr Lakhwinder Singh, another eminent economist, says even as the voice of farmers — their version of how the events unfolded and the persons responsible for the violating the law — was throttled, the social media played the role of spreading their narrative. “But this has come as a setback. The narrative that has been created by the miscreants will have to be countered effectively,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/r-day-events-setback-to-stir-experts-204232

We know that political parties are hatching conspiracies to derail our protest. It’s a big fight that can only be won with peace not violence. — Joginder S Ugrahan, BKU (Urgrahan) chiefPutting up a show of strength at Singhu, the farmer leaders alleged that it was the BJP-led central government’s conspiracy to allow the protesters to march towards the Red Fort. Rajewal gave a call to “throw out the filth out of the farmers’ movement” a day after the violence at the Red Fort.Questioning the role of the Delhi Police, he alleged the protesters heading to the Red Fort were escorted by cops but those marching on the route agreed upon were stopped by raising the barricades.Farmer leader Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala said Khalistani Gurpatwant Singh Pannu had announced a reward of $2.5 lakh for hoisting the “flag of Khalistan” on the Red Fort. Now Lakha Sidhana, Deep Sidhu, Students for Society and Democratic Students Organisation in Punjabi University must tell how much share all of them got from that. The slogans of ‘Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana murdabad’ echoed in the pandal at Singhu. He said the history would not forgive the traitors for backstabbing the farmers.Dr Darshan Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union said the organisations that joined hands with Deep Sidhu would be punished. He said they would take decision in the kisan morcha meeting.Farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said whatever happened on Tuesday was BJP sponsored. He also chanted the slogans of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ amid massive response from people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unions-give-call-to-boycott-traitors-204233

28-01-2021||---||Condemn violence, but stand by farmers: CM||Chandigarh, January 27Condemning the Republic Day violence in Delhi, especially at the Red Fort, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday termed it an insult to the nation and said it had brought shame to the country and weakened the farmers’ agitation.He, however, made it clear that he continued to stand with the farmers as the agricultural laws were wrong and against the country’s federal ethos. Stressing that the Red Fort was a symbol of Independent India and thousands of people had laid down their lives for freedom, the CM said Mahatma Gandhi had fought the entire war of Independence with the weapon of non-violence. “My head hangs in shame at what happened in the national capital on Tuesday.” Even as he demanded action against the perpetrators, who he said were not farmers but misguided youth indulging in symbolism, Capt Amarinder said such problems would continue to take place if the Centre fails to listen to the public.Bring perpetrators to bookThe Delhi Police should probe and take action against the perpetrators. The Centre should also probe the involvement of any political party, while making sure that no farmer leaders are unnecessarily targeted or harassed by the police. Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief MinisterA government for the people and by the people cannot ignore the will of the people, he said, adding that the performance of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre would not be acceptable in the next elections to a majority in a country where 70 per cent of the population was of farmers. The BJP should realise that stability and secularism, encompassing all minorities, was the key to the inclusive growth of the nation, Capt Amarinder added.Reiterating that the farm laws would be death knell for the economic empowerment of future generations of the protesting farmers, the CM said private corporates were even now functioning in Punjab and could continue coming into the state without destroying the established system of the MSP, arhtiyas and the public distribution system.Meanwhile, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Sunil Jakhar said the violence was a pre-planned act of the BJP-led government that facilitated the movement of ‘wrong elements’ to the Red Fort so that it could succeed in undermining the genuine cause of farmers. “The BJP seems to have succeeded in diverting attention from the core issue as evidence clearly suggests that Deep Sidhu was planted to foment trouble by trying to give the stir a communal colour. However, the farmers’ cause is bigger than any other cause of any union or party.”Blaming the BJP government and the Delhi Police for targeting the peaceful protesters than those responsible for the violence, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa said: “The masterminds of Tuesday’s incident should be thoroughly probed and an action must also be taken against those proven to be close to the ruling dispensation.” He said the FIR against the farm leaders was an attempt to malign and misdirect the public and to paint the protest movement as violent or anti-national.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/condemn-violence-but-stand-by-farmers-cm-204235
28-01-2021||---||How Deep Sidhu & Co hijacked march||Chandigarh, January 27Despite being shunned by farmer unions at various stages of the ongoing agitation, actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu had been attempting to take a leadership role in the movement for the past many months.A day ahead of the tractor march by farmer unions, he was seen campaigning on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi. The position taken by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, which is not part of the 32 farmer organisations, of not sticking to the original route, along with the BKU (Krantikari), gave Deep Sidhu the opportunity to create trouble.Shameful & unfortunate: Village panchDeep Sidhu has been misleading farmers, especially youngsters, ever since the protest began. His yesterday’s act is shameful and unfortunate. Jagdeep Singh, panchayat member of actor’s native Udekaran villageOn Monday, a group led by Deep Sidhu took over the main stage at Singhu, and along with gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, announced they would hold the march “inside Delhi”. “They formed a five-member committee as well,” said Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala, vice-president, Kirti Kisan Union.They had a plan ready by Tuesday morning. “They started a march of their own much before the official one began, and positioned their ‘henchmen’ in large numbers at a road turning towards central Delhi. From there, they directed other tractors towards the Red Fort,” said farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal.Volunteers deputed by the unions did try to intervene, but they were outnumbered. “I tried to request them not to do that but they insulted me as well,” said Rajewal.Around a month ago, during a meeting of the 32 farmer unions, one of the leaders had termed Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana as “enemies of this struggle”.During the last Lok Sabha elections, Deep Sidhu was campaigning for BJP’s Gurdaspur candidate Sunny Deol, and had even posed with PM Narendra Modi. He was accused of being an “RSS agent” by farmer unions in Punjab.The ‘Shambu morcha’, as the actor called it, had been receiving “live streaming” support from some pro-Khalistan channels.Around two weeks ago he wrote to the unions, expressing his desire to get associated with their platforms. However, the plea was rejected.Meanwhile, Deep Sidhu posted a video on his Facebook page, saying, “We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/how-deep-sidhu-co-hijacked-march-204236
28-01-2021||Tarn Taran||Tarn Taran youth who hoisted flag at Red Fort has no separatist link: Cops||Jugraj Singh, a youth from Wan Tara Singh village of Tarn Taran, who hoisted the Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort, has no separatist or criminal background, the police said.His father Baldev Singh was an expert in putting up Nishan Sahib at gurdwaras. Jugraj often assisted his father in the task.His grandfather Mehal Singh (90) said they had never ever been associated with any separatist movement. Jugraj joined the farmers’ agitation three days back, he added.According to natives of Wan Tara Singh village, Jugraj must have been among the first group that reached the Red Fort. Since it was a tedious task to hoist the flag at such a height, he must have volunteered to do it without understanding the consequences. Soon, the video clip of the act went viral. Khalra police station SHO Shaminderjit Singh said they had verified that the family had no criminal record. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tarn-taran-youth-who-hoisted-flag-at-red-fort-has-no-separatist-link-cops-204237

We acted responsibility and as per the agreement we wanted to facilitate a peaceful tractor parade. As many as 394 personnel of Delhi police are injured, many are hospitalised and some in are in ICU. Among property damaged are 408 barricades, four X-ray machines, 30 Delhi vehicles and six containers,” Shrivastava added.“The agreement was that the tractor parade will not start before 12 noon but farmers started marching from 6.30 am onwards. From Singhu border the farmers started coming to Mukarba Chowk at 7.30 am and refused to take the right turn as agreed upon earlier. Their leader Satnam Singh Pannu delivered provocative statements and once the speech ended he called upon everyone to break the barricades. Darshan Pal Singh sat at Mukarba Chowk refusing to turn right,” said Shrivastava, adding that no one will be spared if found guilty.He said so far 19 persons had been arrested, 50 detained and 25 plus criminal cases registered against the culprits. “CCTV footages are being analysed and face recognition systems used to identify the guilty. Investigations are underway,” the police commissioner said.Shrivastava said the police had urged the farm leaders to lead the tractor parade and be present with each group to control them but “farmers from all the borders betrayed the agreement and broke barricades to enter the city”.He said Delhi police’s decision to exercise restraint – as per the agreed upon terms with the farmers – ensured that not even one life was lost due to police action.Shrivastava accused farm leaders of handing over their stage on January 25 to militant elements who delivered provocative speeches making their intentions for January 26 clear.“We maintained extreme restraint because we wanted to facilitate a peaceful tractor parade as agreed on. The farmer leaders however did not honour any terms of the tractor parade,” Shrivastava said.On the Red Fort events the top cop said several farmers unions hoisted their flags and religious flags which are now case property.Among the terms agreed upon with farmer leaders in five meetings regarding the parade were – the parade will start at 12 noon and end to 5 pm; top leaders will lead; leaders will accompany every group; there will not be more than 5,000 tractors and no firearm or deadly weapon will be carried.“The farm union leaders had signed an undertaking to honour these terms but they did not,” said Shrivastava.He said the police had learnt of the tractor parade plan on January 2 and was since then engaged with the farmers. Five meetings were held; routes agreed on and undertakings signed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-one-will-be-spared-delhi-top-cop-names-pannu-tikait-darshan-pal-for-violation-of-tractor-parade-terms-204157
28-01-2021||---||Two farmer unions break away from farmers’ agitation||New Delhi, January 27In an aftermath of the Red Fort siege and violence on capital’s roads during the tractor parade on Tuesday, divisions surfaced in the farm unions’ camp on Wednesday with the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee and the BKU (Bhanu) quitting the ongoing protests and announcing their own plans to struggle for justice.AIKSCC chief VM Singh and BKU Bhanu’s Bhanu Pratap Singh today addressed a press conference to announce that their organisations were withdrawing from the ongoing farmers’ protests which had lost the legitimacy and the moral authority to continue after what happened yesterday.Asked if the entire AIKSCC was dissociating from protests, VM Singh said he was dissociating as the national president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (RKMS). VM Singh said his organisation will leave the Ghazipur protest site. Read also: Farmer leaders Rajewal, Ugrahan, Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Chudhni named in FIRs for Delhi violenceBoth AIKSCC and BKU (Bhanu) are Uttar Pradesh based organisations.Singh attacked BKU’s Rakesh Tikait for admitting to inciting violence and asking supporters to carry batons, sticks and flags to the parade besides breaking barricades yesterday and said, “We have not joined this agitation for people to die. The farmers are not here to do what we saw yesterday. They are not agitating for someone to become a political leader.”Singh asked whether BKU’s Rakesh Tikait who has attended all 10 dialogues with the government ever raised the concerns of sugarcane farmers with the Centre.Singh also slammed Tikait for breaking barricades asking, “Why did they start early for the parade?”Singh added, “Whoever has done the wrong yesterday needs to be acted against. Ours is an agriculture dominated nation. Our agitation will continue but not in the current form. We cannot run the agitation with those who have their own separate roads and plans. We are withdrawing from the agitation,” VM Singh said.The announcements came even as Samyukta Kisan Morcha was holding its own meeting amid signs that they would dissociate from some farm organisations after the mayhem on capital roads yesterday.Meanwhile, farmer unions said VM Singh was removed from post of convener of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) a month ago.VM Singh was accused of taking pro-government positions. On December 14, he was removed as convener of AIl India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee.He is taking a decision on behalf of a committee he is no more a convener of, claimed unions.Meanwhile, sources said from Ghazipur most farmers have returned home. Earlier, where there were around 3,000 tractors. Currently, around 150 to 200 tractors are remaining.BKU president Naresh Tikait had returned to Muzaffarnagar yesterday itself, they added.
