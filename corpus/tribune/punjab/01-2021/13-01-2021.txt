The thick layer of fog restricted the penetration of sun rays in the morning and the cold wind added to the chill and kept the mercury low.Hawkers, vegetable sellers, food delivery workers and milkmen faced difficulty in carrying out their work.Morning walkers also had a tough time in parks. Gurmeet Singh, an elderly person in Model Town Phase 3, said, “I was assuming that the fog would not be so thick, but when I stepped out of the door, I realised its enormity. I had a bad walk today.”Another resident, Ankush Aggarwal, said, “As per my routine, I woke up at 7 am. I could see the dense fog from my balcony. Visibility was less, so I had to cancel my morning walk and preferred to stay indoors.”A traffic police official said, “Emergency blinkers at the front and rear of the vehicles should be used during fog. Low-beam lights should be used, as high-beam lights hamper visibility.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dense-fog-throws-life-out-of-gear-in-punjabs-bathinda-197848

He came to the limelight when he managed to flee from the cordon of heavy force of the CRPF and the police from the tubewell room where he had taken shelter at night in November 1985 after ‘Operation Blue Star’.His three kanal land was acquired in 1992 by the police to make a police post under the Sarhali police station. Local residents were not sure if it was the family’s ancestral property or was purchased from someone else. Many said there was a Gurdwara at the place when the police took possession of the ‘house’. There were shops at the front portion of the land at the time of acquisition.Tarlochan and Ninder said the family had been fighting for a long time to take back the possession of their house but to no avail. Tarlochan, bed-ridden for the past 14 years, claimed that the Punjab and Haryana High Court had given a verdict in the family’s favour.Meanwhile, SSP Dhruman H Nimbale said the police had not vacated the land from where the Naushehra Pannuan police post was operational. He said the land was given by the village panchayat to the police and there was a proposal to allot a new place to the police for which the DSP visited the site.“The proposal would be sent to the Deputy Commissioner for approval and then the question of vacating the old building would be taken up,” the SSP said.Even today, ASI Kulbir Singh, along with some other policemen, was working from the spot.

The five men included shooters Gurjit Singh, alias Bhaa, and Sukhdeep Singh, alias Bura, besides three gangsters — Shabbir Ahmad, Ayub Pathan and Riyaz — all residents of Kashmir. They were arrested by the Delhi Police from the Shakarpur area of national capital on December 7 after a brief exchange of fire. The police had said they were linked to terrorist group Babbar Khalsa.The Tarn Taran police are yet to get custody of Sukhmeet Pal Singh, alias Sukh Bhikhariwal, the mastermind in the murder case, from the Delhi Police. He was arrested by the Dubai police and deported to Delhi a few days ago. Interrogation of the five suspects was crucial to solving the case. The local police had earlier arrested 11 suspects but were hesitant to disclose the motive behind the killing. The weapon used in the crime, too, was yet to be recovered.While the district police suspected family’s personal enmity with the gangsters as the cause of the killing, the kin said it was the handiwork of radical elements linked to ‘Referendum 2020’. The Delhi Police also supported the family’s claim. A police officer said interrogation would be key to finding the motive and establishing suspects’ links to radicals. Earlier, the district police had gone to Delhi twice to bring the two shooters on production warrant.2 unsuccessful bids||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/balwinder-case-2-shooters-among-5-brought-from-delhi-197621

Justice Anil Kshetarpal also directed the investigating agency to register an FIR against the erring officials “noticed in the report submitted by Special DGP, Punjab”, before asking it to carry out free, fair and impartial investigation into the matter.The directions by Justice Kshetarpal came on a petition filed against the state of Punjab and other respondents by Balwinder Singh through counsels CS Bakshi and Ankur Jain. Accused of illegally peddling contraband received from Pakistan along with certain others, he was being tried in an FIR registered under the provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act on August 4, 2017, and the Arms Act at SSOC police station in Amritsar. Justice Kshetarpal, during the course of hearing, noticed that affidavit filed by the Director-General of Police, Special Task Force, had left many questions unanswered.Subsequently, Director, Bureau of Investigation, Parmod Kumar, was directed to examine the police diaries, CCTV footage, documents, call details and tower locations of the mobile phones of the petitioner and police officials before submitting his report. Among other things, the report stated that pieces of evidence and expert opinion corroborated Balwinder’s version and cast a serious doubt about the initial version recorded in the FIR.Justice Kshetarpal added executive authority, at the highest level, was apprised of the alleged crime committed by the police officials, which provided punishment for vexatious entry, search, seizure or arrest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/man-framed-in-drugs-case-hc-orders-probe-197622

The profile and background of the members clearly showed that it had been done at the instance of Captain,” the core committee resolution said.Harcharan Bains, Principal Adviser to SAD president, said the core committee came down heavily against the “insane and irresponsible utterances” of the Government of India through its counsel in the Supreme Court in which it alleged the hand of Khalistani and other anti-peace and anti-national elements Meanwhile, two days before the Maghi, the SAD organised a religious event inMuktsar today to pray for the farmers who lost their lives during the protest at Delhi borders and for the success of the ongoing stir.While addressing the gathering, Sukhbir criticised the Congress, saying that the government did not take any people-friendly decision. “Amarinder made false promises to the people and failed to deliver,” he said, adding that people were not provided employment and there was no hike in pension as promised.He further appealed to the party members to take care of all those families who had lost their members in the ongoing protest on Delhi borders.

A new engine costs lakhs of rupees, but people are spending from their own pockets. At Bhogpur near Jalandhar, some mechanics are doing the job with perfection,” he says.Manjit Dhaner, vice-president of the BKU (Dakaunda), says with the help of local mechanics and fabricators, some people are modifying trailers too. “Earlier, tarpaulin sheets over trailers had caught fire after tear gas shells landed on them. Now, these have been replaced with wire mesh,” he says. With a recruitment drive for volunteers under way, modifications are being made to ferry them safely on tractors. “In Hoshiarpur, a group of farmers has hired long trailers to carry 10 tractors to the site,” says Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala, vice-president, Kirti Kisan Union.Those without tractors have also been queuing up as volunteers. They have been asked to carry portable water buckets to defuse tear gas shells, if the situation arises.Around 10,000 volunteers have come forward within a week of unions’ recruitment call. Punjab Students Union, Naujawan Bharat Sabha and Kirti Kisan Union are holding the drive in all districts of the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/modified-tractors-hardshell-trailers-for-r-day-march-197630

13-01-2021||---||Farm laws: Cabinet meet tomorrow, to discuss implications of SC orders||Chandigarh, January 12Hours after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three farm laws, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today convened an emergency Cabinet meeting on January 14 to discuss implications of the orders.Ahead of the meeting, the Chief Minister has asked Advocate General (AG) Atul Nanda to examine the SC order in detail.With the SC staying implementation of the three laws and farmers rejecting the same, the Congress government might have to change the line of its legal recourse in consultation with legal experts, said a senior government functionary.The state government had already finalised requisite petitions for challenging the central Acts. “Since these Acts impact the lives and futures of our farmers, all decisions will be taken carefully and judiciously at an opportune time,” the Chief Minister had said.“With the SC staying implementation of the laws, it is to be seen whether the state challenges the three Acts or appears before the three-member committee named by the apex court to put across its point of views. The state has already moved amendments to the central laws in the Vidhan Sabha, though pending with the Governor,” said a legal expert.The Chief Minister had stated that although matters related to agriculture were mentioned in List II (State List) of the Constitution of India and fell under the exclusive domain of the state government, the Government of India had enacted the three contentious farm laws under provisions related to Agriculture Marketing mentioned in List III (Concurrent List).Being a central legislation, the state government had limited options under Article 254(2) of the Constitution and had exercised the same with the Assembly passing Bills to amend the central laws. As per the law of the land, Bills passed by the Assembly were mandatorily required to be sent to the Governor, who after studying these had to give his consent for forwarding these to the President for approval, the CM had said.BoxAG asked to examine ruling* Advocate General Atul Nanda has been asked to examine the SC order in detail* The Congress govt had already finalised requisite petitions for challenging the central Acts* With SC staying implementation of laws, the state may have to change line of its legal recourse||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-laws-cabinet-meet-tomorrow-to-discuss-implications-of-sc-orders-197640
