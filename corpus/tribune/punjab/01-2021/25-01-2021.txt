He added that AAP workers present near the Kisan Sansad had attacked and manhandled Punjab Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and MLA Kulbir Singh Zira. “AAP is camping there,” he said, asserting that “No one but AAP is responsible for the attack. “Farmers are not responsible,” he added.“They (AAP) should understand, however, that this country is thriving on ‘lokshahi’ (democracy) and not ‘dhakashahi’ (push and shove),” he told the press on the sidelines of various events here in Patiala.Intelligence reports indicate that AAP workers had intermingled with farmers and assaulted the Congress leaders, the Chief Minister said later, adding that the AAP’s desperate attempts to undermine him and his government in Punjab were becoming more and more brazen by the day.“After their efforts to spread false propaganda and lies about the Congress government in Punjab had failed to mislead the farmers, they had resorted to violence against Bittu and Zira, he said.The farmers had no reason to assault the Punjab Congress leaders, Captain Amarinder said, adding that “such tactics would not help AAP drive a wedge between his government and the farmers, which they have been trying to do for months now at the bidding of Arvind Kejriwal, who is clearly dancing to the BJP leadership’s tune.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinder-accuses-aap-of-orchestrating-attack-on-bittu-zira-at-singhu-border-203511

The rally would start from the Cross Iron Mills Mall in Calgary at 9 am.Calgary-based Paramjeet Singh said: “The Indian farmer community of Calgary will undertake a protest on January 26 to show absolute solidarity with farmers in India in their struggle with Indian Government for enacting draconian Farm Bills giving agricultural rights to allied corporates and rendering land owner farmers as mere tenants to work on their own lands for sowing/harvesting of farm produce.”Indian farmers are protesting peacefully for the last several months by gathering in open spaces, facing all incremental auguries of climate, resulting in loss of several dozen precious human lives but Indian Government is still adamant on not repealing these Bills, he said.Paramjeet Singh further said that they were moving to the provincial legislature with a request to convey their sentiments to the Government of Canada for taking up the matter at their level with the Indian Government for processing the matter urgently on logical and humanitarian grounds.“Canadians having land holdings in India or with their near and dear ones among the farmers’ community have their own concerns about the farm laws, which have not been addressed yet,” he pointed out.A few days ago, members of the Indians Abroad for Pluralist India (IAPI) came together to reject controversial Indian laws.They burnt copies of the contentious Indian farm laws, Citizenship Amendment Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act outside the Indian visa and passport office in Surrey to mark the 92nd birth anniversary of US civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nris-to-hold-car-rallies-in-canada-to-support-farmers-tractor-march-on-jan-26-203479

The memorial is expected to be completed and dedicated to the people on this Independence Day.The literary festival will be organised by GNDU around Baisakhi with the aim of reconnecting the younger generations with the tragic event.Earlier in his address, Channi apprised the Chief Minister of the salient features of the project.

25-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM appeals farmers to ensure peace in tractor rally||Even as he termed their Republic Day tractor rally a testimony to the celebration of the Indian Republic and its constitutional ethos, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday appealed to the farmers to ensure that the event remains peaceful, just as their anti-farm law protests have been so far.He urged the Centre once again to heed the troubled voice of the farming community in the true spirit of the Indian Republic."Peace has been the hallmark of your (farmers') democratic protests all these months, and should remain integral to your agitation in the days ahead, including the R-Day tractor rally into the national capital," said the Chief Minister, in his Republic Day eve message."The sight of your (farmers') tractors on Delhi roads tomorrow will underline the fact that the ethos of the Indian constitution and the essence of our Republic is inalienable and uncompromisable," he said, adding that the farmers' arduous battle for survival "will always remind us of this truth, and it will always help us remember (lest we forget), that the principles on which stands the edifice of the India we know, and our forefathers strove to build, cannot be destroyed or demolished on the whims of a few".Lamenting that the federal structure on which India's polity is founded is facing one of its biggest threats under the present Indian regime, the Chief Minister said the brazen manner in which the three farm laws were pushed through, without debate or discussion, cannot, and should not be accepted in the world's largest democracy.The Centre had absolutely no power to legislate on a state subject, which agriculture is, and the implementation of the farm legislations violate every principle of "our Constitution and the federal structure it stands for", he added.The Chief Minister said their collective fight, in which his government was standing shoulder to shoulder with the farmers, was aimed at protecting the federal core of the Indian Constitution."We stand by every farmer whose sweat and blood has nurtured Punjab's soil for decades, and without whom India today would not stand tall as a self-reliant nation."Besides compensation and job for one family member of each of the deceased farmers, we shall extend any other help their families may need. We shall continue also to reach out to the families of those still camping at the Delhi border to make their voice heard by the Government of India," said Amarinder Singh, reaching out to every farmer and their families in Punjab.He extended his respects to all those farmers who had lost their lives in the prolonged agitation, which could have been avoided in the first place or could have been brought to an end long back had the "insensitive" Government of India, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not chosen to stand on unwarranted ego.There was no justification, said the Chief Minister, for the Central government's adamant refusal to repeal the farm laws, which, in any case, have been implemented arbitrarily without consultation or discussion with the farmers and other stakeholders.Recalling the contribution of Punjab's farmers to India's self-reliance and progress, the Chief Minister said they did not toil with their sweat and blood to see a nation whose constitutional ideals of justice, liberty, equality and dignity, were being systemically trampled over the past six years, most notably over the past two months of their struggle."The voice of the farmers, and in fact every section of our populace, is being subjugated, and we have to ensure that their voice is not only heard but also heeded," he asserted, adding that the celebration of the Indian Republic would not be complete without the acknowledgement of this contribution of Punjab and its farmers to India's progress."And it would be rendered meaningless unless the Centre has the humility to accept that it has done wrong to us, and makes immediate amends by repealing the farm laws to start on a fresh slate, after due discussions with the farmers, as well as the government of Punjab and all others states directly affected by their decisions on agricultural issues," he said, adding, "that would be in the true spirit of India's republic and constitution."

Rechristening schools will be a salutary practice and allowed only in case of “those deceased who sacrificed their life for the freedom of the country, martyrs in defence or paramilitary forces or undertook great social service or made substantial contribution to the social, sports, literature, arts, historical and cultural fields at the state and national levels,” says the new policy.Norm for display of donor’s nameThe new policy was sent by the Secretary, School Education Department, to the Director General, School Education Department; Director, SCERT; Secretary, PSEB; and DPIs, this week. According to the policy, a 15-member panel will scrutinise each case and the final decision will be taken by the state Education Minister after receiving a proposal about re-christening of a school on an online portal.Other than various authorities of the School Education Department, the DC and SSP of the district concerned and Secretary of the Freedom Fighters Welfare Department will be the members of the panel. The committee will also include directors of the Culture and Tourism Department, Sainik Welfare Department, Sports Department and Language Department.The scheme of renaming government schools for money was started in May 2012 by then Akali-BJP government, but was stayed by the HC in April 2014, saying naming a public educational institution as per the choice of people who could afford to give Rs 10 lakh for a primary school, Rs 20 lakh for a middle school and Rs 25 lakh for a senior secondary school was violative of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/9-yr-old-scheme-to-rename-government-schools-revamped-in-punjab-203266

25-01-2021||Saurabh Malik||Law on sharing info in drugs cases diluted: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 24The Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted that the law pertaining to communication of secret information in drug cases has been diluted to some extent following amendments to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the accused could not take advantage of a Supreme Court judgment on the issue. The assertion came almost 19 years after Section 42 of the Act was amended.Balance requiredJustice Gurminder Singh Gill asserted the law was much more stringent in the pre-amendment era. Omission to transmit secret information ‘immediately’ upon its receipt would constitute violation. But upon amendment, the requirement was “diluted” to some extent inasmuch as 72 hours for doing the same were provided. The assertion in a drugs case came with reference to a Supreme Court judgment in Darshan Singh’s case.The counsel for the petitioners seeking bail “vehemently argued” that the FIR was registered pursuant to receipt of secret information pertaining to storage of contraband in a building. It was required to be immediately taken down in writing and conveyed to the officer superior to the receiver of the secret information. As the same was done, it resulted in violation of mandatory provisions of Section 42 of the Act. As such, the entire recovery stood vitiated. Consequently, the petitioners deserved to be released on bail.The counsel also placed “much reliance” on the judgement in Darshan Singh’s case, in which no intimation whatsoever was sent by the investigating officer who had effected recovery before conducting a raid. It was only after recovery that intimation was sent to the police station for the registration of the FIR.Justice Gill asserted the judgement was delivered in a case pertaining to a period when Section 42 had not been amended. The provision before the amendment was significantly different than the amended one, which provided 72 hours for communicating secret information against the earlier requirement of sending the information “forthwith”.Dismissing the petitions, Justice Gill added the petitioners could not avail advantage on the basis of the judgement, which was clearly distinguishable on facts. Additionally, the recovered quantity of contraband fell in the category of ‘commercial’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/law-on-sharing-info-in-drugs-cases-diluted-hc-203270

The memorial at the original site was built by the Government of India in 1951 and is run by Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust headed by the PM. The plan of two memorials in the same city has not gone down well with the trust members. Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik said, “I wonder why was there a hitch for the CM to erect the memorial inside the original site.” Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka said there was no objection over erecting memorials at multiple places. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cm-to-lay-stone-of-jallianwala-memorial-bjp-opposes-it-203271

We also demand that the government must provide panchayati and government-owned land to landless people so that they can construct houses.”“While we stand against the Union Government and support farmers in their struggle against the three laws, we also oppose the apathetic stance of the state government for not fulfilling the promises made to the worker class.

An employee sent a communication to the department showing that his leave had been deducted out of the earned leave. Government guidelines during the pandemic read that “employees who cannot attend office as they have tested positive for Covid or their place of residence has become a containment or buffer zone, shall be granted a quarantine leave for a maximum of 30 days. In case the employee was still unable to attend the office, he/she will be granted ordinary leave after that”.One-upmanship game in PathankotPathankot: In October last year, a video of Bhoa Congress MLA Joginder Pal had gone viral in which he could be seen lambasting Deputy Commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal and SSP Gulneet Singh Khurana. This development had irked fellow bureaucrats for the sheer audacity with which the legislator had dared to take on the officers. Last week, when the Pathankot police sealed a mining unit owed by Joginder Pal, officials were cock-a-hoop with joy. Aggarwal and Khurana chose to maintain a stoic silence but their colleagues were surely elated. Sources say the SSP had concrete information that the MLA was engaged in illegal mining following which 80 cops were deputed to conduct raids. Had the legislator not used unparliamentarily language, he probably could have been spared. However, a senior officer said there was nothing personal about the action.Contributed by Parvesh Sharma, Sanjeev Singh Bariana & Ravi Dhaliwal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/canada-lures-sangrur-bizmen-203284

This will help people, especially women, who want to join the protest as travelling on the bus is comparatively comfortable than in a trailer,” said Mandeep Singh, a resident of Cheema village. He said a bus from their village had left for Delhi on Sunday.Similar announcements were being made in other villages as well. The NRIs have been calling their contacts to join the protest and offering them financial support.Inderbir Singh, who has been living in the US from the last 15 years, said, “I received a request from my friends who stay in Chabal area. I cannot join the protest physically, but I am doing my bit to contribute towards the cause.”Residents, including those not associated with the agriculture sector were heading for Delhi. “We will leave on Monday evening as Tuesday is a holiday. We will return before Wednesday morning and join office,” said Karan, a bank employee, who has prepared to leave with his four colleagues.As youths were going in large numbers, elders seem a bit worried. “What if something bad happens? Youth should follow the advice of elderly leaders as they have experience. People fear that if something goes wrong, the hard-earned peace will be lost,” said Balkaran Singh, a senior citizen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nris-make-last-minute-efforts-to-mobilise-public-for-tractor-march-203310

But the RTI reply makes it clear as per an office memorandum dated August 7, 2019, the CM was the seventh member of the high-powered committee of CMs constituted by the Prime Minister. He was privy to what the laws entailed since August 2019.”Reading out from the RTI response, Chadha said the PM approved the revised constitution of a high-powered committee of chief ministers for the “Transformation of Indian Agriculture” on August 7, 2019. Chadha further added in the agenda of the committee, the terms of reference included three key points — ‘Agricultural produce and Livestock Marketing Promotion and Facilitation Act, 2017’; ‘State Union Territory Agricultural Produce and Livestock, Contract farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation Act) 2018; and examining various provisions of the Essential Commodities Act.Chadha said, “This means Capt Amarinder Singh was aware the laws would lead to collapse of mandis, weakening or finishing of the minimum support price law and largely the privatisation of agriculture… why did he not speak up and prevent the passage of laws? If farmers knew about the laws, their passage could have been stopped beforehand.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-knew-what-farm-laws-entailed-since-aug-19-aap-203256

This was again a matter of record, he said, pointing to the “Terms of Reference” of the committee.From sharing an “edited” video of his (CM’s) statements to the release of a list of the final committee members, the AAP had made yet another desperate attempt to sell its lies to the people of Punjab, said Capt Amarinder.He said the original committee (minus Punjab) was set up on June 15, 2019. “Had AAP bothered to share the complete videos of my statements, the truth of what I have been saying would have been endorsed... when the first meeting of the committee was held, Punjab was not part of it,” he claimed.Capt Amarinder added after Punjab’s inclusion at his behest, financial issues were discussed at a meeting with Finance Minister Manpreet Badal in attendance, while another had only the Agriculture Secretary as participant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/yet-another-attempt-to-sell-lies-says-cm-203257

A number of villages have set up kiosks at petrol stations offering free refill for vehicles. NRIs are also chipping in with the service. The BKU (Rajewal), which has mobilised thousands of tractors, is not only providing free fuel to farmers but also sending mechanics along the cavalcades to ensure emergency repairs. The Doaba Kisan Union, too, is offering fuel and repair services at the Delhi border.Amarjot Singh, Jalandhar youth wing president, BKU (Rajewal), says: “We have told farmers they needn’t worry about fuel expenses. Our representative is accompanying each cavalcade to ensure free fuel. Mechanics, too, are on board in case of a breakdown. At least 100 tractors were sent out yesterday. More will follow today and tomorrow.”Kuldip Singh, president, Doaba Kisan Union, says: “Over 1,000 tractors headed out from SBS Nagar yesterday, mobilised by our union.

They move in groups or as solo “warriors” — all headed to join the Republic Day tractor parade in New Delhi.Langars are commonplace along highways albeit it is not a festival or “shaheedi divas”. “This is a celebration of struggle,” quips Gurvinder Singh, a farmer from Saneta village in Mohali as he fries bread fritters. Even the colour of the fritters is green. “This is the colour of our fields,” he adds.The youth club of the village has collectively put up a langar for the Delhi marchers. Forget the count, he doesn’t even hazard a guess about the number of marchers they have fed since Sunday morning.“We have consumed 500 packets of bread and 15 canisters of ghee,” he says, adding they have served langar of “kheer” at Singhu for days.The tractors started leaving for Delhi on Thursday. While the Delhi Police estimate 70,000 to 1 lakh farm machines on its border, farmer organisations assert it is much higher.The sight of never-ending trail of tractors is hard to miss. “I have never seen anything like this before,” says Roop Singh, a shopkeeper near Raipur village on the Banur-Landran road. The number on Friday and Saturday was much higher, he adds.Manjeet Singh from Ballowal Sonkri village in Balachaur left on his Swaraj-855 tractor in the afternoon along with 10 others. “I am moving a little slower. My companions have already crossed Ambala,” he says as he takes a short langar break. His co-travellers say they have every equipment to remove the barricading. “This is the final battle,” he asserts, his hands on the wheel.Asked if he is sure, he points to a row of tractors: “Do you have any doubt”.As the sun disappears below the horizon, the march continues amid the sound of blaring speakers: “Pind-pind vich bharo traliaan, hun gall ni banani Canter naal; Hun pecha pai gya Centre naal,” (Hop on to trailers as Canters aren’t enough, for we are at war with the Centre).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-on-long-march-for-d-day-203264

There are inputs about the same from different agencies too. It will be a challenging task for us but the rally will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over,” Pathak said at a press conference.Since November last year, farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the Centre’s three new agriculture laws at several Delhi border points, including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, demanding that the legislations be repealed.Pathak said, “As the farmers wanted to do a tractor rally on January 26, we have come to a conclusion that the rally will be conducted after the timing of the Republic Day Celebration ends. We have given them around 170 kilometres of distance in three routes”.Barricades and other security arrangements will be removed and the farmers will enter the national capital. Later, they will return to their destinations after covering a “respectable” distance, police said.“For the Delhi Police, it will be a challenging task. We have spoken to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh Police officers about how it will be conducted in a convenient way.
