Agriculture is a state subject under Schedule 7, so why has the Centre interfered with a state subject?” he asked.Also read: Punjab, Haryana farmers to set out for tractor parade in Delhi on SaturdayAsserting that “we are with farmers and will stand by them”, the Chief Minister, during the 20th edition of his Facebook Live #AskCaptain session, said the Punjab government and every person in Punjab stands with farmers.“The sad part,” said the Chief Minister, “was that we are losing our farmers to the cold every day, with an estimated farmers 76 dying so far.”In addition to the Rs 5 lakh compensation being given to the families of the deceased farmers, his government would also give a job to a family member, he added.Stressing that representatives of almost all farm unions from across the country were sitting at the Delhi borders, the Chief Minister said the agitation was of the entire nation’s farmers and not just of Punjab’s farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-cant-centre-repeal-farm-laws-asks-capt-amarinder-dubs-it-inhuman-202173

The police are yet to register an FIR in the case. The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed Sood’s plea seeking a stay on the BMC notice for the alleged unauthorised construction. Earlier, the Mumbai court had also dismissed his petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illegal-construction-actor-sonu-sood-moves-sc-against-bombay-hc-order-202113

Jo mandio surma ab jujhan ko dao (The spiritual warriors enter the field of battle; now is the time to fight).The song is all praise for Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for calling a special session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha to oppose the bills and embolden the spirit of the protesting farmers.Sadiq sings that the farmers’ protest will put an end to the “arrogance” of the BJP leaders and lay low the pompous pride of the “ruthless who, in connivance with the corporate houses, are demolishing the peasantry in the state.”The 7-minute 30-secon song has been written by Babu Singh Maan, also known as Maan Maraarhan Wala of Faridkot, a known lyricist of Punjabi-folk songs.Sadiq’s song was shared on the Facebook page of Punjab Pradesh Congress days after he was trolled on social media for the apparently dozing off momentarily in the Lok Sabha and later on him showing ignorance about the controversial farm bills.To make a video for this song, drone cameras were used at Singhu border to capture the huge gathering of the farmers. Other than the video of the gatherings, many video clips of farmers being attacked with water cannons and teargas shells and cane charging by the police at Haryana has also been made part of this video.This song on Facebook has invited over 3300 comments. In some of these comments, Sadiq has been ‘welcomed’ for him returning to his real singing fiefdom, others have attacked him for reacting much delayed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/faridkot-mp-mohammad-sadiq-releases-song-in-support-of-farmers-agitation-202093

Everyone is doing their bit to lend their support to the farmers.A group of enthusiastic and thoughtful volunteers from different cities around the world are working on a very interesting postcard initiative called, #MannKiBaatSuno, wherein they invite messages from all over the world with regard to the farmers’ movement.

We have been reaching out to people online and then getting messages from those sitting in support of farmers at the Singhu and Tikri borders. Right now we have gathered every message and our volunteers transfer the same message on to the postcard (handwritten message),” said Manu Buttar.“We had expected to get 50,000 postcards, but the way we are receiving messages from folks around the world, we believe that the number would cross the 50,000 mark,” Manu shared.

Please have some compassion.”Another message from Nikita reads, “You should be distressed to see people dying at the protesting sites in Delhi.

If the BJP-led central government is really serious, it must immediately repeal the laws, otherwise authorities should get ready to make proper arrangements for the tractor march,” said Harjinder Singh Gharachon, a Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) Bhawanigarh leader.From Patiala, farmers and youth leaders are openly gathering support and reaching out to villagers to join the tractor rally proposed in Delhi on Republic Day. “We have asked students and employees to apply for a three-day leave, from January 24 to 27, to participate in the proposed tractor march from Tikri border to Delhi on January 26”, said Youth Congress leader Mansimrat Singh Riar.The Congress leader has joined many others in Punjab who are making arrangements to join the protesters at Delhi borders for the tractor march against the contentious farm laws. They are disposing of their work in advance to ensure their participation in the tractor parade. “We will go there with all my friends and family members. On January 26 we will be in Delhi. I have already applied for a two-day leave from my online classes”, said Rajan Verma, a mathematics tutor.In Jalandhar, farmers stated that people had lost trust in the government and its leaders. Satnam S Kalhon, general secretary, BKU (Doaba), said: “We have strongly opposed any proposal of the government to bury the issue by deciding to put the laws on hold. We will not settle for anything less than the repeal.”Farmers from the Majha region, too, echoed similar views. Farmer leader Rattan Singh Randhawa of Jamhoori Kisan Sabha: “It is the same government which was adamant and claimed that the laws are good for farmers. Now, if it has offered to put the laws on hold, it is an achievement of the people. Keeping in consideration the sentiments and aspirations of people, it should now repeal the Acts at the earliest.”Farmer Rawel Singh from Chabal said: “The Centre just wants to end the protest Its offer is just a tactic to delay the decision on the laws.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rehearsals-on-farmers-plan-it-big-on-r-day-201748

22-01-2021||Chandigarh||Centre targeting Punjab over farm stir, says FM||Punjab is being asked to pay the price for the farmers’ agitation, which itself was necessitated by the enactment of three farm laws that were against the interests of farmers, says Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal.The withholding of the Rural Development Fund (RDF) by the Centre was directly linked to the ongoing agitation against the farm laws, said Badal. “We are being collectively targeted by the Government of India,” he told The Tribune on the sidelines of the State Credit Seminar organised by NABARD here today.On January 19, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution had written to the state government saying they would pay just one per cent RDF against the three per cent usually paid to the state. This would lead to a loss of Rs 800 crore to the state, thereby adversely affecting development works.“Withholding of a major portion of the RDF on paddy purchase in 2020 is one such step. The Centre is also not conceding to the demand of hundreds of farmers to acquire their land beyond the border fencing. They graze the land by enduring hardship to help the armed forces keep better vigil. We have written to the Niti Aayog on this issue, but to no avail,” he said.Badal told The Tribune the funds that the Centre was withholding were being given to the state the past six decades. “Asking Punjab to respond on how we have utilised the RDF is akin to citizens asking the government on how they utilise the income tax paid by them to the government.“However, we responded to their letter, alleging misuse of the RDF, giving them details of fund utilisation over the past 10 years. They have still gone ahead and withheld the RDF. The government should have a bigger heart and not make the people of Punjab suffer by withholding money due to them,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-targeting-punjab-over-farm-stir-says-fm-201750

He called upon the people of the state to once again lead the country as they always have.Referring to the issue of crop diversification, the minister called for an MSP component for backing farmers who shunned stubble burning and mobilise projects for harvesting biofuels rather than implementing forceful policies.

The main attraction of the rally was a tableau depicting a farmer ploughing a field with a pair of bullocks.The tableau also shows Dr MS Swaminathan, with one of his hands gently placed on the shoulder of the farmer and the other holding a copy of the National Commission on Farmers’ report, which was released by him, nearly 14 years ago.The tableau is made of carbon fibre that also has gun metal, sandstone, cement, and plaster of paris making it a beautiful piece of art.Known as the father of green revolution in the country, Dr Swaminathan submitted his report to the Centre to fix the MSP for crops after calculating the cost inputs and adding at least 50 per cent profit to it.The protesting farmers in the tractor march urged the Centre to implement the Swaminathan report, repeal the controversial farm laws and continue with the government purchase of foodgrains in all states.The tableau was crafted by famous artist Manjit Singh with the help of his brother Surjit Singh a few months ago. With farmers protesting against the controversial laws, the tableau is being taken to many places in Punjab and Haryana to instill confidence among the farmers to fight for their rights.The art work, which has already drawn a considerable public attention, will also be showcased during the upcoming tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/moga-artists-farm-tableau-in-spotlight-201759

Vijay Kumar through his counsel Manu K Bhandari claimed that the two panicked when they came to know that the petitioner had recorded a conversation.Elaborating, Kumar submitted the conversation was between him and the personal assistant of one of the legislators. Enclosing a copy of the transcript along with the petition, Kumar added the conversation clearly brought out the fact that the person was repeatedly putting pressure on him to help another person already facing criminal cases and being investigated for liquor smuggling.Appearing on the petitioner’s behalf through videoconferencing, Bhandari added a person with criminal antecedents was propped up to complain against the Inspector. On its basis, an FIR was registered against him. The respondent MLAs were not satisfied with the registration of the FIR alone and wanted to get the petitioner dismissed from service.

The visit came after recent news reports highlighted illegal mining in Rajgarh, Nanhera, Chamaru and Bathonian Kalan villages in Ghanaur.“Sand excavated from these villages is shifted to construction sites as far as Mohali, Kharar, Patiala and Sangrur. Though over 20 FIRs have been registered within the Ghanaur belt, nothing has been accomplished in the investigation so far,” claimed villagers.Slamming the Congress government, Cheema said liquor mafia, mining mafia and other mafias were running in the hometown of the Chief Minister. “Congress leaders, their ministers and MLAs are solely responsible for all kinds of mafias flourishing in Punjab,” Cheema added.Meanwhile, villagers claimed that whenever they opposed the mining mafia, the police registered false cases against them and locked them up at the police station. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-raise-issue-of-mining-mafia-in-assembly-harpal-cheema-201762

22-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab rolls back 50% licence fee, exchequer suffers losses||The state exchequer has suffered a loss of crores of rupees as the Directorate, Local Government, has allowed the rollback of 50 per cent of licence fee being charged from outdoor advertisement contractors while citing the Covid-19 pandemic.In the Ludhiana cluster alone, the revenue loss to the department during the nine-year contract period could touch Rs 190 crore. In Mohali, the annual revenue loss is likely to be Rs 10.80 crore and in case of Kharar cluster, it could be Rs 20 crore.Ad contracts: Relief offered for 7 to 9 yrsCiting the pandemic, relief has been offered to outdoor advertisement contractors for the entire contract period, varying from seven to nine years. In contrast, departments like transport, housing and others had waived government levies either till December 31, 2020, or deferred arrears of taxes, without interest and penalty, till March 31, 2021What is more startling is that relief has been offered for the entire contract period — varying from seven to nine years. In contrast, departments like transport, housing and others had waived government levies either till December 31, 2020, or deferred arrears of taxes, without interest and penalty, till March 31, 2021.Most of the outdoor advertising contracts were issued under the Punjab Municipal Outdoor Advertising Policy 2018, framed during the tenure of previous Local Government Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. The orders to give pandemic-related relief were issued by previous Director, Local Government, Bhupinder Singh on September 15, 2020, when a number of civic bodies were dissolved and IAS and PCS officers were appointed as administrators.Explaining the catch, sources said while allowing 50 per cent rollback of the licence fee, there was no clarity on the period of validity of the relief and it was mandated that the beneficiary would be allowed to surrender 50 per cent of the outdoor media sites.However, on the ground, a number of surrendered sites in different towns were being illegally sold by the contractors, the sources said.“The department must explain the logic of giving the relief for the entire contract period instead of mentioning specific period. Fingers are already being pointed as the lockdown has already been lifted,” said Manjeet Sethi, former deputy mayor, Mohali Municipal Corporation.Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra said meetings were held to give Covid-related relief to advertisers. However, he directed the query to Secretary, Local Government, Ajoy Kumar Sinha. “The order was issued prior to my joining the department. Now the matter has been brought to my notice. I will enquire into it and necessary action will be taken,” said the Secretary.In the September 15 order, the Director had referred to several representations made by contractors handling outdoor advertisement display in the state. As part of the relief, the directorate has also permitted a six-month licence fee waiver, starting from March 24, 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-rolls-back-50-licence-fee-exchequer-suffers-losses-201765

Chandigarh has made a leap forward to rank second among the UTs after Delhi.The index, launched last year, ranks states based on whether they provide a conducive environment for registering new businesses, applying for patents, human capital and investments, among other measures.Bihar at the bottomIn the second edition, Maharashtra has overtaken Tamil Nadu for the second spot. Telangana has claimed the fourth place, with Kerala moving one notch up to fifth slot, pushing Haryana to sixth place on the list of 17 major states. Bihar has featured at the bottom.“There is a very strong correlation between innovation and development. As states become more innovative, their per-capita GDP (gross domestic product) rises,” said Amit Kapoor, chairman of the Institute for Competitiveness, a Gurugram-based organisation that worked with NITI Aayog to develop the index.The index is modelled along the lines of the global innovation index, which is brought out by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, but tracks fewer parameters. It aims to add more parameters in the next report and sync it with the global index.“The Prime Minister is very clear that it is innovation and technology that will solve the immense challenges that India faces. Trying to spur innovation at the state level is important,” Kumar said.Kant said, “By providing a thrust to innovation, India can augment its manufacturing and export competitiveness.”“We will continue to work in very close collaboration with science and technology teams across all the states as well as the industrial and manufacturing teams across India. We will complement them as the knowledge partner to make India an innovative nation,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-haryana-among-10-most-innovative-states-201643
