However, the trains have been allowed only for 15 days.A decision to this effect was taken in the meeting of 30 farmer unions held here on Saturday morning. It has been decided that they will allow all trains to pass through only for 15 days, giving this time to the BJP-led Central government to start talks with them on the three controversial Agriculture Laws passed by the Parliament in September.The unions will be concentrating their protests outside residences of BJP leaders and businesses owned by corporates, while preparing for their protest in Delhi on November 26-27.Welcoming the decision, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh said urged the Centre to resume rail services to Punjab forthwith.   Had a fruitful meeting with Kisan Unions. Happy to share that starting 23rd Nov night, Kisan Unions have decided to end rail blockades for 15 days. I welcome this step since it will restore normalcy to our economy. I urge Central Govt to resume rail services to Punjab forthwith. pic.twitter.com/shmIZPHFR0  Train services in the state have been suspended for almost two months now. Earlier, farmers were protesting on the railway tracks, and it was only in October end that they allowed to the goods trains to pass through the state.Trains were allowed to operate for two days, before the Railway Board, again, refused to resume services till all railway property was vacated by the protesting farmers and passenger trains too were allowed to operate.Interestingly, it is learnt that Kirti Kisan Union did not agree with the decision to shift the protest from railway land, and decided to stay away from the meeting with the Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, scheduled later in the day.Other than Kirti Kisan Union, all other 29 unions later met the Chief Minister and conveyed their decision to stop the protest on railway land. They are also learnt to have discussed other issues with the CM, like subsidy on stubble management machines, releasing dues of cane growers, etc. The CM is learnt to have assured them that these issues will be resolved at the earliest.Sources said the union felt a decision to stop agitation at the railway tracks would make the farmers appear weak and bowing to the pressure of the BJP-led Central government. The other unions, however, reportedly overruled their objection saying that it was allowing the Centre to economically block the state, and they could ill-afford to turn industry and trade against them.
21-11-2020||---||CBI being exploited for politics, won’t allow it to enter Punjab without permission: Capt||Chandigarh, November 21Citing the agency’s poor track record in the Bargari case, which it had closed without any investigation, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said his government would not allow the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into his state without permission.Pointing out that eight states, including Punjab, had withdrawn permission to the agency to enter without prior permission, the Chief Minister said the agency was being increasingly used to play politics, and a fair probe could not be ensured through CBI.Dismissing the BJP as a non-entity in Punjab’s political arena, the Chief Minister told a TV channel that the BJP was welcome to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in the state, though the party would not be able to win a single seat without an alliance partner.“The Congress has, in fact, no challenge in Punjab, with even the Akalis and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) posing no threat,” he said, adding that neither of these parties had ever talked about anything positive in the interest of the state.With elections in the state still around 18 months away, it was not possible to say which issue would dominate the polls, said Captain Amarinder, while expressing the hope that the BJP would resolve the farmers’ grievances soon.“Farmers want the MSP to remain and the Government of India should take steps to ensure that,” he said, lamenting the adamant stand being taken by both the Centre and farmers, leading to the prolonged agitation which was affecting supplies to the frontline soldiers while damaging Punjab’s interests.He, however, said agitation was the democratic and constitutional right of farmers, which the Central Government had evidently realised, as apparent from their decision to call Kisan Unions for talks.The Chief Minister reiterated that corporates were welcome to buy foodgrain in Punjab as long as they follow the existing marketing system, built on close ties between farmers and Arhtiyas. He rejected the BJP charge of the Congress and other central Opposition parties were misguiding the farmers, pointing out that the entire Vidhan Sabha in Punjab had unanimously rejected the Farm Laws, though some parties had subsequently made a U-turn due to political compulsions.“When the Bills were brought in Parliament, the Central Government should have consulted all stakeholders, including Punjab government, instead of passing them without discussion,” said Captain Amarinder.Terming the dissent in Congress a sign of internal democracy in the party, the Chief Minister pointed out that those who had written a letter to the party high command had been included in key committees constituted by party chief Sonia Gandhi.On the issue of SGPC elections, the Chief Minister said he had been demanding those for long but the Akalis did not want polls to the body, which they had been using for their own political gains.Welcoming the ongoing joint Indian naval exercises with other countries, Captain Amarinder said China and Pakistan would not succeed in their nefarious designs against India.“Punjab wants peace and development and will not allow Pakistan to foment trouble at any cost,” he added.

These centres would go a long way in helping the state government to expand its health care outreach to a larger community of people across the state. Of the 3,049 centres planned in the state, 2,046 were now operational and 800 more would become operational in the next two months, with the remaining to be opened in 2021, he said.Manned by Community Health Officers, Multipurpose Health Workers (male and female) and ASHA workers, these centres have been provided with facility of 27 medicines, six diagnostic tests and tele-consultation facilities, said the Chief Minister, adding that 54 lakh patients have been provided OPD services for hypertension, diabetes, etc.

He described these laws as nothing but slow poisoning.“The election outcome will come as a shock to the BJP which will be outrightly rejected by the people of Punjab,” Jakhar said in an interaction with The Tribune. “The way the Centre has been treating Punjab is regrettable. The state is being held to ransom by holding back GST and Rural Development Fund and suspending goods trains”, he said.“The BJP has succeeded in weakening the support for the farmers’ agitation with its divide and rule policy. The farm unions seem to be playing into hands of the saffron party. It is going to be a long-drawn struggle which must be fought politically. It would be naive to believe that the issue would be resolved by holding a rally in Delhi”, the former MP observed.In view of the dwindling urea stock, he appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure a rake of urea for Punjab.“The moment this is done, the farmers will withdraw their stir,” Jakhar claimed.

Sources said Majithia had a Punjab Police cover of four gunmen.Party spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said the security cover had been withdrawn as the SAD had stood firmly with farmers against the agriculture laws as well as denial of official language status to Punjabi in Jammu and Kashmir.The SAD leader said the Z+ cover had been given to Majithia in 2010 during the UPA government on the basis of a threat perception.Cheema said Majithia continued to be a target of Pakistan-based anti-national elements and gangsters who had openly threatened to eliminate him.

Earlier, in absence of such guidelines, people used to construct commercial buildings with 100 sq yard at the front and rest 2,900 sq yard at the rear leading to major traffic issues.Although department officials claim a strict policy had been put in place to regulate traffic chaos and inconvenience to people living adjoining the commercial buildings, it has raised eyebrows as it is being largely felt that this will put additional burden on the already stressed infrastructure.The relaxation under the ‘scheme area’ has been given in all Municipal Corporation areas of Amritsar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Bathinda, Phagwara, Patiala, Hoshiarpur, Moga, Pathankot, SAS Nagar, Abohar, Batala and Kapurthala.Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra said the rules were strict. “We have fixed norms.

No ingress or egress will be permitted from the rear or side road.”Brahm Mohindra, Local Bodies Minister No nod if deficiency in parking The rules are strict. We have fixed norms. No building plan will be approved if there is a deficiency in parking. No ingress or egress will be permitted from the rear or side roadIn 2006, the SAD-BJP government had allowed commercial activity on double-depth plots having an area of 3,000 sq yard, but there was no restriction on the minimum plot size at the front and parking norms.Though conditions like providing the required parking as per the applicable bylaws and leaving setback at the rear side have been included in the conditions, leaving the minimum circulation area for emergency services will itself be a big challenge.As per the standard practice, an urban local body can move a resolution to define any road as “commercial road” for the purpose of allowing change of land use from residential to commercial.The department has also decided to do away with the condition of charging 10 per cent annual fee increase every year on April 1 in future cases.

Vipan Mahajan, president, Pathankot Crushers’ Association, said on a conservative estimate, 100-130 vehicles enter the city daily. This was corroborated by senior officials. The development is playing havoc with the local crushing industry.“We sell a large sand-laden tipper at anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 while the HP miners sell the same at Rs 7,000-Rs 8,000. Likewise, we sell a large truck of sand at Rs 22,000-Rs 24000 while those arriving from HP are sold at Rs 14,000-Rs 16,000. People will obviously purchase sand available at lesser rates,” said Mahajan.Mining Officer Gagandeep Singh said he had recently brought this illegal activity to the notice of the Nurpur police station in HP. “The Nurpur police registered a few FIRs against erring HP miners. However, after a brief lull, the activity has again picked up. The entire Pathankot crushing industry is going in losses just because people from HP are undercutting prices. A solution to the problem is to form a joint team of the Pathankot and Kangra police which can look into the infringements,” he said. Owners of vehicles from HP claimed they have valid documentation to sell their produce in Punjab. However, this was countered by Gagandeep Singh, who claimed that only a miniscule percentage of the total number of vehicles coming into the city had valid papers while the others simply meandered their way into Punjab.Teams formed to check menace: SSPSSP Gulneet Singh Khurana said he was apprised of the unauthorised trade and was working on ways to stop it. “Joint teams of the Mining Department and police have been formed to check the menace,” he said

21-11-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Farmer unions in Punjab may change tack on ‘rail roko’, to decide today||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 20After nearly two months of the “rail roko” campaign, which has led to an economic blockade of Punjab, the 30 farmer unions are likely to withdraw the protest and shift the agitation to outside residences of BJP leaders and businesses run by corporate houses.A final decision in this regard is expected to be taken at a meeting of the 30 unions tomorrow, before they hold a meeting with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.The latter has been asking the protesting farmers to vacate all railway property so that train services to the state can be resumed.Of the 30 unions that are jointly holding protests against the three farm laws, at least 14 had expressed their opinion to vacate all railway property during a meeting on Wednesday.The unions are not just under pressure from the Centre and state government, but also from the industry to change their protest tactics and help lift the “economic blockade” imposed on the state as the Centre has refused to resume train services till all railway property was vacated by the protesters. Farmers are presently sitting in protest on railway land, other than tracks and platforms.Some of the farmer union leaders have told The Tribune while they are interested in vacating the railway land immediately to ensure the train services are resumed, others feel the protest locations should be changed only after November 26 — when the unions March towards Delhi.Dr Darshal Pal of the Krantikari Kisan Union said the Centre had created a volatile situation and that the unions would not succumb to their tactics. “We have already allowed freight trains to operate and vacated tracks and platforms. Allowing passenger trains is a very small thing, as we look at re-strategising our protest and take it right to Delhi,” he said.Leaders to meet Capt AmarinderUnion leaders will meet CM Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday to discuss issues including non-payment of subsidy for machines bought for stubble management; release of dues to cane growers; and ensuring the urea produced in the two NFL plants in Punjab was distributed solely to state farmers.

The closure had affected drinking water supply also.Farmers said a small-size breach later got widened to about 150 ft. As the canal was running to its capacity, water had submerged recently sown wheat crop spread over 50 acres in nearby “dhanis”, besides affecting the buildings of Brahmrishi Mission School and the BSF complex.Sub-Divisional Officer Vinod Kumar and Junior Engineer Akshit Soni inspected the site and said officials at the headworks were requested to suspend water supply but levels in the canal would come down late tonight to facilitate plugging of the breach. They endorsed farmers’ view that sidewalls of the canal were getting weaker, but blamed the growth of hundreds of old trees for this as their roots were piercing into the walls and might affect the floor bed later.

A graduate, he has been farming for the past six years.In the recent past, burning of paddy and wheat stubble has been a common trend but Sandeep tried to do something different. Having participated in training camps organised by the Agriculture Department for the past three years, he has refrained from the practice.Sandeep says he started sowing wheat in the field with the help of Happy Seeder, a tractor-mounted machine that cuts and lifts rice straw, sows wheat into the soil and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch. He also used Super Seeder as per the guidelines of the Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department and this increased the yield by two to three quintals.“I keep appealing to farmers to sow wheat by spreading straw in the field with the help of modern implements. By not burning the straw, we can help in protecting the environment,” he says.

However, the company officials did not confirm it.Several solvex plants in Jalalabad, Guruharsahai and other parts of the state have closed operations and others are surviving on the reserve stock of hexane.The solvent plants process various oil seeds, oil cakes, rice bran and other oil-bearing material by using food grade hexane to recover vegetable oils for human consumption and oil meals for cattle feed for both domestic market and exports, but of late the industry has been suffering due to shortage of hexane.Talking to The Tribune, Ravi Kalra, Chairman, Solvent Extractors Association (Punjab), said if the situation was not brought under control, more solvex plants might face closure.“We have asked company officials as to why they were not supplying the material despite raising indent,” Kalra said. AR Sharma of Ricela Health Foods said shortage of hexane was affecting the produce.Inderjit Singh of Kisan Solvex said he had some stock in reserve but the supply should resume immediately. “Notwithstanding the advance money, we are not getting hexane as per our requirement,” said Munish Sharma of Sukhbir Agro Energy Limited. He said orders worth 1,200 KL were pending with the company and they had managed to get one tanker earlier, but that was not enough.“The situation may lead of shortage of editable oil, besides rise in prices,” he said, adding that the refinery was producing 80-100KL hexane every day regularly but it was being provided to other companies in Baddi and MP.HPCL regional head Bharat Kaul said he was occupied and not in a position to reply. ASM Harsh Mani said it was a seasonal issue as demand and supply kept fluctuating. Other HPCL officials evaded a reply on the matter and preferred not to come on record.
