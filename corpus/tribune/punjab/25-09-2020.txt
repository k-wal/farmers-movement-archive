25-09-2020||Lucknow||Punjab govt to challenge farm Bills in Supreme Court: Manpreet Badal||Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal here on Friday targeted the Centre over the farm Bills and said his government will challenge the legislations in the Supreme Court.The Congress leader told reporters that the Punjab government is “preparing to challenge the Bills in the apex court on two counts”.“First, it is a state subject and the Union government has no right to enact a legislation on it. Besides, the federal government cannot destroy the economy of states. Due to the Bills, losses will be too much for a small state like Punjab,” he said.Badal said the legislations will not only result in revenue loss for states but also cause unemployment.He added that the minimum support price (MSP) was the main reason for opposing the Bills. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union Agriculture Minister have tweeted that the MSP will not be abolished, then why are they not getting this point incorporated in the Bills, he asked.“The reality is that the government wants to get out of the MSP,” he claimed, adding that the legislations will be opposed till the “last breath”. When reminded that Uttar Pradesh farmers are not protesting against the Bills, he said perhaps they are not as aware but their losses will not be any different.“UP farmers may be simple but not so simple that they will not understand their loss and gain; the difference between a ‘chor and chaukidar’ or ‘sharab and sharbat’,” he said, adding that the Bills have exposed the “anti-farmer” face of the Union government.Badal also lashed out at the Central government over the promise of doubling farmers’ income and said it has failed in every respect in the past six years of its rule.“The agriculture growth during the BJP rule is 3.1 per cent.  It was 4.3 per cent during the UPA government. Agriculture income is at its lowest in 14 years. Prime Minister had said that the Swaminathan Commission report will be implemented but nothing happened,” he told reporters.Parliament recently passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill; Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.The legislations are yet to get the nod of the President.

25-09-2020||---||Multani murder case: Former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini moves SC for quashing of FIR||New Delhi, September 25Former Director-General of Punjab Police Sumedh Singh Saini has moved the Supreme Court challenging a Punjab and Haryana High Court order dismissing his plea for quashing of the FIR in the 1991 Multani murder case. A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan on Friday posted his petition for hearing on October 1 as the impugned order of the high court was not on record. The Supreme Court had on September 15 granted him interim protection from arrest and posted his plea for anticipatory bail for hearing after four weeks. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had on September 7 dismissed his anticipatory bail plea.“This case is of 1991. After 30 years what is the hurry to arrest him... We will grant you time to file a reply,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan had said, adding he would not be arrested till further orders.However, the top court had asked Saini to co-operate with the Punjab Police in the investigation of the case.Multani—a junior engineer with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation—was allegedly picked up by the police in December 1991 after a terror attack on Saini that left three policemen killed. Saini was injured in the attack.Saini’s troubles started in May when he was booked at a police station in Mohali along with six others for the alleged kidnapping of Multani in 1991. Murder charge was added in August after two of the accused policemen spilled the beans.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi had contended before the top court that Punjab government was after Saini because he had filed two chargesheets in which current Chief Minister Capt Amarinder was an accused. “This is why they are after me,” he had submitted.Saini is also facing trial in a Special CBI Court in Delhi along with three others for alleged abduction and disappearance of automobile businessman Vinod Kumar, his brother-in-law Ashok Kumar and their driver Mukhtiyar Singh in 1994.
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Pain of agitating farmers will reach Central govt: Capt Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday expressed hope that the pain of the agitating farmers, who braved the pandemic and the heat to protest against the agriculture Bills, will reach the Central Government and it will step back from “destroying the farm sector with such ruthless disregard for the farming community”.The BJP-led Union government had, “with its ill-conceived and unconstitutional farm laws, pushed the farmers to the brink, forcing them to come out on the roads and endanger their lives amid the Covid-19 pandemic”, he said, expressing grave concern over the plight of the farmers and others associated with the agriculture sector—the lifeline of Punjab’s economy.“Maybe the distressing visuals of tens of hundreds of farmers out on the roads at hundreds of locations in Punjab, and in several other states, will touch the hearts of the Central leadership.“Perhaps the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will now realise its folly,” the Chief Minister said in a statement.Reiterating his commitment “to fight the draconian laws till his last breath”, Amarinder Singh urged the President not to give his assent to the contentious Bills, “which were crafted to destroy not just the economy of Punjab and the food security of the nation but also the lives of lakhs of farmers and their families, as well as those dependent on the agricultural food chain for their livelihood”.The Bills, if implemented, will have devastating effects for the border state of Punjab, as well as for the entire nation, he warned, charging the Centre with ignoring the farmers’ concerns to promote the interests of their capitalist cronies.The Chief Minister said his government, along with the Punjab Congress, will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers to oppose the Bills, and will take whatever steps needed, including moving the courts, “to scuttle the Centre’s dangerous attempt to demolish the state’s well-established farming network”.Amarinder Singh also lashed out at the Akalis for their public posturing on the Bills, “which even the farmers had dismissed as crocodile tears”.Reacting to the attack by Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal and his wife and former Union Minister Harsimrat Badal on him, the Chief Minister dubbed it a blatant tactic to divert attention from their own failure to protect the farmers’ interests and their shameful decision to stay on in the Central government, after actively supporting and defending the farm ordinances.He said the Akali double standards had been totally exposed by the fact that they continued to be a part of the “anti-farmer ruling coalition” at the Centre and had, till date, refused to even come out with any public criticism of the Union government.This drama of Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigning from the Union Cabinet is not enough to convince the farmers of the sincerity of SAD, he said.Questioning Sukhbir Badal’s persistent refusal to pull his party out of the ruling NDA, the Chief Minister said the farmers of Punjab had seen through the Akali tactics, and won’t let them succeed in their despicable and greedy attempts. — IANS

25-09-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Farmers in Punjab begin their protest against farm Bills||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 25Farmers from across Punjab have launched their protest against the three Agriculture Bills passed by Parliament, by giving a call for Punjab Bandh.As many as 31 farmer organisations in the state are participating in the bandh. Since early morning, farmers from all over the state started gathering at designated roads across the state, and stopping the movement of all traffic and requesting traders to keep their shops closed.The response to the bandh is good as reports from across the state suggest a near lockdown. With the dairy farmers extending support to the farmers in their protest, milk supply to all cities was affected.In Amritsar, milkmen had supplied milk on Thursday night. In Ludhiana and Mandi Gobindgarh, the movement of industrial goods scheduled for Friday was advanced and highways saw a massive rush of goods carriers leaving the industrial towns between Thursday evening and night.The protesting farmer organisations have galvanised immense support from farmers and small groups of protesters, with members of each of these 31 organisations laying siege on the main and arterial roads. It is one of the rare occasions when all farmer organisations are protesting in a coordinated manner.The Punjab Bandh is getting a massive response with patwaris, traders, unions of various state government employees, commission agents, dairy farmers, singers, artistes and all major political parties supporting them.As anger against the Centre mounts in Punjab, over the passing of the three controversial Bills, especially the Farmer Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, which seeks to simplify the entry of private players in food grain purchase, farmers are all set to intensify their agitation in the coming days. Farmers fear that the government will withdraw from the MSP regime of guaranteed prices for foodgrains.Even as each of the political parties in the state have offered their help to the protesting farmers, the latter have refused their help. Punjab’s Congress government has decided to declare the entire area of the state, outside the mandis, into principal market yards. This would prevent the implementation of the Central Act in the state.

He appealed to the protesting farmers to read the farm Bills. He said the PM and the Agriculture Minister have specified that MSP would not be dispensed with.

25-09-2020||Amritsar||Smoke from farm fires may aggravate Covid trouble: Amritsar Deputy Commissioner||As sporadic incidents of stubble-burning have been witnessed in Amritsar district, the administration has asked farmers to shun the practice.The authorities said smoke from farm fires could create serious problems for Covid-19 patients as they can face trouble in breathing.Amritsar Deputy Commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira said due to the prevalence of the Covid-19, smoke could result in aggravating health of positive patients.A visit to rural areas revealed that stubble-burning has started in vegetable growing areas on the outskirts of the district where farmers are in a hurry to clear their fields after harvesting paddy. The Deputy Commissioner said farmers should go for in-situ management of crop residue and opt for machines provided by the government on subsidy.He said farmers can use happy seeders for direct sowing of wheat without burning crop residue. He added that letting the stubble decompose in fields would enrich soil, which would decrease farmers’ cost on fertilisers.Khaira said a total of 24 fire incidents have been noticed in the district with the help of remote sensing techniques. He said they can precisely identify those fields where stubble-burning takes place.The administration is sending teams to all areas from where farm fires are reported, said Khaira adding that the Revenue Department has been instructed to mention the incidents in the revenue record of those farmers who are violating norms.Though paddy procurement is expected to start from October 1, numerous vegetable growers have started harvesting as they are getting ready for sowing vegetables (potatoes and peas).Farmers said allowing paddy stubble to decompose on its own requires time and if they do so, they would not be able to sow vegetable crops.

However, a two-year window was suggested to amend major Acts to suit Haryana’s requirements.Over the years, a majority of the Acts had been amended keeping in mind administrative exigencies. However, these Acts still carry Punjab’s name in their nomenclature.Gupta said the decision to do away with Punjab’s name in various Acts had been taken keeping in mind the demands from a cross section of society, including public representatives. “The insertion of Haryana’s names in various Acts will go a long way in instilling a sense of pride among the general public,” he added.

There will be private players who will procure farm produce as per their own convenience and rates fixed by them.”In Amritsar, farmers commenced their three-day ‘rail roko’ protest against the farm Bills by blocking rail tracks near Devidas Pura village today.They said the ‘rail roko’ move called by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee was indicative of just how far they had been pushed without dialogue amid the pandemic.Keeping it in view, the Ferozepur Railway Division has cancelled 14 trains affecting the state’s connectivity with Mumbai and Nanded with Maharashtra, Kolkata and New Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, Jayanagar in Bihar and Haridwar in Uttar Pradesh.Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “This is purely an agitation of farmers and their families. No sitting or former MLA, MPs or ministers will be welcomed in our fight. We will keep fighting no matter how long it will take.”He questioned the integrity of SAD leadership which he said had yet to clarify its stance over the ordinances.“Why didn’t former Union Minister Harsimrat Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Badal contest when these ordinances came across them before being tabled in Parliament?” he asked.In Ludhiana, passengers are on the receiving end with the rail traffic going off the tracks in the region for at least four days due to the ongoing ‘rail roko’ agitation by farmers. The Railways have announced cancellation of two pairs of trains from today to Saturday, while 10 other pairs of trains would short-terminate and short-originate during this period.

She said subsequently she had even objected to the ordinances when they were discussed in the Cabinet.
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder Singh asks parties to join hands||Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh today urged all political parties to rise above petty considerations and come on one platform to fight the anti-farmer Bills that would “destroy” the farmers of Punjab.Why SAD still in NDA?Is giving up a berth in the Union Cabinet a sacrifice? The Badals clearly do not know the meaning of sacrifice… What are you still doing in the anti-farmer NDA govt? - Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief ministerThe Chief Minister said he was ready to lead the political fight against the ‘unconstitutional’ farm Bills. “I will do what it takes to save my farmers and my state from these dangerous new laws, whose implementation will cripple the farming sector and also destroy Punjab’s lifeline of agriculture,” he added.In a statement, the CM said the Congress had always stood by farmers and would fight with them shoulder-to-shoulder to scuttle the Centre’s plans to ruin not just their families but the entire state.The BJP-led Union Government had stooped to a new low by bringing these Bills, and that too in an “undemocratic” manner, he said, adding his government would oppose the legislations tooth and nail.Lambasting the Akalis for trying to change the narrative in a bid to transform the “Punjab v/s Centre” fight into a local political clash for their vested interest, the Chief Minister said they had changed the history of the SAD, reducing it from a political force into a “puppet of the BJP”. Captain Amarinder dismissed SAD leader Harsimat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Union Cabinet as a “mockery” of the Akali history of sacrifices.“Is giving up a berth in the Union Cabinet a sacrifice? The Badals clearly do not know the meaning of sacrifice,” he quipped, ridiculing SAD chief Sukhbir Badal’s statement that Akali Dal could make any sacrifice for farmers. “What are you still doing in the anti-farmer NDA government at the Centre,” he asked the Akali leader. — TNS

He participated in an agitation led by temporary teachers in 1978, for which he was jailed for two months. "We are raising our rightful demands. Farmers connect to the pro-agriculturist agenda of our organisation," says Kokrikalan. "If such ordinances are implemented, small-time farmers will be left with no choice but to give up farming. We will not let this happen," he says.Balbir Singh RajewalPresident, BKU (Rajewal)The 78-year-old firebrand activist from Rajewal village in Khanna has been jailed many times for raising farm issues.

Many graduates and postgraduates have taken the command of the farm agitations across Punjab.“My father owns 3 acres and it’s the only source of income for us. I have done MTech but I am jobless. Now, the Centre wants to snatch the only source of livelihood from us through these farm legislations. It’s unacceptable,” said Gurdarshan Singh (26) during a ‘rail roko’ protest at Chhajli village by the BKU (Ugrahan).Dilpreet Singh, another protester who has done MSc IT, said, “My uncles are farmers and I am here to express solidarity with them. We will fight till the last breath to oppose these laws.”Rajpal Singh, a BKU (Ugrahan) leader from Mangwal village of Sangrur, said, “The presence of educated youngsters in our agitations has given a makeover to the protests. They keep sharing latest updates with us.”Many protesters have cleared IELTS and completed all formalities to move abroad, but Covid-19 has delayed their flights. Since they have no work these days, they are devoting maximum time to farm protests.Jagmohan Singh, general sectary, BKU (Dakaunda), said well-educated youngsters were attending the ongoing agitation as they had understood the “injustice the Centre has done to them”.
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||FM: Will safeguard farmers’ interests||Assuring farmers that the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Government was committed to safeguarding their interests, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal said today that the fight against the agriculture Bills would “continue till our last breath”.No word against PMHarsimrat Kaur Badal, who has recently resigned from the Union Cabinet, has not even uttered a single word against the BJP and PM Narendra Modi. - Manpreet Singh Badal, Finance MinisterInteracting with mediapersons here, the minister said the Centre’s decision was another attack on Punjab and an example of the anti-Punjab stance of the BJP government, which has the Akali Dal as its partner. The Finance Minister said special tax concessions to hill states, GST regime, and now the agriculture Bills had disturbed Punjab’s economy.Slamming the Akali Dal, Manpreet said SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal should answer as to why his party was hand in glove with every anti-Punjab decision of the BJP. The farm ordinances, which were recently passed in Parliament, were aimed at lifting the safety cover in the form of MSP, thereby ruining the farmers of the country. — TNS
25-09-2020||---||Move to mark area outside mandis market yard||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 24The Punjab Government will convert the entire area in the state outside the existing mandis as a principal market yard so as to circumvent The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, passed by Parliament, said Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal here today. Aimed at skirting Bill: Finance MinisterThe Finance Minister said the preliminary exercise to bring in the change had already been initiated at the official level, but it would be carried out after completing the procedural and legal formalities.By declaring the entire area of the state as an Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), the Central Act would fail to come into force, he said.The Centre’s Bill specifies the area for allowing private trade as “outside the physical boundaries of principal market yards, sub-market yards and market sub-yards, managed and run by market committees formed under each state APMC Act in force in India”. This means the controversial Bill, when enacted, will be in force in residual area, outside the state’s existing mandis.“Section 7A of the APMC Act provides for states to declare their own trade areas. Thus, we are at liberty to declare any area as seasonal market yards/sub-market yards as we want. The Bill also does not bar states from declaring any new areas as market yards. Thus, we are taking legal opinion on declaring the entire area in the state as a principal market yard,” a top official in the Agriculture Department told The Tribune.As a first step in this direction, Punjab has already increased the market yards/sub-market yards from 1,840 to 4,500. The number will be increased to 5,000 before the start of paddy procurement, said a senior mandi board official.

At present, 4.4 contacts per positive case are being traced, much lower than the national average of 10 contacts.A two-member Central expert team, while analysing the state records earlier this month, had found the districts had varied numbers for contact tracing, ranging from 1.6 in SAS Nagar to 4.8 in Ludhiana.Central team recommendationsIt was found that in eight districts, including Sangrur, SAS Nagar, Muktsar, SBS Nagar, Moga, Fatehgarh Sahib, Fazilka and Bathinda, less than 4 contacts per positive case were being traced.There are just two districts Gurdaspur and Ferozepur where more contacts per positive case were being traced than the national average. Gurdaspur topped with 11.6 contacts, followed by Ferozepur with 10.9.The Central team in its presentation had asked Punjab to improve contact tracing. During the field visit to micro-containment zone Mubarakpur, it was found “the zone was without clear demarcation, the barricading was removed, house-to-house survey and contact tracing wasn’t complete and testing of only the primary household contacts was done”.All positive cases were in home isolation. Community based communication on advocacy of hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, wearing of masks/face covers had been done by the healthcare workers verbally during the camps organised earlier, however, no such posters or other material was found.As per the healthcare workers, people showed resistance and refused to get screened. Interaction with the sarpanch revealed he had a poor perception about the health system at the tertiary level and therefore encouraged villagers to undergo home isolation. He was even encouraging people to not entertain healthcare workers for sampling.Similarly, during a visit to another containment zone — New Durgapur in Habowal — it was found households with positive cases were not marked in the map. Strict perimeter control was not followedas there was movementof people for non-essential purposes.Interaction with the people, including the municipal councillor of the area, revealed people were unaware of their area being a containment zone.

Justice Anil Kshetarpal also ruled that commission chairman could not take important policy decisions at individual level.The ruling came on a petition filed against the State of Punjab and others by Jasveer Singh through counsel Alka Chatrath, seeking to set aside a recruitment notice issued by the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) in September 2018, inviting applications for 22 posts of extra assistant conservator of forest in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Protection. It was argued that the commission had drawn its own pattern of conducting written examinations.Justice Kshetarpal asserted that Article 320(1) of the Constitution provided that the Union and the state public service commissions were required to conduct examinations for appointment to the services of the union and the state.“Once the service rules provide for the manner and method of recruitment, in the considered view of this court, the commission has no jurisdiction to deviate or ignore the same,” Justice Kshetarpal added. The Bench also allowed the writ petition and set aside the advertisement/ recruitment notice dated September 27, 2018, along with various corrigendum.

He said as per the new reforms, an industry having 300 or less workers could fire the employees without taking permission from the Labour Department or any government agency. “Earlier, this rule was valid for an industry having 100 or less workers. The government has also put many restrictions on protests organised by labour unions. These new rules are framed to strengthen the big fish while they will exploit the poor and needy,” he said.Lakhvinder Singh of the Karkhana Mazdoor Union said labour unions would take part in the protest rallies being held in favour of farmers on September 25. “During these protests, the labour unions will unite and raise their voice against the government as the recent Bills will destroy farmers, labourers and workers,” Lakhvinder Singh said.

For which, the petitioner is unnecessarily being embroiled into the administrative rigmarole/red-tape and being made to run from pillar to post, including approaching this Court,” Justice Monga asserted.The petitioner had earlier told the court the company — a registered micro, small medium enterprise — was completely misled into supplying goods to the respondent-State of Punjab owing to the tall claim made while executing a contract dated December 24, 2019. It was told 100 per cent payment would be released within 10 days of issuance of consignee receipt and acceptance certificate and submission of bills.

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder Singh calls Tomar's claims 'atrocious lies'||Expressing shock at Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s “atrocious lies”, Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh said the BJP leader had thrown all propriety to the winds, spreading disinformation against the Congress in general and against him in particular.On Tomar asking why he (Capt Amarinder) had mentioned in his poll manifesto that the “APMC will be changed’, the CM said it was obvious that the minister had not read the Punjab Congress’ 2017 manifesto that clearly read that “updation of the APMC Act will be done to ensure direct access of farmers to national and international markets through digital technology without tinkering with the existing MSP system”.Capt Amarinder noted there was a difference between tweaking the APMC Act for the better and destroying the tested APMC system to benefit a few corporate cronies. Even the Congress’ manifesto stated the MSP would be protected and thousands of mandis set up, he added. He accused another Union Minister of lying in Parliament while claiming that Punjab, as a member of the committee on agricultural reforms, had been taken on board “when the fact is that the committee not once made a mention of the proposed new laws”.Cong to challenge farm Bills in courtNew Delhi: Terming the farm Bills unconstitutional, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said it would legally challenge the legislations if approved by the President.

25-09-2020||Roza is a tiny railway station in a nondescript town by the same name in western Uttar Pradesh. Nearly two decades ago||Hubris as policy||All that the government had to do was to have set up a Food Corporation of India (FCI) procurement centre or a small mandi at Roza to help the farmers get the MSP, but in its absence the market devised its own means to create an alternative — but corrupt — mechanism. In the light of the new farm Bills, which are being tom-tommed as a panacea for all farm ills, I checked with Northern Railway to find out whether rakes of wheat still ply between Roza and Khanna. Apparently, this trade stopped long ago, when procurement began in right earnest in UP. The FCI procured 35.77 lakh metric tonnes of wheat despite the Covid restrictions during the last Rabi season, which was considerably lower than the previous year. The market by itself cannot check corruption or the humungous wastage of public money — only governmental intervention can do that.Thus the seamless transportation of farm goods, which one of the three new Bills envisages, was not required to ensure a fair price for harassed wheat farmers of western UP. In this case, the market was not offering a sustainable business model, but merely using public money, government procurement agencies and the government transporter for profiteering. And once the government began doing what it was always supposed to do, the business model of carrying coal to Newcastle collapsed. This could be one reason why farmers are still not convinced about the farm Bills.Instead of ensuring greater transparency, modernisation and incremental digitisation of the agricultural economy, the government has made farmers anxious and apprehensive about corporatisation of one of the most productive sectors of the Indian economy. Despite the Covid contraction of 23.9 per cent of the GDP during the April to June quarter — the worst in the world — caused by the Central Government’s lockdown, agriculture was the only sector that grew, by 3.4 per cent over the last year’s figures. Why would the government want to overhaul a sector that is bucking the general negative trend and growing well? Why isn’t the government doing something similar for the manufacturing, construction, mining, hospitality, communication and transport sectors, which have no hope of immediate revival after having bottomed out?Farmers, particularly landowners who may or may not till land, are middle class, politically aware, astute voters and opinion-makers. They have smelled a rat in the farm ordinances, which have been hurriedly and undemocratically enacted, bulldozing parliamentary customs and courtesies. They believe that this is an attempt to corporatise farming and thereby gradually dismantle the MSP regime and the available safety nets for the rural economy. Sure, Madhya Pradesh has supplied more wheat to the central pool than Punjab this season and West Bengal is the top producer of rice in the country; but the agitation of farmers of Punjab and Haryana cannot be dismissed merely as a result of misinformation by the middlemen. It questions the intelligence and free will of the hardy people of a region that has suffered the worst and yet produced some of the greatest sons and daughters of India. The apprehensions of these people are genuine as they have already gone through the failed experiment of contract farming. About 15 years ago, I had travelled the Majha countryside to report on the farmers burning contracts that they claim were reneged by the corporates, including the multinationals.The Central Government has, so far, not taken the farmers’ agitation seriously, nor does it have any qualms about appropriating a state subject without an agreement with the stakeholders — state governments, Bharatiya Kisan Union leaders and agricultural economists. Instead, one of its agencies intends to question Deepika Padukone on the day of the Bharat Bandh against the farm Bills as if headline management on news TV channels is all that matters in this New India. People are in great distress after having lost 2.1 crore salaried jobs and this is no time to tinker with a smooth-running machine.
