The DC tilled the farm with the help of ‘Superseeder’ machine to encourage farmers for sowing of next crop without burning stubble.Before driving tractor, the DC interacted with farmers and said due the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the burning of crop residue will become more hazardous as coronavirus primarily affects lungs and the smoke after burning the stubble also causes difficulty in breathing.“To stop burning crop residue, the Punjab government has been giving farmers up to 80 per cent subsidy and the draw has been conducted online to ensure transparency in the whole process. Government authorities have provided agriculture implements to 69 panchayats, 148 co-operative societies, 273 custom hiring centres and 1,124 individual famers recently,” said the DC while interacting with farmers.Associate Director, KVK, Kheri, Mandeep Singh and ADO Sunam Damanpreet Singh accompanied the DC.“Government needs the support of farmer to protect our environment and farmers should also understand the seriousness of the issue. If any farmer is facing any problem in getting required machinery, he could contact us anytime,” said Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal, Chief Agricultural Officer, Sangrur.

He is waiting anxiously for someone from any industrial unit to call him to transport the goods. Earlier, things were different. He would start the work at 5 in the morning and would visit Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur and other districts for the transportation of goods. But since the pandemic began, the work has almost stopped. Bittu Pehelwan shares his life journey. “I am illiterate. I had a horse cart initially, then I started riding rickshaw. Now, I ride tempo and transport goods. I also used to wrestle in akharas, so, hence I was named ‘Pehelwan’. It gives me a sense of strength,” tells Bittu.His daughter is also a wrestler and has been taking coaching in a college. His 10 year-old-son is suffering from a rare disease called haemophilia. These days, Bittu’s focus is on providing his children with a balanced diet so that their health doesn’’t suffer. He wants his children to become successful wrestlers, for which he is working hard to help them get a good diet.Bittu Pehelwan’s otherwise strong voice becomes bleak when he mentions his son, “He needs medical checkup every three months and we visit Chandigarh for his checkup, but since March, when the lockdown was imposed, we haven’t gone for his medical checkup. These days, I am taking an extra care.”After a pause, he adds, “Once his forehead was bruised and the bleeding wasn’t stopping. Several bottles of blood had to be given to control his condition. I have also got a goat for my son. I make sure that he drinks goat’s milk because it is good for his health. But these days, there is hardly any work, so, I am hard pressed. I have no idea regarding how I will look after my family as well as the goat. I have to ensure a good diet for the goat as well. It is getting difficult with each passing day.”

Lt Gurbinder was a part of the advance party, when he was killed by insurgents on December 10, 2001 in Kashmir.Ajit is the same man, who had in March 2016, sought permission from the district administration to commit suicide. The trigger for his appeal was the fact that the name of the colony –‘Shaheed Lt Gurbinder Singh Nagar’ named after his son in 2005 – was changed to ‘British Town’ on the insistence of some residents by the Jalandhar Municipal Corporation.Following a long drawn battle and an inquiry by the Deputy Commissioner following Ajit’s appeal, the name of the colony was renamed ‘Shaheed Lt Gurbinder Singh Nagar’.Lt Gurbinder’s brother Davinder Singh said, “My father fought for the respect to be accorded to his martyred son for 10 years. My mother never revived from the shock. She became diabetic due to the trauma of my brother’s death and had to undergo dialysis twice a week even during the pandemic. She tested positive on September 10 and died on September 26. My father got sick soon after.”Lt Gurbinder’s elder brother Col Khushwinder Singh said, “My mother and father underwent immense trauma while fighting for my brother’s rights. Mother was pained at the ordeal my father went through. Sardar Ajit Singh’s son fought the Pakistanis on the border, but the former had to fight his own people to give him respect. In 2007, the name of the colony was clandestinely changed to ‘British Town’. Is this how martyrs are rewarded? The colony was finally renamed, but after a long drawn fight. Residents defaced and blackened boards. Still many of those adamant have stuck nameplates reading ‘British Town’.”

As a result, the BJP’s leaders reached the venue around one-hour late. The district administration and the police officials somehow managed to persuade the farmers to leave the venue.A large number of farmers, including Om Singh Satiana, Gurdeep Singh Khun Khun, Nambardar Manjit Singh Khun Khun, Lawrence Chaudhary, Ajib Dwivedi, Harminder Singh Harmoian, Gurnam Singh Singriwala and Jagtar Singh Bhinder, were present.Sukhbir was aware of farm Bills, says Som ParkashWhile addressing mediapersons, the MoS said, “When the Prime Minister is saying that the MSP will continue, then I don’t think that there is any reason to doubt it.” He said these laws were an important step of the government to double income of farmers.He said the Congress has no moral right to oppose the agriculture laws as Rahul Gandhi himself was not present in the Lok Sabha when the Bills were introduced.Replying to another question, he said despite the implementation of the farm laws, the mandi system will continue as before and these laws have provided another alternative to farmers to sell their produce in the open market and get higher prices.Commenting upon the opposition of the agriculture legislations by the Akalis, he said SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had earlier spoken in favour of the farm Bills, but later started opposing it for his political interests. He said Sukhbir was aware of the outline of the Bills so how could he say that these were anti-farmer.Former national vice-president of BJP Avinash Rai Khanna, Subhash Verma and Nipun Sharma, were also present.BJP to contest 117 Vidhan Sabha seats: AshwaniBJP state chief Ashwani Sharma said Capt Amarinder Singh-led state government was opposing the Centre’s agriculture laws to cover up their failures.He claimed that the farm laws were in favour of the farmers. He said Cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot had embezzled crores of rupees from scholarships, which were meant for Dalit students and the chief minister had given him a clean chit.Sharma said the BJP would contest on 117 seats in the forthcoming Assembly elections. He said though the BJP used to contest at 23 seats earlier, they had a strong base in all the segments in the state.

During this period, the SGPC executive members would continue to sweep the street for one hour daily.On September 18, Giani Harpreet Singh had publicly punished the SGPC president and executive members from the Akal Takht podium for failing to check the misappropriation of 328 ‘saroops’ that went missing.Longowal said though the existing SGPC executive was never summoned at the Akal Takht, they had decided to appear for atonement voluntarily considering it their moral responsibility.“Abiding by the Akal Takht directives, we are undergoing religious punishment. We took departmental action instantly on those officials and staffers who were named in the Akal Takht-appointed probe panel report.

The reason was that the issue of sehajdhari Sikhs’ role in elections was pending in the Supreme Court. In 2016, the court validated the 2011 House to operate.Voices have been raised over the term of the House several times, but the elections could not be held for the want of appointment of Chief Election Commissioner by the Centre.The present House has 170 elected and 15 nominated members. The Jathedars of the five Takhts are also members of this House. Eighteen members have passed away and two members have resigned.SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal welcomed Justice Saron’s appointment.

Among other things, the use of word “may” by the competent authority in the impugned order led to its quashing.Superintendent Rajan Kapur and other employees were dismissed from service by dispensing with a regular inquiry on April 25, 2019. The inquiry officer had submitted that Kapur was patronising a well-organised extortion racket in the jail with the help of other officials and gangsters lodged inside.The competent authority had then observed that holding of an inquiry was not reasonably practicable “as it may cause loss of time, which may be prejudiced to public interest and security of the nation”.Referring to the order, petitioner’s counsel Pankaj Jain contended the competent authority was itself not sure regarding the reasonability and practicability of not holding an inquiry. First, the reasons assigned were untenable. Second, the word “may” used by the competent authority showed the doubt in its mind.“When the competent authority is itself not sure, how could it come to a conclusion with regard to the satisfaction of not holding an inquiry,” Jain submitted.Justice Augustine George Masih asserted that the use of “may” left a void in itself with regard to satisfaction of the competent authority as it was “itself not sure with regard to the reasons to be of such effect which would prejudice the public interest and the security of nation”.Justice Masih added a perusal of the impugned order showed that the competent authority only reproduced the inquiry report. It did not apply its independent mind to the facts and circumstances of the case.The order and the reasons recorded were merely toavoid inquiry. The competent authority was neither expected, nor required to dispense with the inquiry lightly or arbitrarily, but was required to take into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and apply independent mind based upon any independent material to justify the dispensing with the inquiry.

After the police officials, the complainant and her daughter Rupinder Kaur went to the spot and a Sub-Inspector came to know that a murder case was registered against Palwinder Singh, Harwinder’s husband. When the police officials were inspecting the spot, a crowd started abusing and beating Harwinder and Rupinder.Claiming that the case was not of illegal detention, the state and other respondents claimed Harwinder and Rupinder were rescued by the police present on the spot and under the supervision of the senior officers, a duty magistrate and a subdivisional magistrate. It was in good faith and in order to protect their lives from angry mob, the alleged detainees were permitted to stay at the Ropar city police station until the situation normalised.“Even if it is accepted that some persons had tried to cause harm to the detainees, both of them could not be kept in the police station for two days without even making entry in the ‘roznamcha’ and also without informing the district/illaqa magistrate. Their continued detention cannot be termed as legal,” the Bench ruled.

Its larva bores into the stem of young plant and kills the central shoot,” the experts added.Therefore, the farmers were advised to remain vigilant and regularly monitor their paddy crop, especially, the fields where long duration varieties of paddy — Pusa 44, Peeli Pusa, etc. were grown, said the experts. The pink stem borer could be carried to next wheat crop in heavily infested paddy fields, they warned. — TNS

His sole interest lay in protecting the farmers of the state and the farm sector at all costs, and not in appeasing the farmer organisations, said the CM, adding that he would take decisions which were in the best interest of the farming community.‘Rail stir regrettable’The government needs to urgently transport foodgrain, coal, fertilisers and petroleum. It is regrettable that the kisan unions have decided not to stop their ‘rail roko’ stir. — Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief MinisterAt a meeting held today, the kisan unions had issued an ultimatum to the state government for convening a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to amend laws to counter the Centre’s agricultural legislations.The unions’ threat to gherao his residence, the houses of the state ministers and Congress leaders would not force him into taking any decision which might turn out to be detrimental for the interests of the farming community, said Amarinder.Flays Lakhowal groupCM Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said the BKU (Lakhowal) group’s U-turn on its petition against the farm laws in the Supreme Court was the result of pressure from the SAD.The suggestions given by the unions on the way forward on the farm Acts had been taken into consideration. Besides, it would be ensured that nothing was allowed to obstruct his government’s efforts to save the livelihood of farmers, said the CM. It was regrettable that the kisan unions had decided not to stop their ‘rail roko’ agitation, as it would prove to be damaging for the interest of both farmers and the state, said Amarinder.

The plazas haven’t been operative for the past six days.‘Don’t test collective will of farmers’ The collective will of the people forced the Britishers to leave the country. Similarly, big corporates will meet the same fate, if our concerns aren’t addressed. — Swaran Singh, general secretary, BKU (Sidhupur)They have also laid siege to three petrol stations owned by corporate houses and plan to protest outside departmental stores and malls in the district.“The farm Acts have been enacted to profit the corporate houses. We, therefore have decided to stop the toll plazas from collecting the charges to send a message to business houses that we won’t let them spoil our future,” said Bhinder Singh, a protester from Badholi Gujran village.Swaran Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), said they would continue to lay siege to toll plazas until the Union Government withdrew the draconian Acts. He said, “Before the Independence, Britishers had developed railway lines, roads and other infrastructure for their commercial interests in India. But the collective will of the people forced them to leave the country. Similarly, big corporates will meet the same fate, if our concerns aren’t addressed.”Ranjit Singh, a farmer leader, said they had been getting support from commuters, who gave them salutes and thumbs up to continue their battle.In Bathinda too, losses are mounting for toll plazas, mega wholesale stores, petrol pump companies and the Railways.Farmers are not allowing officials of the toll plazas on the Bathinda-Chandigarh National Highway to collect the fee from commuters.At some petrol pumps, even dealers have announced support to the farmers’ protest. A petrol pump dealer said: “I also come from a farming background and oppose these Acts. However, agitating at petrol pumps and not allowing them to function is also not the right way to protest as the losses are mounting.”Similarly, a big international brand wholesale store at Bucho Khurd on the Bathinda-Chandigarh National Highway is also facing huge losses as it has been closed for the past seven days with farmers protesting at its main gate and not allowing it to operate.Meanwhile, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leaders said the anger of farmers against the Centre was increasing by the day. They claimed that the Centre wanted to hand over their land and crop in the hands of big corporate houses.

However, the minimum support price continues to elude many farmers.Ruing that CCI refused to purchase their produce citing high moisture content, farmers raised slogans against procurement officials, the state government and Centre at a grain market here.‘Even private players quoting very less’On the one hand, CCI officials wouldn't procure cotton from me. On the other, private players are quoting a very low price for the produce. — Gurcharan Singh, a farmer“On the one hand, citing purchase guidelines, CCI officials wouldn’t procure cotton from me. On the other, private players are quoting a very low price for the produce, which is much richer in quality than that of many others in the mandi,” said Gurcharan Singh, a farmer from Kot Bhara village.Another farmer Amandeep Singh from Katar Singh Wala village said, “The moisture content in my cotton was measured at 12 per cent. However, the price quoted was Rs 5,446 when the minimum support price (MSP) is Rs 5,725.”Conducting procurement at the grain market in Bathinda, Harjit Singh, senior commercial officer, CCI, said: “We have procured around 200 quintals of cotton. While making the purchase, the quality of cotton, along with the moisture content, is in focus.”Meanwhile, former senior SAD minister and Akali Dal’s Kisan wing president Sikander Singh Maluka met cotton farmers at the grain market and assured them that he would take up the matter with authorities concerned to facilitate the MSP or at least remunerative prices on their produce.“I would also urge farmers to dry the cotton properly and ensure it’s in rich form and within the permissible limit of moisture content before bringing it to mandis for procurement,” said Maluka. He also met CCI officials and urged them to make the purchase of cotton on MSP.

||A race against time to douse stubble fires||Stubble burning is back in the news. And, as always, bureaucrats and politicians are scrambling to find a solution to the huge amount of pollutants released and moving towards highly populated areas in Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi.This time, however, the scrambling is a little more energetic. Experts warn that pollutants, including sulphur, particulate matter and carbon dioxide, will worsen the already serious Covid-19 situation. That conclusion should have been logically arrived at by even non-experts in the government, since it doesn’t need an Einstein to make the connection between bad air and a virus that hits the lungs. Given that ‘solutions’ offered have clearly failed, it is necessary to clean the slate and look for solutions that combine a little arm-twisting, political points and practicality.Warning of stubble burning began around September 12, rising steadily as the weeks passed. NASA imagery provided enough early warning, even indicating exact locations. Even assuming a comatose bureaucracy, there was an additional wake-up call from the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Control and Prevention) Authority or EPCA on September 22, advising ‘early action’.Also read: Curbing stubble burning: Farmers need incentives to discontinue the practiceGiven that the time for early action had run out months ago, this was a clear case of passing the buck. EPCA chief Bhure Lal, however, can’t be blamed entirely. Created in 1998, EPCA’s mandate covers only the National Capital Region (NCR), which includes 24 districts in Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh as well as the 11 districts of Delhi.And, as a perceptive analysis brings out, not only does it lack members from any state other than Delhi, but also that its members included the head of an automobile association, publicly opposed to restrictions on diesel cars. That’s a stark conflict of interest and an example of government indifference to the environment. So, the end effect is that setting up bodies like the EPCA, which has enormous powers, is not the solution.There is, of course, the Environment Ministry — which has brought out a draft Environment Impact Assessment report that attempts to sideline the environment altogether — of which the less said the better.This evidence of an almost criminal delay becomes more evident when it is considered that the solutions being talked of, like the Happy Seeder — which cuts and lifts straw, sows the seed and drops paddy straw on top — was the result of a task force set up in 2006. More than a decade later, there are still not enough seeders to go around, and are still too expensive for the small farmers, especially compared to the use of a couple of matches that ‘solves’ the issue in a few hours.Several alternative solutions proposed by universities in Punjab and Rajasthan include turning straw into biochar, feed, and animal bedding. There are successful start-ups which use straw pellets in power production.In theory, the farmer is literally burning money. But the reality is that few of these solutions can beat the time factor. Buying up crops takes time, and with just a three-month window to the next sowing season, farmers can’t take the risk. Incidentally, stubble burning was banned in 2015 by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). But, clearly, that doesn’t count.It’s as well to remember that this short window is the result of the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act 2009, which pushed the sowing of seedlings back by a month to time it with the monsoons, rather than using the rapidly depleting groundwater for the water-intensive crop. The intention was good, but the end result is this barrage of pollutants.Depleting water tables and the resultant debt drive farmer to suicides, underlining the undeniable fact that a state predicted to turn into a desert in 25 years has to turn away from paddy. That’s actually the primary solution.The difficulty is that the state is highly inconsistent in its approach, while the powerful arhtiyas (commission agents) have stalled any farm reform at all. Their opposition lies at the heart of the agitation against the farm laws. Sidelining this powerful group should, therefore, be priority number one.To beat the time factor, ‘high-value’ farmers — who have merrily taken advantage of subsidies meant for marginal farmers — should be made responsible for implementing solutions in specific villages, with the whole area coming under heavy fines, if not in a kind of corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme with teeth. But solutions have to be decided locally, while bureaucrats only turn their energies to ensuring forcible implementation.Governments could also take a leaf out of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal’s proposal for a free and entirely organic spray to turn stubble into manure, which is abundantly good for the soil.Finally, urgent measures are required as pollutants reach the NCR, endangering the Covid-affected people and others in the impacted states. Armed with the powerful clauses of the National Disaster Management Act, the Centre can use the Indian Air Force to put out fires — as it has done in forest fires in Uttarakhand and elsewhere, using the media to the full, to send a powerful message of a determined leader. That also has potential political benefits.Meanwhile, naysayers will point to the Chinese threat, and ‘waste’ of resources. But that particular war is still far away, and right now, it’s the several million downwind that count.

||Why farmers are not keen on agri reforms||The farmers’ agitation in Punjab, Haryana and western UP against the agricultural reforms, initiated to help none other than the farmer himself, continues unabated. Why is this so? Doesn’t the farmer know what is good for him? Is he being led up the garden path by the politicians and political parties, which are there only to fish in troubled waters?Of the two main parties leading the agitation, the Shiromani Akali Dal has been feeling increasingly marginalised in Punjab and, according to some commentators, the farm reform issue has come as a godsend. Ditto with the Congress which is seeking to use the issue to become nationally relevant again.But it may be wrong to think that the farmer does not have a mind of his own. He is likely without any knowledge of formal economics, but he is intuitively seeing what is good for him and voting with his tractor if not feet.The reforms have been described by agricultural economist Ashok Gulati as a 1991 moment for agriculture, drawing a parallel with the reforms led by Narasimha Rao-Manmohan Singh combine which ended the licence-permit raj for manufacturing. But agriculture remained untouched.Essentially, the latest reforms will allow the farmer to sell his produce to whoever he likes wherever in the country, by not having to take his harvest to the APMC yard. He will be able to engage in contract farming which will fetch him a better price. Removal of stock restrictions will enable private sector investment in warehouses and cold storages which will create a more efficient supply chain. This will reduce wastage and eliminate some middlemen, bringing greater price stability and, possibly, price reduction for the consumer. Plus, contract farming will pave the way for farm investment and improvement in productivity and quality.Why is the farmer looking a gift horse in the mouth? Yogendra Yadav, an academic-turned-government adviser-turned-grassroots activist-turned-politician, has come up with some answers. His point is that economists like Gulati have their ears to the economic theory and data, whereas you need to keep your ears to the ground and understand what is driving the farmer.Yadav’s first point is that ending the so-called monopoly of APMCs is a non-issue as only a quarter of all agricultural produce is sold through APMC mandis. In Maharashtra, there is extensive contract farming between sugarcane growers and cooperative sugar mills. Besides, the reform of APMCs has been a continuous process in many states for several years now. Yadav asserts that he is yet to meet a farmer who complains about not being able to trade outside the mandis. What farmers want is better run mandis.His second point is to question the assumption that the reforms will save farmers from exploitation by arhtiyas (commission agents). This is because big businesses will not deal directly with farmers but rely on middlemen as aggregators. So, it is unlikely that delayering of the supply chain will take place. In fact, there may come a time when both the arhtiya and the new middleman-aggregator will operate.He also questions the assumption that under the new system, the farmer will be able to operate in an efficient market and thus get better value. To benefit from the new system, farmers will have to command market power. Currently, farmers, mostly small, are price-takers. Proper market regulating mechanisms will take time to develop. Farmers will be able to command market power when they organise under farmer producer organisations. But again, these will take time to come up.Yadav says it will be naive to take the government at its word that it will maintain and raise its investment in agricultural infrastructure. He sees the new laws signalling the withdrawal, over time, of the government from agriculture in terms of investment, regulation and extension work. The new private players will invest in warehouses and cold storages and also carry out extension work by helping farmers adopt new technology.One manifestation of the farmers’ lack of faith in government promises is to raise doubts over how long the system of minimum support price (MSP) will continue. For them, the giveaway is the government assuring verbally that the MSP will continue, but refusing to write that into the law. In the last few days, the MSP of crops has been announced, but how long will it last is another matter.The MSP-supported government procurement of wheat and rice have, over decades, become the cornerstone of agricultural operations in the north-west. The farmer in this area not only helped make the country self-sufficient in food, but also today, there is a huge excess in the buffer stock. Now there is a need to diversify, move away from cereals and into coarse grains, cash crops and pulses — crops which are not water-guzzlers — and also to encourage dryland farming. The MSP has to lose its primary focus on cereals.The MSP-supported procurement of cereals gave the north-west farmers a sense of security. As a result, productivity has stagnated.Decades after the Green Revolution, the farmer has to confront the marketplace of private buyers and live in a world where the MSP and procurement are not primarily focused on cereals, but other crops. So, the agitating farmers know intuitively that assured procurement at the MSP of what they produce is set to end. Hence, they are insisting on maintaining the status quo.

Other than this, 2.27 lakh bulk litres of beer was also found less than what was projected,” said a senior excise officer.This meant that what was less or more than accounted for was kept for sale without paying the excise duty, the sources said. “The intent was prima facie suspicious. After a thorough investigation, we have now imposed a penalty of Rs 22.77 lakh on the brewery for the mismatch in stock of beer cases and Rs 2.83 crore for the mismatch in the bulk beer stock,” said the officer, requesting anonymity.As a measure to check smuggling, all distilleries and breweries are now required to bottle at least 6,000 cases per month to ensure that all liquor bottled in the additional lease lines are accounted for, said Rajat Agarwal, Excise Commissioner, Punjab. In case of failure to adhere to the direction, a security of Rs 2 lakh deposited by the distillery would be forfeited.Action is also being initiated against other distilleries and breweries, which the department suspects are smuggling liquor in the name of bottling by creating additional bottling capacity (lease lines). Many of these manufacturers, citing shortage of capacity, were allowed to establish new lease lines to bottle 25,000 cases per month. Excise officials allege the distillers account for just 600-700 cases per month, while they sell thousands of cases.Booze Scam1,518 cases of beer show mismatch in ledger2.27 lakh bulk litres unaccounted forRs 22.77-lakh penalty for mismatch in beer casesRs 2.83 crore fine for mismatch in bulk litre stockExcise officials say manufacturers account for just 600-700 cases per month in lease lines while actually sell thousands of cases

Buta Singh Burjgill, BKU (Dakaunda) chief, claimed the Centre seemed in no mood to withdraw the laws. “The invitation by Secretary (Agriculture) Sanjay Agarwal is clearly not to initiate a dialogue, but has been sent merely to ‘explain to the agitating farmers’ how the laws were beneficial,” he said.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) chief, said the farmers had no choice but to continue the ‘Rail Roko’ campaign and protest outside the houses of BJP leaders. Union leaders condemned the lathicharge on protesting farmers in Haryana on Tuesday.“We will observe a two-hour bandh in Punjab on October 9 from 4pm to 6 pm in solidarity with Haryana farmers,” said BKU leader Balbir S Rajewal.
