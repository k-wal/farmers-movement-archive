19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh calls for aggressive steps to take back Galwan valley||Advocating aggressive steps to take back the Galwan Valley territory seized by the Chinese, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday urged the government of India to issue an ultimatum to Beijing to vacate the occupied land immediately, with a clear warning that failure to do so would lead to serious consequences for them.While India would also have to suffer some consequences of such an act, it could no longer afford to allow such intrusions and attacks on its territorial integrity to continue, said Amarinder, while talking informally to media persons at the Chandigarh airbase where he had gone to pay tributes to the jawans from Punjab and Himachal whose mortal remains were flown in from Galwan valley.Laying a wreath on the mortal remains of Gurbinder Singh from Sangrur, Gurtej Singh from Mansa and Ankush from Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh, Amarinder saluted their supreme sacrifice and said the nation was forever indebted to them.Declaring himself to be totally against following an appeasement policy vis-a-vis China, he said past experience showed that when faced with aggression, the Chinese had always backed off.It was time to call their bluff, he asserted, reiterating that every Indian wants a befitting response to be given to the Chinese.The Chinese, with their salami-slicing tactics, had been nibbling into Indian territory piece by piece since 1962, said the Chief Minister, demanding an end to these intrusions, which 60 years of diplomacy had failed to stop.Questioning the so-called agreement which prevented Indian troops from firing (even if they had weapons), Amarinder demanded to know who had come up with such an agreement."How can one have an agreement of this nature with a hostile neighbour?" he asked.In any case, it was clear that the attack on Indian soldiers was a premeditated one by the Chinese, who had come prepared with their crude but deadly weapons, he said, adding that by carrying nail-studded and barbed-wire clubs and by attacking our troops they had abrogated whatever agreement was in place.In the circumstances, the Indian soldiers had full right to retaliate using their own weapons, he remarked, adding that India alone could not be responsible for adherence to the terms of the agreement.Unrelenting in his demand to know why the soldiers posted in Galwan valley failed to open fire if they were indeed carrying weapons, after their commanding officer fell, Amarinder said the colonel's death at the hands of the Chinese was an insult to the entire Indian Army.Asserting that he could not believe that the men at the LAC failed to open fire even after witnessing such a horrendous sight, he said the Indian Army is well-trained and equipped with the best of weapons, which it has every right to use when faced with such a brutal and treacherous attack.The Chief Minister recalled that during his term with the Army, armed soldiers were always strategically deployed whenever their senior officers went for meetings with the other side, and were ready to jump in for a rescue operation if needed."Why were soldiers not so deployed in this case? And if they were, why did they not use their weapons to rescue the officers and men under attack?" he asked.If the situation is allowed to escalate further, then China, in collusion with Pakistan, would get further emboldened to encroach into more Indian territory, which had to be stopped at all costs, said the Chief Minister.

Safety of students is our utmost priority".STUDENTS DEMAND DELAYOn the other hand, the BDS students have demanded to postpone their exams until normalcy is restored in the state. The students claimed that it was not possible for them to take their exams under such conditions.  Amidst this, seemingly, to avoid legal implications, many dental colleges have forced the students to sign Affidavits & Declarations that the college authorities would not be held responsible if a student gets infected.  Some colleges have made it clear that to the students that it will be the students' fault if they were unable to give their papers. A BDS student of Government Dental College said: "The risk of contracting COVID-19 is at an all-time high right now and is only increasing by the day. If the University conducts examination now, students from different part of the country will gather. They will be staying in the hostels only. This will exponentially increase the probability of infection.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-dental-college-makes-covid-19-test-mandatory-before-exams-students-demand-delay-101419

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Police claim two suspected Khalistani operatives arrested||Punjab Police claimed they arrested two alleged Khalistani operatives who were allegedly planning to carry out a series of “terror attacks and targeted killings” with help from their Pakistani handlers.Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said Amritsar Rural Police arrested the suspects, whom he identified as Gurmeet Singh and Vikram Singh, after a raid near Gurdaspuria Dhaba on GT Road, PS Jandiala.Gupta said police were acting on a tip they received. Police allegedly found a MP5 sub-machine gun of German-make, a 9 mm pistol with 4 magazines, and two mobile phones with “incriminatory” conversations, messages, and photographs with the two suspects.“The mobile phones revealed suspicious transactions with Pakistan-based elements, including photographs, voice messages, as well as the coordinates of a particular geo-location,” Gupta told the press on Friday.He also said investigators also found several posts and web-links that linked with the movement’s beginnings on the mobile phone of Gurmeet Singh, one of the two suspects. Gupta claimed Singh was in touch with ISI and “anti-India elements sponsored by the Pakistan establishment” on a regular basis.Gupta said Gurmeet Singh, a 44-year-old resident of Amritsar, allegedly told police during questioning that their Pakistani handlers had sent them photos and voice messages to help them locate and pick up some sophisticated weapons that their associates had kept waiting.  Gupta also claimed that they had instructions to target a particular community in Punjab.Gurmeet Singh, who faces unrelated criminal charges of fraud in an old case, allegedly met his handlers three years ago when he visited Pakistan.  “Efforts were being made to find the identities of the Pakistan-based mentors and handlers of the terrorist module,” said Gupta.The two have been booked for criminal conspiracy (Section 120-B), waging war against the state (121) and under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act as well as the Arms Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-claim-two-suspected-khalistani-operatives-arrested-101393

It's been really special to see, even in small communities, people saying, 'You know what? Black lives do matter. Indigenous lives matter'," he told the show's host.Also read: Trudeau backs opposition leader Jagmeet Singh expelled from Parliament over racism row"In light of all of this and the inaction of Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau and the inaction of the Liberal government, we put forward a motion to push for some real change."Singh further said that when the motion was presented, he heard a lot of "yays", but Therrien was the "one person in the entire House of Commons saying no"."Racism is exactly that. It's kind of saying that people don't matter. Their lives don't matter. There is no value to their lives," he told CBC Radio."Racism sends a message that people don't matter. And in that act, it made people feel like they mattered. And I don't want to take that away from people."It would be akin to saying I'm sorry for fighting systemic racism now. And I can't say that I'm sorry for fighting it," the NDP leader added.In recent weeks, police in Canada have come under scrutiny for the police shooting of an Indigenous woman in New Brunswick during a wellness check, footage of RCMP officers beating a First Nations chief in Alberta, a video showing an RCMP officer hitting an Inuk man with a truck door, and the death of a Black-Indigenous woman in Toronto who fell from a balcony during a police encounter, CBC News reported.Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet has demanded an apology from Singh.

Rather a separate exam centre will be established for such candidate.“Due to Covid-19, we will not allow any candidate to miss the chance of writing the test under any circumstances,” said Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor, BFUHS.Given the situation due to COVID-19, candidates cannot exchange pens and other instruments with others. Adhering to the strict compliance of social distancing norms, the medical university has deputed one supervisory staff for every 12 candidates in place of 24 candidates.There are 84 exam centres and every centre will have about 100 candidates.“To ensure social distancing among the candidates, we are making about double expenditure in conducting this test by engaging about 700 supervisory staff against 350,” said an officer associated with the conducting of the test.Wearing masks is mandatory while appearing for the examination. Maintaining social distancing of minimum 4-6 feet is compulsory. Candidates are allowed to carry drinking water during the examination as it will not be provided at the centre due to Covid-19 scare.Every candidate with mild flu-like symptoms would be seated in a separate room and all candidates will be sanitized as some candidates may come from hotspots and other states. There would be less interaction between the candidates and supervisory staff and the exam centres and furniture would be disinfected, he said.“Once the students reach the exam centre, they must not mingle as was the usual practice but maintain social distancing.All candidates need to download e pass from the state government COVA app to reach their exam centres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/8-500-candidates-to-appear-for-nursing-exam-in-punjab-101369

After experiencing an exhausting time at the airport, waiting to get screened, he was packed into a bus with other passengers, who had travelled abroad. He was then brought here at the Sports College where he and other returnees were further examined before being accommodated at the quarantine centre.Suraj said, “It’s been three days since I have been lodged here with other returnees. Though we have been kept here to recover, our health is completely at stake. The rooms are unclean, washrooms are dirty and Covid prevention measures have absolutely gone for a toss here. Most of the people are sharing common washrooms, which are dirty and the washing area hasn’t also been cleaned since we arrived here. If we stay here in such unhygienic conditions, we are bound to get infected as we don’t have any face masks and sanitisers here. However, even after pleading with the authorities, I wasn’t sent to a hotel, as I am ready to pay for my own expenses instead of living here.”Similarly, a Dubai returnee said, there is no timing for providing us food. We are forced to remain without food for hours. “We get our first meal between 7.30 to 8.30 am, followed by lunch around 2 pm and then dinner after 8.30. At times, the timings to supply food also gets delayed,” added the returnee.The authorities have kept nearly 80-100 oversees returnees at the NIT quarantine centre. Authority in-charge, Navneet Kaur Bal, Estate Officer, assured that she would verify the anomalies as all the facilities have been provided at the quarantine centre.

Impact of the lockdown imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak is now showing its aftermath.After relaxations from June 1, as many as 26,028 industrial units are yet to resume operations. There are a total of 2,59,799 units in the state.Around one-fifth of industrial units are functioning at less than 50 per cent of their capacity. Nearly, 49 per cent units (1,27,408) are working with less than 10 workers, while 28,103 units have a workforce of more than 25 workers.With lack of raw material and major markets of finished products still under the lockdown, manufacturing would take time to hit pre-Covid levels. Shortage of working capital has put 2,902 units in a financial distress.“What should we do?” questioned Ludhiana-based industrialist SC Ralhan. “We are neither getting raw material, nor market for finished products in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi is operational. How can we produce goods at the earlier levels?” he said. As many as 5,307 units are not in production due to non-availability of raw material.The situation is worse in Mandi Gobindgarh, where industrialists claim that their production has reached just 60 per cent. “We were importing scrap through Kandla Port in Gujarat and domestically generated scrap via Delhi. With Covid hitting both the states badly, our supply chain has snapped. Harassment by officials of the Punjab Pollution Control Board is making the matters worse for industrialists,” said Mahinder Pal Gupta, president, Steel Furnace Association.C Sibin, Director, Industries, said the state government was doing all within its means to mitigate problems of industrialists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/industrial-activity-yet-to-pick-up-pace-101008
19-06-2020||---||Cops deny using offensive word for African national||Chandigarh, June 18 The expression for which the Punjab Police was rapped by the Punjab and Haryana High Court was not used by it at all, at least this is what the police has told the Bench. In the midst of a row for allegedly using an offensive term for describing an African resident, the police today submitted before the High Court that the expression was, in fact, used by an accused in his statement and faithfully reproduced in accordance with the provisions of law. As the case came up for resumed hearing through videoconferencing, Justice Rajiv Narain Raina’s Bench was told that the “offensive word” was neither used by nor mentioned in police proceedings or other documents forming a part of the police report by complainant Sub-Inspector Surinder Singh, Investigating Officer ASI Surjit Singh or any other police official involved in the matter on their own accord. A perusal of the police report under 173 CrPC would reveal that the word cropped up in the matter at the time of recording disclosure statement suffered by the accused. “The police officials, while recording the statement of complainant, witnesses and accused persons, cannot make any changes in the language or narrative version being dictated by either of them. This was the reason that led to the recording of the ‘offensive word’ in the paper work/case file, being a verbatim recording of the disclosure made by the petitioner,” it was added. The Bench was also told that Punjab Director-General of Police Dinkar Gupta has already issued detailed instructions to the field units to comply with the High Court directions and not to use any offensive or racist words in any official records such as FIRs, final investigation reports, seizure memos and `panchnamas’ prepared by the  police.  Earlier, the Punjab Police faced the High Court wrath after they were found using a “highly offensive” word for an African national in their final investigation report filed before a trial court.

Permitting them to export the PPE kits “would also give an impetus to the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan recently launched by the Government of India under your leadership,” he said in his letter to the PM.“The manufacturers are finding it difficult to obtain orders from HLL Lifecare Ltd,” he said, adding that of the 128 approved manufacturers, only 18 had received orders from the Central Government. The Chief Minister recalled that on May 21, 2020, the Punjab Industries and Commerce Minister had written to all Chief Ministers to consider directing their respective Health Departments to place orders to Punjab’s PPE manufacturers at HLL rates. The minister had requested the Union Commerce & Industries Minister to allow export of surplus PPE kits from the country, he said.Notably, the 128 manufacturers have a cumulative capacity to manufacture 5,21,050 PPE coveralls every day. Besides, with the manufacturers possessing significant ability to further scale up the total capacity, the potential for exports was massive, said Additional Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, adding that the export permission would help in reviving the state’s industry. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/128-units-making-ppe-kits-in-punjab-allow-export-capt-urges-pm-101016

Spread over 4 kanals, the farmhouse is situated at Ghallu village in the district. According to the FIR registered at Khui Khera police station, on a tip-off, a police team conducted a raid at the farmhouse and recovered illicit liquor.  Rakesh Sehgal, his brother-in-law Rohit Kumar and one unidentified person have been booked under the Excise Act. The accused used to smuggle liquor from Chandigarh and sell it in Fazilka, SSP Harjeet Singh said. When contacted, Jyani claimed that earlier Sehgal had been running a dairy from the farmhouse, but he had leased the land to someone two years ago. Sehgal had nothing to do with the liquor trade, Jyani said, adding that his name was being dragged in the case due to political reasons. Sehgal claimed that he had no role in the sale of illicit liquor, as his farmhouse was being managed by Rakesh Kumar to whom he had leased out the property years ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/liquor-seized-from-fazilka-farmhouse-101023
19-06-2020||Rajmeet Singh---||Officer shifted hours after possession of prime land||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 18 A concerted effort by the Local Government Department to take possession of 55 acres of prime land in Nayagoan, adjoining Chandigarh, appears to have not gone down well with political bigwigs. Hours after Jagjit Singh Sahi, Executive Officer, Nayagaon Nagar Council, moved an application before the SAS Nagar District Collector to take possession of the land that was under the “occupation” of private persons, the officer was transferred to the head office by the Additional Chief Secretary (Local Bodies), Sanjay Kumar, on directions of the Local Government Minister, Brahm Mohindra. Interestingly, the land was required for developmental projects, including sewerage treatment plant, power grid, water disposal units and playgrounds. For the last one year, the civic body had been trying to take possession of the land. The Executive Officer refused to comment on the issue. Mohindra categorically denied any motive behind the transfer. “The halqa in-charge and senior party leader Jagmohan Singh Kang had written several times to me to transfer Jagjit Singh Sahi.” “I will ensure that possession of the land for developmental projects is taken,” the minister said. Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari is learnt to have spoken to the minister against transferring the Executive Officer.  Kang said it was wrong to draw conjecture on the transfer and the exercise to take possession of the land. Chairman of the Punjab Agri Export Corporation and member of the Nayagoan Sudhar Committee, Ravinder Pal Singh, said Sahi was doing a good job and was instrumental in getting possession of the prime land for development projects. Deciding the case in favour of the Nayagoan Nagar Council on June 16, the District Collector, while quoting the East Punjab Holding (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948, pointed out that the common land recorded as “shaamlat deh hasab rasaz zar khewat” cannot be partitioned amongst the proprietors of the village and shall continue to be used for common purpose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/officer-shifted-hours-after-possession-of-prime-land-101024

On August 10, 2015, she approached Patiala Eye Hospital, where Dr Sukhdip Singh Boparai, hospital owner, prescribed medicines and urged her to undergo bladeless LASIK surgery. He told her that it was a 10-minute operation and she won’t have to use spectacles after it.Dr Boparai performed the LASIK surgery upon her at Clear Vision Lasik Laser, Patiala, on September 10, 2015. After the surgery, the complainant went back to the UK to continue MSc (Management) at University College, London.In March, 2016, her vision started becoming blurred, causing stress as well as watering. She came back to India on July 9, 2016 and went to the Centre For Sight, New Delhi, on July 16, 2016. The centre carried out the refraction of her eyes and also conducted ‘Oculus Pentacam’. Her condition was diagnosed as “Post LASIK Ectasia”.She said it was shocking to know that her eyesight had deteriorated further.Updip Singh, counsel for the complainant, contended that all the post-operative problems faced by the complainant were the result of incorrect and improper LASIK procedure conducted by the doctor.Dr Boparai said after the LASIK procedure, the complainant missed one follow-up session after 10 days and went abroad. As started having blurred vision in March 2016 only, this meant she had no problem for six months after the surgery, he said.“Keeping in view the above discussion and the evidence on record, it clearly stands proven that the doctor and centre were grossly negligent while performing the LASIK surgery,” said the commission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patialas-eye-hospital-directed-to-pay-rs-15-lakh-for-negligence-101025

19-06-2020||Saurabh Malik||Punjab police deny using ‘offensive word’ for African national||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 18The expression for which the Punjab Police were rapped by the Punjab and Haryana High Court was not used by it at all — at least this is what the force has told the Bench.In midst of a row for allegedly using an offensive term for describing an African resident, the Punjab Police today submitted before the High Court that the expression was, in fact, used by an accused in his statement and faithfully reproduced in accordance with the provisions of law.As the case came up for resumed hearing through videoconferencing, Justice Rajiv Narain Raina’s Bench was told that the “offensive word” was neither used by, nor mentioned, in police proceedings or other documents forming a part of the police report by complainant -- Sub Inspector Surinder Singh, investigating officer Assistant Sub Inspector Surjit Singh or any other police officials involved in the matter on their own accord.A perusal of the police report under 173, CrPC, would reveal that the word cropped up in the matter at the time of recording disclosure statement suffered by the accused. “The police officials, while recording the statement of the complainant, witnesses and accused persons, cannot make any changes in the language or narrative version being dictated either by the complainant, witness or accused persons on their own. This was the reason that led to recording of the 'offensive word' in the paperwork/case file, being a verbatim recording of the disclosure made by the petitioner,” it was added.The Bench was also told that Punjab Director-General of Police Dinkar Gupta has already issued detailed instructions to the field units to comply with the High Court directions and not to use any offensive or racist words in any official records such as FIRs, final investigation reports, seizure memos and `panchnamas’ prepared by the  police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-deny-using-offensive-word-for-african-national-100933
19-06-2020||---||Punjab Police book SFJ adviser Gurpatwant Pannu for sedition||Chandigarh, June 18Punjab Police on Thursday booked Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, US-based legal adviser of the banned organisation Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), for sedition and unlawful activities, instigating youth of Punjab in favour of ‘Referendum 2020’, provoking the secession of Punjab from India and attempt to spread dissatisfaction among the country’s armed forces or abetting mutiny.He has been instigating people of Punjab through pre-recorded audio message (IVR) from different international numbers mainly from the US for last few months. Pannu was booked under Sections 124-A (waging war against India), 131 (abetting mutiny) 153-A (promotion disunity and disharmony) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 10(a), 13(1) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.The trigger point for registration of the case took place today after Pannu reportedly approached the Chinese government for helping him in his anti-India activities. Also, a number of pre-recorded calls emanating from Pakistan were also received by number of citizens, including advocates, journalists and police officials. Some callers claimed they were calling from China or were Chinese and supported Pannu.DGP Dinkar Gupta said the calls from Pakistan proved that the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) of that country was planning the whole conspiracy. Also, the attempts to involve China, at a time when a bloody clash has taken place between armed forces of both countries, suggests there is a bigger conspiracy against the country through Pannu.“It is highly insensitive that when brave Punjab soldiers had achieved martyrdom fighting Chinese army, Pannu and others were carrying their nefarious designs in causing bloodshed and violence in Punjab. We will never let it happen as Punjabis are living in peace,” said DGP Dinkar Gupta. He said it was also unfortunate that the trouble was being created when each resident of the state was fighting against the spread of deadly coronavirus.Police had earlier also lodged two FIRs against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu for his anti-India activities.However, during last 2 months, he continued to send these pre-recorded messages from different numbers regarding which 21 DDR’s has been recorded and total 54 numbers have been blocked.A police spokesperson added that on June 13 and 15, one person who introduced himself as Imran made these calls saying “Sikhs for Justice will be starting a voter registration for Referendum 2020 in Punjab. Today, you have the opportunity to undo the mistake of 1947 by participating in Referendum 2020 and Pakistan will also get a peaceful neighbour”. In this regard, a DDR on June 06 and another one on June 15 were recorded.On June 18, another pre-recorded audio message (IVR) was received from different numbers, where the caller claimed that she is from China and supporter of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) and wanted to tell the people of Punjab that voter registration for Punjab ‘Referendum 2020’ will start from July 4.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-book-sfj-adviser-gurpatwant-pannu-for-sedition-100945
