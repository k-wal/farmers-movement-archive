However, when I came to know the ‘kala kanoon’ (black law) was being tabled in Parliament, I decided to resign,” the Shiromani Akali Dal leader said.“I felt it was a shame to sit on my chair any longer; kicked it promptly and decided to stand with farmers,” Harsimrat said addressing a gathering, according to a party statement.The ex-Union minister claimed that she had told the government to take farmers into confidence before bringing the Bills. “I tried continuously for two and half months,” she claimed.She said when their pleas went “unheard”, Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal decided to oppose the Bills in Parliament. Harsimrat said as she has resigned, she will join hands with farmers in their fight against the legislations.“I need your blessings for this task,” she told the gathering even as she appealed to all political parties to unite to fight for the cause.SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said no alliance or government was important for the party before the welfare of farmers and that his party will fulfil its responsibility towards the ‘annadata’ (farmers) come what may.Sukhbir said the SAD had taken a consistent stand from day one and told farmer representatives that the party will fulfil its responsibility as and when required.“We did this by voting against the agricultural Bills in Parliament and resigning from the Union cabinet. It is only after Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the cabinet that the opposition was galvanised and opposed the bills forcefully in the Rajya Sabha,” he claimed.Sukhbir said the party decided to vote against the Bills after the NDA-led government refused to make the minimum support price a statutory right as demanded by farmers and the SAD.“Earlier we had met with farmer organisations and they had expressed their fears about the end of the MSP regime and the SAD had conveyed this to the Centre following which the agriculture minister had given an assurance that the MSP will stay.However, when farmer organisations told us that they wanted a law on the MSP, we took a stand and even resigned from the government when this was not accepted,” he said. — PTI

We all withstand with the farmer community.Every single person of all age groups from Punjab is standing with the farmers. People calling it right to the bill passed, atleast try to talk to the farmers. Punjabi language has been eradicated from Government Languages in Jammu and Kashmir. What is this happening people?" Diljit wrote on Instagram.Reacting to the post, a user tried to take a dig at Diljit. "Apni anpad soch nu loko na ladwao. 10 padhke singer banjande ho fir loka nu bevkoof banaude ho. Sara desh bil de naal hai (Don't try to create unrest among people with your uninformed thoughts.

24-09-2020||---||Punjab CM appeals to all parties to fight unitedly against farm Bills||Chandigarh, September 24Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday appealed to all political parties to rise above petty considerations and come on one platform to fight unitedly against the treacherous Agriculture Bills that would destroy the farmers of Punjab.Asserting his commitment to protect the rights of the farmers at all costs, the Chief Minister said he was ready to lead the political fight against the unconstitutional anti-farmer Bills with all his might. “I will do what it takes to save my farmers and my state from these dangerous new laws, whose implementation will cripple the farming sector and also destroy Punjab’s lifeline of Agriculture,” he added.In a statement, the Chief Minister said the Congress had always stood with the farmers and will fight with them, shoulder to shoulder, to scuttle the Centre’s plans to ruin not just their own families and the labourers, who toil on the fields day and night to feed the nation, but the entire state of Punjab.The BJP-led Union Government has stooped to a new low by bringing these Bills, and that too in a totally undemocratic and unparliamentary manner, said Amarinder, adding that his government, supported by the Punjab Congress, will oppose the legislations tooth and nail in the interest of not just the farmers and the state but the entire country.Lambasting the Akalis for trying to change the narrative through their concerted and deliberate efforts to transform the ‘Punjab V/s Centre’ fight into a local political clash for their vested interests, the Chief Minister said they have changed the history of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), reducing it from a political force into a puppet of the BJP.Amarinder dismissed SAD leader Harsimat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Union Cabinet as a mockery of the Akali history of sacrifices, before the Badals hijacked the party and converted it into their personal fiefdom for their own gains. “Is giving up a berth in the Union Cabinet a sacrifice? The Badals clearly do not know the meaning of sacrifice,” he quipped, ridiculing SAD chief Sukhbir Badal’s latest statement that Akali Dal can make any sacrifice for farmers. What are you still doing in the anti-farmer NDA government at the Centre, he asked the Akali leader.Sukbir’s assertion that SAD will not let any corporate enter Punjab if the people make an Akali Dal government in the state clearly showed that it was all about power, and the entire drama was being enacted by their party to get into the saddle, said the Chief Minister.

Among them were the two manuscripts of Guru Granth Sahib. When the Sufi elder passed away in 1950, he had left the scriptures in the safekeeping of his children and since then they have remained with the family," Kakravi told The Express Tribune.Kalravi said that Naqshbandi had always campaigned for Muslim-Sikh brotherhood and also for interfaith harmony in general."He was known for his kindness and this what led to the revered Sikh manuscripts coming into his possession. After over 90 years of safekeeping within the Pir's family, we have now decided that the manuscripts should now be rightfully transferred to the Gurdwara Baba Di Beri."This is a great example of Muslim-Sikh friendship and will help further strengthen our relationships," he told the newspaper.
24-09-2020||Faridkot||PDS wheat ends up in open market; price falls 20 per cent||With a surge in wheat delivery through the Public Distribution System (PDS) among the Smart Ration Cardholders during the lockdown, the prices of wheat, flour, maida and suji have fallen by more than 20 per cent in September in the area.Wheat is trading currently at Rs 1,600 per quintal in the open market against Rs 2,200 per quintal in April this year. The current market price of wheat is more than 15 per cent lower than the minimum support price of Rs 1,925 a quintal, offered by food procurement agencies to farmers during the rabi season.Sources attributed this fall in price mainly to a large number of Smart Ration Card-holders selling the wheat they had received under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) during the past three months.Other than providing 30-kg wheat at a discounted price of Rs 2 per kg through the PDS, under the PMGKAY, every smart cardholder family member was distributed 15 kg wheat free this time.Under the AAY, every smart cardholder family was provided 5-kg wheat per member per month at Rs 2 per kg. This stock of six month makes 30 kg per member.With an average family of four or five members getting 200-225 kg of wheat this time, its major portion was sold in the open market at the price ranging between Rs 1,400-Rs 1,500 per quintal, said sources in the Food and Supply Department.Wheat was sold in the open market at throwaway prices by the cardholders as many of them were rendered jobless due to the lockdown, said a senior functionary in the department.Other than this increased supply of free and subsidized wheat under PMGKAY and AAY schemes, what further gave an impetus to flood the open market with wheat was a scheme of Punjab government under which 10 lakh packets of dry rations, containing 10 kg atta, 2 kg dal and 2 kg sugar each, was distributed to daily wagers and unorganized labourers to help them through the lockdown imposed in light of Covid-19 crisis.Punjab has about 34.62 lakh such ration cardholder families. In Faridkot district, the number of such cardholders is about 80,000 and over 3,00,000 persons have been listed as beneficiaries on these cards, revealed sources in food and supply department here.The huge flow of wheat stock in the open market has even dampened a move of Central Food Ministry of cutting the base price of wheat by nearly 12 per cent to clear the excess stock from the central pool. Food Corporation of India (FCI) is offering wheat at Rs 1,840 per 100 kg so that to increase the offtake given overflowing stock. But as the market prices are hovering much below Rs 1,840, so the FCI is not getting much of the desired number of buyers.Vineet Parkash, divisional manager, divisional office, FCI in Faridkot said despite the decline in the price, the FCI is also getting its share of buyers.

So the Congress and the people of Bathinda were protesting against the SAD and asked it to stop doing “dramebaazi”.The AAP leaders are also standing at Khanda chowk outside Takth Damdama Sahib in large numbers to show black flags and placards to the SAD leaders.The protestors are shouting slogans “Badal family go back” against the SAD leadership.AAP MLA from Talwandi Sabo Baljinder Kaur and Bathinda (Rural) MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby have also reached Damdama Sahib to gehrao the Badal couple.While talking to mediapersons, Baljinder Kaur said: “Badal family is misleading farmers by becoming agents of Modi as on one hand, it says that the bills are not anti-farmers and on the other, it says we have failed to make them understand about these bills.”She said they were representing farmers, arhtiyas and farm labourers as all are on roads today. “Our protest will continue till the time the Bills are not taken back.”She said: “Resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal is the victory of the people of Punjab. She has not given the resignation. It was taken after they knew that their politics would be over due to the anger of the people.”

It means they are not good for farmers,” said Pandher.He said they will continue their struggle against the Bills until they are revoked. “It is going to be a long struggle,” he added.Pandher asked the Shiromani Akali Dal to clarify its stand on the bills. “If they find these Bills as anti-farmer, then why are they still in alliance with the BJP,” he asked.The protesters dug up tents in the middle of the rail tracks. They also made arrangements for ration for three days, said farmers.Women, youth and elders also took part in the protest, they said.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh said the Bills were drafted just to “benefit” big corporates and demanded that they be “withdrawn”.Farmer leaders said they were getting support from several sections, including government employees and labourers.Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee president Satnam Singh Pannu said they have appealed to representatives of political parties, ministers, MPs and MLAs not to take part in the farmers’ agitation.They vowed to gherao BJP leaders and socially boycott those who voted in favour of the farm Bills.As many as 31 farmers’ outfits have given a call for a complete shutdown of Punjab on September 25.Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension that the Bills would pave a way for dismantling the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.Parliament has passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill; Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill.They await the President’s nod to become laws.Meanwhile, railway officials said the Nanded-Amritsar train will end its journey in Old Delhi.

The sprawling town, which pops out for its whiteness like a white dot on Google maps, was a much vast space several years ago, very different from the densely populated concrete jungle now, which spreads out like a monster gobbling up the greens.During the time of the Mughals, the 12 bastis of the town, populated by Muslim settlers, began to branch out into kots.About the 12 kotsWhile the town was divided among bastis and kots, the 12 kots were walled areas, where affluent Muslim families lived. With time, the kots have disappeared into oblivion. Their names and legends shrouded in obscurity. The places which were earlier the kots now constitute the busy, congested bazaars of the old city. Only a few have retained their names, while others are referred to by other names.Deepak Jalandhari, an 89-year-old historian who has carried out extensive research and penned two books on the history of Jalandhar, writes in detail about the kots in his book “Ek Shahar Jalandhar”.He said: “Much of the history of the city is lost because no on tried to document the buildings or developments. Nor were many of the historic buildings marked or researched upon by the Archaeological Department. Many glorious havelis and palaces of yore fell to decay. Of others, a gate, a wall or a ruinous pillar remains. A majority of these are totally gone. I also know of historic gurdwaras and buildings that were built over or laid over with marble. Now, we can never catch a glimpse of what they looked like. There are others that still stand but are in extremely pathetic condition.”Partition also altered the area substantiallyNotably, the Partition also substantially altered the area. Earlier, much populated by the Muslims, it was later populated by the Saini Sikhs, who settled here after the Partition.Historian Chiranji Lal Kangniwal, says: “Back when the bastis were formed, there were repeated attacks against Indians by Ahmad Shah Abdali and Nadir Shah. The bastis were populated by the poorer Muslims, who grew their own food on little plots and gardens and sold vegetables off in the city. They toiled while the affluent lead lives steeped in decadence, travelling the city on horses. The richer ones lived in walled cities, while the poor ones lived outside. These poorer peasants and working class members were called ‘raain’. After Partition, the working class Sikhs, which replaced the ‘raains’ were the Sainis. Following 1947, these outer bastis started being frequented by Kabohs and Sainis.”Subsequently, rampant development and change in the city ate up the kots and very few traces of the original structures remain today. Deepak Jalandhari says the historic buildings and heritage sites of Jalandhar weren’t documented even in 1861, when the Archaeological Survey of India was formed by the British Government.Stories of yore...The Kot Kishan Chand area is also popular for another legend.It was frequently used as a hideout for the members of the Kirti Party during World War-II. Historian Chiranji Lal Kangniwal, Ghadar and Independence movement scholar as well as librarian at the Desh Bhagat Yadgaar Hall, says: “During the second World War, the peasantry, under certain able farm leaders, was being mobilised to rise up against the oppression of the British. Many Kirti Party leaders, who were mobilising farmers, were put in jails. Those who escaped went underground and used to organise activities against the British from their hideouts. A rented house at Kot Kishan Chand served as the underground office for several Kirti Party luminaries. Madan Lal, the general secretary of the Jalandhar unit of the Kirti Party, was himself a resident of Kot Kishan Chand and he rented a house to carry out his underground party activities. Madan Lal, along with freedom fighters Nain Singh Dhoot, Bujha Singh, Gandharva Sen, Ram Singh Dutt and Tehel Singh Baghi, were revolutionaries, who mobilised farmers to stand up against the British.”
24-09-2020||Neeraj Bagga||Hit by downturn, tenants in Amritsar vacating commercial premises||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, September 23Unable to meet the fixed expenditures, many tenants have left commercial premises due to the recessionary trend spiralling out of the Covid-19 lockdown.A majority of these tenants were fence sitters as far as liquidity was concerned. They could not absorb a lockdown-like blow and had to abandon the field. So, rental price in the commercial markets within the city plunged up to 12 per cent.Also, they say they got no support from the government or the property owners to withstand the crisis. On the other hand, fixed expenditures like staff’’s salary, power tariff, rent, tax, loan, etc., remained unchanged.Sanjay Vasudev, a real estate expert, said a small section of such tenants with enough savings were out in the market to buy commercial properties to get benefit from the slowdown.He elaborated that property prices had varied segments. Commercial and residential segments within the city suffered a minor 5 per cent correction, while the demand is largely standstill. On the other hand, residential and commercial components of the localities situated out of the bypasses suffered maximum decline. Prices in the residential localities came down between 20 and 25 per cent. The rates of commercial properties plummeted between 30 and 40 per cent.Even in this scenario, the number of customers has also halved in comparison to those available before the Covid-era in the market.Even then, there appears to be a silver lining as far as the properties of the Amritsar Improvement Trust are concerned. It recently held an auction and elicited a handsome response from participants.For instance, in spite of the reserve value of Rs25 lakh of a shop built on 44-square yard in New Amritsar, it was auctioned for Rs94 lakh, which after adding taxes would cost Rs1.04 crore.Dinesh Bassi, chairman of the Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT), said the auction belied the slowdown trend. He said people invariably repose faith in the localities set up by the Trust. He said plots in some localities got low-price bid but this could be referred to as correction.He said preference of people to buy properties in the schemes of the Trust could be attributed to the massive maintenance facilities in terms of sewerage, potable water supply and other civic amenities being ensured.

It appears that officials were being paid bribe on a monthly basis,” it asserted.Observing that the information with the investigating agency may be the tip of the iceberg, Justice Avneesh Jhingan said the matter involved reaching ramifications. It might vary from allowing non-payment of input credit/modified value added tax (MODVAT) to the government to an eventuality where credit of tax paid on some other product was used for something else, he said.The matter was brought to Justice Jhingan’s notice after Excise and Taxation Officer Sushil Kumar, posted at Mandi Gobindgarh, filed a petition for anticipatory bail in a case of cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and other provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.Turning down the plea, Justice Jhingan asserted a person’s liberty was of utmost importance, but when personal liberty was pitted against a sovereign function of tax collection — life blood of the economy — the latter would prevail. The arrest was imperative for fair and full investigation.Justice Jhingan noted the petitioner was allegedly paid Rs 8,25,000 during past three years. There were indicators that minor penalties imposed and recovered in cash by the petitioner were even not deposited in the government treasury.

I don’t think in America, (as) for any small business, we have a guaranteed income or guaranteed profitability.”Wherever agriculture is being opened to markets, the big capital has successfully managed to push out the majority farming population and concentrated its control over food. That’s how the markets behave, with its own set of logic and ethics. As the big get bigger, the small farms struggle to survive. In America, after decades of market reforms in agriculture, only 1.5 per cent of its population has somehow managed to survive on the farm. Despite providing for $867 billion support under the Farm Bill 2018 over the next 10 years for agriculture, nutrition and conservation programmes, rising suicide rate, worrying trends of depression in rural areas, declining milk and farm commodity prices, and the mounting bankruptcy in farming — estimated at $425 billion — will make it tough for the family farms to survive the transition.With the suicide rate being 45 per cent higher in rural areas as compared to urban America, low prices and mounting debt has pushed much of the rural population in the grip of stress and depression. What happened in America is no exception. It has in fact become an international agricultural design, with agribusiness gaining strongholds over the food value chains across the globe, in reality their competitive strength depending on the huge subsidies received. In Europe, farming too is in a severe crisis despite an annual subsidy support of $100 billion, of which nearly half goes as direct income support. Low prices and mounting debt has gradually pushed small farmers out of business. In the UK, 3,000 dairy farms have closed down in the past four years. In France, a study had shown that nearly 500 farmers commit suicide on an average in a year.In India, 3.64 lakh farmers have officially committed suicide in the past 25 years as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics. Despite 94 per cent farmers being dependent on markets all these years (as per the Shanta Kumar committee report), Indian agriculture is still in the throes of a terrible agrarian distress. Interestingly, an NSSO report in 2014-15 had shown that nearly 54 to 84 per cent farmers (depending on crops) in the kharif marketing season had sold their produce outside the mandis to private traders. In other words, farmers had the freedom to sell anywhere. They were not in the clutches of the mandis. The question therefore that needs to be asked is if markets were so efficient, why should farmers be increasingly abandoning agriculture and migrating to the cities. If markets were so benevolent, there is no reason why agriculture shouldn’t have been the engine of economic growth.But this is how markets operate, pushing people away from agriculture primarily to provide cheap workforce for the industry. The big get bigger in the process and the small go out. For India, the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has a similar proposition — ‘move up or move out’. For several decades, mainline economists in India had been arguing on similar lines. Numerous committees and reports had pointed to the need to move towards market-friendly agriculture. Minimum Support Price (MSP) was named the culprit, coming in the way of real price discovery. In one form or the other, the emphasis had been on dismantling the vast network of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)-regulated mandis in Punjab and Haryana.To strengthen the argument, even the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) had come out with a table ranking states in terms of market-friendliness. Bihar topped the chart, and Punjab was at the bottom.Punjab brings up the rear because 87 per cent of wheat and rice (as per CACP) is procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) or by public sector agencies on its behalf at a guaranteed MSP. In Bihar, less than 1 per cent of the wheat harvest is procured. If this is market-friendliness, economists need to explain what is so good about it. In Punjab and Haryana, comprising the food bowl, farmers receive Rs 80,000 crore a year by way of price support. As far as I can remember, barring a few instances, farmers have not received a price higher than the MSP in open markets. Market prices have always remained lower than the MSP announced for wheat and paddy, the two crops that are being procured. Similarly, for the 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, open market prices have generally been lower.The real price discovery for farmers is by MSP only. The need therefore is to make MSP a legal right for farmers and ensure that no trading takes place below the MSP, not only for wheat and paddy but for all the 23 crops for which MSP is announced.Although the government says MSP and APMC markets will remain intact under the new marketing reforms being ushered in, farmers fear that APMC mandis will gradually become redundant. With APMC markets heading towards a collapse, the new set of reforms is aimed at encouraging corporatisation of agriculture, with big business moving into agriculture, storage and marketing. As the experience of US/Europe shows, when unregulated markets become dominant, small farmers are the first to be pushed out of agriculture. Given that 86 per cent farmers have less than five acres of land holdings, the message is clear: get big or get out.
24-09-2020||---||It’s not just about the farmer||The situation following the enactment of the three ordinances passed by the Centre has created a political problem as well as somewhat of a dilemma for many economists. There is the fairly common assumption by many economists that free functioning of markets is a more efficient way of letting prices and choices function than relying too heavily on the government. Other economists, however, have always pointed out that whatever the merits of the markets, when these fail, the government intervention is not only desirable but also often necessary. In the present situation, the debate is around three issues: the first, the application of the Essential Commodities Act; the second, the functioning and reach of the APMC; and the third, the functioning of contract farming.These issues are not new, and nor are the debates. Since about 2000, the Centre has been trying to put in place reforms which would do whatever is necessary to have more orderly agricultural markets, and this is a process which has continued irrespective of the parties in power. While clubbing the teeth of the Essential Commodities Act, reforming APMCs and encouraging contract farming have been the objectives, with the Central governments bringing out model enactments at various points and holding discussions with the states, there has been very limited progress on the ground.The present hurried enactment of the ordinances reflects a belief that somehow a process which had not yielded full fruit for 20 years could be done through a rushed enactment. This attitude is in itself a major change in the way the Centre is now dealing with the states, because agricultural marketing, like agriculture on the whole, is a State subject. The recourse that the Centre has taken in the matter of agricultural marketing is to the provision in the Constitution that the Centre can intervene in matters of inter-state trade. This has been known for some time, but the way in which this is being imposed is the true matter for debate.For agricultural markets as a whole, it is useful to distinguish between crops such as fruits and vegetables that are not covered by the MSP system, and those such as rice and wheat that are. Many states in response to efforts to reform the APMCs had either relaxed APMC regulations on such perishable commodities, or even allowed marketing outside APMCs, while retaining the APMC functioning on grains and oilseeds and less perishable crops. The main thrust in the 20 years leading up to now has been one of creating an economy where high-value crops, mainly fruits and vegetables, can be given a chance to grow and thrive by attracting new players into the market, such as large retailers and food processors.It was recognised that for certain other crops, mainly rice and wheat, the market was very strongly affected by what decisions were taken by the Centre on MSP and PDS purchases, and hence it was not possible to assume that markets would function freely. The present Acts seem to have dropped these distinctions, although the Centre has been quick to say that the MSP will continue to function. The Opposition, on the other hand, suspects that the MSP system may be under threat. States such as Punjab and Haryana, which were at the forefront of the Green Revolution, and till very recently, the main suppliers to the PDS, are understandably among the most concerned. The issue is not only that most farmers grow rice and wheat and sell it at MSP, but also that the functioning of many markets in these states depends upon MSP operations.For example, Punjab receives by way of mandi charges a very substantial fraction of the cost borne by the Centre in the purchase of rice and wheat at MSP. Any winding up of MSP, or even if MSP operations are taken out of the APMCs, could have a large impact on the total flow of funds from the Centre to the state. This is a danger, which although not expressed clearly so far, exists because one of the things enabled by the new Act is that the FCI, for example, could function outside an APMC, and as a direct purchaser for distribution to other states, it need not pay any market charges at all in Punjab. In other words, for states like Punjab and Haryana, the matter is beyond simply what concerns farmers, but also the fiscal relationship between the Centre and the state. The matter should have been discussed before the ordinances were issued, or at least before the enactment was put to Parliament.Punjab and Haryana farmers are clearly very concerned about what might happen to the system which they know so well, and which has paid them quite handsomely. The protests are related to this concern, and to the fact that in Punjab, for example, both the ruling and the Opposition party are united against the Central action. Nonetheless, from the point of view of economics, it must be remembered that one of the major issues that has been discussed over the years is that Punjab, especially, is paying a very large cost in terms of falling water table and other environmental problems that arise from too great a dependence on the rice-wheat cycle. Proponents of the Act would point to the fact that by liberalising trade in all other commodities, Punjab and Haryana farmers would be able to grow rice and wheat, if they wanted, but they might have better choices as a result of investment by the private sector, in view of larger and stable demand for high-value crops. These are precisely the issues which have been debated over the last 20 years and ramrodding important matters deserving of concern does not do justice to the sense of good federalism.
