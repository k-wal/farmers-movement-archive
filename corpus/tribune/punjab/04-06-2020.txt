He said that the vow was taken after several NGOs and institutions, which were providing food to the needy amid lockdown, withdrew their services.‡§ú‡§ø‡§® ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§ö‡§≤‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§§‡•à‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç... ‡§µ‡§π‡§æ‡§Å ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§¶‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ñ ‡§™‡§π‡•Å‡§Å‡§ö ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç üôèüèªLangar on Wheels initiative of Gurdwara Sri Bangla Sahib serving thousands of people everyday in different parts of New Delhi. pic.twitter.com/8i7EPApBjM  The Committee President added that the initiative has been started for one month but will be extended from time-to-time till the economic activities are restored and disadvantaged people are able to sustain themselves.The Committee will remain in touch with the Sikh leaders, government officials and resident welfare associations of the respective areas to gauge the demand of the food. He added that additional food will be rushed to any place if the demand escalates.Vans with banners highlighting food and water arrangements for needy persons will also be stationed at different places like railway stations and bus stands. Those in need will be served 'langar' at a convenient place with social distancing.Harmeet Singh Kalka, General Secretary of the committee, said that the decision to start 'Langar on Wheels' has been taken as it was 'impractical' for most of the poor people to find the nearest Gurdwara. "Now, we have decided to go where the people are."The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had earlier launched a similar community kitchen initiative for migrant labourers at around ten locations in the national capital region.

He claimed that the Akali Dal had consistently fought for autonomy to the states. Referring to Centre‚Äôs recent announcement to virtually do away with the state agricultural marketing produce legislation, he said any intervention by the Centre would tantamount to encroachment on the rights of the states. The move was skewed against the farmers in general and Punjab in particular whose contribution to the country‚Äôs food security continued to be the highest. The stand by Chandumajra is set to ruffle many feathers in the SAD-BJP. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar had recently slammed the Akalis on the issue of reports of withdrawing free power facility to farmer. The two leaders had said that the Centre was forcing many anti-farmer policies on the state, but no Akali leader had questioned its decisions. Chandumajra said of late, the governance model being implemented by the Centre was exhibiting tendency towards centralisation and weakening the powers of the states and the move to amend the marketing produce Act was its latest manifestation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akali-ex-mp-slams-move-to-dilute-state-powers-94057

Besides, over 95 per cent of the 47 Covid deaths in the state have occurred in patients who had co-morbidities, mainly those afflicted with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes.‚ÄòDeath rate under control‚ÄôI hope the study will play a key role in saving the lives of patients who are suffering from various chronic diseases. We have so far been successful in controlling the death rate. ‚Äî Balbir Singh Sidhu, Health MinisterThese are some of the findings of a study being undertaken by the Health Department in association with Dr Rajesh Kumar, a public health specialist and epidemiologist at the PGI. The study is being undertaken after analysing the patient history of all nearly 2,300 Covid patients in the state.The department started monitoring the patient data to analyse the progression of the pandemic after the total cases crossed 2,000. The study includes the analysis of patients who are worst affected, their age group, co-morbid conditions in patients cutting across different age groups and the recovery of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases as well as serious cases. The study is also analysing how the population of the state as a whole reacts to the spread of the pandemic, as the patients are living in similar environmental conditions.‚ÄúThis will help us classify patients as pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, mild, medium and severe cases, study the outcome of treatment in each and then formulate our plans for medical intervention,‚Äù a senior health officer told The Tribune. The study, so far, is not analysing the samples of those found positive posthumously.As the number of cases rise, the study is also helping the state formalise its preparedness to deal with the pandemic. Though the number of oxygen beds as of now is around 600, the department is all set to ensure oxygen supply network in all 22 district hospitals and in some of the big government-run sub-divisional hospitals. ‚ÄòWe are adding more beds with oxygen facility to deal with any eventuality as the disease progresses,‚Äù said a senior functionary.Health officials say other than following guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), they are also following the international guidelines. Though the state is mostly testing those persons who came in contact with the positive cases, the department says this will be tweaked further to test only those asymptomatic contacts of patients who had been in touch over the past 10 days. ‚ÄúFor people who come from outside the state, the diagnosis and surveillance would, however, be much stringent,‚Äù said the official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/90-patients-asymptomatic-punjab-health-department-94064

04-06-2020||Karam Prakash||Lakhs working, but few registered under migrant Act||Tribune News ServicePatiala, June 3During the nationwide lockdown, over 12 lakh migrant labourers gave their names to the government to return to their states. Ironically, the state Labour Department did not have the record of the labourers.Despite the Inter-state Migrant Workmen Act in force, none of the migrant labourers have been registered as per the law by the department.According to the Act, every establishment, which employs five or more inter-state migrant workers or had employed such workers on any day of the preceding 12 months, has to register them with the department.At present, only 10 companies are registered under the Act in the state. However, the number of migrant labourers in the companies is not clear.Over the years, the Act has remained a ‚Äònon-starter‚Äô despite 20 lakh migrant labourers working in 2,52,741 industrial units and 2,800 brick kilns in the state.VK Janjua, Principal Secretary, Labour Department, said, ‚ÄúThe Act has always remained a non-starter in the state. The reason is that the contractor has to register himself before submitting the names of migrant labourers. Secondly, the contractor or employer has to inform the department of the workers‚Äô domicile before hiring. This makes the process a tedious one.‚Äù He said 10 companies were registered under the Act in the state.The Inter-state Migrant Workmen Act stipulates a journey allowance for the workers from the place of work to the residence in his domicile state. The allowance is to be paid by the contractor. During the time of the journey, the workers are to be considered on duty.Experts said had the migrant labourers been registered, the government could have provided relief material and financial help, and averted the exodus. Notably, the government had to direct the Deputy Commissioners to register migrant labourers so that food and relief material could be provided to them during the lockdown.Vijay Walia, an activist, said, ‚ÄúThe Labour Department could not register the workers because employers didn‚Äôt provide the information. Despite negligence from the employers‚Äô end, the department didn‚Äôt take any action against them for failing to provide the details.‚Äù||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lakhs-working-but-few-registered-under-migrant-act-94067

Amicus Curiae PS Hundal and respondent-contemnor‚Äôs advocate Rajvinder Singh Bains were present during the proceedings before the Bench of Justice Jawant Singh and Justice Sant Parkash.

His contentions, including claim that circulation by way of YouTube did not amount to publication and whether the act amounted to scandalising the judicial system, were moot questions which could be answered only after evidence and evaluation of submissionsThe first charge read: ‚ÄúYou have made a ‚ÄòYouTube‚Äô account titled ‚ÄòUgly face of Indian Judiciary, Ludhiana‚Äô and uploaded videos lambasting judicial officers by levelling false allegations and conveyed wrong message to the public and discouraged the public from getting justice from the Court of Law‚Äù.
