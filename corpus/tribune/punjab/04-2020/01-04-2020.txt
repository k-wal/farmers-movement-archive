The agency said it has registered the case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and under the provisions of Section 6 (8) of the NIA Act and started an investigation into the recent attack.On March 25, unknown gunmen had stormed into a Gurdwara in the Shor Bazar area in Kabul and fired indiscriminately, killing 27 devotees and injuring several others. An Indian citizen Tian Singh, a resident of Delhi's Greater Kailash Part-1, was also killed in the attack.About 150 persons were inside the Gurdwara when the attack took place. The proscribed terrorist organisation, Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), had claimed the responsibility for the attack.In an official statement the NIA said as per the preliminary investigation, one Muhsin from Trikkaripur, Kasargod, Kerala, and others who had joined ISKP, are suspected to have been involved in the attack.This is the first case of its kind which NIA has registered as the recent amendments in the NIA Act, which empowered the agency to investigate terror cases that are committed at any place outside India against the Indian citizens or affecting the interest of India.Sources said the NIA will immediately start with the technical part of the investigation as suspected suicide attacker Mushin’s family had received a message on Telegram from Islamic State, informing them of his death.Noting that in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, there may not be an immediate foreign travel, sources in the agency said the investigations will begin from India and in due course Afghanistan police and authorities would be contacted. “A team of NIA would be sent but it is not needed in these circumstances. And would be at a much later stage,” sources in the NIA said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nia-registers-case-to-investigate-kabul-gurdwara-attack-64179

The spread of Covid has hit the power sector badly with the 21-day lockdown estimated to cause roughly over Rs 500-crore loss.Already under losses, the PSPCL is suffering about Rs25 crore loss per day due to the steep fall in demand and fixed charges to be paid to private thermal plants despite not using the power produced by them.Sources said the PSPCL in its notice to three power generators of thermal plants at Talwandi Sabo, Rajpura and GVK besides biomass generators had stated that under force majure clause 12 of the PPA between PSPCL and thermal power generators, it will not be declaring its day-ahead scheduling under the grid code and for any power supply made during this period, no payment will not be made. A force majure notice can be given by either party within seven days of its occurrence of such conditions.The PSPCL will be saving Rs20 crore of fixed charges daily during the force majure period till normalcy is restored. As per the contract, the PSPCL is to pay fixed charges even if it does not purchase power due to any reason.PSPCL CMD Baldev Singh Sran said, “The savings will help save our state residents from bearing additional cost of power.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-fixed-charges-for-3-private-plants-63708

Many of them are finding new ways to go back, by telling lies to the authorities or going against the system/guidelines.Pintu, who works in a factory in Industrial Area A, said it was not possible for migrants to stay back here as their families were getting panicky and everybody wanted to be together in such times.“One of my fellow workers arranged for an ambulance from the Janakpuri area and some persons were taken into confidence. Five or six persons were able to reach their village in UP and they were stopped just once by the police at a naka in Haryana. Together, they paid Rs 9,500. We are also trying to arrange some vehicle like this,” he said, adding many “middle-men” were taking back migrants to their respective villages.Another migrant said even today, long queues of migrants were seen outside the railway station, which meant that they were still going back to their villages.Sargun, another migrant working at a brick-kiln, said the kiln is shut and he did not have any work.“I don’t have a single penny. Even if I have to go on foot to my village in Hardoi district (Uttar Pardesh), I will do so. I am convincing a few other labourers of the same village to accompany me. I feel suffocated here,” he said in a choked voice.3 held for ferrying people from GujaratAbohar: The police in Hanumangarh arrested three drivers for ferrying 72 Punjabis from Gujarat without permission during the lockdown.

Afterwards, no one bothered again. The police do not let us go to the Golden Temple where we can at least get food,” he said.Similarly, Jai Ram, who hails from Banka district, is putting up in Gali No. 7, Karampura. He said along with him, around 40 persons from Bihar were living in the locality.

They gave us ration that could last for not more than a day. We urge the administration to facilitate us in reaching our villages where our families will take care of us.”Migrants safe, Capt tells Bihar CMChief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh spoke to his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar and apprised him of the arrangements being made for migrants from Bihar. Captain Amarinder also asked Nitish to assure the families of these migrants back in Bihar that they were being fully looked after by Punjab and its people during these testing times.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/migrants-struggle-for-food-shelter-as-punjab-seals-borders-63707
