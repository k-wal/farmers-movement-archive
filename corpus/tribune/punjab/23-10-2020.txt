He was then asked to explain the alleged movement of funds to Switzerland and creation of Jacaranda Trust and a few subsidiaries in British Virgin Islands.The ED summons have come at a time when its officials had sought to inspect the I-T files in three cases against him and the CM through an application on September 14, 2020. Though the inspection was initially allowed, it was later stopped after Raninder submitted a revised petition saying that the ED had no locus standi since it had not served any notice to him.Raninder's lawyer Jaiveer Shergill said, “We will examine the summons and accordingly put up our case”.Questioning the timing of the summons, Congress leaders said, “These might have come now probably because of the tough stand that Captain Amarinder has taken against the Centre over the farm Acts.”

23-10-2020||Mansa||Stubble burning: 25 FIRs registered in Mansa; farmers demand immediate cancellation||The Mansa police have registered around 25 FIRs till date for burning paddy stubble, and violating the orders of the Deputy Magistrate in the district.Farmers are fuming over this action, and have demanded immediate cancellation of the FIRs.Senior Superintendent of Police, Mansa, Surender Lamba said: "They are taking strict action against the erring farmers, who are polluting the environment, by burning the stubble in the field, and so far, they have registered 25 FIRs pertaining to stubble burning in the district, and violating the district magistrate orders".Most FIRs have been registered against unidentified farmers, and under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.Farmers said that they acknowledge the adverse effects of crops residue, but they have no alternative—even as the environmentalists demand a strict ban.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), Ekta Ugrahan, state secretary, Shingara Singh Mann claimed, that this is 'double-standard' of the state government, since, on one hand, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh during meetings assure them, that no case would be registered against farmers, and even old cases, pertaining to stubble burning would be cancelled, instead, the police are registering cases against farmers, which is completely wrong, and intolerable.He added, that the government has not made any arrangements to handle the situation and farmers cannot afford to manage the expenses of stubble, and a large number of farmers have not received compensation of Rs 2,500 per acre, which was announced by the state government last year for not burning the stubble.BKU, Ekta Ugrahan, Mansa district, president Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha said: "The state government is doing wrong by registering cases against the farmers over the burning of stubble and like last year, they would fight with the government over this issue".He also warned, that if police try to arrest the farmers in any of these cases, then they would 'gherao' the concerned police station. He demanded, that the cancellation of the cases, and further, that no such case to be registered.Punjab government and state government have been asking farmers to not burn stubble as it not only adversely affects the soil fertility but also leads to several health ailments.With 75% of the 19.7 million tonnes of paddy straw generated in Punjab every year, the problem has taken dangerous proportions, leading to loss of organic material for soil, degradation of air quality and high SPM level.These incidents of stubble burning have been captured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite in the satellite image by the PPCB.These were based on the longitude and latitude measurements.The PPCB takes the help of satellite imaging for the identification of sites where the stubble is set on fire.After receiving the images of stubble burning through the remote sensing technique, a team is sent to the spot to ascertain the area of the land on which the stubble has been set on fire, after which it sends its report to the administration, on which action is taken.Burning of stubble also leads to a rise in air pollution and precipitates numerous ailments associated with the respiratory tract.The number of patients complaining of such ailments is on the rise in various hospitals in and around the city.Stubble burning not only affects the soil fertility resulting in loss of essential nutrients but also poses a serious threat to human health, including diseases such as breathing problems, allergies and asthma attacks.The crop residue burning also depletes the red blood cell (RBC) count and adversely affects the oxygen-carrying capacity in the body.
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Won’t let BJP succeed in its vicious agenda to divide Punjab’s people on caste lines: Capt Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday charged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with trying to divide the society on caste lines to promote their political interests, and asserted that he would not allow them to impose their vicious agenda on the state.“I will not let them disturb the peaceful atmosphere of Punjab at any cost,” the chief minister said, pointing to the BJP’s futile attempt to take out a so-called ‘Dalit Insaf Yatra’ yesterday without taking due permissions.These divisive tactics will never succeed in Punjab, whose people are happily living together for their collective progress, he added.The BJP, said Capt Amarinder, had no moral right to talk about Dalit rights, which they had been brazenly trampling wherever they were in power.He pointed to the shocking statistics that showed that Uttar Pradesh, under BJP rule, accounts for over 25 per cent of the total cases of atrocities against SC people in the country, and had recorded the highest number of such incidents in 2018.“Is this your definition of justice for Dalits? Is this what you are offering the SC people of Punjab?” he asked the BJP.The chief minister said the BJP, finding itself totally cornered over the draconian, anti-farmer and unconstitutional farm laws, was indulging in theatrics and propaganda with the sole motive of diverting public attention.The fact is that the party has completely failed the farmers and also the SC students, whom its national leadership had deprived of access to higher education by abruptly withdrawing from the central post-matric scholarship scheme, he said.Capt Amarinder attributed the BJP’s attempted rally to the fact that it was clearly rattled over the state government’s successful launch of its own scholarship scheme for SC students.Despite suffering Rs 800 crore in losses due to the anti-Dalit decision of the BJP-led Union government, the cash-strapped Punjab government had not only introduced a new scheme — B R Ambedkar SC Post-Matric Scholarship — for SC students but even expanded its ambit to benefit more youngsters, he pointed out, adding that the BJP clearly could not digest this.Bereft of any justification for its anti-people acts, the BJP was now resorting to the ‘divide and rule’ tactics which the British had used to keep the people of India in shackles for nearly a century, Capt Amarinder said.He, however, warned that today’s India was not the India of the 19th century, and the BJP would never succeed in its divisive politics.“We Punjabis will sacrifice anything, as we did during the freedom struggle, to protect our unity and integrity, which forms the ethos of the Indian Constitution,” the chief minister said, warning the BJP against continuing with its dangerous and reckless agenda.The people of Punjab will not be taken in by your theatrics, he told the BJP, which currently has only two MLAs in the state assembly.

23-10-2020||GS Paul||26 trucks carrying paddy from Uttar Pradesh intercepted by farmers in Amritsar||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, October 22In the past 24 hours, at least 26 trucks carrying paddy from Uttar Pradesh have been intercepted by farmers protesting in Amritsar. It seems the paddy bags from Aligarh, Bulandshahr and Sitarganj were to be delivered to rice shellers in Amritsar and Tarn Taran.The farmers got suspicious when one of the truck drivers stopped to enquire about a local mill, said Dilbagh Singh, the sarpanch of Rajewala village.“The police must book the suppliers as well as mill owners who ordered the consignment,” he demanded.Complaining that he had yet to find buyers for the 1509 variety of paddy lying at his home, he said he smelled a plot to destroy Punjab’s mandi system. “While in UP paddy is being purchased at  Rs 900-1200 per quintal, the rate in Amritsar is between Rs 1,788 and Rs 1,888 per quintal,” said farmer Harjit Singh.Santosh Kumar, one of the drivers, said neither the firms in Aligarh nor the mills here were responding to his phone calls. “It seems we are stuck here,” he added anxiously.
23-10-2020||---||SAD rejects Punjab farm Bills||Chandigarh, October 22Making a U-turn, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) today rejected the Bills passed by the Punjab Assembly to block the Centre’s farm laws, claiming that the legislators had been misled. The Akali MLAs had supported the Bills in the House and were part of the CM-led delegation that handed these over to the Governor.The SAD had initially backed the Centre’s farm ordinances, but later snapped ties with the BJP, saying the government had reneged on its promise to include the amendments suggested by it in the final draft.Sukhbir Badal, SAD PresidentMLAS misled,CM betrayed HouseCopies of the Bills were provided to the legislators just before the Bills were tabled. They had no time to read these carefully... The Chief Minister has misled and betrayed the House.Addressing the media after the party’s core committee meeting here, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal alleged that Capt Amarinder Singh had misled the Opposition while reading out a resolution that the Bills brought by his government “rejected” the Central laws. “Copies of the Bills were provided to the legislators just before the Bills were tabled in the Assembly. They had no time to read these carefully. We have now rejected the Bills after going through the details,” he said, adding that if voted to power, SAD would block the Centre’s “anti-farmer” laws by declaring Punjab as Principal Market Area and repealing the APMC Act enacted by the Amarinder government. “The resolution, unanimously passed by the Vidhan Sabha, had outrightly rejected the Centre’s farm laws.It stated that the Punjab Government was committed to declaring the entire state as Principal Market Area. It also rejected the APMC Act of 2017. But the Bills subsequently brought by the Amarinder government carried none of these provisions. The CM has misled and betrayed the House,” Sukhbir alleged.Stressing that Punjab farmers were the backbone of the state, he said: “We have been demanding that the MSP regime must cover all 22 listed crops. When the SAD forms government, we will ensure that this is done.”
23-10-2020||Kuldip BhatiaLudhiana||Punjab drawing 2,000 MW from Central pool||Nearly a month-long ‘rail roko’ by farmers over the new farm laws has obstructed the coal supply to the state-owned and private thermal plants hence severely affecting power production in Punjab.With the deadlock between the agitating farmers and government continuing, resumption of goods and passenger trains looks a remote possibility. However, the only saving grace is the drop in the demand for electricity from the agriculture and domestic sectors.With the total demand dropping to around 6,200 MW today, the power generation from the state’s own sources stood at just about 1,700 MW, including 740 MW from the state-owned and private thermal plants, 450 MW from the hydel projects and 500 MW from renewable energy sources. “The state is drawing nearly 2,000 MW from the Central pool from its allocation. The remaining demand is being met by purchasing power,” said DIS Grewal, Director Distribution, PSPCL.He said of the three state-owned thermal power plants, one unit each was operational at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat, providing nearly 430 MW power. Among the three private thermal plants at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and Goindwal, only one unit at Rajpura is generating some 335 MW power.“We have directed the thermal plants to use coal judiciously since the state can’t afford to shut all thermal power plants as it can create a crisis-like situation,” Grewal said. Sources said private players and middlemen in the power purchase sector were also making the most of the situation as suddenly the rates of electricity purchased from other sources had been jacked up by 25 to 40 paise per unit.“We are praying for the farmers’ stir to end and for the restoration of rail traffic in the region,” said a senior PSPCL official.
23-10-2020||Our CorrespondentFerozepur||Goods trains back on track from today||Following the decision of the farmers’ unions to allow the movement of goods train, around 12 trains will finally become operational from today in this division.Rajesh Aggarwal, Divisional Railway Manager, said: “Since farmers belonging to various outfits have lifted the blockade from 26 of 30 sites in the state, the decision to operate the goods trains has been taken.”The DRM added all tracks had been checked by the engineering department and even a drill had also been conducted by running a light engine from depot station last night to ensure safe movement of these trains.One goods train already moved from Ludhiana to Jammu today and the preparation for smooth operation of other trains is also complete.However, Satnam Singh Pannu, president, Kisan Majdoor Sangharsh Committee, said their ‘rail roko’ stir would continue at Devidass pura railway track in Amritsar till October 29. “We have lifted the blockade from Tankan Wali Basti Railway Crossing in Ferozepur,” he said.
23-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punsup official-trader  chat exposes nexus to sell outside paddy||The release of a purported chat between a Punsup district manager and a trader regarding allowing the sale of paddy bought at lower rates from other states to procurement agencies at the minimum support price (MSP) in Punjab, has exposed the misuse of the MSP system.Modus operandi show paddy procured from local farmersIt is then sold to government agencies at MSP of Rs1,888 per qunitalSome traders buy paddy at Rs 1,100-Rs 1,200 per quintal from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Later, they transport it to Punjab. After tying up with officials in mandis, procurement agencies and commission agents, they fake records to show the paddy was procured from local farmers. This is then sold to government agencies at the MSP of Rs 1,888 per qunital.In the viral chat, the Punsup official at Patiala and the trader discuss how much he should be paid by the commission agent for allowing the entry of paddy in the mandi. In the chat, they purportedly talk of having an inspector of the agents’ choice posted in the Patiala mandi. The Punsup official also “negotiates the bribe” with the trader, saying it has to be shared with a minister and for organising the visit of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Gandhi had visited the state earlier this month. The chat reportedly is of October 4.Since the chat went viral, Food and Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has suspended the official and proceedings to dismiss him from service have been initiated. Denying any role in the controversy, the minister claimed that his name was being misused. “The moment I learnt of it, I suspended the official, showing zero tolerance for such acts,” he said. The suspended official has also approached the Patiala police, alleging that the chat was fake.Sources in the Food and Supplies Department and Punsup said the practice of buying cheaper paddy from other states and selling it to government agencies here had been going on for quite some time.“No wonder, the paddy bought in Punjab in each procurement season is more than the paddy produced in the state. Last year, 11.82 lakh tonnes of paddy, over and above the production of 152 lakh metric tonnes was procured by government agencies,” said an official in Punsup KAP Sinha, Principal Secretary, Food and Supplies, said the department had asked the police to register cases if they find illegal trucks carrying paddy from outside the state, to be sold in mandis here.“Around 200 trucks have been seized and action initiated against unscrupulous dealers, while a similar number of trucks are being examined. I have written to all district managers to keep a strict vigil and seek police help wherever an anomaly is detected,” he said.

Bajwa is one of the contenders for the party state president post, though Rawat has denied any move to replace Jakhar.During the recent visit of party former president Rahul Gandhi to the state, Bajwa had not only shared stage with Capt Amarinder Singh but also attended the lunch hosted by him.Sources said efforts to bridge the gap between the Chief Minister and Sidhu had started showing results, as was visible during the Vidhan Sabha session. A formal meeting between the two was being worked out by Rawat on the insistence of the party high command. On being asked about appointment ofparty’s firebrand leader Sidhu as Punjab Pardesh Congress Committee president or a Cabinet Minister, Rawat said it was a media speculation.
23-10-2020||New Delhi||It’s arhtiyas, not farmers’  protest: JP Nadda to CM Punjab||BJP president JP Nadda today slammed Capt Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and those “instigating” farmers in Punjab.He said the ongoing agitation in the state was “not of farmers but middlemen”. “Farmers in Punjab are not even allowed to choose their ‘arhtiya’, the BJP president said, addressing a group farmers from the Delhi region at the party headquarters.“It is because of monopoly of some people in the ‘mandis’ that farmers have to sell their produce at a price lower than market rate,” he said.Slamming the Congress, which is leading the agitation in Punjab and has also passed three farm Bills, Nadda said a “well-educated” person like Amarinder Singh is saying that MSP should be mentioned in the Act whereas he knows very well that it is always implemented via an executive order.Nadda accused the Congress of “fueling agitation because they know nothing except politics”. — TNS

He visits such protest sites just to send out a message that farmers are not alone in their fight for their rights,” Pritam Singh, son of Inder Singh, said.Pritam Singh recently underwent a surgery but that doesn’t deter him to extend support to thousands of farmers who have been protesting day and night against the farm laws, besides fighting their own personal problems.Kirpal Singh from Moosapur village has a paralysed wife and a 91-year-old mother at home, but he has not missed the protest even for a day. “I am the only one to look after my family. My attention is divided. I am concerned about my mother and wife and my fields. My son lives abroad as I never wanted him to take up farming because of the current scenario. But we will fight on till we secure our community’s future,” he says.Manwinder Singh from a Hoshiarpur village is a young farmer, who received a phone call from his relatives a few days ago that his father had suffered a heart attack. He immediately left for his home. After meeting his father, he was back to protest the next day.

23-10-2020||Amritsar||Most farm fires in Amritsar, Tarn Taran||The two districts in Majha region, Amritsar and Tarn Taran, have reported the maximum number of stubble burning incidents during the ongoing paddy harvesting season in the state at 1,657 and 2,086, respectively.The figures clearly indicate at the extent of violation of the ban on burning crop residue in fields. However, officials reasoned that figures were high (in comparison to other districts) as harvesting of paddy began early in Majha as compared to Malwa and Doaba. They added that the final figures after the harvesting is over in the entire state would give a clear picture.Employees of the Agriculture Department claimed that the ongoing protest against the farm Acts had emboldened the farmers. “The farmers know that it will be hard for the government to take strict action against them amid the ongoing protest,” said an official of the Agriculture Department.Also, the figures bring attention to the fact that the government’s endeavour of providing machines on subsidy to farmers as an alternative way to manage crop residue seemed to have yielded no result.Jagjit Singh, a farmer, said, “Despite the claims of the government, it is difficult for the farmers, especially vegetable growers, to prepare fields without burning the residue.” He added that the farmers were reluctant because they would have to bear additional monetary burden if they went for alternative ways to manage crop residue.Tarn Taran Chief Agriculture Officer Kuljit Singh Saini, who also holds an additional charge for Amritar, said, “It’s too early to say that the two districts have reported more fire incidents. In other districts, the harvesting is going at a slow pace as compared to Amritsar and Tarn Taran.”
