05-12-2020||---||Farmers’ agitation: Protest sites named after historic personalities||New Delhi, December 5BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has nominated five protest sites after the names of historical personalities representing the legacy of struggles leading up to the ongoing agitation against farm Bills passed by the Modi government.The protest site spread over kilometres have been divided into cities named after these personalities – Baba Banda Singh Nagar, Chacha Ajit Singh Nagar, Bibi Gulab Kaur Nagar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura Nagar.Shingara Singh Mann, general secretary of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), and Harinder Kaur Bindu shared the whole information with the press and the logic behind these names.They shared that a press gallery had been established and named as Shaheed Ashfaq Ullah Khan press gallery.They shared that Baba Banda Singh Bahadar was a great hero of farmers as he gave land entitlements to the tillers after an intense fight against the rulers.Mann stated that Chacha Ajit Singh was the founder of glorious anti-imperialist movement ‘Paghdi Sambhal Jatta’, which remains an inspiration for the struggling masses.He further said Gadri Gulab Kaur was great inspiration as she was part of anti-imperialist movement.The women protesters represent the continuity of Gadri Gulab Kaur, Mann said.Harinder Bindu, meanwhile, said that Shaheed Bhagat Singh imagined a society free of exploitation and oppression, and became Shaheed-e-Azam and was an inspiration for the ongoing agitation.His images inspire farmers, workers, women and youth, said Bindu.Bindu further said that Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura was leading light for the struggling masses.Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura was assassinated by land mafia patronised by BJP-SAD. Takhtupura was a leader of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) fighting against land mafia and his martyrdom motivated the organisation to build mass movements on people’s issues, said Bindu.The leaders explained that the sites named after these legendary personalities manifest the progressive and secular character of the ongoing agitation against farm laws.The ongoing movement is in continuity with the glorious history created by struggling masses and that history inspires farmers, workers, women and youth to struggle against the injustice, they said.The duo remained confident that the ongoing movement would carry the people’s history forward and emerge victorious.
05-12-2020||Chandigarh||Former sportspersons from Punjab to return awards in support of farmers' agitation on Sunday||Several former sportspersons from Punjab, including Padma Shri and Arjuna awardees, left for Delhi on Saturday to return their awards in support of the farmers' protest against the Centre's three agriculture reform laws.They will join the farmers camping at the national capital's Singhu border on Saturday before returning their awards to the President the next day.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at five Delhi gateways for the past nine days to press their demand for a repeal of the recently enacted farm laws."We have left for Delhi today and will join the farmers' protest," said former wrestler Kartar Singh, who is a Padma Shri and Arjuna awardee."Many former players like Sajjan Singh Cheema who could not join us because of health or other issues have given their sports awards to us," he said.The sportspersons said they had sought time from President Ram Nath Kovind to return the awards."If we are not allotted time to meet the President, we will place our awards outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Sunday," said former hockey player Rajbir Kaur.Other former sportspersons who are headed to the national capital are Dhyan Chand awardee hockey Olympian Gurmail Singh, Arjuna awardee Kabaddi player Hardeep Singh, and Arjuna awardee weightlifter Tara Singh.On Friday, former national boxing coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu, during whose tenure India won its maiden Olympic medal in the sport, Padma Shri boxer Kaur Singh and Arjuna awardee boxer Jaipal Singh had announced that they would return their awards.Enacted in September, the three farm laws are anticipated to bring "reforms" in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop.The government is holding talks with farmers, who have called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to occupy toll plazas.

05-12-2020||Kolkata||Farmers’ agitation: SAD leader Chandumajra meets TMC leaders in Kolkata||Representatives of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday met senior leaders of West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) here in a bid to unite various regional parties of the country to lend support to the farmers agitating against the farm Bills passed by the Modi government.A SAD team led by the party’s senior vice president Prem Singh Chandumajra had a meeting with Sudip Chattopadhyay and Derek O’Brien, leaders of TMC at Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, respectively, at the Trinamool Bhavan here in this connection.Later, talking to media persons, Chandumajra said the protests at Delhi-Haryana border, though spearheaded by farmers, had started getting support from all sections of the society.Similarly, though the movement had started from Punjab, its appeal had spread far and wide. The message sent out by the agitation had even travelled beyond the border as the remarks by the Canadian Prime Minister had shown, Chandumajra said.The SAD leader, who revealed that he had a telephonic conversation with West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee two days back, said it was time that political parties also threw their weight behind the agitating farmers.The former Anandpur Sahib MP said the farm Bills, besides paving the way for corporatisation of agriculture, also amounted to an assault on federalism since agriculture was a state subject.The loss of the mandi fees or taxes as envisaged by the Bills was bound to upset states, he said.Noting that the SAD led by Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal was a pioneer among the regional parties, Chandumajra said Mamata Banerjee was a premier leader of a regional party.The SAD senior vice president said he would meet the leaders of other regional parties also to mobilise support.This would be followed by a meeting of representatives of various regional parties in Delhi to draw up a strategy to strengthen the ongoing agitation by farmers. The proposed meeting in Delhi would take place sometime in the middle of December, Chandumajra said.TMC leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said if the Central government really wanted to retain the system of grain procurement by state agencies, there ought to have been mention of MSP in the farm Bills. He said the Bills should be withdrawn or sent to standing committee or a select committee of Parliament.On the Bharat bandh on December 8 called by the agitators, Bandopadhyay said while TMC would extend moral support to the call, its volunteers would not take part in enforcing it. Mamata Banerjee has already announced that she is wholly supporting the agitation by farmers.

We will continue to raise the voice of farmers' rights in the same way.Baksheesh Singh Jamnia said, that if needed, hundreds of people from Abohar will also go to Delhi in support of the farmers. If they had to send ration, water to the farmers, none would back down.Davinder Singh said, that actress Kangana Ranaut's derogatory tweets about the elderly mother Mohinder Kaur were widely condemned globally but instead of offering an unconditional apology, she was abusing Punjabi artists and stars who took exception to her wrongdoing.Being a woman, Kangana should have refrained from uploading objectionable messages which have hurt sentiments of Punjabis across the world, he added. More effigies will be burnt if the actor does not express regrets, he concluded.Sohan Singh Fauji said, that the farmer is called Annadata. Due to them, the entire world gets a lot of food. Therefore, everyone should support their legitimate stir.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Gippy Grewal ‘disappointed’ at Bollywood's 'lack of support' for farmers||Punjab star Gippy Grewal on Saturday criticised Bollywood for not standing up for Punjab at a time when the state needs their support for the ongoing farmers' protest.Thousands of farmers from Haryana, Punjab, and other states held demonstrations for the ninth consecutive day at Delhi's border points,  protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.Rupinder Singh Grewal, popular by his stage name Gippy Grewal, took to Twitter and wrote that for years Punjab had welcomed Bollywood with open arms but its silence over the issue was painful."Dear Bollywood, every now and then your movies have been shot in Punjab and every time you have been welcomed with open heart. But today when Punjab needs you the most, you didn't show up and speak a word. Disappointed," the 37-year-old singer tweeted. Singer Jaswinder Singh Bains, popularly known by his stage name Jazzy B, rallied behind Grewal. "People whose conscience is alive are coming out in support, not the ones whose conscience is dead," he tweeted.However, Bollywood actor Taapsee Pannu responded to Grewal, saying that there are artistes in Bollywood who have always been vocal about contentious issues, including the farmers' protests, and she found his generalised comment "demotivating". "Sir, just because the ones you expected to speak up did not please, don't put us all under the same umbrella. Not that the handful of us need validation regarding standing up but it really pulls down our efforts when disregarded,' the ‘Thappad’ star tweeted.Replying to the actor, Grewal said his tweet wasn't for Pannu and others who are supporting the farmers, but for those who call themselves Punjabi."My tweet was for them who call themselves from Punjab and not utter even a single word. They all vanish," the singer added.Several Bollywood stars, including Pannu, Swara Bhasker, Richa Chadha, Sonu Sood, Hansal Mehta, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Divya Dutta and Neha Sharma have come out in support of farmers.Agitating farmers on Friday announced a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on December 8, hardening their position ahead of the fifth round of talks with the government.

05-12-2020||London||36 UK MPs seek ministerial intervention in farmer protests in India||A group of 36 cross-party parliamentarians has written to UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asking him to make representations with his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, about the impact on British Punjabis affected by the demonstrations by farmers against new agricultural reforms in India.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as “ill-informed” and “unwarranted” as the matter pertained to the internal affairs of a democratic country.The letter, issued on Friday, has been drafted by British Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi and signed by other Indian-origin MPs including Labour’s Virendra Sharma, Seema Malhotra and Valerie Vaz as well as former Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the department has not received the letter as yet.“The police handling of protests is a matter for the government of India,” an FCDO spokesperson said. The letter from the parliamentarians urges the minister to set up an urgent meeting with them to discuss the “deteriorating situation in Punjab” and seeks an update on any communication the FCDO has had with the Indian government on the issue.“This is a joint letter calling for representation to be made by yourself to your Indian counterpart about the impact on British Sikhs and Punjabis, with longstanding links to land and farming in India,” reads the letter.“This is an issue of particular concern to Sikhs in the UK and those linked to Punjab, although it also heavily impacts on other Indian states. Many British Sikhs and Punjabis have taken this matter up with their MPs, as they are directly affected with family members and ancestral land in Punjab,” it reads.Reacting to the comments by the foreign leaders, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Tuesday said, “We have seen some ill-informed comments relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country.”              In a terse message, the ministry added that “it is also best that diplomatic conversations are not misrepresented for political purposes.”        The latest intervention by British MPs follows Dhesi and other politicians taking to social media to express support for the farmers. Lord Indarjit Singh, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, also raised the issue in the Upper House of Parliament earlier this week.The UK Cabinet Office minister responding in the House, Lord Nicholas True, refused to address a “broad denunciation” of any nation, adding: “Our values are democratic; they are very widely shared and practised across the world. We wish to sustain that.” PTI

05-12-2020||Washington||US Senate passes bill to name post office after slain Sikh police officer Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal||The US Senate has unanimously passed a legislation to name a post office in Houston after slain Sikh police officer Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal, who was gunned down in the line of duty during a routine traffic stop a year ago.The US House of Representatives had passed the bipartisan legislation in September to rename the post office at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston as ‘Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building’. The bill is now headed to the White House for it to sign into law by outgoing President Donald Trump.The post office named after Dhaliwal in Houston is only the second American post office named after an Indian-American. The first one was named after the first Indian-American Congressman Dalip Singh Saund in Southern California in 2006.The Senate also passed the bills to rename another US Postal Office located in Castroville, Texas as the ‘Lance Corporal Rhonald Dain Rairdan Post Office’.“The US Postal Office on Addicks Howell Road in Houston will now serve as a lasting tribute to Deputy Dhaliwal's trailblazing legacy for Sikh Americans and religious minorities in law enforcement, while the Post Office in Castroville will serve as a memorial to Lance Corporal Rairdan and his fellow soldiers who fell in the line of duty,” Senator Red Cruz said.“While we tragically lost both outstanding Americans far too soon, their memory will live on as we honour their many contributions to their country and community. I look forward to seeing President Trump swiftly sign these measures into law," Cruz said.Both Lance Corporal Rairdan and Deputy Dhaliwal exemplify the notion of putting their neighbours before themselves, said Senator John Cornyn.“It's important for us to recognise these heroes who have done so much for our community, and honouring them with a local post office is a great way to highlight their public service for future generations to come," he said.Born in India, Dhaliwal moved to the US along with his parents to Houston where he grew deep roots.In 2015, Dhaliwal of the Harris County Sheriff's office, became the first Sikh American in Texas to receive a policy accommodation to serve while wearing his articles of faith, including his turban and beard.He was the first Sikh police officer to serve in the Harris County Sheriff's Office and was a role model and trailblazer for Sikh Americans and religious minorities that sought to serve in law enforcement.On September 27, 2019, Deputy Dhaliwal was killed in the line of duty in service of his community.“Our family remains grateful for the outpouring of love and support in this effort to commemorate my son,” said Pyara Singh Dhaliwal, Deputy Dhaliwal's father.“This gesture will memorialise his legacy of service to his beloved Houston, while also reminding us all to uphold his example and celebrate the diversity that makes our and so many other communities strong,” he said.“We are very glad to see the Senate pass this important resolution and send it to the president's desk” said Sim J Singh, Sikh Coalition Senior Manager of Policy and Advocacy.“Signing this resolution into law and commemorating Deputy Dhaliwal in his city is an important way to affirm both his legacy and the fact that conscious efforts towards diversity and inclusion serve our communities well,” he added.

05-12-2020||Ravinder Saini & Mukesh Tandon||Protesting farmers refuse to undergo Covid test||Tribune News ServiceJhajjar/Sonepat, December 4Farmer leaders have categorically rejected a proposal of the district administration to conduct the Covid test of all those protesting at the Tikri-Bahadurgarh border for a week against the three farm laws.Their stance is: “Covid is not an ailment and we are not scared of it”.“Bahadurgarh SDM Hitendra Sharma has been informed of our decision. All we ask from him is to deploy teams of doctors at the dharna spot. It is necessary because the Bahadurgarh Civil Hospital is far from the protest site,” said Buta Singh, a farmer leader.Sources say the administration has built five medical booths at the dharna spot. A majority of farmers visiting the booths are suffering from fever, cough, cold and body pain. It is because of this reason that the administration had planned to conduct the Covid test of all protesters, they say.The Bahadurgarh SDM told The Tribune, “We held a meeting with farmers’ leaders and tried to convince them to undergo the Covid test, but they refused. Hence, we have decided to conduct the test of only those who will visit the medical booth complaining of fever and cough.”Meanwhile, the farmers’ agitation at the border entered the seventh day on Friday. The Delhi Police sealed the Bahadurgarh-Nijampur and Bahadurgarh-Jharoda borders, leaving commuters high and dry. They had to use alternative routes to reach their destinations in Delhi.Jhajjar DC Jitender Kumar said 19 Duty Magistrates and 20 nodal officers had been deputed at the dharna spot to maintain law and order.At a press conference held at the Singhu border in the evening, representatives of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) announced that they would step up the agitation.One of the farmers’ leaders, Harvinder Singh Lakhwal, said the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and those of corporates would be burnt on Saturday across the country. On December 7, retired Army personnel and award winners will return their awards in solidarity with the protesting farmers.

They have brought motorcycles to go to one point to another as the 10-km stretch between the Bahadurgarh bypass and Tikri border is jam-packed.“A cellphone is the only way to get updates about the agitation and directions from top leaders. Since we know there is no electricity connection at the dharna spot, we have arranged charging points in our vehicles. We charge cellphones and power banks at night from the tractor battery while the battery is charged by keeping the tractor on. This mechanism is being adopted by a majority of farmers,” said Jasprit Singh Walia, a farmer.Many farmers had been using electricity from poles on the highway to charge their cell phones and power banks. Amit Nain, a young farmer, said since the dharna spot was spread over 10 km, two vehicles were being used to update farmers about the latest developments.Magar Singh of Muktsar said the 10-km-long stretch from Bahadurgarh to the Tikri border was jam-packed with tractor-trailers and buses. “We are using two-wheelers not only to go from one point to another, but also to buy medicines, eatables and other essential items from Bahadurgarh,” he said.

Fearing that certain persons could try to defame their peaceful agitation, the leaders have asked their cadres to report any unknown elements found at the stir sitesJoginder Singh Ugrahan, president of the largest farmer union in Punjab, the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), while talking to The Tribune over the phone, said, “If the laws are so good, as the BJP propaganda machinery is trying to say, why not repeal them, get a wider public consensus, and then implement them again? The government knows that these laws will never get public support.”A number of activists and intellectuals are supporting them and guiding them in the course of negotiations with the Centre. As part of the stir, all sportspersons who have received government awards will be returning them to the Centre on December 7.“We will win this fight with the Centre. The laws threaten not just our livelihoods. They will hit the consumers hard as prices of all commodities will be dictated by the corporates, in whose control the Centre wants to hand over the farming operations. Thus, the Punjab model of gheraoing toll plazas operated by corporates across the country will be launched,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of the BKU (Dakaunda).

At least show some respect to those who refused to bow down before the Khalistani Kalashnikovs. - Harinder Kaur Bindu, farm activistHer father, communist leader Megh Raj Bhagtuana, was gunned down by the Babbar Khalsa when she was just 13. Reacting to the smear campaign by a section of media that Khalistanis are behind the farmers’ movement, she says, “Before labelling us Khalistanis, please have a look at our history. At least show some respect to those who refused to bow down before the Khalistani Kalashnikovs.”She says their movement opposes any kind of fundamentalism, whether it is led by Hindu or Sikh communal leaders. “Our sacrifices have proved that in the past,” she says.She is not alone. The current farmers’ uprising is being led by mainly those who fought Khalistani fundamentalists and ‘state terrorism’ with the same valour and lost many leaders in those days. “Kirti Kisan Union’s (KKU) Gian Singh Sangha and Jaimal Padda were some known faces who were killed by the Khalistanis,” says vice-president of the KKU, Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala, who is leading the movement at the Singhu border. In those days, celebrated documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan in his famous documentary ‘In the Memory of Friends’ had documented that epic battle by the farm leaders.Dr Joginder Dayal, former general secretary of the Punjab Kisan Sabha, says that it was mainly farm leaders who were moving in villages where Khalistanis didn’t tolerate any dissent. “Several prominent peasant leaders like Sarwan Singh Cheema, Arjun Singh Mastana and Jagir Singh Kaulsheri were gunned down by the Khalistanis,” he says.Similar is the story of BKU Krantikari president Surjit Phul, who remained on the hit list of the Khalistanis when he opposed the murders of innocent people and police atrocities. It is a known story in peasant circles that after killing an innocent young man in Bathinda, the Khalistanis announced that the last rites of the victim won’t be allowed. Phul not only motivated the family to hold the last rites but also gave a lecture at the function.
05-12-2020||---||Why link stir to security issue, Sukhbir asks Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh||Chandigarh, December 4Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal today asked Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to stop his “dangerous efforts to sabotage” the farmers’ agitation by linking it with national security.The Akali leader asked the Punjab CM to share with the people the specific grounds or intelligence on the basis of which he had suddenly woken up to the threat to national security and that too when the farmers’ battle of life and death had reached a crucial stage.After meeting Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday, Captain Amarinder said, “I came to meet the Home Minister to reiterate our position and to make a request to him and the farmers to resolve this soon because this (agitation) affects the economy of my Punjab as well as the security of the nation.”In a statement here, Sukhbir said, “Amarinder is clearly dancing to someone else’s tune to paint the farmers as national security risk. His so-called warning came immediately after his suspicious meeting with a powerful Union minister. Does he think the farmers and others in the country can’t see through his conspiratorial role against them?”The SAD chief said instead of telling the government to address the farmers’ genuine apprehensions and grievances, the CM had chosen to warn the poor farmers against continuing with their peaceful, democratic agitation. “At the same time, he has tried to set the whole country against the farmers’ cause. This is clearly a part of the Centre’s design to use him to weaken support for the farmers,” he said.

The Bench also sought the state’s response on six counts, including progress against erring officials.No clarityThe Bench of Jaswant Singh and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma, the state counsel referred to an affidavit giving details of progress on departmental front and investigation/registration of cases. It found absence of clarity in the affidavit on the issue reported by a judicial officer regarding the setting up of illegal nakas and goonda tax.As the matter came up for resumed hearing before the Bench of Jaswant Singh and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma, the state counsel referred to an affidavit giving details of progress on departmental front and investigation/registration of cases.It stated four FIRs had been registered in Ropar district regarding illegal mining activities. But the Bench found absence of clarity in the affidavit on the issue reported by a judicial officer regarding the setting up of illegal nakas and goonda tax.The Bench then directed the state to file an affidavit on the progress against persons found manning illegal check posts and their superiors/contractors and the provisions, if any, under which the state proposed to take action.The state was also asked to specify whether there was any provision under the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, the Punjab Minor Minerals Rules or any other rule in force which penalised a person for setting up illegal nakas and seeking royalty for minerals. It was also asked to specify the details of procedure, if any, for an aggrieved person to report the setting up of nakas and collection of goonda tax.Directions were also issued to the state to apprise the court on method put in place by the government for reporting illegal mining in any area and provisions under which penal action was taken.Considering subsequent events, especially the initiation of criminal proceedings by the state and other administrative inquiries initiated to investigate the matter, the Bench added it would be a wastage of resources by asking two agencies to look into similar issue.

In his report, CJM-cum-Secretary, District Legal Services Authority, Ropar, Harsimranjit Singh, had stated that local residents, passersby and the truck drivers unanimously confirmed no truck carrying sand and gravel was allowed to cross the points without paying royalty.

His mercy petition under Article 72 of the Constitution is hanging fire for eight years.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said once the Centrehad decided to recommend Presidential pardon for a death row convict, the pendency of appeals of his co-accused can’t be a reason to delay the clemency proceedings.“Appeal of other co-accused has no relevance to the decision to commute the death sentence of some convicts taken to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev,” it noted.Asking Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj to take instructions in two weeks on the issue, the Bench posted the matter for hearing in January next year.The court’s comments came after the Centre contended that the proposal to commute death sentence was not sent to the President as appeal of other co-accused was pending and the convict himself hadn’t filed an appealCiting Devender Pal Singh Bhullar’s case, the petitioner claimed that the “Delay caused by circumstances beyond the prisoners’ control mandates commutation of death sentence.” The inordinate delay caused agony and adversely affected his physical and mental health.

05-12-2020||Roopinder Singh||Narinder Singh Kapany: Scientist, Entrepreneur, Philanthropist||Apioneering scientist, teacher, entrepreneur, businessman, patron of arts and philanthropist, Moga-born Narinder Singh Kapany was truly multi-faceted. The “father of fibre optics” turned his research into a thriving business, and in the process revolutionised communication and helped provide the underpinnings of the Internet infrastructure of today. He was also a major patron of Sikh arts and sponsored many activities through the Sikh Foundation that he founded.Born on October 31, 1926, the man who rubbed shoulders with a veritable who’s who of world leaders, presidents, prime ministers and princes, Dr Kapany passed away on December 4, 2020. For “Fortune” magazine, in 1999, he was among the “Unsung Heroes of the 20th century”, who, many contend, had a stronger claim than Charles Kao, who got the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.As a youngster, he grew up in Dehradun. He earned the BSc degree from Agra University and then went to the UK for advanced studies in optics at the Imperial College of Science in London. There he researched and successfully published a paper on transmitting images through optical fibre bundles in “Nature” in 1954. The same year he married Satinder Kaur in London.The couple moved to the US in 1955, where Dr Kapany taught at the University of Rochester. He established Optics Technology in 1960 at Palo Alto, California. The west coast was to be his home henceforth, as he devoted his time to teaching — University of California (UC) Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and Stanford University — and to his business, going on to founding Kaptron (1973) and K2 Optronics (2000). I remember his laughing and saying that one must be modest when I asked him why he had named his company after the second highest peak in the world.The Kapany family home welcomed Punjabis. However, the back-to-the-roots yearning took a concrete form with the establishment of the Sikh Foundation in 1967.In 1997, he set up the Kundan Kaur Kapany Chair of Sikh Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara in the memory of his mother. In 1999, he endowed a Chair of Opto-Electronics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.He led the commemoration of the Tercentenary of the Khalsa with the international “Sikh arts exhibit” at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, which was inaugurated by Prince Charles on March 22, 1999.He lost his wife Satinder in 2016.Dr Narinder Singh Kapany is survived by his son Raj Kapany and daughter Kiran Kaur Kapany and his grandchildren. His family, foundation and endowed chairs will now have the challenge of shaping his legacy.
