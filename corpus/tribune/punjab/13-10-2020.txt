The current paddy crop is being bought on MSP basis. There has been record buying by government agencies this season. Similarly, wheat will be procured in the season and no farmer will face any issue.”Puri said legislations “will also create new opportunities for arhityas who can provide better seeds, inputs, knowledge, supply chain assistance apart from their existing roles in mandis. Investments will drive change across the supply chain benefiting all stakeholders to reduce the agriculture wastage which is currently at 30 per cent.”The number of procurement centers for Kharif season this year increased from 30,549 (2019-20) to 39,130, nearly 30 per cent hike, he said. “The number of procurement centers (rabi and kharif seasons combined) gone up from 48,550 in 2016-17 to 64,515 in 2019-20, increase of nearly 33 per cent over just four years,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/record%C2%A0buying-of-paddy-on-msp-wheat-to-be-similarly-procured-hardeep-puri-155190

The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee is the only organisation now which has decided not to participate in the talks.Interestingly, the leadership of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) decided to change their protest tactics--- they lifted their dharnas from the railway tracks and instead decided to concentrate their energies and resources on dharnas outside the houses of BJP leaders. “Every other union is already holding protest on the rail tracks, so we decided to intensify protests outside the residences of BJP leaders in Punjab,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary of the union.The other unions, however, have decided to continue their ‘Rail Roko protests’, besides protesting outside the residences of BJP leaders, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU Rajewal.Meanwhile, a delegation of Punjab government comprising of Ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhbinder Sarkaria, met the representatives of these 29 Unions, and assured them that a special vidhan sabha session is being convened by the state government next week, to reject the Agriculture Laws passed by the Centre.

A decision to this effect was taken at a special meeting of the SAD core committee chaired by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal here this afternoon.The committee reiterated its continued support to the farmers’ organisations fighting for the cause of the peasantry especially with regard to the three central Acts.Harcharan Bains, principal adviser to the SAD president, said: “The ultimatum to Capt Amarinder Singh has become necessary in view of the CM’s continued refusal to take a clear stand against the anti-farmer Acts of the Government of India as well as his refusal to declare the entire state a principal market area where the Centre’s Acts would no longer be implementable.”The core committee also decided to take up the issue of early reopening of the Kartarpur corridor with the External Affairs Minister soon to ensure Sikh pilgrims could pay obeisance at the Pakistan shrine in the run-up to the 551th Parkash Purab of Guru Nanak Dev.“The core committee also served an ultimatum to take action against SC Welfare Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot in the Rs 69 crore SC scholarship scam or be ready to face an agitation,” said Bains. The committee expressed concern at the mishandling of the Hathras incident by the UP Government and asked it to ensure the victim family received justice.

In an advisory sent to the Congress-ruled states, it has been asked to explore the possibilities to pass laws in their respective states under Article 254(2) of the Constitution, which allows the state legislatures to pass a law to negate the Central laws encroaching upon the State’s jurisdiction.Sources in the government said the state government had sought legal opinion on the issue. A few days ago, the kisan unions had issued an ultimatum to the state government for convening the special session.Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has already said he would ensure that nothing was allowed to obstruct his government’s efforts to save the livelihood of the farmers and secure the future of their children.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cabinet-to-take-call-at-tomorrows-meet-154945

13-10-2020||Amritsar/ludhiana||Farmer unions divided over Centre’s invite||Farmer organisations seem divided on whether or not to attend the meeting convened by the Union Ministry of Agriculture on Wednesday. They are slated to meet tomorrow to reach a consensus on the issue.The Kirti Kisan Union feels there is nothing new in the invitation of the Union Government, while the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Qadian) seems inclined to participate in the meeting.Interestingly, one of the major organisations of farmers having a pan-Punjab presence —the BKU (Lakhowal) — has not been invited for the talks as the outfit was expelled for rushing to the Supreme Court with a writ petition against the farm Acts without taking other farmer bodies into confidence.Kirti Kisan Union patron Hardev Singh Sandhu said the Centre was apparently not keen on a dialogue with agitating farmers. He stressed farmers would accept nothing less than revocation of all three farm Acts and the withdrawal of the electricity Bill. On the other hand, BKU (Kadian) president Harmeet Singh Kadian seems inclined to initiate a discussion with the Centre. He, however, was quick to add that his union would abide by the decision taken at the Jalandhar meeting.The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee has outrightly rejected the proposed talks. Committee’s state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said the Centre had never created a conducive environment for it. “We will continue to hold protest till the three farm Acts are repealed by the Centre,” he said.He said the letter of invitation was sent by the Agriculture Secretary, who is not an authority to make amendment or resolve the issue by conducting meeting with farmers. “Moreover, our Haryana counterparts were left out of this invitation. We have unanimously decided not to hold talks and will intensify our agitation till the Centre revokes these Acts,” he said.On the other hand, Rattan Singh Randhawa, vice-president, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, opined that every solution to the problem ultimately emerged over the negotiating table. He urged all farm organisations to share a common platform for the cause.In Mandi Ahmedgarh, farmers see little hope in the proposed meeting, but they wish their leaders to accept the invitation. However, they said they would welcome the decision to be taken at a joint meeting.Baldev Singh Latala, an office-bearer of the All-India Kisan Sabha, apprehended that the proposed meeting might prove a futile exercise as no mention of three farm Acts had been made in the communiqué received by representatives of 29 kisan sabhas from the Centre.BKU (Qadian) state president Harmeet Singh Qadian said: “It is too early to comment on the invitation. The situation is slightly different from earlier invitation as the government has now invited all constituents of the joint front.”Sher Singh and Sarabjit Singh Burthala Mander, block presidents of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) said protesting farmers should continue dharnas and rallies while their leaders take a decision in Tuesday’s meetings. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmer-unions-divided-over-centres-invite-154950

Therefore, in order to give a fresh start to agriculture and economic rejuvenation of the region, I request your good office to consider opening of diplomatic channels for the resumption of trade and also for a fresh trade policy more acceptable in the post-pandemic world,” Aujla said in a letter to PM.He noted: “The border district of Amritsar has suffered manifold due to imposition of 200 per cent customs duty on imports from Pakistan in February 2019, reckless termination of trade in August 2019 by Islamabad, Covid-19 pandemic and now with the introduction of farm Bills. The direct impact of a disruption in border trade is felt most in Punjab, especially among more than 20,000 families in Amritsar dependent on this trade.”“Amritsar’s economy has suffered a net loss of nearly Rs 30 crore earned every month from this border trade. With the opening of the Kartarpur corridor, possibility of looking at bilateral relations from a different prospective had emerged. It is worth considering whether Punjab can be made center to the India-Pakistan relationship fortifying trade route running through Punjab,” said Aujla.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/resume-trade-with-pak-cong-mp-gurjit-aujla-to-pm-154957

There were complaints that many trailers laden with cotton were being offloaded directly in cotton ginning and pressing factories on the directions of the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), affecting the labour work. Farmers claimed that since the CCI was not coming forward to ensure the purchase at the minimum support price, they had to sell the produce at a lower price.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/abohar-labourers-lock-cotton-yard-154959

However, neither the SGPC nor the university authorities had bothered to resolve the issue, the employees alleged.While talking to The Tribune, Pushpinder Kumar, president of teachers union, and Rajpal Singh, president of the non-teaching employees’ union, said the employees were on the verge of starvation and were finding it difficult to make both ends meet. Most of them had taken loans from banks and were unable to pay the instalments and even the school fee of their wards.Pushpinder Kumar said ironically, the highly educated intellectuals had to resort to agitational approach to get their rightful dues. After watching their condition, students will think twice before becoming teachers in the future. Rajpal Singh alleged that from the past three years, they had been struggling to get salaries and each time they had to sit on a dharna to get their dues.Meanwhile, Vice-Chancellor Pritpal Singh said the state government had not released scholarships of SC students, which amounted to approximately Rs 15 crore.

13-10-2020||---||Centre ignoring GST relief law, Constitution: Manpreet Badal||Chandigarh, October 12In the sharpest attack on the Centre over the non-payment of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation, Punjab has accused the Centre of setting up a wrong precedent by ignoring the tenets of the Constitution of India and the Compensation Law in the GST.At a GST Council meeting in Delhi today, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal reportedly minced no words as he made the state’s stand clear that it wanted the compensation of Rs 9,000 crore that the Centre owed, as per the original plan.Talking to The Tribune, Badal said he had made the state’s stand clear: If a pragmatic change is necessary, amend the law. “The Centre cannot split the compensation into two parts, as is being proposed in the GST Council meetings. There is no legal basis to apply seven per cent growth (from the earlier proposed 10 per cent growth in compensation). It has to come from the Compensation Fund, as defined in Section 10. It cannot come through borrowings as is now being suggested.“Unless the Union Government first borrows and credits it to the Compensation Fund, it is not compensation. The Attorney General of India has opined that compensation must be paid within the five years of transition period and cannot be delayed beyond these five years,” he said.Reacting to the narrative that since a majority of the states agree to the Centre’s option of additional borrowing, they can go ahead with it, Badal countered saying the AG had also said unless all states agreed to delay receiving compensation beyond five years, it could not be effected.“Is this what the Constitution of India and Compensation Act imagined — to leave dissenting states to fend for themselves?” he said.In a veiled jibe, Badal said he shuddered to think of a situation where states could cite today’s precedence later and amend the GST laws, imposing their own rates of GST or grant exemptions on the grounds that the council’s recommendations were not binding on legislature. “I hope the council will rise above immediacy and guide itself by law rather than expediency,” he said.Form mechanism to adjudicate disputesManpreet Singh Badal has stressed the need for establishing a mechanism to adjudicate disputes between the Centre and state/states or between Centre and state/states on one side and one or more states on the other, arising out of the recommendations of the GST Council or implementation of thereof.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-ignoring-gst-relief-law-constitution-manpreet-badal-154975

As per the Civil Hospital staff, he died of cardiac arrest on the morning of October 7. At least two such destitute patients have died at the ESI hospital, which has been doubling up as the Civil Hospital for the past six months. After Raju and 15-year-old patient Bikram were found abandoned by the roadside at a ‘Raen Basera’ near the railway station, they were readmitted to the ESI Hospital by some good Samaritans. ESI Hospital staff said the 15-year-old patient with a fractured leg had been sent back home after his relatives came to take him. To date, not a single person has been held accountable for the inhuman treatment meted out to the two in September as a formal report gave a clean chit to the hospital staff. Raju had told The Tribune he had been living on the sidewalk in Adarsh Nagar for several years. He broke his pelvic bone after a fall into a sewer some months ago. He was admitted to the Civil Hospital. He had claimed he had been dropped by the roadside along with Bikram by some men in an auto-rickshaw on the night of September 17. The men included a patient and a sweeper at the ESI hospital, he had said. The report had refuted the charge. Raju and Bikram are among the eight unidentified patients who made it to the hospital during Covid. Two died (Raju and an elderly woman) at the hospital. An intellectually challenged woman, who has been refused stay by shelter homes, is among those shifted. The patients from the ESI Hospital were finally shifted back to the Civil Hospital today after five months of ESI’s operations as the Civil Hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/60-yr-old-dumped-by-roadside-dies-154993

Farmers’ leader Tehal Singh Chetanpura said all sections of society were joining hands with the farmers as the new Acts would affect society in general.

We also demand from the CM to bring a law restricting the purchase of land by non-domiciles.Bains said on the one hand Prime Minister Narendra Modi had invited farmer associations to join a meeting on the issue on October 14 but on the other he was threatening leaders of the opposition parties and was accusing them of misleading farmers.Bains said the PM was trying to create divisions in farmer associations by inviting them for a meeting. He urged the associations to not to fall prey to such political tactics of the Union Government.Talking about the protest outside Tarun Chugh’s residence, Bains said the objective was to wake up ‘sleeping souls’ of BJP leaders from Punjab. “We want to remind them that they are Punjabis and they should feel proud of being Punjabis,” he said, adding that Punjab was an agrarian state and its economy would be hit hard if the three Acts were implemented.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/time-for-punjab-bjp-leaders-to-wake-up-simarjit-singh-bains-155016

The assailants had pumped 10 bullets into Shah’s body. His two colleagues, who were present at his office at that time, had also suffered bullet injuries. A day later, a post was updated on a Lawrence Bishnoi’s Facebook profile claiming the responsibility for the murder.Later when Bishnoi was brought by the Chandigarh police on production warrant, he revealed that the Facebook post claiming responsibility for Sonu Shah’s murder was posted by one of his henchmen.In March this year, Surjit Singh, a bouncer-turned-financier, was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne persons near his house in Sector 38 (West). He was returning home in his car when the assailants opened fire at him.Within a few hours after the murder, an unidentified person updated a post on the Facebook page of gangster Davinder Bambiha, stating that Lucky has avenged the killing of Amit Sharma who was shot dead at Saketri, Panchkula in 2017.Gangster Bambiha was killed in a police encounter at Gill Kala, near Rampura, Punjab, in 2016.

The city is witnessing a declining trend with 0.8 per cent growth rate.Prof Jagat Ram, Director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, said, “We have to stick to the standard protocol for keeping epidemic surge at bay, especially during the winter season, as respiratory viruses thrive better in cold weather and low humidity conditions.”We have to stick to the standard protocol for keeping epidemic surge at bay, especially during the winter season, as respiratory viruses thrive better in cold weather and low humidity conditions. —Prof Jagat Ram, Director, PGI“If precautions are not taken, the situation can go out of hand with sudden rise of Covid-19 cases. Besides, people need to be extra cautious during the festival season and practice social distancing,” he added.The UT Administrator on Monday also directed Deputy Commissioner to ensure that festivals were celebrated by the people while strictly following the Covid-19 protocol.He instructed that necessary guidelines should be issued while giving permissions for public celebrations.Prof JS Thakur, the Department of Community Medicine and Public Health, said, “In the absence of any vaccine, mask is the only inoculation. People should wear mask all the time. For any change in season, the viral infection is common among people. How the virus behaves in winter needs to be seen, but there is already second wave in other countries and a similar trend can be expected here too.”“Residents must also avoid crowded places and gatherings during the festival season. They should try to go to market when there is less crowd,” he added.The Union Health Minister had stated, “During winter, there is a tendency of overcrowding in residential dwellings, which may increase transmission. So, in the Indian context, it will not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases.”The minister also cited examples of the European countries, especially the United Kingdom, where the number of infections has gone up with the advent of winter.Recently, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had recommended in a document that Delhi should prepare for a daily surge of approximately 15,000 positive cases and make arrangements for patients’ admission with moderate and severe disease.Meanwhile, Manoj Parida, the UT Adviser, said, “We will make proper market arrangement for residents during the festival season and issue guidelines for social distancing and safety protocol.
