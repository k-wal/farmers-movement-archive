06-01-2021||Chandigarh||Withholding Rs 1,200 crore of Punjab’s RDF an arm twisting: Manpreet Badal||Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Wednesday slammed the Centre for allegedly holding back the state’s rural development fund amounting to Rs 1,200 crore, dubbing it as “an arm twisting tactic” amid the farmers’ protest.“The kind of the government of India’s attitude towards Punjab is not right. It has withheld our Rs 1,200 crore of RDF on paddy crop. It has not been paid to us as yet,” said Badal while addressing the media here.He said the Centre has not released the RDF despite the state raising the issue with the concerned central ministry.Punjab charges three per cent of the minimum support price of wheat and paddy as the RDF from buyers, he said.The Centre last year had allegedly put Punjab’s RDF on hold on the pretext of scrutinising its utilisation.Badal said Punjab’s RDF is a statutory tax which has to be paid.“You cannot question us on this,” he said, adding the Centre had asked the state government on the utilisation of RDF funds.“They (Centre) are upset with us as to why Punjab farmers are agitating and why are you (Punjab government) not controlling them. It is a kind of an arm twisting tactic,” he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points—Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—for more than a month, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price for their crops.Badal further expressed displeasure over the non-selection of Punjab for food parks proposed to be set up by some United Arab Emirates entities in the country.He said the United Arab Emirates had planned to set up three food park projects in the country.“The UAE was keen to set up a food park in Punjab. But the government of India gave one food park project to Gujarat, second to Madhya Pradesh and the third one to Maharashtra. We feel this was an unfair selection. Punjab deserved it,” said Badal.The state finance minister also alleged that the GST (goods and services tax) compensation to the tune of Rs 8,500 crore was still pending.Badal said with the mobilisation of its tax revenue and rationalisation of the government expenditure, the state did not go for any overdraft for a single day in the current financial year. — PTI

The students will be able to attend the physical classes only with the written consent of parents,” the minister added.Singla added that the parents should also ensure that their ward going to school will be wearing a mask and made them aware not to exchange masks with others. He added that the parents should also encourage their ward to wear full-sleeved clothes to minimise the interaction with any public surface.Singla said, “If the strength of the students is large in the school and social distancing norms are not maintainable, in that case School Head/ Management may take a decision whether to hold the classes in two shifts or call the students at alternate days, at their own level.”He added that the staff and students belonging to containment zones shall not attend the school and other educational institutions. He said as per the recommendations of MoHFW, older, pregnant and other employees who have underlying medical conditions to take extra precautions, should preferably not be exposed to any frontline work requiring direct contact with the students.He said the authorities will also ensure foot operated hand washing facilities in the schools and ensure availability of key supplies like contactless thermometers, disinfectants, soaps, etc., and arrange for availability of these essentials.Singla added that they will also ensure sanitisation of school transport before plying and also ensure social distancing while transportation of students.The education minister said the schools will mark the seats of students in classrooms ensuring distance of minimum 6 feet and similarly, social distancing shall also be maintained in the staffrooms, office area, hostels and other places of public interaction. He added that the schools will also ensure installation of posters/messages/stickers and signage at appropriate places reminding students about maintaining social distancing.He said the schools will not undertake events where social distancing will not be possible. However, school assembly may be conducted by the students in their respective classrooms or outdoor spaces or other available spaces and halls under the guidance of the class teacher.

For this purpose, also, DoPT keeps continuously reviewing and following up the cases with different state/UT governments.”“As far as the Punjab Civil Services are concerned, the DoPT has already processed their cases and there were some clarifications from the UPSC, which had to be responded to by the state government. But I have been given to understand that this process will also be concluded very soon,” he added.

This is why Shree Brar has been singled out for punishment with relation to another song he wrote one month back”, he alleged. Parambans Romana said police had refused to allow his party to meet Brar. “While the YAD is against glorification of violence, there are so many other singers who have done much worse but continue to roam in vehicles of Congress leaders even after being issued summons by the courts,” he said, adding there were reports of singers being issued notices by the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax and even under FERA to intimidate them.

Jaspal started helping other fellow farmers too after finishing his preparations.  “Farmers, especially the youngsters, are enthusiastic about the tractor march and are also ready to lead it from the front. As the march will start at 9 am hence we have tied flags on the tractors and filled their tanks today to save time next morning. Even, music system installed on the tractor has also been checked,” Jaspal told The Tribune.He said three farmers will board on a tractor, while women protesters will not be part of this march. They would remain at protest sites to do routine affairs like attending dharna along with other farmers and preparations of langar, etc. The march would be peaceful and the tractor would move in a row, he added.Like Jaspal, other farmers too were excited about the march at Tikri and were seen discussing it with their elderly. “My tractor suddenly developed some technical issue yesterday but I got it rectified today to ensure my participation in the march,” said Jaskaran Singh, another farmer from Punjab.   Joginder Nain, state president, Bhartiya Kisan Union, said the farmers would assemble at old bus stand in Bahadurgarh town in the morning. “Thereafter, they will proceed towards Aasodha village for taking the route of KMP highway to go to the Singhu border. Similarly, farmers from Singhu will proceed towards Tikri,” he added.Meanwhile, the police beefed up security arrangements on the route of the tractor march to avert any untoward incident.“Adequate arrangements have been made to maintain law and order situation during the march.

06-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Amarinder urges PM Modi to listen to farmers' voice and repeal farm laws to resolve crisis||Stressing that there was nothing wrong with the demands of the farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday urged the Prime Minister to immediately repeal the Farm Laws to resolve the crisis.Categorically rejecting as “highly irresponsible” reports in a section of the media, that Punjab had already implemented the new Farm Laws, the Chief Minister said, that Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu’s statement had been mischievously twisted by one newspaper, with others picking it up.Punjab was the first state to have opposed the central farm laws and, in fact, passed amendments Bills to negate their dangerous impact on agriculture, he pointed out, slamming the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for spreading misinformation on the issue with their fake propaganda machinery.The Governor said: “should have forwarded our Bills to the President for assent, which he has not done.”The Chief Minister, in a media interview, made it clear that Punjab would not allow the lives of its farmers to be ruined by the new laws.“We will do whatever possible to help the farmers and their families, for whom the state government had already started two helplines on which they could reach out in case of any emergency,” he said.Urging the Prime Minister to withdraw the controversial laws and talk to the farmers, Captain Amarinder said: “The farmers have made their stand very clear - that the laws should be repealed. It is the job of the Government of India to listen to them.”The Centre can bring in new laws after due consultation with the farmers, he said, pointing out that the Constitution has been amended many times and can be done again for the revocation of the recently enacted farm legislations.Noting, that farmers from across the country had joined the protests against the Farm Laws, Captain Amarinder said after 6-7 meetings, it was time that the matter is resolved, and the farmers, who are sitting out in the cold and rains, can go back, and everyone else can get on with their lives.The Chief Minister lambasted those calling the protesting farmers Naxals and terrorists, terming it as wrong and irresponsible.

Other wetlands in the state are in Gurdaspur, Rupnagar and Nangal.Protocols have also been issued for collection of samples in case any migratory bird is found dead, the officials further said, adding that all possible precautions were being taken.Notably, samples of dead migratory birds at Pong Dam Lake sanctuary in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh have tested positive for the H5N8 strain of bird flu.Four lakh poultry birds have died at 20 farms in Haryana's Panchkula district in the past several days.A team of experts from the RDDL collected samples from the farms on Tuesday.Panchkula's Barwala-Raipur Rani area is one of the largest poultry belts in the country with nearly 70-80 lakh birds in more than 100 farms.According to the officials, the mortality rate in poultry birds was unusually high this winter.However, there was no confirmed report of avian influenza as of now.Poultry farmers' in Panchkula have attributed the high mortality rate in birds to extreme cold weather conditions or the disease Ranikhet. — PTI

06-01-2021||Washington||Wisconsin State Assembly Speaker supports farmers' protests in India||Voicing his support for the farmers' protest in India, the Speaker of Wisconsin State Assembly has urged the Indian government to reconsider its decision on the three farm laws and listen to the concerns of the affected farmers.Robin J Vos expressed his support through a letter to India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu. He also wrote a similar letter to US Ambassador to India Ken Juster."One thing Wisconsin and India may have in common is our large agricultural economies. The farmers of our state are a very large part of our overall economy. It would be unfathomable to me that we would make law changes that affect them without taking their input into account, or by shutting them down as they exercised their right to peaceably assemble,” he wrote in his letters dated January 4.“Hopefully, the Modi government will reconsider its decision and sit down with the affected farmers to listen to their concerns,” Vos said.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted", asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country."We have seen some ill-informed comments…relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said last month.“Recently, I was made aware of three new laws that may have a great impact on the farmers of Punjab. It is my understanding that these three laws were implemented with little to no consultation with this large community of farmers, and have sparked massive protests in Delhi,” Vos said in his letter to Sandhu.“While my job does not usually call me to opine on relations between the United States and other countries, I write as a US citizen who represents Indians in Wisconsin. I ask that in your consultations with Prime Minister Modi you convey my concern for violations of human civil rights and the right to peaceably protest,” he said in his letter to the Indian ambassador.Wisconsin has a sizeable Sikh population.In his letter to Juster, Vos said he was writing as a US citizen who represents Indians in Wisconsin.“I ask that in your consultations with Prime Minister Modi and his government, that you convey a concern for violations of human civil rights and the right to peaceably protest. I trust you agree that these are fundamental bedrocks in American society and we should do all we can in our diplomatic relations to ensure that they are bedrocks in the countries with which we have diplomatic ties,” Vos wrote.Eminent Sikh American Darshan Singh Dhaliwal welcomed the letters written by Vos and said that farmers of entire India, not only Punjab, were suffering.“Repeal of the three farmers' laws is the right thing to do. Farmers do not want these laws,” said Dhaliwal who left for India on Tuesday to show solidarity with the protesting farmers.He said he was in talks with several US Congressmen for a visit to India to meet the protesting farmers and get a firsthand assessment of the situation on the ground.Meanwhile, the Indian embassy has increased its outreach to members of the US Congress briefing them about the various aspects of the farm bill, and the right of the farmers to protest and the several rounds of talks that the government has had with the leaders of the protesting farmers.During these briefings by senior officials of the Indian embassy, the lawmakers and their staffers are being given the historical perspective of the agricultural sector in India and the problems that this sector is facing, including the falling income of farmers.Ambassador Sindhu has spoken to a few eminent Congressmen. The Indian embassy is also reaching out to members of the Indian community.Members of US Congress and their staffers are told about the various misconceptions about the farm bills. They are told that farmers have the absolute right to protest and their ongoing protest is democracy in action.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislation would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the Indian government but the logjam continues. PTI

The extreme step taken by the family has shocked everyone in the village.No one opened the gate of the house on Monday, when one of their neighbours visited them after 4 pm to ask if they needed any help ahead of the marriage. When he again went to check on them after sometime, nobody responded. It was in the morning, when the neighbours became suspicious and broke open the door and found their bodies. They then called the police and it was found that they had consumed sulphas.The police said Yamuna did not marry earlier because she was always worried about what will happen to her parents after her marriage because she had also lost her brother in an accident a few years ago and they were financially very weak. Other six sisters of Yamuna are married off.“After investigation, it has come to the fore that the family members were in depression. There was no source of income and the villagers were pitching in for Yamuna’s marriage and were helping the family members financially, so that Yamuna could be married without any problem, but she was worried for her elderly parents,” the police said. As per the villagers, the family was very simple and god-fearing.SHO, Nawanshahr Sadar, Sarabjit Singh said the bodies were cremated after the post-mortem examination.

The submission came as the Punjab and Haryana High Court issued a notice of motion to the state of Punjab.Taking up the company’s petition for action against efforts by “vested interest and miscreants” to completely sabotage and damage its network infrastructure, Justice Sudhir Mittal also issued a notice to the Union of India, the Department of Telecommunication and the state Director-General of Police. Justice Mittal fixed the case for February 8 after the counsel for the respondents sought time.The notice to Punjab and the DGP was accepted by state counsel Diya Sodhi. For remaining respondents, it was accepted by Addititional Solicitor-General of India Satya Pal Jain, Saigeeta Srivastava and Gurmeet Kaur Gill.Responding to the contentions raised in the petition, Punjab Advocate-General Atul Nanda submitted the petitioner-company was itself admitting action for protection of its assets. Accompanied by Additional AG Rameeza Hakeem, Nanda added the state has deployed 1,019 patrolling parties in 27 districts and appointed 22 nodal officers to prevent further damage. The state was carrying out the duty enjoined upon it by the statutes. The impact of the farm laws’ agitation by the farmers on 1,300 affected towers had been removed and these were now functioning, Nanda submitted.Appearing for the petitioner-company, senior counsel Ashok Aggarwal submitted the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act, 2014, was enacted to prevent damage to public and private property. But preventive mechanism was not provided. As such, damage to petitioner’s properties could not be prevented despite the enactment. “The state needs to evolve a mechanism for fulfilling the purpose behind the Act,” he added.

Sidhu also got selfies clicked with them.The former minister enquired about their well-being and patiently listened to their grievances before taking on the Union Government for allegedly favouring the big corporates and “looting” the common man.“Today, the farmers are fighting not only for their own cause but for the rights of every Indian. The farmers are the flag-bearers of our fight for rights. We must support them. How can they trust the government which could not fulfil its constitutional commitment under the GST to pay Punjab an increment of 14 per cent every year?” he said.Citing statistics, Sidhu claimed that the total debt on the Government of India in 67 years (1947-2014) was Rs 54 lakh crore, whereas under the BJP rule, it had risen to over Rs 70 lakh crore between 2014 and 2019.“If you divide the first amount by 67 years, the debt rose by Rs 74,000 crore annually, meaning Rs 6,200 crore per month. Since 2014, the debt has increased by approximately Rs 7 lakh crore every year, means Rs 60,000 crore every month. Consequently, they have increased the burden on the common man by 10 times,” he said.

The state had not increased the SAP for the past three years. It said due to this, while the SAP of cane was Rs 310 per quintal in Punjab, both Haryana and Uttar Pradesh paid their farmers an SAP of Rs 350 per quintal.

The state had hit the peak in September when around 60,000 cases and around 2,000 deaths were reported.Following that, the cases started declining over the next two months. In October and November, the number of cases remained static at around 18,000 and deaths also came down to almost one fourth.However, last month the cases came down to around 14,500, which is over 20 per cent less cases.

One accused is at large. The suspects were operating in Punjab, Haryana, UP and MP.The police have recovered ATM cards, cash, SIM cards and a POS machine from the suspects. Arpit Shukla, Director-cum-ADGP, Bureau of Investigation, said the suspects had created a fake Facebook account in the name of Chief Principal Secretary to Punjab CM and were defrauding people by asking for money, pretending to be him.DGP Dinkar Gupta formed three teams and dispatched them to UP, Rajasthan and MP. The arrests are likely to solve similar cases related to Facebook hacking, OLX/ bank frauds and a host of other cyber-related crimes.Investigations suggest Dinesh and Rahul, nephews of Madan Lal, used his IDs to open bank accounts in his (Lal’s) name and usurp money obtained fraudulently.The suspects moved in three different states of Haryana, UP and Rajasthan as their primary base was located at the tri-junction of these. The police located the whereabouts of Narender, in whose account the ill-gotten money was deposited, and arrested him from Bharatpur in Rajasthan. “On further probe, another gang member, Gulaab Singh, was apprehended, which led to the disclosure of a full-scale racket being run in the area,” Shukla said.He said the connivance of some bank employees in the racket could not be ruled out. Further probe led to the arrest of Bhaag Singh and Raman Kumar, the kingpin in the money circulation of such rackets as they provide ATM cards, SIM cards and IDs to fraudsters, who hired their services for a 10 per cent cut in the money withdrawn through his money siphoning channel.A case has been registered under relevant sections of the IPC and the IT Act.

The former DGP has challenged a Punjab and Haryana High Court order that had turned down his plea seeking quashing of the FIR and stay on further investigation in the case.On Tuesday, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Saini, urged a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan to stay further proceedings in the case even as senior counsel Dushyant Dave opposed it on behalf of the complainant. Terming it a “very serious case” that involved charges of kidnapping and murder, Dave sought to highlight that the accused was facing certain other murder charges as well.On behalf of the State of Punjab, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium and Vikas Singh informed the Bench that a chargesheet had been filed and summons issued to the accused.The SC asked the state government to file a copy of the chargesheet along with additional documents after Subramanium and Singh said all facts and material should be placed before the court in view of the sensitivity of the matter.

Apart from conducting a fair inquiry into the scam, action should be taken against the college authorities for withholding the degrees.”He said the Centre had refused to send the next instalment of the scholarship funds due to the alleged Rs 63-crore scam by Dharamsot.Meanwhile, over a dozen Congress leaders, including Neeraj Mittal, PPCC general secretary; Balkar Singh Chatha, chairman, sports and culture cell, Jalandhar District Congress Committee; and Hemant Sabharwal, former PPCC secretary, joined the AAP today. — TNS
06-01-2021||---||In Punjab, Haryana, wait for justice can be up to 3 decades||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 5In Punjab and Haryana, the wait for justice can be up to three decades, with 19,15,727 cases pending in the district courts of the two states. National Judicial Data Grid — the monitoring tool to identify, manage and reduce pendency of cases — indicates that the litigants in 40 cases in Punjab and eight cases in Haryana have been awaiting justice for more than 30 years.THE CASE FILE8,14,704 Cases pending in the district courts of Punjab11,01,023 Cases pending in Haryana19,15,727 Cases awaiting decision in the two statesIn all, there are 11,01,023 cases pending in Haryana, including 7,14,594 dealing with criminal matters. The situation is a trifle better in Punjab, with 8,14,704 cases awaiting decision, including 4,66,467 criminal cases.Seven civil and 33 criminal matters involving life and liberty have been pending for more than 30 years in the courts across Punjab; 77 for 20 to 30 years; 1,693 for 10 to 20 years and 22,437 for five to 10 years. No less than 4,10,530 cases have been pending for one to three years.In Haryana, eight civil matters have been pending for more than 30 years; 48 for 20 to 30 years; 1,161 for 10 to 20 years; and 24,714 for five to 10 years. The hammer of justice is yet to fall on another 5,70,298 cases pending for one to three years.Punjab has 22 sessions divisions, while Haryana has 21. The direct fallout of the colossal pendency is long adjournments and lesser number of hearings in a year, affecting not just the parties to the litigation, but also hampering the protection of fundamental rights. The effect of the ever-increasing pendency is also reflected in an increase in the number of undertrials or un-convicted prisoners lodged in the jails but facing trial in a court of law.The courts went into a restricted functioning mode since March following the Covid outbreak. The subordinate judiciary managed to dispose of on an average over 900 cases daily in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh. But the rapid rate at which the pendency is growing in the subordinate courts can be gauged from the fact that 9,74,942 cases in Haryana and 7,39,015 in Punjab were pending just about four months back.

06-01-2021||Chandigarh||High Court junks plea over Capt’s 2002 election||The allegation of corrupt practice was in nature of a criminal charge and required to be proven beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today ruled as it dismissed the oldest pending petition against Capt Amarinder Singh’s 18-year-old election from the Patiala Assembly constituency.The petition placed before Justice Daya Chaudhary’s Bench was filed in 2002 by Harkirat Singh — a voter in the constituency. It was initially dismissed in December 2005, but was remanded back by the Supreme Court on a plea against the High Court verdict.‘Can publish absconders’ names on Net’The Punjab and Haryana HC has made it clear there was no harm in publishing the names of absconders on the Internet. Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted the Punjab Police Rules were promulgated in 1934, when there was no Internet. The only social media available at that time was newspapers and magazines. “The court would see no harm in extending the publishing of the names... on social media as is now available via Internet, etc.,” the HC said.Justice Chaudhary held the mere presence of a gazetted officer at a press conference did not prove a corrupt practice as envisaged under Section 123(7) of the Representation of Peoples Act.Justice Chaudhary added the petitioner failed to prove that the press conference organised by former media adviser Bharat Inder Singh Chahal was held for furtherance of Capt Amarinder’s election prospects.

The police will question him over the controversial lyrics relating to a recent murder in Patiala.Case for promoting gun cultureA case under Section 3 of The Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1922, and Sections 500, 501, 502, 505, 115, 116 and 120-B of the IPC has been registered. SSP Vikramjeet Duggal said the song, “Jaan” by Barbie Mann, featuring Brar, was released in November last year. In its video, Brar is reportedly seen threatening police officers after being named in a murder case. It shows him barging into the Nabha police station and rescuing a murder accused by pointing a weapon at the duty officer.Moosewala fails to appear in courtThe police said the singer, a resident of Sector 91, SAS Nagar, talked about his name being dragged in a recent murder case, but “owing to his links” he was “untouchable” by law. “Such glorification of guns and hatred will not be tolerated. The FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint. Raids are on to nab other artistes who were part of the song,” the SSP said.DSP (Investigation) Krishan Kumar Panthe said the singer admitted to his involvement in the murder in the song. “We will interrogate him to ascertain if he had any role in the case,” he said. — TNS
