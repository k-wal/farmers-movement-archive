24-07-2020||Chandigarh||Over Rs 300 cr spent by Punjab govt on COVID care, sending back migrants: CM||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said the Rs 64 crore in the ‘CM Relief Fund’ being questioned by the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) was a miniscule of the over Rs 300 crore already spent by his government on providing COVID care and related expenses.He said the fund had been set aside by his government for emergency purposes.Ridiculing the SAD for criticising the state government for spending only Rs 2.28 crore from the amount accumulated in the CM Relief Fund for COVID support, Singh, in a statement, said the source of financing COVID-related expenditures was totally irrelevant.“The important thing is that despite total absence of financial support forthcoming from the central government, of which SAD is a part, the state government has not allowed the fiscal crunch to come in the way of COVID management,” he said.“If the Akalis were at all concerned about COVID care in the state, they should ask the Centre why they had failed to support the Punjab government in this critical time,” the chief minister said.The money being contributed by citizens to the ‘CM Relief Fund’ was an emergency fund that the state government had set aside to meet exigent urgent needs as and when required, when there is no immediate alternate resource available to it, he added.Singh pointed out that given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, it was important to keep such emergency funds in readiness to meet any eventuality.“However, the Akalis clearly did not believe in such emergency preparedness, as was evident from the many instances of mishandling of crisis situations during their 10-year-rule,” he quipped.The Rs 64,86,10,456 balance lying in the CM Relief Fund was a drop in the ocean compared to the crores of rupees already spent by his government on infrastructural upgradation, setting up of COVID care centres, roping in additional medical and para-medical staff, purchase of PPE kits and other essential equipment for battling the coronavirus, Singh pointed out.“As of date, the Health Department alone had spent nearly Rs 150 crore on COVID care essentials like VTM kits, PPE & N95, triple layer masks, drugs, consumable, oxygen cylinders, ambulances, among other things,” he said.In addition, the state government had spent Rs 29.5 crore on enabling 5.20 lakh migrant workers to go back to their home states via 398 Shramik special trains, the chief minister said.Besides, crores of rupees had been spent on food and essential supplies to the poor and marginalised people across the state, he added.“Instead of wasting their time on non-issues and misleading the people with their unwarranted and baseless accusations and allegations in this critical time, the Akalis should partner the state government in fighting the COVID pandemic,” he added.Meanwhile, SAD senior vice president and party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the CM is “still hiding the details about the State Disaster Relief Fund which is lying undisbursed with the state with an amount of more than Rs 6,000 crore”.The SAD leader said the chief minister must explain that why this fund was not utilised to compensate the loss of livelihood to lakhs of people from different sections of society, including skilled workers, daily wagers, small traders, rickshaw pullers, taxi drivers, etc.The party also raised questions on spending of Rs 29.5 crore enabling 5.20 lakh migrant labourers to go back to their homes and said that “announcement for this programme was done by none other than Congress president Sonia Gandhi and she had declared that these expenses will be borne by the Congress party”.“This shows that the Congress party has befooled the public by using ex-chequer money while befooling the public,” Cheema said in a statement.

24-07-2020||---||Punjab Police smash inter-state drug cartel spanning over 50 districts; arrest 20 persons||Chandigarh, July 24In one of the biggest crackdowns on the supply of pharmaceutical opioids across the country, the Punjab Police has busted an inter-state drug cartel operating in more than 50 districts spread across 11 states of the country, using the hawala channel route, a press release by the state government stated.As many as 20 persons have already been arrested with a huge cache of drugs, drug proceeds-money and five vehicles, in an operation that spanned over eight weeks.Disclosing the details of the case and the investigations, Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta said the drug cartel, known as ‘Agra Gang’, was pushing pharmaceutical opioids (drugs) into the markets all across India by diverting drugs in huge quantities from drug manufacturers, suppliers, wholesalers and retail chemists spread out across the country.Of the 20 people arrested so far, 16 are from Punjab, two from UP and one each from Haryana and Delhi.With the arrest of these gang members, a well-oiled network of drug syndicate pushing consignments to the tune of 10 to 12 crores of intoxicating pharmaceutical opioids in the form of tablets/capsules/injections/syrups per month into Punjab and other parts of the country has been totally smashed thousands of youth who were or could have got hooked to these drugs have been saved from drug abuse and addiction, the press release further read.The gang was busted by a Barnala police team, comprising IPS Dr Pragya Jain, ASP Mehal Kalan, SP(D) Sukhdev Virk, DSP (D), Ramninder Deol, CIA in-charge Inspector Baljit Singh, working under the supervision of SSP Barnala Sandeep Goel.The arrests of the 20 men, including one of the cartel’s kingpins, were made from various locations in Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. As many as 27,62,137 intoxicating tablets, capsules, injections and syrup bottles were seized from them, along with drug proceeds money of Rs 70,03,800, said Gupta.Interestingly, the Barnala police, in March 2020, had similarly busted a ‘Mathura Gang’ and seized 44 lakh intoxicants and Rs 1.5 crore drug money/proceeds in the biggest ever such haul by the Punjab police, the press release read.The case began to unravel in May with the arrest of Balwinder Singh, alias Nikka, and four others, along with 2,85,000 intoxicating tablets during an investigation under Sections 21, 22, 25, 29, 61 and 85 of the NDPS Act. This further led to the arrest of Julfikar Ali with 12,000 intoxicating tablets. Julfikar’s questioning revealed the role of Harish as one of the masterminds in the influx and supply of pharmaceutical opioids into Punjab.Following these arrests, the Barnala police spent over two months developing the available leads, laying out elaborate surveillance plans and a trap was then laid out, with a special team being sent to West Bengal from where Harish was nabbed. It was Harish who disclosed the modus operandi of the gang and its chain of supply of psychotropic drugs not only in Punjab but also in over 11 states of the country.Subsequent raids in UP, Haryana Delhi, Punjab led to arrest of other gang members, along with the seizure of a large quantity of pharmaceutical opioids, the drug proceeds-money and vehicles.The DGP said investigations into the gang’s modus operandi so far had revealed that Harish posed as a Medical Representative to establish contact with chemists and pharmacists by using information such as address and phone number, which he easily found over the internet and social media.“The contraband smugglers used a pre-identified network of couriers/transport/goods carriers, operating from major cities namely Delhi, Agra, Amritsar, Jaipur, Gwalior and Bhopal, and delivered consignments to various locations in several states with the help of fake/ undervalued bills using local transporters. Payment and transfer of money were done using the hawala channels, and also through multiple cash transactions into a bank account specially created for this purpose,” the DGP added.The intoxicants seized are mostly pharmaceutical opioids. Many of these pharmaceutical products have legitimate and important medical use; however, these products cannot be sold without a valid medical prescription from a registered medical practitioner. The gang was diverting these intoxicants, which are medically used for pain relief and treatment for opioid dependence, for extra-medical use, which can lead to major drug overdose issues and even deaths.The DGP said the operation carried out by Punjab Police and the huge recovery of pharmaceutical opioids was highly significant and was a major hit to the supply of drugs in Punjab, as according to ‘Magnitude of Substance Use in India-2019’, a study commissioned by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, New Delhi, pharmaceutical opioids (which itself includes a variety of medications of the opioid group) are the second most commonly used opioids in India (0.96 per cent), after heroin, which is the most commonly used opioid in India (1.14 per cent).It is estimated that the harmful use/dependent use of pharmaceutical opioids constitutes about 40 per cent of the drug problem in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-smash-inter-state-drug-cartel-spanning-over-50-districts-arrest-20-persons-117407

24-07-2020||Saurabh Malik||High Court: Marriages being relegated to contracts||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 23When a Moga couple tied the knot two years ago, little did anyone realise that the marriage was allegedly a contract between the two sides. As per terms and conditions, the groom side was to allegedly spend money on facilitating their immigration to Canada. Things went wrong after the bride reached Canada with groom’s side allegedly spending around Rs 30 lakh, but the boy was left behind, leading to registration of a case.Taking a serious view of the matter, Justice Fateh Deep Singh of the High Court asserted that matters where marriages were given a contractual tinge were getting rampant notoriety in Punjab.“However, the courts cannot shut its eyes to such shocking reality whereby marriages are being relegated to contracts for attainment of such sinister designs...,” said Justice Fateh Deep Singh.The matter reached the High Court after the bride’s father filed a petition seeking grant of an anticipatory bail in the FIR registered on March 11 for cheating and criminal conspiracy.The groom had alleged that the marriage was solemnised in August 2018 in accordance with an arrangement. The wife went to Canada, but did not call the husband.Appearing before the Bench through video-conferencing, counsel for the petitioner contended that it was a pure matrimonial dispute. It was by sheer providence that the boy did not qualify for immigration.Opposing the prayer, the state counsel submitted that the accused side committed a serious fraud with the complainant and the custodial interrogation was “very much essential”. The state counsel added they refused to even refund the money spent on the bride’s immigration to Canada.Before parting with the order, the Bench asserted a debatable issue arose over the applicability of Section 420 and his joining the investigation would suffice the purpose. “On his doing so, he shall be released on bail to the satisfaction of the investing officer...,” added Justice Fateh Deep Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-marriages-being-relegated-to-contracts-117077

He urged to form a new SIT to ascertain ‘invisible hand’ behind the “organised massacre”.According to the BJP national secretary, the report submitted by the Justice Dhingra Committee “clearly and unarguably puts forward a case in favour of the petitioners, displaying explicitly how various functionaries of the state, namely, the judiciary, the police and the state, were working hand-in-glove not only to aid such a gruesome hate crime against a minority community but also successfully managed to shirk off the accountability for the same by giving clearance to the accused.”“As the report makes it abundantly clear, it is reiterated that the violence, riots as well as the clearance to the persons involved…were indeed orchestrated and cleared by an invisible hand from the very top of the government in power during that time. It is submitted that instead of holding those responsible for the violence to account, many police officials and other persons involved have been promoted over the last 30 years,” Singh added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/months-after-report-in-84-riots-case-bjp-leader-writes-to-amit-shah-117078

24-07-2020||Ravi Dhaliwal---||In Gurdaspur, active cases down to just 21||Tribune News Service Gurdaspur, July 23 Gurdaspur district has managed to keep the Covid R-naught (R-0) number — the rate at which the infection either increases or decreases — at less than the state’s average of three, which means it has virtually stopped the spread of infection. “R-naught is also called the basic reproduction number. It represents the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case. In other words, if R-naught is 3, then one person with the disease is expected to infect three others. An R-naught below 1, as is the case in this district, means the number of cases is shrinking. An R-naught above 1 indicates that the number of cases is growing,” District Epidemiologist Prabhjot Kaur Kalsi said.  Only those are catching the infection who have been in touch with people from outside the district.  This development was confirmed by Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ishfaq and Civil Surgeon Dr Kishan Chand. Dr Chand confirmed that the number of active cases had gone down from 48 to 21 in 10 days.  “R-naught is calculated from innate features of a disease, like how easily it jumps from one person to the next, along with elements of human behaviour that shape how often people having co-morbidities will come into contact with positive cases,” said Dr Chand. Experts claim that in Gurdaspur, strict adherence to social distancing and stricter use of Section 188 of the IPC (disobeying government orders) have been the two main factors in keeping a check on the spread of the virus. SSP Rajinder Singh Sohal said: “We declared the Police Lines as a temporary jail, where violators are being kept after being booked for not maintaining social distancing.” Even in Batala, a part of this district, the Police Lines have been declared a temporary prison.  Officials said a positive message was sent by the DC a few weeks ago when he publicly pulled up a bank manager for not sticking to rules. “After that incident, all commercial institutions, including banks, fell in line,” a banker said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-gurdaspur-active-cases-down-to-just-21-117081

He alleged that due to the incompetence and inept handling of the situation, the government-run centres were rather unsafe for patients. In a statement, Cheema claimed the Covid care centres in Bathinda, Mansa and Sanghera (Barnala) were in a pitiable condition.The manpower mobilisation exercise was undertaken from July 17 onwards, and as of July 23, 3,669 personnel were part of the 202 reserves in districts, while 475 were in the reserves of the armed battalions, said DGP Dinkar Gupta.The diversion of force has been done from non-core police duties at district police offices, police lines, saanjh kendras, those attached with police and civil officers and officials on temporary attachment with other units.During a Covid review video-conference meeting chaired by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, the DGP said post the exercise, an additional 1,800 police personnel had been mobilised at the police stations across the ranks of constable to inspector. Expressing concern over the rising number of cases, which has now touched 11,739 in the state with 277 deaths, Capt Amarinder Singh today called for extreme caution and directed DGP Gupta to ensure strict enforcement of all norms.Citing the high positivity rate in Ludhiana and Jalandhar, the Chief Minister directed the Health Department to step up surveillance and testing in these districts to contain the spread. Jalandhar currently has the maximum of 18 micro-containment zones, Dr KK Talwar informed the Covid review meeting.Meanwhile, pointing out that 28 police personnel at Nathana police station in Bathinda had tested positive, the DGP advised employees with fever or flu-like symptoms not to come to office but to get themselves tested at the earliest. All 28 cops were primary contacts of an ASI, who had tested positive some days ago, the DGP said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-readies-covid-force-as-cases-spike-117082

A state-wide protest has been launched by all farmer organisations, beginning July 21, and it is now taking political overtones.False narrative: SADDr Daljit Singh Cheema, senior vice-president, SAD, said the party had studied the ordinances in detail and even discussed these with the Union Agriculture Minister. “A false narrative is being created that the ordinances are a step to move away from the MSP regime,” he said.Talking to The Tribune, Sushila Bishnoi, general secretary of the Punjab unit of BKS, said: “Whenever the ordinances are brought up for discussion in the Parliament, we will be raising certain points that fuel apprehensions that these ordinances have been brought in to promote privatisation of mandis. The issue of having a Minimum Support Price (MSP) on all crops that are bought by private or government agencies, within or outside the mandis, will be stressed upon,” she said.Gurdev Singh, organising secretary of the BKS, said: “These ordinances, especially The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, that allows for private players to procure crops outside the mandis in private yards, needs to be amended.”The Sangh is now recommending that amendments be made to ensure that all purchase of crops (by private or government agencies) is done at an MSP; all those operating private market yards be registered by state and Central Governments and made to give a bank security; and independent ‘Kisan courts’ be set up for dealing with any disputes in payments arising between private entities and farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rss-kisan-wing-terms-agri-ordinances-unacceptable-117089

The Congress, in its poll manifesto, had promised to increase the amount from Rs 15,000 to 51,000. In July 2017, the government had increased the shagun amount from Rs 15,000 to Rs 21,000. Under this scheme, the state government provides money for the marriage of a girl whose family’s annual income does not exceed Rs 32,790. The said amount is directly transferred to a bank account of the girl or her family members. Jagmohan Singh Maan, District Welfare Officer, Muktsar, said: “We prepare a report of around 200 cases every month. Shagun money has been paid till April 2019. The department will soon disburse money till October last year.” Barinder Singh, District Welfare Officer, Fazilka, said: “Beneficiaries have not got shagun money after April 2019.” SBS Nagar District Welfare Officer Kamaljit Raju said: “The directorate will soon disburse money till October 2019.” Meanwhile, repeated attempts to contact Devinder Singh, Director, Welfare Department, proved futile. Not just the beneficiaries of the Ashirwaad scheme, but a large number of inter-caste marriage couples have been waiting for Rs 50,000. Some districts have not got even a single penny under this scheme since 2011. The Centre and the state government had introduced the inter-caste marriage scheme to abolish caste consciousness by contributing money on 50:50 basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ashirwaad-scheme-in-limbo-no-benefit-since-april-last-year-117090

He ‘exposed’ the Congress by releasing a copy of the party’s 2017 Assembly election manifesto, which clearly stated that the “party will amend the APMC Act to allow private mandis in the state”.Talking to reporters via video-conferencing here, the SAD president said the Congress was playing politics on the issue by telling farmers that the MSP or assured marketing system would end. “The SAD is a party of farmers. We understand their problems and have always fought for their rights. Let me assure them that the SAD will not stand any discrimination against them. We will not allow anyone to tinker with the MSP system.”Badal said he would take up the issue in Parliament and take an assurance from the Centre in this regard. “I am ready to accompany farm organisations and seek whatever clarifications they need from the Union Agriculture Minister,” he said.‘Govt not utilising funds adequately’The SAD on Thursday asked Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh why the state government was not releasing money from the CM Relief Fund for providing assistance to hospitals and patients affected by Covid-19. Party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said more than Rs64 crore had been collected in a private bank under the CM Relief Fund, but the money was not being utilised for those suffering due to the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wont-allow-tinkering-with-msp-system-sad-117091
