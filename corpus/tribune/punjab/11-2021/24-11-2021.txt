24-11-2021||Chandigarh||AAP questions Punjab CM’s announcement of fixing cable TV connection charges||The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday raised questions on Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s announcement to fix at Rs 100 the monthly charges for a cable TV connection, saying the government should immediately issue a notification if it thinks it can fix these rates.Senior AAP leader and spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang claimed that huge support, which his party is getting from the public ahead of next year’s Punjab assembly polls, has “unnerved” the ruling Congress.As a result of it, the chief minister has been making announcements without any thought, “but in reality nothing is being done on the ground”, Kang claimed.“That is why Chief Minister Channi was being ridiculed by the people as a fake Kejriwal,” he said.About the announcement to fix Rs 100 monthly charge, Kang said, “Let the chief minister tell how it will be possible? When will the notification be issued? Prior to announcing the decision, did Charanjit Singh Channi conduct any study or research on the rules and regulations of the state and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) for cable network operations?“If Chief Minister Channi had given even a little thought to these aspects and facts, he would not have made the ‘Tughlaqi farman’ (diktat) by announcing Rs 100 per cable connection because cable network rates are set by TRAI,” he said.Kang challenged the Channi government to issue an immediate notification about Rs 100 per month for cable connection.“If the government does not do so, the AAP will gherao the chief minister’s residence in the coming days,” he said.Cable Operators’ Association of Punjab also raised questions on the announcement made by the chief minister, saying it is the TRAI which regulates the cable TV industry.Addressing a rally in Ludhiana on Monday, Channi had announced to fix at Rs 100 the monthly charges for a cable TV connection.Now, people need not to pay more than Rs 100 per month and strict action will be taken against those not adhering to the new rates, he had said.“If anyone harasses you, inform me,” Channi said in the rally.

24-11-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu hits out at AAP over poll sops, says people won’t fall prey to populist measures||Targeting the AAP over its sop announcements ahead of the Punjab Assembly elections, state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday said that people won’t fall prey to populist measures without the backing of a policy framework, defined budget allocations and implementation metrics.He said true leaders do not give “lollipops” and instead focus on building the foundations of society and economy.In the run-up to the Punjab polls, Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal has announced a slew of sops for different sections of society.On Monday, during a visit to Punjab, he promised that if the AAP is voted to power, its government will transfer Rs 1,000 per month into the account of every woman in the state and dubbed it the “world’s biggest women empowerment” programme.Earlier, he had promised up to 300 units of free electricity for each household, 24-hour power supply and free treatment and medicines at government hospitals.Speaking to reporters in Amritsar, Sidhu took on Kejriwal for making tall promises to different sections, including the youth and women.He said Kejriwal’s financial assistance scheme for women and other promises will cost thousands of crores of rupees and exceed the state budget.He said the AAP leader is giving “lollipops” to people.Sidhu’s comments came a day after Kejriwal praised the Congress leader for raising public welfare issues.On various announcements made by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi for different sections, Sidhu said, “Whatever our chief minister has said... the party will back him and stand by him.”He said Channi has done in two months what former chief minister Amarinder Singh could not do in four-and-a-half years.“His (Channi’s) intent is right,” the state Congress president said, adding that the chief minister has the party’s backing.Later, in a series of tweets, Sidhu said people won’t “fall prey to populist schemes”.“UPA Govt formulated policies to transform India’s & economy. Today Punjab needs policy-based structural transformation of its economy. People won’t fall prey to populist “schemes” without any backing of policy framework, defined budget allocations & implementation metrics,” he said.The Congress leader said populist schemes are a fast-paced reaction to popular demands, without any thought being given to governance and economy.“History tells (that) populist measures only hurt people in the long run. True leaders will not give lollipops but will focus to build foundations of society and economy,” he said.“Credit games don’t last, they put more baggage of debt and depressed economic growth onto the society. Punjab needs a policy-based redemption and soon every Punjabi will be wealthy and prosperous as we were in earlier times. Punjab model is only way forward!!,” he added.Sidhu, a former minister, said in 2017, he introduced the Punjab Entertainments Taxes Bill before the state cabinet “to end cable mafia to strengthen local operators”.He said he wanted to end the alleged monopoly of one operator, making it pay the due taxes to the government as “only then the benefit of cheaper connections can be transferred to people”.“Will bring solid “policy-based” Punjab model. Give redemption from monopolies formed by Badals, such as Cable mafia. SOPs will empty state-treasure and kill livelihoods but does nothing to truly uplift the poor and eradicate tyranny of Multiple Systems Operator...,” he said.The Punjab Assembly elections will be held early next year.

Besides this, there was also the recovery of an unexploded hand grenade from Zira area.DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota said Singh revealed during questioning that he had founded a group named “Kaum De Rakhe” to collect funds on the pretext of social work. Through this group, Sahota said, he got in touch with various radical and terrorist elements based in UK and other countries through social media and extended his help to form sleeper cells under the garb of his social work. “Ranjit further disclosed that recently he had received a consignment of arms and explosives, and was planning to carry out a terror strike to create an atmosphere of fear and lawlessness in the border state,” he said.The DGP claimed the suspect was also part of a group that had vandalised statues of folk dancers installed at the heritage street leading to Golden Temple Amritsar on January 15, 2020. He had been arrested in connection with one such case and was out on bail when he was arrested in the current case.“Further efforts are being made to ascertain the identity of the UK end, who had arranged the consignment and also his other Indian associates,” ADGP Internal Security RN Dhoke said.Ranjit Singh has been booked for criminal conspiracy (Section 120-B) and concealing design to commit offence punishable with impris­onment (Section 120) of the Indian Penal Code, as well as sections of the Arms Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-claim-they-averted-possible-militant-attack-arrest-one-with-hand-grenades-pistols-342317

24-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre writes to Punjab, Kerala, J-K ,10 other states and UTs over declining Covid testing rates||Amid multiple Covid-19 surges in various countries, the Centre on Wednesday sent out letters to 13 states and UTs including Punjab, witnessing drastic reductions in average daily tests that are critical for determining the level of infection in the community.In a letter to Vikas Garg, Principal Secretary, Health, Punjab on Wednesday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan flagged a nearly three-fold fall in the average daily tests being conducted by the state between May and November.“Punjab has reported 24, 300 average daily tests as of week ending November 22. This is in stark contrast to a high of 71, 257 average daily tests conducted by Punjab in the week between May 17 and 23,” the letter states.The health ministry told the state that in the absence of sustained levels of sufficient testing, it is very difficult to determine the true level of infection spread in a geography.“With the majority of countries seeing multiple surges in Covid cases in recent times and few countries facing even fourth and fifth waves despite high levels of Covid vaccination, there is a need for continued vigil given the unpredictable and contagious nature of the disease. It is therefore important that the state maintains high testing given the recent increase in travelling due to various events such as marriages, festivities, vacations having either recently concluded or underway.The Centre’s letter for need to raise testing has also gone out to Kerala (where average daily tests fell from 2.96 lakh in week ending August 15 to 56071 in week ending November 22), Maharashtra, Mizoram, Manipur, J&K, Goa, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Ladakh, West Bengal, Sikkim and Meghalaya.The health secretary also said that although new cases have declined significantly at a national level, with 10, 195 average daily cases in the week ending November 22, “It has been observed that there has been a corresponding decline in weekly testing rates also”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-writes-to-punjab-kerala-j-k-10-other-states-and-uts-over-declining-covid-testing-rates-342308

Farmer unions will also continue to send groups to the agitation sites till December 7. We have felt that people in rural areas are re-energised and are planning to participate in the protest. Rattan Singh Randhawa, Farmer leader Farmer leaders said the efforts by the associations to mobilise people for the November 26 programme and later for the proposed march towards the parliament coupled with the recent announcements by Prime Minister to repeal the three laws have rejuvenated the agitation.Farmer leaders said the participation at Delhi borders was expected to swell in the coming days. Apart from farmer organisations, Punjab Bachao Sanyukt Morcha, a collegium of social organisations, intellectuals, writers, members of trade unions and employees’ organisations is also mobilising public.The farmers and farmer leaders said it was not logical to end the protest till the farm laws were repealed in parliament and political leaders cannot be held accountable for their statements alone.“In our country, we see that politicians make promises every day but these are seldom fulfilled. The farmer organisations are not ready to take chances and they have to respect the wider public opinion,” a farmer leader said.Sarwan Singh Pandher of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee said: “The government is planning to delay the decision on the bill to ensure MSP by forming a committee which is not accepted to farmers.” He said now farmers were free and would join the protests in large numbers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/done-with-sowing-of-wheat-farmers-all-set-for-delhi-now-342017

He corrected CM Channi by telling him sand was still being sold at Rs20 per cubic feet, not Rs5. — Arvind Kejriwal, AAp National ConvenerHe said Sidhu rightly pointed out that sand continued to be sold at Rs 20 per cubic feet, instead of Rs 5, as announced by the state government. “He always raises issues in public interest, but faces pressure from his own party,” he said.Kejriwal said before every election, it was claimed that the state’s coffers had run dry. “After governing the state for five years, leaders of the ruling dispensation are once again making the same claim. If we come to power, we will probe the matter and set the house in order,” he said.The AAP chief alleged CM Channi was often seen with people involved in the sand and transport mafia. “The state’s financial problem will be resolved if he manages his Cabinet,” he said. On freebies being promised by the AAP, he said: “All Punjab ministers are getting 3,000 units of free electricity. If we are offering 300 units to the common man, what’s wrong in it?”The Delhi CM called for reforms in education and detailed eight promises, including ending outsourcing and contract system of hiring staff, new transfer policy as per teachers’ convenience, no non-teaching jobs for them and timely recruitment and promotion.During a meeting with traders, businessmen and industrialists as part of AAP’s ‘Kejriwal di Galbaat’ programme, Kejriwal later announced seven guarantees for trade, commerce and industrial development.These included setting up of a commission, abolishing ‘inspector raj’, fixing VAT refunds, ensuring power supply, setting up of Punjab Bazaar portal, improving law and order and construction and development of focal points.He said: “Punjab’s land has great potential to revolutionise. But due to the wrong policies of the Congress and SAD, youth are going abroad.

An announcement is expected soon. — Senior Party LeaderCautious of AAP chief’s attack on the “real aam aadmi” narrative of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and his efforts to reach out to the urban voter, the Congress leadership, after playing the Dalit Sikh card by naming Channi as the CM, is now going out all out to woo its Hindu leaders.“Having worked to bring CM Channi and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on the same page, efforts are on to give a big responsibility to former PCC chief Sunil Jakhar. An announcement in this regard in expected soon,” confirmed a senior party leader privy to the development.The party leadership wants to launch its election campaign for the 2022 Assembly elections by projecting the combination of Channi, Sidhu and Jakhar. At this juncture, party leaders do not want to declare Channi or Sidhu as the chief ministerial face as it could lead to fresh trouble.Only yesterday, CM Channi and the PCC chief along with Punjab affairs incharge Harish Chaudhary were called to Delhi for a meeting with AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal.Given the developments over the past few days, the party leadership feels the SAD is also trying to woo Hindu and OBC vote banks. The switching over of Congress’ Hindu leaders to the SAD was an indication in this regard. Chaudhary has already started touring the urban segments in a bid to mollify disgruntled leaders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/to-woo-hindu-voter-congress-plans-big-role-for-sunil-jakhar-342038

Directions were also issued to permit the petitioner to provisionally ply the buses. Orbit Aviation is believed to be Badals-run company.Payment of duesThe directions by the Bench of Justices Ajay Tewari and Pankaj Jain came on the petition seeking the quashing of 30 impugned orders dated November 12 passed by the RTA on the ground of being arbitrary, against the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and violation of the principles of natural justice.Appearing before the Bench for the petitioner, senior advocate Puneet Bali with counsel Surjeet Bhadu, Vaibhav Jain and Shivam submitted the competent authority permitted the company to pay government dues of Rs 77,15,061 in four monthly instalments originally by the order dated October 11.The petitioner paid the first instalment. But the order on permission to pay an instalment was revoked vide another order dated October 18. The petitioner was directed to pay the taxes in lump sum. The petitioner by November 15 paid entire tax up to November 30. But before that, the petitioner’s permit was cancelled on November 12.Accepting notice issued by the court, Punjab Advocate General DS Patwalia pointed out the petitioner did not pay a single penny after the order dated October 18. It did not submit an application informing the government of intention to make full payment and did not even file an appeal against the order. The respondents were, as such, constrained to cancel the permit, in view of default in payment. The petitioner had made the payment thereafter. As such, its “bona fides were suspect”.The Bench asserted once the petitioner had been permitted to make the payment in instalments, a notice was required to be issued for withdrawing the order.“It is not disputed by the Advocate General now as matter stands the petitioner has paid the entire tax amount due till November 30. The matter has been adjourned to the week commencing after November 29. Since now the tax has been paid till November 30, we deem it appropriate to direct the respondents to release the buses forthwith and to permit the petitioner to provisionally ply them,” the Bench observed. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-orders-release-of-orbit-buses-342044

A parallel meeting was held at MP Preneet Kaur’s New Moti Bagh Palace, where over 18 councillors were present. Bittu, who wants to contest from Patiala (rural) (a constituency represented by Mohindra), has accepted the challenge to prove majority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-mayor-sanjeev-sharma-faces-rebellion-342046

People living in the border districts and transporters purchased fuel from states where it was cheaper. Gurmeet Monty Sehgal, spokesperson, petrol pump dealers’ ASSN PunjabReason: Costlier fuel prices due to higher value added tax (VAT) compared to the neighbouring states. This resulted in higher sales in Haryana, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh, where the fuel rates were cheaper.According to estimates, the industry in Punjab spent over Rs 2,500 crore extra on account of road transportation as the train services were disrupted for over two months.It was only on November 7, the Punjab Government reduced the VAT on petrol from 27.27 per cent to 13.77 per cent and that on diesel from 17.53 per cent to 9.92 per cent.The state government claimed with the decision, Punjab now had the lowest petrol rates in the region (barring UT Chandigarh) and the rates of diesel were also much lower than in Haryana and Rajasthan. Prior to that, VAT on petrol and diesel was highest in Punjab.“The farm agitation did not have much impact on fuel sales. In fact, it was higher fuel prices and higher VAT that proved to be a dampener,” said Gurmeet Monty Sehgal, spokesperson, Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association Punjab.According to him, the overall impact on the sales was 10-15 per cent. Notably, the annual consumption of petrol and diesel in Punjab as per 2019-20 figures is 13,52,260 kilolitre and 38,86,897 kL, respectively.According to truck owners, vehicles used to get refuelled in states where the fuel rates were cheaper, as the cost of transportation went up by almost 50 per cent. Around 800 fuel stations in the border districts of Mohali, Ropar, Pathankot, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur, Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib were the worst hit.The average monthly sale of petrol and diesel in Punjab was 90 kL per fuel station from April to September. To sustain, a fuel station should on an average sell 100 kL. Around 72 per cent or 2,492 pumps were selling less than 100 kL per month.In Haryana, which has 3,130 petrol stations, the monthly sale was around 155 kL per fuel station.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/higher-fuel-cost-cut-into-profit-of-punjab-filling-stations-342047

Before the government announced capping of sand prices at Rs 5.50 per cubic feet, it was being sold between Rs 26 and Rs 28 per cubic feet.Lovepreet Singh, assistant district mining officer, said the high rate of sand in the retail market was due to high transportation charges from the mining sites to the dealers. The Rs 5.50 per cubic feet rate is fixed at the sand pihead and includes loading charges, he said. But due to the inflated rates of diesel, the transportation charges of sand from the pithead to the retail market were quite high, he said.The transporters were not allowed to charge arbitrary rates. They were bound to charge the transportation charges as those fixed by Mineral Sale Management and Monitoring System in the State Water Resources Department (Mining and Geology), he said. It is a kilometre-based transportation rate fixed by the department. For one to 10 km, transportation charges range between Rs 64 and Rs 164 per metric tonne. The transportation charges for 10 to 30 km range between Rs 164 to Rs 275 per MT. For 40 km, the transportation charges are Rs 300 per MT. Most of the sand mining sites are situated within the radius of 40 km in this area.The retail dealers in Faridkot said they were getting sand at Rs 18 to Rs 20 per cubic feet from the suppliers and transporters and further selling it between Rs 23 and Rs 26 to the customers in retail. While the state government is highly vocal about capping the sand rates at the mining sites, there is no word about the highly inflated transportation charges.Though the government in its policy on November 10 announced that a consumer was free to take his own transport, these vehicles are not allowed at mining sites. “It is the transport mafia in place of sand mafia now, and there is no relief to the end user, the high claims of the state government notwithstanding,” claimed retail dealers of sand and gravel in Faridkot, preferring anonymity.As a cartel of transporters, having political lineage, is supplying the sand among the retailers, in reality no consumer or retailer is allowed to use his private vehicle for transportation from the pitheads, the retailers claimed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sand-rates-belie-punjab-govt-claim-on-capping-charges-342052
