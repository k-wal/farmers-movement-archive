On the other hand, officials of the cooperative societies claimed there was adequate supply of DAP and that they were distributing it in a phased manner.A representative of the Punjab State Cooperative Societies Employees’ Union said, “More than 100 cooperative societies of total 193 are running dry in Bathinda district while the rest of them are left with a small quantity of the fertiliser… Apart from the short supply in cooperative societies, unlike during previous seasons, farmers are not getting the fertiliser from private sellers as well.”Protest outside Lehra SDM office todaySangrur: Farmers have decided to protest in front of Lehra SDM office on Friday to press for the supply of DAP, crop loss relief to growers and against the closure of paddy purchase centres. “In coming days, we will intensify the stir if the government fails to take a quick action to fulfil our demands,” said Ram Singh Dhindsa, BKU Ugrahan, Lehra block president.EFFORTS ON TO END fertiliser shortageThe crunch will end in coming days, especially after the government announcement on 70% of DAP being provided by cooperatives and 30% by private sellers.

12-11-2021||Aman Sood||Farm fires rage in Punjab but no FIR yet||Tribune News ServiceFatehgarh Sahib, November 11Amid political slugfest ahead of the upcoming Vidhan Sabha polls, farmers, backed by several unions, are resorting to stubble burning more actively than last year. The state has witnessed over 55,000 farm fires to date with over 30 per cent fields in Malwa belt yet to be cleared for wheat sowing.Against the Rs 65 lakh environmental compensation imposed on erring farmers, merely Rs 80,000 has been collected with 90 per cent of that amount collected in SBS Nagar, while other districts have turned a blind eye to the issue. In Fatehgarh Sahib and Patiala, many highways were choked due to burning crops and industrial pollution adding to the smog.Interestingly, the police have also not taken farm fires seriously and not even a single FIR has been registered against defaulters. With the Assembly elections just three months away, Punjab has decided to go soft on paddy straw burning.Every season, district magistrates order banning paddy stubble under Section 144 of the CrPC and the violator is liable to face action under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated) of the IPC. In addition, the government can impose Rs 1,500 per acre as environmental compensation.Insiders, however, say that it is not that easy to fine farmers and take legal action against them as farmer unions are already threatening to launch agitation if fined. “Just by appointing administrative secretaries to check stubble burning in districts, the government can only request farmers as any action against them will be futile as they (erring farmers) neither pay fine nor can be arrested,” they said.With polls round the corner, politicians across party lines are already opposed to the drive to challan farmers who burnt stubble.“We are not against a ban on stubble burning, but farmers should be compensated for the additional Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 per acre cost,” said Satnam S Behru, chief of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association. “Farmers are already burdened and the authorities must show them a financially viable way to stop stubble burning,” he said.“We are keeping a tab and monitoring the situation,” said PPCB Member Secretary Karunesh Garg.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-fires-rage-in-punjab-but-no-fir-yet-336919

Raikot MLA Jagtar Singh Jagga Hissowal, who had returned to the party fold after rebelling in 2018, proclaimed in the House he was happy to see a common man rising to be the Chief Minister (referring to Channi) and accepted him “as his CM”, leaving the AAP MLAs stunned.Two Bills on farm laws approvedCivil war may happenThis is a serious issue. If this fiscal condition is not reversed, the state can plunge into civil war. —Navjot Sidhu, PCC chiefAs CM Charanjit Singh Channi asked the House if they realised how a common man had risen from the ranks to be the CM, Jagga switched sides. This drew a sharp reaction from AAP MLA Aman Arora, who demanded to know how the Congress and Speaker could allow such blatant defection. With this, the strength of AAP MLAs in the House gone down to 11, besides Kanwar Sandhu, who continues to be a rebel and four others who have joined the Congress. Rupinder Kaur Ruby had joined the Congress yesterday. Interestingly, the SAD MLAs were also named by Speaker Rana KP Singh after their heated exchanges with CM Channi. During the discussion on the two Bills related to farm laws, the CM pointing towards Majithia accused him of being involved with “bad elements”. To this, Akali MLAs rose and rushed towards the CM’s seat, speaking about his previous scandal. The Congress MLAs, too, rushed to Channi’s rescue. As heated exchanges continued between the two sides, the Speaker adjourned the House. With things continuing to worsen, and senior minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Akali MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala unsuccessfully trying to restore peace, the House was adjourned twice more. The Speaker then summoned the Akali MLAs to his chamber and tried to broker peace. But as soon as the proceedings resumed, the Akalis demanded an apology.

As Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa moved the resolution and the Opposition benches took on CM Charanjit Singh Channi for his complicity in issuing of the notification.Can’t differentiatePeople playing up jurisdiction issue can’t differentiate between law & order and national security. —Capt Amarinder Singh, Former CMCong pleasing isiThe Congress seems to be pleasing its mentors in the ISI by passing such anti-national resolutions. —Tarun Chugh, BJP Gen SecySAD leader Bikram Majithia pointed out that the Congress was divided on the issue as MP Manish Tewari’s tweets showed that he supported the notification and former PCC chief Sunil Jakhar had questioned Channi over the outcome of his meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah.SAD (Sankuyt) leader Parminder Dhindsa and AAP Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema questioned the timing of the notification after Channi met Shah.Majithia asked the Cabinet to decide that it would not allow the BSF to interfere in the functioning of the Punjab Police.

But in 2007, the mode was changed to a build, operate and own basis, ensuring the private producers also got other assets from the government by changing the mode of construction and operation,” Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal told The Tribune.The White Paper also mentions a lesser levelised tariff was arrived at by assuming high calorific value of coal, thus forcing the PSPCL to pay higher costs to power companies.VB to probe pactsThe government will soon get all cases of graft and malpractices, including the PPAs, during the SAD-BJP regime probed by the Vigilance Department to fix the responsibility.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bill-allowing-punjab-govt-to-scrap-ppas-cleared-336894
12-11-2021||Rajmeet Singh||Punjab CM Channi leads from front, shows floor management skills||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 11From setting the narrative of being an “aam aadmi” icon to taking Opposition heavyweight politicians “head on” in the Assembly on the concluding day of the two-day special session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi asserted his authority as the leader of the Congress Legislative Party today.Displaying apt skills in manoeuvring through the Opposition’s onslaught to overshadowing PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, CM Channi adopted an aggressive stance as he tore into the SAD, led by Bikram Majithia. Taking on an already depleted AAP in the House, CM Channi targeted party national convener Arvind Kejriwal for being “an outsider who does not understand the dilemma of the Punjabis”.Interestingly, CM Channi was seen keeping Sidhu in good humour by repeatedly referring to and defending him during a discussion on the legislation of termination/renegotiation of the power purchase agreements (PPAs) and resolution to reject the three central farm laws, as he displayed his oratory skills to blame the Akalis for various “acts of omission and commission”.At one point, CM Channi and Sidhu were seen jointly attacking the Akalis, much to the respite of the party high command, which is looking to utilise the combination of Channi’s “aam aadmi” image and Sidhu’s “aggressive” style in the run-up to the Assembly elections.Punctuating his verbal attack with couplets and quotes from religious scriptures, CM Channi launched a scathing attack on the Akalis, accusing them of pushing Punjab’s youth towards drugs. Barring certain objectionable remarks attributed to Majithia, Channi displayed effective floor management skills as he took on the Opposition benches with support of his MLAs.Political analysts believe CM Channi’s political journey has come a full circle, from being ridiculed in the previous term for his “patchwork” comment as the Leader of the Opposition in 2016 to now taking on the Opposition.Jakhar takes a dig at AAPCongress leader Sunil Jakhar has taken a dig at the AAP for failing to announce its Chief Minister face. “‘A suitable Sikh match required’ (No, this is not for a matrimonial alliance). It’s how AAP was planning to look for a Sikh CM candidate on OLX,” he tweeted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-channi-leads-from-front-shows-floor-management-skills-336897
12-11-2021||Chandigarh||Meetings with Modi, Shah courtesy call: Punjab CM Channi||Taking on the Akali rank and file, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Thursday termed it unfortunate that the SAD always saw everything through the “narrow prism of politics”, especially issues of utmost importance to Punjab such as devolution of powers to states, transfer of Chandigarh to Punjab, besides the Anandpur Sahib resolution.Accusing the Akalis of being power hungry, the CM said they always adopted the use-and-throw policy.SAD Power hungryThe Akalis have joined hands with the BSP just to return to power. Earlier, they left BSP when BJP came into power at the Centre. —Charanjit Singh Channi, CMSpeaking during the 16th session of the 15th Punjab Vidhan Sabha, the Chief Minister came all guns blazing at the Akalis, saying they were the gateway through which the RSS managed to make inroads into the state. “When the RSS and its political wing the BJP undermined the federal structure of the country by revoking Article 370, not only did the Akalis take sides with the BJP, but the SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal spoke in favour of the move and even went to the extent of not voting against the move,” said Channi, holding the Akalis responsible for imposition of such decisions on Punjab.Effectively silencing the criticism hurled at him on meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, Channi said his meetings with the two were a courtesy call. “Perhaps the Akalis have chosen to forget that I wrote to the Centre emphasising the reopening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor, besides pleading with it to roll back the three farm laws, which are striking at the very roots of the farming sector.”The CM further apprised the House that during his meetings with the Centre on security issues, he took the consistent stand that the International Border should be sealed so that drugs could not enter Punjab. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/meetings-with-modi-shah-courtesy-call-punjab-cm-channi-336899

However, Batala-based advocates welcomed Bajwa’s proposal. Earlier, during the tenure of Capt Amarinder Singh as CM, the MP had written a letter to him on the issue. The proposal died a natural death after Capt Amarinder was removed as the CM. Partap is eyeing the Batala Assembly seat to contest the 2022 poll. He has already made it clear that he is interested in state politics. In a letter addressed to CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Partap said, “Batala has a rich religious, cultural, literary and economic history. Over the years, the city has grown and for it to be better governed, it needs to be made an independent district.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/declare-batala-district-partap-singh-bajwa-writes-to-punjab-cm-336911
