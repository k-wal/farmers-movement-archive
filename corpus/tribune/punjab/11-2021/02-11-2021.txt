It is the say of the petitioner that they are older persons and they can be accommodated. They could have made a further representation if they are so pleased. It is not as if the petitioner is not being permitted to visit but their proposal is sought through the channel of the State Government of Punjab for the period in question.“We are thus of the view that there is no infringement of the Constitutional right for invocation of the jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India which would enable us to interfere with the aforesaid process. The writ petition is dismissed accordingly,” the bench said.The counsel for the Gurdwara Sahib Dasmesh Darbar submitted that some other Jathas have been permitted earlier and the petitioner’s Jatha of 55 people must be permitted along with the Jathas which have visits planned earlier.However, the apex court in its October 29 order said the decision forms part of the practical administrative domain of the government.

02-11-2021||Amritsar||Remembering ’84 with changed perspective||Every year 31st October brings back memories of the dreadful pogrom against Sikhs that haunt not only the families of the victims but on vast majority, who witnessed the events as outsiders. Majha House, in order to honour the memories of those whose lives were lost and uprooted during the period held a session titled 1984/ Chaurasi. Activist and author Gurmeher Kaur, former diplomat Navtej Sarna, author and artist Sunil Mehra, Ishmeet Kaur Chaudhary, SS Behl, Ujjal Dosanjh and Saif Mahmood were part of the session.“Even today, thirty-seven years down the line, makes us wonder about how we should deal with it, talk about it and voice our right to justice. We want to remember that time. And as we remember we stand by those innocents who bore the brunt of the political fever of the times,” said Preeti Gill, founder, Majha House, while opening the conversation.Prof SS Behl, academician and poet, recited a heartening poem titled “Ehh Meri Atam Katha”. It was a historical reference on the changing narrative and perception around minorities and Sikhs over the period of time, whether it is 1947 or 1984.Saif Mahmood, lawyer and author, recited letters of Ghalib and how the situation he described during the 1857 mutiny was similar to what happened in 1984. Sunil Mehra and Navtej Sarna read stories of victims of 1984 riots from Delhi and how they were left on streets, without a home or a sense of belonging.Gurmeher said, “We are here not to scratch the wounds but to honour their memories. The Sikh community is not the one to whine but we need to understand the pain that an entire community had to face.”Canada-based author said, “Religion had no place in my heart before 1984. But after 1984, I had to say publicly that come from Sikh family and I completely discouraged any kind of violence that was being perpetrated.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/remembering-84-with-changed-perspective-333216

Rather, Punjab needs a clear roadmap to improve its fiscal health by ending the loot by the cable mafia and others like sand mafia.”Sidhu, who had so far been pushing for the replacement of Advocate General (AG) APS Deol, also doesn’t seem to be amused at reports of CM Channi looking to replace the AG under pressure from various Sikh groups objecting to his appointment. Though the AG has denied having resigned, sources in the CM’s office said as and when the AG is replaced, the party leadership does not want to give the credit to Sidhu.“Though the issues of high power tariff, and replacing the AG and DGP have been flagged by the PCC chief from time to time, he has not been taken on board when the decisions are announced. The party high command needs to clarify its stand on Sidhu as the elections are round the corner,” said a senior party leader.In the backdrop of the differences between the two leaders, Punjab affairs incharge Harish Chaudhary held a meeting with the PCC chief at minister Pargat Singh’s residence late this evening.Instead of sharing the stage with CM Channi when the important announcements were made, Sidhu was seen speaking at a function of the Sanyukt Hindu Mahasabha, an NGO, organised by Ashwani Sekhri, Chairman, Punjab System health Corporation.Taking on ex-CM Capt Amarinder Singh, Sidhu said Punjabis needed to rise above political parties and select the most suitable person as their leader. Sekhri, whose aim was to create a platform for Punjab’s Hindu community so that their voice is heard, said: “CM Channi is surrounded by the same coterie that used to be around Captain as a result Punjab is being neglected. Our aim is to break the coterie around the CM.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/need-to-improve-fiscal-health-navjot-singh-sidhu-333052

There has never been any concern over the ‘CM’s post’ or any ‘position’ in the party, but for issues concerning the state. Anyone who addresses the issues of liquor and sand, and offers better healthcare and education should be the CM.“When issues are being resolved efficiently by the Chief Minister and his Cabinet, it needs to be appreciated. Sidhu has never been annoyed with the working, but has been demanding rollback of wrong decisions such as AG’s appointment as he appeared for Saini,” she said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tussle-over-issues-not-chair-says-navjot-kaur-sidhu-333053

The latest reduction in power tariff by Rs 3 per unit for those having a load of up to 7 KW will put an additional burden of Rs 3,316 crore on the exchequer.Also read: Punjab slashes power tariff by Rs 3 per unitPoll play by partiesRelease duesIt is good that people are getting relief, but what about PSPCL? We have a huge unpaid subsidy bill. — Jasbir Singh Dhiman, PSEBThe big question is how Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) will manage its operations, considering the poor credit history it shares with the state government. For years now, the subsidy amount of any given year has been carried forward to the next fiscal.Earlier, the Channi government announced a waiver of Rs 1,500 crore worth of pending bills of consumers having upto 2 KW load and also reduced the fixed charges on medium-scale industry by 50 percent, adding another subsidy of Rs 150 crore.This fiscal’s power subsidy is Rs 10,668 crore, besides around Rs 7,000 crore of unpaid subsidy from the previous years. The government has to clear a subsidy of Rs 17,796 crore by March 2022. Eight months, the government is still to pay Rs 4,960 crore of subsidy to PSPCL.As on November 1, it is paying Rs 600 crore a month as subsidy. As calculated at the time of the Budget, the government should be releasing Rs 1,483 crore each month to clear the subsidy bill. With the additional subsidy burden of nearly Rs 5,000 crore (this year, only Rs 2,083 crore will have to be paid from November to March, provided this is okayed by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission), the power subsidy burden is clearly becoming unbearable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/power-tariff-cut-to-put-rs-5k-cr-burden-333057

The test was conducted again on October 24 with a relatively easy question paper but this time, the number of qualified candidates could not cross 220. Now, for the admission on the vacant seats, the first priority would be given to students on the basis of their score in the PPMET, followed by students who did not appear in the test but belong to Punjab and lastly, to students who belong to any other state in the country.It is not only the nursing course where the colleges are facing shortage of students, even in the post graduate nursing courses (MSc), there are only 35 candidates who took admission against the availability of about 520 seats in different nursing institutes in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/4-500-nursing-seats-go-begging-baba-farid-university-eases-admission-norms-333058

To date, environment compensation of Rs 25.17 lakh has been imposed on such farmers.“There is a marked improvement due to various factors, including more machinery in the fields and awareness drives,” Garg said, adding: “However, our main focus is to bring down the area under farm fires and keep a check on such activities. It is crucial time.”Punjab on Sunday reported 2,895 farm fires, highest this season, which is almost half of that until the corresponding date last year. Over 1,000 cases are being reported daily for the past few days and officials expect the numbers to go up around Diwali, affecting the air quality.Meanwhile, agriculture department officials confirm that the number of farm fires will spike by over 1,500-2,000 per day in the next few days as the window between sowing wheat and getting rid of stubble narrows. “Rain spell last week delayed farm fires and now a spike is expected,” they said.“Erring farmers, backed by politically inclined farmer unions, refuse to deposit fines and even take officials hostage when they are approached in that connection. Investigation in many cases is still pending as the farmer unions have threatened agitation if their members are harassed,” said an official. “With elections approaching, not many officials are willing to act sternly against erring farmers,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/area-under-farm-fires-down-25-but-cases-up-in-punjab-333062
02-11-2021||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Farm fire incidents in Punjab: At 2,895, Sunday spike steepest||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, November 1The farm fire incidents surged to 14,920 as the state witnessed the highest single-day spike with 2,895 cases reported on Sunday alone, followed by 1,796 today.The central and state governments have implemented several policy measures ranging from subsidising crop residue management (CRM) machines to providing cash incentives and banning crop residue burning. But, stubble burning still persists.LS Kurinji and Srish Parkash of Council on Energy, Environment and Water, New Delhi, did a study on why stubble continues to be burnt in Punjab and observed that paddy continues to dominate Punjab’s kharif crop mix despite years of efforts to diversify. The area under paddy in Punjab during the kharif season in 2021 is 30.66 lakh hectare, only 2.6 per cent lower than 31.49 lakh hectare in 2020.Area under the age-old late-maturing PUSA 44 variety, which has a high straw load of paddy, has declined considerably. However, it is still a dominant variety in districts where burning is frequent.Punjab has seen a dramatic increase in the deployment of in-situ crop residue management. By 2020, Punjab had established 19,834 custom hiring centres and deployed 76,626 CRM machines. Sangrur has the maximum number of happy and super seeders, followed by Muktsar, Bathinda, and Mansa. If deployed at full capacity, the existing stock of happy seeders and super seeders can manage up to 17 lakh hectares, which correspond to 66 per cent of area sown under non-basmati variety, in 2021. However, their adoption is limited and utilisation remains inefficient.The rental or custom hiring model of machines is picking pace but logistical challenges and behavioural issues are keeping it from reaching its full potential.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-fire-incidents-in-punjab-at-2-895-sunday-spike-steepest-333063

02-11-2021||Saurabh Malik||Society grappling with drug menace: Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 1Amidst claims by state agencies of earnest efforts to arrest the flow of narcotics, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that society was grappling with the drug menace and it was required to be brought to an end at the earliest.The assertion came as Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi of the High Court dismissed an anticipatory bail plea of an accused in a case registered on September 26 under the provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act at the Kotkapura City police station in Faridkot district.“In the facts and circumstances of the case, in order to elicit the truth, the custodial interrogation of the petitioner is necessary. Keeping in view the fact that the drug menace is grappling the society and the same needs to be curbed at the earliest, no ground is made out for grant of anticipatory bail. The petition is hereby dismissed,” Justice Sethi asserted.The petitioner in the case had submitted that the benefit of bail may be extended to him as contraband was not recovered. He was arrested on the basis of disclosure statement made by co-accused, from whom 1,850 intoxicant tablets were recovered. His counsel had submitted that the petitioner was ready to cooperate after joining the investigation.Punjab state counsel, on the other hand, submitted it had come on record in the disclosure statement of the co-accused that they had purchased the intoxicant tablets from the petitioner. Even the sale consideration of the contraband was disclosed in the statement. Therefore, his custodial interrogation was necessary to find out the source. The state counsel submitted the petitioner was also facing another case for violating the provisions of the NDPS Act.After hearing counsel for the parties and going through the record, Justice Sethi asserted: “The source of the contraband needs to be elicited during the investigation. Even the Supreme Court in the judgment ‘State represented by CBI versus Anil Sharma’, has held that in case where serious allegations have been alleged and the truth needs to be elicited from the accused, the same can only be done through custodial interrogation as compared to questioning the suspect, who is already on anticipatory bail.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/society-grappling-with-drug-menace-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-333078

Irrigation officials have started the repair work to plug the breach.BKU Dakonda block president Gurdeep Singh said: “The breach and subsequent mixing of sewage water with the canal tributary channel has left residents of five villages perturbed. This points towards the lack of preparedness and laxity on the part of the Irrigation Department.”“The closure of the Sirhind canal for repair resulted in the drying of its tributary channels and this exposed the leakage near Jassi Pauwali village. It is, however, unknown for how long this leakage has been there as it was not detectable during regular flow of canal water and the leakage was at the base of sludge carrier,” he said.Bhinder Singh, a Naruana village resident, said: “The sludge carrier had been a breeding ground for several diseases. We don’t even know for how long this leakage has been there and we have been supplied contaminated water.”XEN Sandeep Singh Mangat said: “We had sent our workers and got the leakage plugged. We will carry out repair if similar problem arises again. If there is a problem from the sludge carrier’s end, the MC must see to it.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/breach-in-sludge-carrier-water-supply-to-6-bathinda-villages-hit-333085

The Chief Minister, too, has not talked about it and no such talk has come from the Chief Minister’s Office. The speculation (on resignation) keeps going on. Sometimes some pressures are built, but there is nothing of the sort,” Deol asserted.Sources in Deol’s office in the morning, on the other hand, had claimed that the senior advocate had handed over his resignation to the CM.A senior government functionary in the CMO said as and when the resignation of the AG comes, it would be tabled in the Cabinet before being forwarded to the Punjab Governor.Deol was appointed after the post fell vacant following Atul Nanda’s resignation soon after Capt Amarinder Singh stepped down as Chief Minister. His appointment had generated debate since the beginning as he was, at one point of time, the counsel for former Director General of Police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and Inspector General (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal, both accused in the Behbal Kalan police firing case.The appointment had come as a surprise as incidents of sacrilege and subsequent police firing in Faridkot district’s Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015 have always been considered politically sensitive.It had also led to a legal debate on the issue of conflict of interest primarily on the ground that Deol, having been Saini and Umranangal’s counsel, would neither be able to appear nor advise the state in their cases and related matters.In an attempt to settle the storm, senior advocate RS Bains was appointed special public prosecutor for the politically sensitive sacrilege matters.

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu attacks those who offer ‘lollipops’ for seeking votes ahead of polls||Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday hit out at politicians who offer “lollipops” just ahead of polls, in an apparent attack on his own party-led government in the state, and urged people to vote only on the agenda of Punjab’s welfare.His remarks came on a day when Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi announced slashing of the power tariff by Rs 3 per unit for the domestic sector and increasing the dearness allowance for government employees.Addressing a gathering of the Hindu Mahasabha here, Sidhu wondered if anybody would talk about the welfare of the state.“They (politicians) offer lollipops...this is free, that is free, which happened in the last two months (ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls slated to be held early next year),” he said.The cricketer-turned-politician asked people to question those politicians as regards how would they fulfil such promises.Stressing on a roadmap for the revival and welfare of the state, he asked people to cast their votes on the agenda of development, not for “lollipops”.“There should be a question in your mind whether the intention is only government formation or coming to power after speaking lies, making 500 promises or the welfare of the state,” Sidhu said.He said politics has become a profession and it is no longer a mission.“It is my objective to bring back people’s trust, which has faded away from a politician,” the Congress leader said while pointing out that parents do not want their children to become politicians these days.He said he would die but never sell Punjab’s interests.Sidhu said Punjab had an outstanding debt of Rs 5 lakh crore and blamed the governments that ruled the state over the last 25-30 years for this.Municipal committees and government rest houses were mortgaged, he said, adding that this debt is to be paid by the people of the state.“Wherever there is talk of compromise, Sidhu throws away the post so that your trust is not broken. For me, it is a ‘dharm yudh’ (battle of principles) and I cannot be defeated in this ‘dharm yudh’, I know this,” he said.The Congress leader also took on those who say the state’s coffers are filled.“If that is the situation, then give Rs 50,000 as salary to the ETT (Elementary Teacher Training) teachers and give it (the money) to the contractual teachers,” he said.

02-11-2021||New Delhi||AAP calls Punjab govt's decision to slash power tariff a 'poll stunt', 'chunavi jumla'||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday dubbed Punjab government's decision to reduce power tariff as "a poll stunt", alleging that the move is aimed at "buying" votes in the runup to the assembly elections early next year.Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here, co-convenor of the AAP's political affairs in Punjab, Raghav Chadha, also cautioned people of the state against falling in the trap of the Congress government under Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.Diwali gift: Power tariff slashed by Rs 3 per unit in PunjabHe alleged that the Punjab government has slashed the power tariff just a few months ahead of the polls only to "cover-up" its failures on various fronts in the past four and half years of its term and secure votes by "misleading and fooling" them.The AAP leader also mocked the Punjab chief minister over the slashing of power tariff, saying the decision was taken as Channi was "scared of" Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's promise of providing free and uninterrupted electricity to the people of Punjab.This came soon after the Punjab Cabinet decided to slash power tariff by Rs 3 per unit for domestic consumers. Announcing the decision, the chief minister said it was "a big Diwali gift" to the people of the state."It's a chunavi stunt (poll stunt) and a jumla (rhetoric) by Channi Sahab ahead of assembly elections in February-March next year. Decision to slash the power tariff has been taken with intent to fool people and secure their votes,” Chadha charged.He said the Punjab chief minister's "poll stunt" will be over by the end of the current fiscal as the revised power tariff will remain effective only till March 31, 2022."I want to caution people of Punjab that they should not fall in the trap of the 'chunavi stunt' and 'chunavi jumla' of Channi sahab. He is doing it because he wants to buy your votes,” Chadha said.The AAP leader said the Congress government has slashed the power tariff "to lure voters" in the run up to the assembly polls as "Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi was scared of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's promise of providing free and uninterrupted electricity to people (if voted to power)." "It's only Kejriwal who can provide 24X7 free electricity to people," he added.Training guns at the Congress, Chadha said power tariff was the "highest" in Punjab but no relief was given to the people of the state by the government until so far.Questioning the motive of the Punjab government behind the decision at this point in time, he also asked why power tariff has not been reduced simultaneously in other Congress-ruled states."If it was there in the Congress vision to provide electricity to people at a cheaper rate, it would have done so in all the states ruled by it where elections are not due next year," he said.Chadha alleged that the Congress government has been misleading people in Punjab with its "lies and false promises" for the past four and a half years.The people of Punjab are now ready to give their mandate to the AAP in the upcoming assembly elections, he asserted."Capt Amarinder Singh (former Punjab chief minister) had launched a campaign for farmers loan waiver. He did not waive the loan of the farmer with whom he had posed for a picture...Congress only knows fraud, cheating and loot," he charged.Punjab's assembly elections are due early next year. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-calls-punjab-govts-decision-to-slash-power-tariff-a-poll-stunt-chunavi-jumla-332903

There are around 72 lakh domestic consumers in the state.The announcement was made by CM Charanjit Singh Channi after a Cabinet meeting."We are reducing power tariff by Rs 3 per unit for domestic consumers," said Channi addressing the media here.It is a "big Diwali gift" for people, he said, adding that the decision will come into effect immediately and put an additional burden of Rs 3,316 crore per year on the exchequer.He said according to a survey conducted by his government, people wanted quality and cheap power.With this decision, the tariff rate for the domestic category has become cheapest in the country, he claimed."People of Punjab do not want anything free. They want quality power at cheaper rates," he said while quoting the survey.Channi said for up to 100 units of consumption (up to 2 kW), the power tariff will drop to Rs 1.19 per unit from Rs 4.19 per unit and for 101-300 units, the tariff will be Rs 4.01 and for above 300 units, the power rate will be Rs 5.76 per unit.Similarly, power rates for more than 2 kW and up to 7 kW will also come down.Taking about the AAP government in Delhi, Channi said its power subsidy is Rs 2,220 crore per year as against Rs 14,000 crore in Punjab.Channi said his government was procuring power at a cheaper rate and would pass on the benefit to consumers.His government has issued a notice of termination of the power purchase pact with the GVK Goindwal Sahib power project as it was costing Rs 6-7 per unit, he said.For this project, no tenders were called, he alleged taking a dig at the previous SAD-BJP regime.He said tenders had been issued for buying solar power at Rs 2.38 per unit.Three power purchase pacts will also be reconsidered and a bill be brought in the Vidhan Sabha in this regard, the CM said."We have started buying power at cheaper rates," he said.Existing free power facility of up to 1 kW to Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes and BPL categories will continue, he added.Prior to Channi's announcement, the power subsidy bill of the state stood at Rs 10,628 crore.The Aam Aadmi Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal had already promised 300 units and 400 units of free power, respectively, if their parties come to power in the Assembly polls early next year. Punjab Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu has also been pressing for providing power to people at cheaper rates.The state government has been facing the ire of the opposition and various sections of society for costly electricity. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/diwali-gift-power-tariff-slashed-by-rs-3-per-unit-in-punjab-332862
