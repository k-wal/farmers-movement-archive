He called the IG, blue-eyed boy of former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini.Sidhu stated this while reacting to the statement of Sukhbir Badal in which he claimed that Sidhu had held a meeting with the police officers who had given clean chit to the Akalis.Sidhu said the Akalis, afraid of ED raids, are trying to deviate the attention of people by bringing in his name. ‚ÄúWith the Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials raiding the properties of Gurdeep Singh, the owner of Fastway Cable Network and Jujhar Bus Service, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and disclosure of connivance with former Chief Engineer of GMADA Surinder Pal Singh alias Pehalwan, the SAD leadership is scared,‚Äù he said, claiming that a politician gave 11 acre of land to Gurdeep and there were 1.5 crore cable connections in the state but their exact numbers were never given out.‚ÄúObviously, it was aimed to deny due tax to the government. If the government levies Rs 50 tax per connection it means that it earns Rs 150 crore per month. But due share was always denied,‚Äù Sidhu added.The PPCC president questioned the logic of Sukhbir Badal gheraoing the CM office and asked him to, instead, gherao the office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the ED falls under purview of the Central government. He accused Congress and Akalis for playing together in the state.On the desecration issue, he said two Sikh youths Rupinder Singh and Jaspinder Singh were held by the police and were later released. He reiterated that the SIT report should be made public.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-sidhu-dares-sukhbir-to-prove-he-met-police-officers-who-gave-clean-chit-to-akalis-343485
27-11-2021||Chandigarh||Badal, Akali leaders court arrest in Chandigarh||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday courted arrest along with the party's core committee members to register their protest against the 'conspiracy' of the Congress government in Punjab to implicate party leader Bikram Singh Majithia in a 'false' drugs case.Despite heavy security outside, senior leaders of the party overcame barricading to march to the Chief Minister's residence and courted arrest in front of it.The SAD chief said that state Congress President Navjot Sidhu was resorting to extra constitutional measures by directing the state government to register a false case against Majithia."The Chief Minister and the Home Minister have not only agreed to this demand in order to divert attention from the failures of the Congress government, but have also directed the DGP to register the false case. The SAD is very clear in this matter. All such persons will be prosecuted once the SAD-BSP alliance government is formed in the state next year. We will also set up a commission to probe these false cases, including those registered against Akali workers," Badal said.Badal also made it clear that SAD will not be intimidated by such tactics."We will continue to raise our voice in favour of the people and demand fulfilment of the promises made to them by the Congress," the SAD leader said.He also said that the party would simultaneously continue to fight the repression and acts of vendetta against senior party men and workers alike.Announcing that the senior party leadership had come to court arrest, Badal said, "The Congress government has constantly politicised both the sensitive issues of sacrilege and drugs. It is with this in mind that its top leaders and the DGP met to conspire and frame me in a false case. The conspiracy was, however, exposed by SAD. Now another conspiracy has been hatched to implicate Bikram Majithia in a false drugs case. We will expose this conspiracy also." Meanwhile, before proceeding towards the CM's residence, both Badal and Majithia talked to contractual teacher Sohan Singh who had climbed atop a BSNL tower near the MLA flats.They were apprised that the contractual teacher had climbed the tower in protest against the reduction in the salaries of contractual teachers, and the government's failure to regularise their services.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/badal-akali-leaders-court-arrest-in-chandigarh-343462

It is yet to see if she is asked to continue for the next annual term or a new candidate will take over the coveted charge. Since the SAD enjoys a majority in the House, party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal reserves all rights to take the final call. Nonetheless, speculations are rife over certain names who are supposed to be in the race for the post. In the run-up to the 2022 Assembly poll, the SAD preference will be for the one who can run the SGPC affairs, besides help in garnering political gains for the party, and Bibi Jagir Kaur fits into the bracket well. She can be the party‚Äôs choice as a candidate.

Since the SGPC chief is an honorary post with no salary, an MLA can serve on it simultaneously, but no ministerial post can be accepted. I am ready to forego any ministry over serving the SGPC,‚Äù Bibi Jagir Kaur said.Nonetheless, if the change of command is on the cards, the name on the top of the list of probables is Harjinder Singh Dhami, who is the honorary chief secretary of the SGPC. Dhami, a law graduate, has been the SGPC member since 1996 and also served as its general secretary during the 2019 tenure.Sant Baba Balvir Singh Ghunas is also in the queue for the past three years.

It has to come from within.‚Äù And as he professed, he wrote in a natural and organic manner. The ink in his pen began to flow when he was a student of Class IX.Over the years, it was to mature into a significant and resolute voice of Punjab. Few understood the transformation of society as well as this man who lived in Chandigarh but came from a traditional rural set-up. The Banbhaura village in Sangrur district he left behind lived in his mindscape forever. Noted playwright and theatre personality Dr Atamjit remembers his story ‚ÄòGhotna‚Äô in particular. He shares how effortlessly and poignantly Bhandari would paint the alienation of those severed from their roots. Essentially a short story writer, contemporary events figured in his writings. The cataclysmic events set in the background of communal riots pulsated in his much-acclaimed story ‚ÄòMoon Di Akh‚Äô, also the name of his Sahitya Akademi Award-winning book. 1984 and its aftermath might go down as a dark chapter in history, but Bhandari saw humanism in these tough and turbulent times.Former bureaucrat and writer NS Rattan remembers him as ‚Äòyaaran da yaar‚Äô who was friends with indomitable poet Shiv Kumar Batalvi too. Hailing him as the leading light of Punjabi short story writing, Rattan also recalls his inspirational personality who would encourage budding writers. He wrote simply and lucidly without jugglery of words, reaching out to one and all. If delicacy of thought marked his writing style, he was equally a man of conviction. He had the gumption to return the Sahitya Akademi Award in solidarity with the nationwide protest by writers in 2015.However, he did not suffer from any delusions of grandeur. Nor did he nurse any notions of being a reformer and only considered himself an ever vigilant student of human nature. Whether there is afterlife, whether he will be reborn as a writer as he desired, his words sure have the potency to live forever in more than one story. ‚ÄòTil Chauli‚Äô, ‚ÄòManukh De Per‚Äô, ‚ÄòKath Di Latt‚Äô, ‚ÄòPacchan‚Äô, ‚ÄòMoon Di Akh‚Äô, ‚ÄòBaraf Latare Rukh‚Äô, ‚ÄòTan Pattan‚Äô and ‚ÄòKatha Varta‚Äô are some of his memorable stories. While Punjabi literature stands richer with his sterling writing, it will sorely miss his ebullient persona.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/reached-out-to-all-with-lucid-story-telling-343234

Till then, a little over 184 LMT of paddy had been purchased against the targeted 169 LMT.As the realpolitik in the state continued to sway in favour of the farmers, the state government asked its officials tocontinue buying whatever paddy was arriving in the mandis. In order to ensure that the government agencies were not sold paddy from outside the state, Punjab even set up committees headed by deputy commissioners to monitor the purchase.‚ÄúOn an average, 10,000-20,000 MT of paddy is still arriving daily in some mandis, and we have been asked to have it procured subject to a verification report by the deputy commissioner concerned,‚Äù a senior official in the department of food and supplies said, adding that the government had promised to purchase all paddy arriving in the mandis at a meeting with Kisan unions earlier this month.

No action was taken despite the Punjab and Haryana High Court directing the government to dispose of the desecration case within six months, he said.Who‚Äôs stalling action?Who is stalling the police and law to take action against the guilty? The issue of drug is ravaging the state. ‚ÄîNavjot Singh Sidhu, PCC presidentHe questioned the government‚Äôs failure in curb the drug menace. Citing High Court judgments in different cases, he pointed towards connivance of government officials. ‚ÄúThe HC while hearing a smuggling case observed drug suppliers are enjoying political patronage and escape punishment and only small-time couriers are caught,‚Äù he said. In the 12 lakh Tramadole seizure case, Sidhu cited the HC order, saying: ‚ÄúPunjab state functionaries, for reasons best known to them, are intentionally protecting drug offenders.‚Äù He said the NDPS bureau in its report had stated Punjab topped in drug-related crimes.Similarly, on the directions of the HC, the Enforcement Directorate report was handed over to the STF in February 2018. There were clear instructions of the HC to take action against the accused as per law. ‚ÄúWho is stalling the police and law to take action against the guilty?‚Äù said Sidhu.Asked whether there was lack of coordination between the party and government, Sidhu brushed aside the allegation, saying it was the result of coordination that power tariff and rates of sand were reduced. The reason for taking up the issue was that ‚Äúthe government was acting slowly and casually‚Äù. The issue of drug was ravaging the state, he added.Showering praise on farmers, he hailed as social revolution their success in getting the three laws withdrawn. He said the agitation had left an indelible mark in the history of independent India. He said successive governments failed to give a roadmap to turn farming profitable. ‚ÄúFarmers are grappling with constant rise in the input cost, low productivity and quoting of insufficient prices‚Äù.Zira MLA Kulbir Singh Zira on Friday said though the issues flagged by Sidhu were right, the manner in which he was raising these wasn‚Äôt.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sidhu-again-attacks-govt-over-sacrilege-drugs-343197

They occupied a stretch of 10 km on National Highway-9 from Bahadurgarh bypass to Tikri and a similar area on National Highway-44 at Singhu when Delhi Police did not let them enter the capital on November 27 last year. They have since been camping there to carry forward their agitation.‚ÄúIt was not easy for us to adjust to these conditions but then we had come with the resolve that we would not return without getting our demands met.

Yet, the agitation continued with the same enthusiasm. Summer brought new problems like scarcity of water, long power cuts, breeding of mosquitoes, he adds.‚ÄúWe had to dig borewells and install RO systems to address the drinking water issue. Solar plates were used to get electricity while a lot of money was spent to erect huts to save ourselves from the scorching heat.
