28-11-2021||Khati (Phagwara)||Punjab CM Channi says will do PhD on Mahabharata; state govt to set up research centre on Hindu epics||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday said he will learn Sanskrit and do a doctorate on the Mahabharata as he announced to set up a research centre on the Hindu texts Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagvad Gita.Addressing after laying the foundation stone of a Bhagwan Parshuram Taposthal here, he also compared SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal to Mahabharata’s Dhritarashtra, saying the “putra moh” (blind love) for his son has led to the “ruin” of his party.The CM said the research centre will showcase the message of the three Hindu texts.Since ages, these texts have been a source of inspiration for the entire humanity and the research centre will act as a catalyst for disseminating the message of these among the masses in the simplest form, he said.Channi said his government is trying to rope in a respected Shankracharya for this ambitious project.Striking an emotional chord with the Brahmin community, he said they have strong ties with him.Channi said he will learn Sanskrit language and then do a doctorate on the Mahabharata.“I was told by a very wise and scholarly man to learn one shloka of the Bhagavad Gita every day to make my life meaningful and righteous. The Gita updesh is unparalleled. My present PhD will be completed in three months. Then I will start learning Sanskrit and do a PhD on the Mahabharata,” he added.The chief minister further said to ensure proper care of stray cattle in the state, the Brahmin Welfare Board will be entrusted with this task.He said funds will be provided to the board for proper upkeep of the stray cattle.It is the need of hour to solve this one of the major social problems, he said.The CM also said his government will develop the “taposthal” of Bhagwan Parshuram as a state-of-the-art architectural marvel.A cheque for Rs 10 crore has already been handed over to the district administration and more funds whenever needed will be sent accordingly, Channi added.Channi said Rs 75 lakh will be spent on the development of a place related to Mata Renuka, the mother of Lord Parshuram.Evoking the example of the Mahabharata to make a scathing attack on the Akalis, the CM said the “Kauravas” were ruined due to “putra moh” of King Dhritarashtra.In the same manner, he said that Akalis are in shambles due to the “love” of Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal for his son.Channi said the Mahabharata is a treatise regarding statecraft and is still relevant today,” adding the “poor situation” of the Akali Dal is an example of it.Slamming Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal for “little knowledge” about the state, Channi said the Delhi CM is “groping in the dark for fulfilling his lust for power”.He said besides being an outsider, Kejriwal is a “rumour monger”, who knows nothing about the state but pokes his nose into everything.He said such type of “cheap” politics will never be successful in the state.The chief minister said he was fortunate that the Congress leadership has bestowed him this service to serve the state.Paying tributes to Lord Parshuram, the chief minister exhorted people to imbibe the ideals propagated by him so that justice and equality is ensured in society.He said that Bhagwan Parshuram stood for protecting the basic tenets of religion, truth, universal love, compassion and righteousness.

The Chief Minister alleged some protesters were spoiling their functions without any valid reasons as his government has already started the process to fulfil a majority of their demands.When Channi reached at a function in Mehal Kalan, unemployed and contractual staff disrupted his function by raising slogans. But Channi asked his security staff to handle the protesters carefully. “Some persons are creating problems for thousands. We are already working on the demand for jobs,” said Channi from the stage.Later employees protested in Barnala, where cops forcibly removed protesters from the road. In Tapa, the contractual teachers’ union held a protest, while a member climbed atop a water tank, demanding immediate regularisation of their services.“Our members faced police action in Mehal Kalan and Barnala. Some of them were detained. Our protest will continue until all our demands are met,” said Sukhwinder Singh, President of BEd and TET Pass Union.Meanwhile, the Chief Minister announced Rs 25 crore for the development of Barnala Assembly constituency. Earlier at Mehal Kalan, CM also announced a sum of Rs 25 crore for development, announced to upgrade Mehal Kalan as subdivision besides opening of an ITI there. He also announced Rs 25 crore for development of Bhadaur constituency besides opening a government nursing college, ITI and stadium there.Channi asked AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal to specify how many farmers had got the facility of loan waiver or had been getting free power in Delhi. Training his guns at the SAD, he said the Badals were instrumental in getting the farm laws passed.“I will not give in to tactics of launching a protest at my official residence. Akalis must face the music for misdeeds during their decade-long misrule,” said the Chief Minister.Lashing out at Capt Amarinder Singh for expressing gratitude to PM Narendra Modi for announcing repeal of the three farm laws, Channi said he failed to comprehend how a true Punjabi could rejoice over the decision, since nearly 700 farmers had lost their lives during the year-long agitation. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/already-working-on-providing-regular-jobs-says-charanjit-singh-channi-343533
28-11-2021||Chandigarh||Show if any promise fulfilled: Arvind Kejriwal to Punjab CM||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today reached out to contractual teachers protesting in Mohali for more than 160 days, striking a chord with the common man in the state that will go to polls early next year. Teachers and employees have been seeking regular jobs.He also addressed public grievances regarding hefty power bills in spite of a waiver announced by the state government, and exorbitant rates of sand and gravel despite the government-fixed rate of Rs 5.50 per metric tonne. He claimed that AAP, if voted to power, would present a governance model different from the present Congress and the previous SAD-BJP governments.“Charanjit Singh Channi (Punjab Chief Minister) has put up boards in the state, claiming to have regularised the service of 36,000 employees. But you (protesting teachers) tell me that the assurance remains on paper. No doubt, schools are spic and span, but where are the teachers? Teachers are atop towers, protesting and demanding regular jobs,” he said.Furnish electricity bill waiver proofI am submitting before public one lakh power bills of Delhi consumers, whose tariff has been reduced to zero. Can the Punjab CM furnish 1,000 such bills? I challenge him. Arvind Kejriwal, AAP ConvenerThe Delhi CM challenged his Punjab counterpart to prove the Congress government had delivered on its promises. He projected the Delhi model of governance, as per which his government had made several policy interventions to improve the education system.Later, Kejriwal asked PTI teachers, who have been atop a water tank in Sohana for more than 40 days, to come down as one of them, Sippy Sharma, was not in good health. She, however, refused to climb down. He said: “In Delhi, even a labourer’s wages have been fixed at Rs 15,000 per month while teachers are sent abroad for upgrading their skills. However, in Punjab, well-educated teachers are getting only Rs 6,000 per month. My advice to you is to vote wisely.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/show-if-any-promise-fulfilled-kejri-to-cm-343534

He stated this while reacting to Sukhbir’s statement in which he had alleged a plot against senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia.Sidhu said the Akalis were afraid of ED raids and trying to deviate the attention of people by quoting his name. “With Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials raiding the properties of Gurdeep Singh, the owner of Fastway Cable Network, and Jujhar Bus Service under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), and the disclosure of connivance with former Chief Engineer of GMADA Surinder Pal Singh alias Pehalwan, the SAD leadership is scared,” he said.The PCC chief alleged a politician gave 11 acres of land to Gurdeep and there were 1.5 crore cable connections in the state, but their exact numbers were never given out. Obviously, it was aimed to deny tax to the government. “If the government levies Rs 50 tax per connection, it can earn Rs 150 crore a month,” he said.Sidhu questioned Sukhbir over the gherao of the CM’s house and asked him to, instead, gherao the PM’s office as the ED falls under the Centre. On desecration, he said two youths, Rupinder Singh and Jaspinder Singh, were held by the police and later released. Again training guns on his own government, the PCC president accused both the Congress and SAD laxity in matters of grave concern. He reiterated the SIT report should be made public. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/prove-allegations-pcc-chief-343535

Sukhbir alleged Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu was resorting to extra-constitutional measures by directing the state government to register a false case against Majithia.“The CM and the Home Minister have not only agreed to this demand in order to divert attention from the failures of the Congress government, but have also directed the DGP to register a false case,” he alleged.Sukhbir also made it clear that the SAD could not be intimidated by such tactics.He said the SAD would simultaneously continue to fight repression and acts of vendetta against senior party men and workers alike.Sukhbir alleged, “the Congress government has constantly politicised the sacrilege and drugs issues. It is with this in mind that top leaders and the DGP conspired to frame me in a false case. However, the conspiracy was exposed by the SAD. Now again another conspiracy has been hatched to implicate Majithia in a false drugs case.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-chief-alleges-frame-up-bid-courts-arrest-343536

Consumers of 201-400 units received approximately 50 per cent subsidy.The AAP, which is the main opposition party in Punjab, has announced that if it wins in the 2022 assembly polls in the state, it will make up to 300 units of electricity free.Kejriwal, at the gathering, presented copies of one lakh electricity bills of Delhi consumers, claiming that these were “zero bills”.Seventy to 75 per cent people in Delhi get zero amount electricity bills and still there is 24 hours electricity supply, claimed the AAP leader who is on a visit to the poll-bound state.Kejriwal said he has already announced to make up to 300 units of electricity free in Punjab, if the AAP comes to power next year.Following the AAP’s announcement, Channi claimed that electricity has been made “free: in the state, Kejriwal said and asked those present at the gathering if any of them have got zero amount electricity bills so far.“Did he (Channi) lie,” the AAP leader asked.Kejriwal said that out of 50 lakh, 35 lakh electricity consumers in Delhi got zero amount electricity bills last month.“Today, I have brought proof that electricity in Delhi is free. I brought one lakh such electricity bills. Channi sahab can see them…we will send these bundles of electricity bills to Channi sahab,” the Delhi chief minister said.“I want to challenge Channi sahab to show 1,000 electricity bills in Punjab, which have zero amount,” he said, adding that if people want “zero bill”, then they have to ensure the AAP wins in Punjab.Accusing Channi of making “false” promises, Kejriwal said the Punjab chief minister had promised five marla plots for homeless people, but has not fulfilled it yet.          He said Channi had claimed that the sand rate had been slashed to Rs 5 per cubic feet but sand was still being sold at Rs 35 per cubic feet.The Channi government had claimed to regularise services of 36,000 contractual and outsourced employees in Punjab but not a single person has been made permanent, he said.“Channi is making false announcements every day and not a single announcement has been implemented,” said Kejriwal.He also targeted Channi’s predecessor Amarinder Singh, saying the former chief minister of Punjab had also made several promises but he also did not implement them.“Channi is spending a lot of government money on various advertisements and hoardings for his fake publicity, but he is not doing any work at the grassroot level. Due to which today every section including unemployed teachers, employees, farmers, traders, doctors, nurses are sitting on dharna and protests,” the AAP leader said.He claimed that all the promises made by the AAP to the people of Delhi have been fulfilled.While in Punjab, the Congress and the Akalis (Shiromani Akali Dal) had promised a lot to the people, but did not provide any facilities after forming government, he alleged.Kejriwal said, “We have guaranteed free electricity to the people of Punjab, 24 hours uninterrupted power supply, opening of 16,000 mohalla clinics, giving Rs 1,000 per month to women, improving school and education system and building good hospitals and eradicating corruption.”        “With the formation of the AAP government in Punjab, all the guarantees will be fulfilled at all costs,” Kejriwal said.He appealed to the people of Punjab to give one chance to his party, saying they have already given chances to the Congress and the Akalis.Earlier, AAP Punjab president and Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann in his address said, “The Congress has made many promises to the people of Punjab by issuing 129-page election manifesto during the 2017 elections, but the Congress government did not implement it.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-polls-kejriwal-dares-cm-channi-to-show-1-000-zero-amount-electricity-bills-343505

28-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre to introduce Bill in Lok Sabha on Monday to repeal contentious farm laws||The central government will introduce a new Bill to repeal the three contentious agriculture laws in Lok Sabha on Monday.The new Bill, which states that though “only a small group of farmers are protesting” against these legislations, the need of the hour is to take along everyone for inclusive growth, has been listed for introduction and passage in Lok Sabha on the first day of the Winter Session of Parliament.It was passed by the Union Cabinet after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an announcement that all three farm laws will be repealed in the Winter Session.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar will introduce the Bill in the lower house.The ruling BJP and main opposition party Congress have issued whips to their MPs to be present on the day.“Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar will move for leave to introduce a Bill to repeal the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation Act) Act, 2020, the Essential Commodites (Amendment) Act, 2020 and to amend the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Also to introduce the bill,” Lok Sabha’s list of business for November 29, states.Despite the prime minister’s surprise announcement to repeal the bills, farmers’ unions have announced that they will continue with their protest until their other demands are not met. However, they have called off their proposed tractor March to Parliament on Monday.“To enable the farmers to sell their produce at higher prices and benefit from technological improvements, farmers have been provided access to agriculture markets which will help them increase their income. With this objective three farm laws...were enacted, as a part of the government’s endeavour to improve the condition of farmers including small and marginal farmers,” the Bill to repeal three farm laws states.It also says that even though “only a group of farmers are protesting against these laws, the government has tried hard to sensitise the farmers on the importance of the farm laws and explain the merits through several meetings and other forums”.Without taking away the existing mechanisms available to farmers, new avenues were provided for trade of their produce, the proposed legislation states. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-introduce-bill-in-lok-sabha-monday-to-repeal-contentious-farm-laws-343468

28-11-2021|| Chandigarh||AAP is making presence felt in Punjab, Kejriwal joins teachers' protest in Mohali||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday joined a teachers' protest at Mohali and promised to regularise their jobs if the Aam Aadmi Party comes to power in next year's Punjab Assembly polls. After landing at the Chandigarh airport, Kejriwal went straight to the protest site outside the Punjab School Education Board building, where temporary teachers have been protesting against for the past 165 days, demanding regularisation of their jobs. Kejriwal was accompanied by party's state unit chief Bhagwant Mann, Punjab affairs incharge Jarnail Singh and the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, Harpal Singh Cheema. He asked the protesting teachers to give one chance to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to form the government in Punjab while claiming that his government in Delhi had improved the education system and addressed issues of teachers there. He slammed the Congress and the previous Akali government for not acceding to their demand for the past several years. "I came here today and I promise you that when our government comes, we will regularise you. But I want to assure you on this that I addressed issues of teachers in Delhi. Therefore, we will resolve issues in Punjab as well," said Kejriwal. The AAP's national convener said he was told by protesting teachers that they were getting Rs 6,000 per month. He said in Delhi, the minimum wage is Rs 15,000 per month. "You give one chance. If we do not do it, then you can throw us out next time," he said, alleging that neither the Congress nor the Akalis regularised jobs of temporary teachers during their regimes. He also accused the Charanjit Singh Channi-led government of lying over its claims of regularising 36,000 contractual employees in the state.He said a few days ago, some sanitation workers from Punjab met him and complained about not being regularised.When "safai karamcharis" or teachers have not been regularised, then who has been regularised, he asked the Congress-led government.The AAP leader also took a dig at Education Minister Pargat Singh over his claims that Punjab had the best schools. Kejriwal asked Pargat to come and ask the protesting teachers how good the state schools are. "They will tell their pain and then you will come to know how good the Punjab schools are. If you do not understand the problem and then how will you find a solution for it," said Kejriwal while taking a swipe at Pargat Singh.Kejriwal also claimed that he was told in Ludhiana during his recent visit that there were several schools where not a single teacher was there to teach students. Later, the Delhi CM spoke to some other protesting teachers sitting atop an overhead water tank in Mohali over their demands. The Delhi CM during his last visit to Punjab had promised eight "guarantees" for comprehensive education reforms and promised that these would be implemented on a priority basis if his party comes to power in the polls.
