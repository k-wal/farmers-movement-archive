Any statement against them does not make any sense. The governments have to provide a solution. We have shown (how stubble burning can be curbed) in Delhi. Other states lack the will to do it," the environment minister said."We will ensure free spraying of bio-decomposer in every field in Punjab if we form a government in the state...like we did in Delhi," Rai told reporters in response to a question.He had earlier told PTI that Punjab, which generates around 20 million tonnes of paddy straw annually, would become free from crop stubble burning if the AAP formed government in the state.The Delhi government has made arrangements for free spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer, a microbial solution which can turn stubble into manure, over 4,300 acres belonging to 844 farmers in Delhi. Last year, 310 farmers had used it on 1,935 acres of land.In Punjab, paddy is cultivated in 2.814 million hectares.According to officials, Uttar Pradesh is using the bio-decomposer in 10 lakh acres of area, Punjab in five lakh acres, Haryana in one lakh acre this year.

The appointment has been notified by the Department of Home Affairs and Justice. While “Home” is under Randhawa, “Justice” is with the Chief Minister. Sidhu has declared he will attend office only after Deol is replaced. He had two days ago made a veiled attack on Randhawa over the sacrilege cases.Deol, who resigned from the post last month, was told to continue till a new appointee took over the charge. He had some days ago publicly accused Sidhu of spreading misinformation and hampering the functioning of the government and the AG’s office. Sidhu retaliated with a string of 12 tweets.Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha, asking the government if this was what its “Ghar Ghar Rozgar” scheme meant, remarked: “The Congress is fulfilling its principal poll promise of ‘Har Ghar Naukri’ but with a minor modification. Recipients of these jobs are family members of Congress ministers and MLAs. The latest beneficiary is Deputy CM Randhawa’s son-in-law.”Dy CM: Purely on merit“Why can’t a relative of a minister be appointed on merit as Additional AG?

It argued that “the HC has, thus, given a clean chit to persons who were not even present before it”, terming the findings as “bad in law and liable to be set aside”.The HC had on April 9 quashed the probe into the firing in which two men protesting the sacrilege at Bargari village were killed in police firing on October 14, 2015. It had ordered reconstitution of the SIT without IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. Thereafter, another SIT led by ADGP LK Yadav was formed in May to probe the incident. The order had come on a petition filed by Gurdeep Singh, the then Kotkapura SHO who was the complainant as well as investigating officer in the FIR lodged in 2015. He was made an accused in a subsequent FIR lodged in 2018. On Monday, an SC Bench asked the parties to respond to the state’s petition in four weeks after senior counsel Salman Khurshid and Aadil Boparai urged the court to expunge certain remark from the verdict as it virtually gave a clean chit to certain persons, creating hurdles in probe. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kotkapura-firing-supreme-court-notice-to-ex-sho-on-punjabs-plea-335703

The last time, the medicine was supplied was in March 2020, when the first wave of Covid-19 had started.Taking cognisance of the report, the department has issued a circular to officials to collect the medicine immediately from the three government drug warehouses in Bathinda, Kharar and Amritsar for respective districts.Each dispensary will be supplied with two months’ supply of 33 medicines and consumables.The government had drawn flak from the Opposition parties over the issue.

I am checking it up with the officials concerned. OP Soni, Dy CMAs many as 129 medical officers, 489 pharmacists and an equal number of Class IV employees of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat were merged with the Health and Family Welfare Department. It’s learnt barring Patiala and Mansa, merged medical staff in other districts have not been paid salaries since June.Deputy Chief Minister OP Soni, who is also the Minister for Health and Family Welfare, has assured the staff of getting their salaries released at the earliest.Ironically, the Director Health and Family Welfare had issued an order on September 15, directing all Civil Surgeons to ensure the dues were disbursed from the ‘salary head’ of the Health Department at the earliest.Amritsar-based Dr Harinder Singh said their pleas fell on deaf ears. He said, “Many doctors have failed to pay the instalments for house and car loans. Some of us belong to humble background and are in distress.”Dr Gursimran Singh, posted on deputation at the Patti Civil Hospital, said the last salary slip he got was in May. “We performed our duties with dedication amid the pandemic, little knowing that we will be treated in this manner.

The ventilators are lying in locked rooms.Experts said there were a number of other medical problems that could lead to respiratory problems among children and they might need the ventilators. Therefore, the ventilators could have been distributed to other medical facilities for best use, they said.Will distribute theseWe are already taking stock of all available ventilators.

In fact, there has been no admission of Covid-positive patients for weeks now.”Health experts said there were chances the ventilators could become defunct if not used for months. “In the past instances too, ventilators had become defunct and repair was required to use them.

The Bench observed almost every single undertrial would have to be admitted to bail by the High Court if a bail plea before the court was allowed on the ground.Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted “technically” the counsel for the petitioner may be right in his arguments, subject to further arguments being addressed on the issue by him and the counsel for the state. The matter was brought to the court’s notice after a petition was filed against the state of Punjab and other respondents by Gurjant Singh through counsel Saurav Bhatia. Appearing before the Bench, Bhatia referred to Sub-Section (2) of Section 309 of the CrPC.The section on ‘power to postpone or adjourn proceedings’, among other things, says: “If the court, after taking cognisance of an offence, or commencement of trial, finds it necessary or advisable to postpone the commencement of, or adjourn, any inquiry or trial, it may, from time to time, for reasons to be recorded, postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks fit, for such time as it considersreasonable, and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody.”He submitted that in none of the trial court’s interim orders, adjourning the hearing in the trial to a future date, was the petitioner actually remanded to police custody. Consequently, he was on that ground alone entitled to be admitted to bail by the High Court.“It needs to be observed by this court that if this petition were to be allowed on that ground, almost every single undertrial would have to be admitted to bail by this court because in most cases, if not in all, at the time that hearing in a trial is adjourned/postponed on grounds of prosecution witness not being present, etc, no formal order extending the remand (judicial or police) is passed by the trial court…,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted.Before parting with the order, the Bench added the issue for consideration before the court was whether the provision could be held mandatory or was only discretionary/directory. The case will now come up for further hearing on November 18. “Any judgment that the counsel wish to rely upon shall be duly placed on record by way of an appropriate application in the meanwhile,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh concluded.‘Provision mandatory or discretionary?’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-examine-whether-bail-can-be-granted-if-no-order-on-remand-335643

Iqbal Singh Lalpura, NCM ChiefThe National Commission for Minorities (NCM) today asked the CM to refrain from pressing the Dalit Sikhs of Shillong’s Harijan Colony (Punjabi Lane/Sweepers’ Lane) to vacate the neighbourhood.“The Sikhs living in Punjabi Lane, Shillong, should not be displaced,” NCM chairperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura wrote to Sangma.An official communiqué said the commission took note of reports in the media regarding the Meghalaya Government decision to shift the staff of Shillong Municipal Board and other departments from the area “where the Sikh families are settled since the 19th century”. Lalpura said the matter must be handled with sensitivity.The Harijan Panchayat Committee (HPC), representative body of the Dalit Sikhs living in Harijan Colony, has also written to the CM highlighting various instances of doublespeak and subterfuge resorted to by the state government regarding relocation of the residents. In the letter, HPC secretary Gurjit Singh said while on the one hand, the government was making public statements about inviting the Harijan Colony residents for talks, on the other it was talking about evicting the residents.He demanded that the CM must invite them for an agenda-based talk. The HPC never received any invitation for talks from the high-level committee (HLC) constituted by the state government to recommend modalities for relocating the residents of Harijan Colony.“Your statement and that of your deputy that the HLC did not receive any representation or objections from the affected people were far from true,” he wrote to Sangma.The HPC secretary also questioned the authenticity of the state government claim regarding employees of the Shillong Municipal Board having been allotted residences in another part of the city. He asked for copies of allotment letters.He also questioned government’s reluctance to make public the agreement handing over the Harijan Colony land to it by the local tribal chief and alleged the agreement was not legally tenable. “We are committed to holding on till our last breath and Sikh history bears testimony to our determination,” the HPC secretary wrote.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-evict-shillong-sikhs-minorities-panel-to-punjab-cm-335645

Similarly, the reduction in diesel price is Rs 4.19 per litre, not Rs 5 per litre,” Monty Sehgal, spokesperson, Punjab Petroleum Dealers’ Association told The Tribune, after the new rates were notified by the oil marketing companies to retail fuel outlets.When brought to the notice of Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and the Excise and Taxation Department, they said this anomaly had arisen because of a miscommunication between the government and the oil marketing companies. The government issued another notification saying, “Additional tax @ 10% as specified in Section 8-B of the Punjab VAT Act, 2005, shall be in ad valorem rates only. Fixed rates specified above are already inclusive of additional tax @ 10%.”“This will ensure that the cut in prices is Rs 10 per litre for petrol and Rs 5 per litre for diesel,” they told The Tribune. It was clarified vide a fresh notification that the fixed charge was inclusive of surcharge and the correction in rates would reflect by Tuesday morning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/post-cut-fuel-prices-in-punjab-still-higher-than-most-neighbours-335647

The Chief Minister and the Finance Minister should tell who is responsible for this wasteful expenditure? It would have been better if instead of adjourning this session for two days, it had been extended for a 15 days.

He owes an explanation now over son-in-law’s appointment. Fatehjang Singh Bajwa, Qadian MLABy evening, a solution to the deepening crisis in the Punjab Congress seemed in sight after a closed-door meeting between Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Punjab affairs incharge Harish Chaudhary and Navjot Singh Sidhu at Punjab Raj Bhavan guesthouse.Sources said the PCC chief had been assured Attorney General (AG) APS Deol was on his way out soon and the government was moving ahead on the subjects of his concern. He has reportedly been advised to control his frequent outbursts in the media.During the meeting, minister Pargat Singh was also present. Sources said Chaudhary played a key role in bringing the two leaders on a common platform. “As the CM has already taken the resignation from the AG, the new replacement will be announced soon. Subsequently, Sidhu will resume work at the PCC office,” said a senior leader. During the meeting, DGP, Vigilance, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya was also called as Sidhu had been raking up the STF drug report.As soon as the Assembly session ended, Sidhu took on his own government for not filing a special leave petition (SLP) against the blanket bail granted to ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini on September 10 in the 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing case. With the blanket bail to Saini as the prime accused in the case, the sacrilege case can’t move forward, he said.On the STF’s drug trafficking report, Sidhu asked the government to make it public in the Assembly on November 11. Hitting out at certain ministers, Sidhu said: “Those who sought the removal of Capt Amarinder Singh from the post of CM over inaction in the drugs and sacrilege cases are sitting silent now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-lacks-political-will-on-sacrilege-issue-navjot-singh-sidhu-335654
09-11-2021||Saurabh Malik||Punjab Dy CM Sukhjinder Randhawa’s son-in-law appointed Additional Advocate-General||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 8In a politically strategic move, the infighting-ridden Congress government in Punjab on Monday engaged — among others — Deputy Chief Minister-cum-Home Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s son-in-law Tarun Vir Singh Lehal as an Additional Advocate-General, leading to allegations of nepotism from the Opposition.Available information suggests the appointment has been made on the recommendation of Punjab’s “interim” Advocate-General APS Deol.The appointment has been made under “proviso to Section 7 (4) of Punjab Law Officers (Engagement) Act, 2017”.The provision makes it clear that the Advocate-General may, with the government’s approval, engage up to seven advocates. They, in his opinion, should “possess such special qualifications and experience as he deems suitable, as law officers keeping in view the exigencies and for smooth functioning of his office”.The appointment, notified by the Department of Home Affairs and Justice, comes at a time when differences between him, Randhawa and Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu are no more a matter of surmises. While “Home” is under Randhawa, “Justice” is with Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.Just about two days back Sidhu is believed to have made a veiled attack on Randhawa over the sacrilege issue.Deol, appointed by the Channi government, had last month resigned from the post, but was allowed to continue till the joining of the new incumbent. He is already engaged in a war of words with Sidhu. Deol had publically accused Sidhu of disseminating misinformation to achieve political benefit over his political colleagues.Deol had also blamed him for obstructing the functioning of the state government and the AG office. Sidhu, in turn, had used a long thread of 12 tweets to slam Deol.The notifications said another advocate Sumeet Mahajan was engaged as senior Additional Advocate-General, while Mukesh Chander Berry and Aadil Singh Boparai were engaged as Additional Advocates-General. Rehatbir Singh Maan was appointed Deputy Advocate-General.Political considerations while making appointments to public offices are not uncommon. In September, the Cabinet had approved the appointment of the then Revenue Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar’s son-in-law as Excise and Taxation Inspector by tweaking the rules.In June, the decision to appoint the sons of Ludhiana North Congress MLA Rakesh Pandey and Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa as naib tehsildar and inspector had led to an uproar, with Randhawa — among other Congress leaders — opposing the move.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-dy-cm-sukhjinder-randhawas-son-in-law-appointed-additional-advocate-general-335605

Posed more than 100 questions to him from 10.30 am to 6 pm on the range of issues around the three FIRs of the sacrilege incidents. The report would be submitted to the High Court shortly,” he told The Tribune.Besides Parmar, other SIT members who carried out the questioning included SSP Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar, DSP Lakhvir Singh and Inspector Dalbir Singh. The Haryana police had erected barricades on various routes to the jail to keep Dera followers, Sikh protesters and media at bay.The main focus of questions was the unsolved case of theft of a bir of Guru Granth Sahib on June 1, 2015 from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. The second FIR was regarding the pasting of posters in different villages amounting to sacrilege of the Sikh Holy Book. The third was on throwing the ‘angs’ of the Holy Book at various places.In the latter two cases, the SIT has already submitted challans accusing a number of followers of the Dera Sirsa for carrying out the sacrilege incidents. Key accused Mohinder Pal Bittu was killed by other inmates in a Nabha Jail over his role in the incidents.Later, a CBI inquiry team had absolved the dera followers of the charges saying there was no conclusive evidence against them. However, the Punjab government had not accepted the CBI closure report on the incidents and decided to carry out an investigation by the Punjab Police.It has been alleged that the Dera men stole the Bir and later tore the pages in order to take revenge from Sikhs for defamatory actions and speeches against the Dera head. The Dera head was allegedly close to political leaders, especially the Akalis besides some film stars as well.This is the first time the SIT was able to meet the Dera head for questioning. Earlier, an SIT, including IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap, as the lead investigator had tried to get permission from the Haryana government for the purpose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sacrilege-incidents-punjab-sit-questions-dera-head-gurmeet-ram-rahim-for-over-7-hours-335520
