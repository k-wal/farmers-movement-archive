These workers belong to various states of the country, and as a result of the prolonged lockdown, have become unemployed and are facing great hardship,‚Äù the Chief Minister noted.Unfortunately, he observed, that despite easing of the restrictions, only 6,900 of the industries in Ludhiana had so far resumed activities. Many of the industries were not able to start their works as they were dependent on various small and tiny cottage industries which provided them components, and most of these small/tiny/cottage industries were located in the mixed-land use areas as per the notified Master Plan, pointed out the Chief Minister.Even as he directed the district administration to immediately encourage industry to open for the benefit of the large number of labourers employed there, Captain Amarinder noted that as per extant notification of town planning department/notified Master Plan, existing industries in mixed-land use areas were allowed to operate. Therefore, these industries needed to be permitted as they were also part of the supply chain to the industries which fall in SEE/EOUs/Industrial Estates/Focal Points/Designated Industrial areas as per the master plan of Ludhiana, he pointed out.The micro/tiny industries in mixed-land areas constitute about 50 per cent of the industrial set-up in the district and employ about five to six lakh workers.Established about four decades back, these have been granted industrial connections and, for all practical purposes, these mixed-land areas are considered as industrial pockets for green industries.

They also helped other migrants who were on their way to their respective villages."After cycling for four days, I had reached Saharanpur along with 21 other workers from Ludhiana. We then halted at an orchard located near village Chhutmalpur to take rest. I was fully tired while my foot had badly swollen. When villagers who were Muslims learned about us, they reached the orchard that belongs to a Muslim man", Mahendra said.He continued: "When we shared our story, they assured us for every possible help. The Muslim villagers provided food and water to us. They provided soaps for all of us for bathing".‚ÄúThe villagers provided meals to us at night as well as the next morning. They also assured to arrange vehicles to send us to our villages. Meanwhile, the district administration officials reached there that day and asked us to come with them to nearby Doon Ayurvedic Medical College. I am Hindu. I can‚Äôt forget the help provided by the Muslim people. I am very thankful to them‚Äù, he continued.‚ÄúAfter reaching Ayurvedic Medical College, we spent the night there.

We spent 14 days under quarantine at the college hostel‚Äù, he said.He continued: ‚ÄúAfter the quarantine period, the administration arranged vehicles to send us to our respective villages located in different districts. I was asked to station my cycle there and come after lockdown to take it. Finally, I reached my village in district Basti by bus."Mahendra used to work in a textile firm at Ludhiana.‚ÄúDue to poor financial condition, I had come to Ludhiana in search of a job. Days after the lockdown was imposed, I had no money to eat that‚Äôs why I decided to go back village in UP on cycle. I had taken some amount of ‚ÄòDhan Chura‚Äô with me to eat on the way. For the first four days, I ate ‚ÄòDhan Chura‚Äô with water‚Äù, he said.‚ÄúNow, I am living with a family in my native village. I have not yet thought to return to Ludhiana. I can do labour work at my village too. It is better to stay in the village by eating ‚Äòroti‚Äô with salt.

In a note prepared for the Chief Minister, which will be sent to the PM by May 15, the department has recommended that the Centre increase its share in Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, Smart City and Jal Jeevan Mission significantly. Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra has said the Centre wanted a broad strategy on how states would want to deal with the lockdown regime while ramping up the economic activity. ‚ÄúThe only way to go forward would be through getting more aid from the Centre as the state‚Äôs own revenue sources dry up. The revenue inflow from cess on electricity consumption as well as share in excise duty on liquor is almost nil. Coupled with this, states have had to defer payment of property tax and water and sewage charges,‚Äù he said. Mohindra has recommended increasing Centre‚Äôs share in the Smart City projects from 33 per cent to 70 per cent (in cities above 10 lakh population), and in other cities from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. At present, Ludhiana, Amritsar and Jalandhar are being developed under the scheme. In the AMRUT scheme, funding is in the ratio of 33:66 per cent for metros (66 per cent is state‚Äôs share) and 50:50 for other towns.  ‚ÄúThis funding pattern must be changed with the Centre giving 75 per cent of the project cost,‚Äù he said.

Instead of moving to my village near Patna, I have made plans to go to Batala, 35 km from here, where some small scale industries have already opened. I will find work there,‚Äù he said.He said he knew more than 100 migrants who feared that quarantine restrictions could hamper their movement back home.‚ÄúI will be made to stay in my home for 14 days when I reach my village in Purnia district, a 32-hour journey from here. What if I do not find work after that? If I decide to come back to Punjab, I will again placed under quarantine for 21 days. So why travel all the way back to Purnia and then back to Gurdaspur?‚Äù said Dharo, who used to sell dry fruits in his rickety cart in the busy Hanuman chowk area of the city before the lockdown came in.‚ÄúWe are from Gopalganj and got ourselves registered on the portal two days ago. However, as units are opening up, employers are calling us. Working in a foundry unit in Batala is a much better option than undergoing an arduous 28-hour journey back home. Moreover, sitting at home for 14 days as a part of the quarantine period is not acceptable to us,‚Äù said Lakshman.Migrants from Gurdaspur district have to travel to Amritsar to take a train to their respective states. ‚ÄúWe would have gone had the authorities arranged trains for us from Gurdaspur itself.

My friends in Batala tell me that industrial units will start functioning in the next few days. I had got myself registered but now, I have changed plans,‚Äù said Madho.Tejinder Pal Singh Sandhu, ADC (general), said the administration was making arrangements for migrants to board trains from Gurdaspur. ‚ÄúGurdaspur district has been allocated just one bogey and only 54 migrants can board it. We have written to the state government‚Äôs nodal officer to ensure that at least four trains start from Gurdaspur itself. This will ease the pressure to some extent,‚Äù he added.Address their woes: Capt to CentreChandigarh: CM Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said intervention in the unorganised labour sector should have been the priority in the fiscal relief package, the first tranche of which was announced by Union Finance Minister Niramala Sitharaman.

In the desperation of going back, he went to the checking centre without even receiving any confirmatory SMS of rail ticket. After spending hours outside the centre, he returned to work. His fellow workers refused to work with him and even the quarter owner didn‚Äôt allow him to stay because of fear of contacting the virus.

With several issues raised by the liquor contractors before the stand-off remaining unresolved, many have rejected the announcements and threatened to keep the liquor vends shut.Only 50-60 per cent of the 5,800 liquor vends across Punjab are expected to be reopened on Thursday.Ministers Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaraia and Vijay Inder Singla along with officials of the Excise and Taxation Department met some of the liquor contractors in Jalandhar this evening, asking them to open the vends.The government delegation is learnt to have conveyed that they would not be demanding licence fee immediately. It also assured the contractors that liquor smuggling from neighbouring states would be curbed.A contractor said, ‚ÄúWhile the decision to open vends will be taken by all contractors, many are now ready to leave the contracts, mainly those having sites near migrant labour settlements. With the departure of migrants, these vends, which otherwise saw good sale of Punjab made liquor, will incur losses.‚ÄùOn the other hand, Anil Mahajan, a Hoshiarpur-based contractor said, ‚ÄúI am suffering a loss of Rs15 lakh each day. I have decided to open the vend as I don‚Äôt see the government agreeing to any discounts.‚ÄùThe amendments to the excise policy included providing adjustments to licencees for losses incurred for the lockdown period from March 23-May 6; not extending the period of contract of liquor vends beyond March 31, 2021; setting up a group of ministers comprising Manpreet Badal, Vijay Inder Singla and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, to consider the levying of Covid cess on liquor; and leaving the option of home delivery of liquor on the licencees.The contractors said the government neither reduced the minimum guaranteed quota or the minimum guaranteed revenue for the coming months nor acceded to their demand for extending the year of implementation of the policy by 36 days, beyond March 31, 2021.‚ÄúNone of our demands have been met. In Ludhiana, majority of the contractors have decided against opening vends,‚Äù said Varinder Sharma, a representative for Ludhiana liquor contractors.A meeting of the group of ministers is likely to be held on the issue on Friday.

Official figures put the excise revenue loss during the three years of the Congress rule at an estimated Rs 1,800 crore.Sources said the trouble began when the ministers accused the top officer of not accounting for the mounting losses. He, in turn, is learnt to have replied that the main reasons for the low revenue receipts were liquor smuggling and unaccounted-for sale across the state allegedly involving Congress leaders.Also read:¬†12 MLAs seek CBI probe against Chief SecretaryThe Chief Secretary has since relinquished the additional charge of Financial Commissioner, Excise and Taxation.Certain ministers and MLAs are said to be into the liquor business, directly or indirectly. ‚ÄúThese leaders are into the business in their own names or in the names of their family members. The big issue here is unaccounted-for liquor stock. There are no records,‚Äù a senior official of the state Excise and Taxation Department said.There are three aspects to the revenue loss: businessmen owning distilleries and retail outlets moving stocks illegally and selling without record of sales; retailers buying stocks from distilleries without bills and selling these illegally; and third, organised smuggling of alcohol in districts and sale by bootleggers.The officer added that besides involvement of leaders and questionable liquor supply, ‚Äúwe have also been facing competition as a result of smuggling of liquor from Chandigarh and Haryana‚Äù.Congress minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, when contacted, said, ‚ÄúOur sole objection during the meeting with the Chief Secretary was the falling revenue figures from liquor sales.

In March, Indian cricket saw the series against South Africa abandoned. IPL was also cancelled. The Indian Super League final (football) was held in an empty stadium in Goa on March 14. The I-League season was called off with 23 matches left. Similarly, The All England Championships, which concluded on March 15, was the last event in which India‚Äôs major badminton stars participated. In tennis also, India was to take on Latvia in a Fed Cup playoff on April 17-18 but that too has been postponed.The industry, which was banking on demand generated by these events, is clueless about future and foresees no signs of revival in next 1-2 years. The industry, dominated by around 500 units in MSME sector, is battling for survival with payments stuck and virtually no orders in hand.The lockdown was announced at a time when the industry was gearing up for the demand which is common during March-October. Especially, summers are considered as the peak season because of summer vacations when many cricket academies open and summer camps are organised across the country.‚ÄúOur stocks are lying with us. We are uncertain about the future. Even if we want to commence production, there are no signs of demand as markets are closed, stadiums not accessible to masses and major sports activities have already been cancelled,‚Äù said Munish Chopra, proprietor, Chopra Synthetics.He said the biggest buyers ‚Äî schools, universities, gymnasiums and sports clubs ‚Äî are shut, resulting in virtually no uptake of sports goods. The losses of manufacturers are mounting as they are yet to receive payments but have to pay fixed electricity charges despite their units being closed.Punjab and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh are hubs of sports industry, with former contributing 60% to total sales. The Rs 1,200-crore sports industry of Jalandhar contributes around 30% to exports from the country.‚ÄúThough there is no demand, even if we want to start operations, labour is hardly available as a large number of migrants have left,‚Äù said one of the manufacturers.‚ÄúThe cancellation or deferment of exports and domestic orders has started biting the industry. The extension of the lockdown will give a major jolt to the industry. Sports goods don‚Äôt come under essential items. This will delay the revival of our industry and it will take at least 1-2 years,‚Äù said Ashish Anand, CEO, Anand & Anand and chairman of Sports and Toys Manufacturers Association.
