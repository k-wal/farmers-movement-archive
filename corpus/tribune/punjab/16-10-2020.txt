I fear for his security.”“In the garb of ongoing investigation, the West Bengal Police have illegally detained my husband while deliberate attempts are being made to give a political overtone to the matter,” she said.Karamjit along with her 16-year-old son is running from pillar to post for Balwinder’s release. The duo even visited Kolkata recently to seek justice for the retired Black Cat Commando.“I couldn’t stay back at home and decided to fight the injustice,” said Karamjit.Accompanied by Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, Karamjit met West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has assured them of justice.Various Sikh organisations in West Bengal have also come out in support of Balwinder Singh and submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Balwinder who was serving as a personal security officer of West Bengal BJP leader Priyanshu Pandey was assaulted, his turban defiled, and later arrested by Kolkata Police for carrying a firearm during the protest rally.In video posted on a social media, Manjinder Singh Sirsa condemned the act of local police and “unsupportive” approach of the WB Government in the matter.He said that they would fight against the “injustice” tooth and nail and also claimed that they had been able mobilise support for the release of Balwinder Singh and if the authorities concerned did not relent, they would be forced to knock court’s door.    Rupinder Singh, who accompanied Karamjit to Kolkata, said, “We have been exploring every possible alternative for Balwinder’s release.”“We are seeking support from all quarters to get strict punishment for police personnel who not only beat him (Balwinder) but also defiled his turban and dragged him by his hair, thereby hurting the religious sentiments of the Sikh community,” he said. “The pistol carried by Balwinder was licensed but the West Bengal Police have applied strong sections against him which may result in his sentencing for life time,” Rupinder highlighted.“We had sought time from West Bengal Chief Minister to seek justice in the matter but did not get any response so we decided to meet the Governor of the state, and Manjinder Sirsa, president of the DSGMC, and other local Sikh organisations have extended support to us,” he added.Condemning the act, Jaskaran Singh Sivian, president of the Gurmat Prachand Lehar – a Bathinda-based Sikh organization, said, “The incident has hurt the religious sentiments of Sikh community. We demand unbiased investigation and justice in the matter. High-handedness of authorities against minorities would not be tolerated.”Balwinder’s father Gurtej Singh (71) said, “In the video circulated on social media, my son could clearly be seen urging them to not defile his turban but they did it thrice and then dragged him by his hair. Nothing could be more shameful than that.”“He stood for the identity of Sikhs, now it’s time that the community stands united to ensure his safe and secure release and strictest possible action against those who assaulted him,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kargil-war-veterans-wife-running-from-pillar-to-post-for-his-release-156661
16-10-2020||Lahore||Pakistan court questions federal government's construction of Kartarpur Corridor||A Pakistani court has questioned the federal government on the construction of the Kartarpur Corridor in Punjab, directing the authorities to explain whether the project was "not an intervention" in the affairs of the provincial government.During a hearing on a petition against undue delay in the construction of Lahore-Narowal Road, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Qasim Khan on Thursday asked a federal law officer as to who was responsible to construct the road—federal or provincial government.The law officer said the matter of releasing funds for the construction of the road in question did not fall within the ambit of the federal government.Chief Justice Khan asked: "If construction of the road was the subject of the province how the federal government constructed and controlled the project of Kartarpur Corridor. Do the governments work on their personal wishes or under the law?”The judge directed the law officer to tell the court whether Kartarpur Corridor's project carried out by the federal government "was not an intervention in the affairs of the province of Punjab." The judge said the court may issue a notice to the prime minister if the meddling on the part of the federal government in the affairs of the province was established."We would issue a notice to the prime minister if necessary,” he said.The chief justice adjourned the hearing for two weeks and also directed Additional Attorney General Ishtiaq A Khan to file a reply in the matter.In November last year, India and Pakistan threw open the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative as part of commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev The Imran Khan government had taken credit of the construction of the corridor, while Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid claimed that it was the "brainchild" of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. It is the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, who had spent the last 18 years of his life in Kartarpur.The corridor—which allows Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free travel to the historic Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara—was closed on March 16 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the court is shut (for Dussehra) we don’t want anything to happen during these nine days,” the CJI said.The committee is required to visit the affected states and submit fortnightly reports to the top court at the initial stages or “as and when found necessary”.The Bench asked heads of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme (NSS) and Bharat Scouts and Guides to provide young force to the panel for locating stubble burning and bringing it to notice of authorities concerned to prevent it.The order came on a fresh petition filed by two students—Aditya Dubey and Aman Banka—who suggested that Justice Lokur could be assigned the task.On behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Vikas Singh pointed out that “there is a grave concern about the quality of air in the National Capital Region and that the quality is dropping rapidly. This is due to several factors, including the practice of stubble-burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh and certain activities in the NCR of Delhi.”Singh said despite several measures taken, there was a reported increase in the amount of stubble-burning, leading to increased pollution in Delhi-NCR.On behalf of Punjab senior counsel PS Narsimha and for Haryana Additional Advocate General Anil Grover pointed out that several steps had been taken for stopping stubble-burning in the two states, including developing an App which can help in identification and notification of the particular field in which someone has burnt stubble.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench that the government had reservations about appointment of Justice Lokur committee for monitoring stubble-burning and the EPCA was already doing the job.  The court made it clear that appointment of the Committee was not intended to dilute the powers, functions and the authority of any authorities such as EPCA, already created.“The object of appointing a Committee is more to facilitate and coordinate the activities of different authorities so that the problem is resolved. The different authorities created by the States/Centre, shall also be free, to carry on their own activities, without feeling muted by the appointment of the Committee,” it said.The court will further hear the matter on October 26. The top court is already seized of a PIL on air pollution in NCR. It has been asking states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the Centre to take measures to ensure farmers don’t indulge in stubble burning.Despite a ban on stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes of paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it, while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.On October 6, the top court had agreed to examine a suggestion that a portion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be withheld from farmers and released later only after a verification that they didn’t burn stubble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-appoints-ex-judge-mb-lokur-as-one-man-panel-to-monitor-steps-to-prevent-stubble-burning-156619

16-10-2020||Chandigarh||As winter sets in, water level in major dams remains below normal||As winter starts to set in the Himalayas where the catchment areas of major dams lie, the water level in crucial reservoirs in the region, that depend on snowmelt and rain, remains noticeably below normal.In Punjab, the available storage is 26 per cent below normal whereas in Himachal Pradesh it is 21 per cent below normal, according to data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on October 15.The depletion period for the dams begins in October and continues till May.During this period, inflows are drastically reduced as there is negligible snowmelt. Night temperatures in high altitude areas are already below freezing point.While the total storage capacity in Punjab is 2.34 billion cubic meters (BCM) the present water availability is 1.29 BCM.In Himachal, 8.40 BCM is currently available against the total capacity of 12.48 BCM.There is one major reservoir in Punjab at Thein Dam on the Ravi and two major reservoirs in Himachal – at Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej and Pong Dam on the Beas.There is another reservoir in Himachal at Kol Dam, upstream of Bhakra, but its storage capacity is minuscule as compared to the other reservoirs.The reservoir at Thein Dam is presently filled up to just 55 per cent of its total capacity as compared to 85 per cent at this time last year and an average of 74 per cent over the past 10 years.The water level recorded at Bhakra Dam on October 15 was 512.83 meters against the maximum permissible level of 527.91 meters.The water level recorded at Bhakra Dam was 501.51 meters against the upper limit of 512.06 meters.This translates to the currently available storage being 65 per cent of its total capacity. This was 83 per cent at this time last year and an average of 86 per cent over the past 10 years.At Pong Dam, the level was 416.99 meters against the upper limit of 423.67 meters, resulting in the present storage being 69 per cent of the total capacity.It was 87 per cent last year and an average of 85 per cent over the past 10 years.The below normal water level in reservoirs comes in the wake of the monsoon, which ended in September, being deficient in the region this year by about 18 per cent. Even the first fortnight of October has gone dry.Whereas the normal rain for Himachal is 15.9 mm for the period from October 1—15, no rain has been recorded by the India Meteorological Department.The same is the case with Punjab and Haryana, which are supposed to get around 5.3 mm and 6.1 mm rain, respectively during this period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/as-winter-sets-in-water-level-in-major-dams-remains-below-normal-156609
16-10-2020||Bathinda||AAP demands an immediate release of post-matric scholarship dues worth crores||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has made a strong exception to the post-matric scholarship—worth crores—for Dalit students across the state.This has been pending for over three years.Reacting to Punjab Cabinet decision wherein the state government has given it's not to pay the post-matric scholarship to the beneficiaries at par with Punjab, saying "it would be paid for the next academic session 2021-22," Budhlada MLA Principal Budhram said, that the lopsided decision seems to have been taking in a tearing hurry, as the beneficiaries have not been paid dues worth crores for over three years.AAP MLA said, that due to the non-payment of the post-matric scholarship dues, the future of more than 1.25 students belonging to the Dalit category was in the doldrums. They have been forced to pull out of various schools and colleges, as they were releasing their degrees due to non-payment of the dues.Accusing the state government of usurping a whopping scholarship, an amount worth crores, released by the union government released to the state government, the AAP MLA said that the unscrupulous leaders like Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, a Cabinet Rank Minister, who was embroiled in a multi-crore scholarship scam, was responsible behind ruining the careers of lakhs of students.He accused the government of protecting such tainted ministers, who walk free after committing multi-crore scams and other crimes, sans the scantest fear of the law.The Budhlada MLA said, that the Congress government in the saddle ‘grabbed’ power in the state by promising the sky to the people of Punjab, adding, that the loan waiver promise remained a paper promise by far, and so we're bringing the drug mafia to its toes within four weeks of assuming power, and bringing those behind the incidents of desecration of Sri Guru Granth Sahib under oath of ‘Gutka Sahib’.He said the students of a particular category would take it as a breach of contract if they were denied their dues from the time they actually deserve.Principal Budhram urged Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to revisit the decision, and roll back on cabinet decision and allow payment of scholarship from the current academic session 2020-2021 to enable students of the hassled community to pursue their higher studies under the Right to Education.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-demands-an-immediate-release-of-post-matric-scholarship-dues-worth-crores-156603

They have also visited the Raj Bhavan, and urged Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to make arrangements for his release."He will be in police custody till Sunday. Thereafter, Singh will be produced before court," a police officer said.The turban controversy has emerged as a political flashpoint between the TMC and the BJP, with the safrom camp accusing the ruling party of hurting religious sentiments.The state government had said that a political outfit was deliberately giving "communal colour" to the incident to serve its "narrow partisan interest".The state home department had also said Singh was arrested in accordance with the law for carrying illegal firearms during BJP's march to the state secretariat.Violence had erupted in Kolkata and adjoining Howrah on October 8, as BJP activists tried to go past barricades put up by the police to stop their rally at the secretariat.The police later said the rally was taken out by the saffrom camp without proper permission.

He said the abrogation of these laws would help strengthen the farmers’ struggle to save not only the farmers but the farm sector as a whole.Yograj comes out in support of protesting farmersAlthough the Central Government has been declaring the new agriculture laws farmer friendly but the farmers are not at all satisfied with the laws. The farmer organisations have demanded reversal of the new agricultural Acts. Well-known Punjabi cinema actor Yograj Singh said this here on Thursday.He was here in support of farmer organisations against the new laws at the Chandigarh road toll plaza near Nangal Shahidan village. The farmer struggle got a boost today when Yograj Singh reached out to them. Encouraged by his visit, the farmers raised slogans against the Union government.Talking to mediapersons, Yograj said, “I understand the sufferings of farmers because I belong to a famer family and I know the plight of the farmers”. While taking a dig at the Central Government, he said the laws passed by the Centre were totally anti-farmer and would affect labourers, working class and other sections of the business community.He said that if the government was really working in the interest of farmers then it should not talk to the farmer organisations in a closed room but in front of farmers and media to find a concrete solution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/modi-govt-has-insulted-farmers-by-not-holding-talks-harpal-singh-cheema-156334

In protest, Sampla and other leaders started a parallel protest on the road, barely a few metres from the farmers’ protest, terming them anti-Dalit. Later, the police took Sampla and others into preventive custody as the situation was turning grim with the increasing number of farmers and both BJP activists and farmers raising slogans.Sampla, said, “The protest was led by a Youth Congress leader. He, along with others, blocked our way. When we objected and started a parallel protest on the road, seeking a way to go ahead to meet a Dalit youth’s family, a police party arrived and took us into custody. We were not even told where were we being taken too.”Later, the local BJP leaders were released at the boundary of Muktsar and Faridkot. However, Sampla, his nephew Robin and Sheetal Angural were then taken into custody by the Faridkot police. Kulwant Rai, SP (PBI), Muktsar, said, “Some BJP leaders were simply moved out of the district in a police vehicle. They were not ready to budge from their demand that they would go ahead either by car or on foot. The action was taken to maintain law and order in the district. No legal action is being taken against anyone.” Sampla was released later and he came back to Hoshiarpur.BJP activists across Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Phagwara raised slogans and burnt effigies of the CM in protest against the incident. Sampla demanded arrest of the perpetrators in the Fazilka case. SSP Harjeet Singh said charges under the SC/ST Act had already been added to the FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/on-way-to-fazilka-bjp-leader-vijay-sampla-gheraoed-156433

You are mistaken if you presume that stakeholders were not consulted.”Regarding what was the hurry, she said, “Despite several decades in the free country, farmers were not free. We brought an Act that ensures their rights and protection of their land and refund.”She said the government’s reform agenda continued to ensure that in the pandemic every citizen was protected and provided relief.However, she remained tight-lipped about SAD. The BJP leader said AICC president Sonia Gandhi and former AICC president Rahul Gandhi were “missing” from the Lok Sabha when issues on these farm-related Bills were going on.She lashed out at the Congress saying: “Congress party, whose son-in-law has taken lands of farmers, is now talking about their welfare.”Claiming that the Congress in 2014 had allocated only Rs 21,000 crore for agriculture in the Budget, which was raised to Rs 1.34 lakh crore when the Narendra Modi led-BJP government came to power, she said this clearly showed who thinks more and better for the farmers. Moreover, even the Prime Minister had taken a ‘sankalp’ to double their income. She alleged that the Congress was misguiding farmers over the issue of farm laws.However, the BJP event faced protests from arhtiyas. They were called to interact with the Union Minister, but returned citing they would not talk to her as they were against the laws.Vijay Kalra, president, Federation of Arhtiyas Association of Punjab, said, “We were called by BJP leaders to come here as the Union Minister would interact with us. However, on coming here we found that it was a BJP event in which she was trying to justify that these laws were for the betterment of farmers. But we are opposing it.”Leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party staged a protest with black flags outside the venue in the city where this virtual interaction with the Union Minister was going on. They raised slogans against the Union Government over the farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/smriti-irani-all-stakeholders-taken-into-confidence-on-farm-laws-156434

Against the MSP of Rs 5,725 per quintal, farmers in the region were selling their produce at as low as Rs 4,600, they claimed.With government agencies dragging their feet on cotton procurement, farmers had been subjected to loot by private traders who had been quoting prices below the MSP, they said.Vijay Kalra, president of the Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, alleged the agriculture input cost was increasing by the day, while government and procurement agencies in connivance with private companies were looting farmers.Kalra said: “The farm laws will directly affect the farmers and commission agents.”A CCI official said: “We purchase cotton with a moisture range of 8-12 per cent, but the crop being brought by farmers now has a moisture content ranging from 16-22 per cent.

The farmers said some private traders were doing this just to make profit. “The paddy crop is fetching a low price in UP, thus some rice millers are buying the crop from there and in doing so, evading the local market committee fee. We will not release the trucks until strict action is taken in this regard,” said the farmers. They alleged UP’s paddy would be shown in records as Punjab’s crop, thereby changing the per-acre yield of the crop. The Rice Millers’ Association has assured farmers of taking action against erring millers.

Pointing out that two power units at Lehra Mohabbat and one unit of GVK in Tarn Taran had already shut down, he said the state was staring at a massive power shortage.In his #AskCaptain Facebook Live session, the CM in response to a question from a Bathinda resident said the state was facing critical shortage of urea and coal and also needed to urgently move foodgrain from godowns, which was currently impeded by the rail roko andolan.The Chief Minister said there was a suggestion that the state should purchase power from the Central grid, but where was the money? He pointed out that the state government was providing free power to farmers and was facing a serious shortage of diesel too. “We need to seriously think about these problems,” he said, urging the farmers to lift their blockade to allow movement of these goods.Asserting his government’s commitment to do everything possible to protect the rights of the farmers, who had been hit hard by the Centre’s farm laws, the Chief Minister said his government had decided to convene a special session of the Vidhan Sabha on October 19 to find the way forward. “I will do everything in my power to save the farmers and their future,” he said, responding to a Ferozepur resident. Besides calling the Assembly session, his government was consulting top-most lawyers to find a way to fight the farm laws, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-blames-union-govt-for-failing-to-resolve-power-crisis-156442

Some private schools in the state opened today.School Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “As the schools are already conducting online classes, and some students prefer to attend the online classes rather than physically attending school, they may be permitted to do so. The students will be able to attend the physical classes only with the written consent of parents,” the minister said.Expressing concern over the warnings by health and medical experts of the possibility of the second wave hitting the state in the festival season or during the winter months, the Chief Minister directed the departments concerned to take all steps to ensure that things remained under control in the festive times ahead. He asked the Health and Medical Education Departments to work with market committees to ensure widespread distribution of masks with steps to encourage people to wear them, and also follow social distancing norms.The Chief Minister, who was chairing a virtual review meeting of the Covid situation, also asked the departments to ensure that the medical staff was kept motivated and vacancies were filled immediately.DGP Dinkar Gupta said the Punjab Police was gearing up to manage the festival season during which security would be beefed up and all efforts would be made to ensure strict adherence to Covid norms in markets. The DGP said the police were also focused on handling the increasing number of farmer protests as well as protests by the BJP and RSS.Even as he termed the decline in the positivity rate to 2.60 as a good sign, Dr KK Talwar, head of the state government’s expert advisory committee on health, warned of a second wave hitting Punjab during the festival season. With about 500 cases a day at present, the projections for the next few days were positive, he said, but added that with the spate of upcoming festivals and the fatigue in the health system, Punjab could see the next wave soon.Dr Talwar suggested giving pulse oximeters to ASHA workers to enable them keep a check in their respective areas.

||Teachers working for over 4 yrs to be adjusted||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 15 Less than two months after the Punjab and Haryana High Court called for the state of Punjab to consider sympathetically the case of elementary trained teachers sought to be terminated from service after putting in more than four years, the government has decided to adjust them against available posts. No less than 200 petitioner-teachers will benefit from the development. The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after Amna Rani and other petitioners filed nine petitions through senior advocate Gurminder Singh, RPS Bara, Parvesh Saini, Vikas Chatrath, Mandeep Kaur and Jimmy Singla. Taking up the matter, Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi observed the respondent-state had issued notices to the petitioners proposing termination of their services on the ground that the merit list, pursuant to which the petitioners were selected and appointed, had been revised. Keeping in view the revision of the merit list, the petitioners were pushed out of the zone of selection. As such, they could not continue and their services were liable to be terminated. Justice Sethi, on the previous date of hearing, also took on record submission by the state counsel that 2,300 posts had been advertised and were to be filled in the cadre in which the petitioners were already discharging their duties. Justice Sethi further requested the respondents to consider their case sympathetically to end the litigation as “admittedly the respondents require manpower to execute the work of the posts in the cadre, in which the petitioners are working....” In case there was no serious impediment in adjusting the petitioners, an appropriate decision be taken by the respondents, Justice Sethi had added. As the case came up for resumed hearing, the state filed an affidavit agreeing the petitioners would be adjusted against the available posts subject to certain conditions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/teachers-working-for-over-4-yrs-to-be-adjusted-156445

The administration has broken the trust of farmers, who vacated their land for the thermal plant years ago. The people of Punjab have been coerced to pay high electricity charges.”Jatinder Garg, senior vice-president, said, “It was proposed that the revenue from the sale of the thermal plant land will be reinvested in the power sector, which will reduce the tariff for the consumers. However, now the valuable land will be offered for free to private players.”Garg said, “The PSPCL management has agreed to the district administration to occupy houses at the thermal colony, Bathinda, on a nominal rent, while earlier the BOD, PSPCL, had decided to sell the houses to the state government against payment.”Padamjit Singh, chief patron, Punjab State Engineers’ Association, said, “The state government decided to close down a running plant, and rejected all proposals by experts from the power sector to establish a biomass plant and a solar plant. These proposals would have provided cheaper renewable electricity to the consumers. When the department is already grappling with staff shortage and failing to dispense quality services at ground level, the government has decided to relieve hundreds of outsourced workers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pspcl-engineers-resent-sale-of-bathinda-thermal-plant-land-156455

16-10-2020||Jalandhar||Online studies make it worse for special children||The pandemic-induced shutdown of educational institutions has made things difficult for students of all ages and groups, but the children with special needs are the worst-affected.Volunteers working under the “Inclusive Education for Disabled” initiative say teaching such students requires the use of various props and sign language, but that is very difficult to do via online mode. Ranjit Kaur, mother of 13-year-old special child Simarjit Kaur, says, “I try to help out my daughter in studies, but with not much success. She suffers from cerebral palsy. I want schools to reopen so that she could go and enjoy studying there.”Daily wager Joginder Singh’s son Amarjit Singh (15) can’t speak properly and also has an eye trouble. “For several months, Amarjit has not studied properly. He has also not been able to complete the work assigned by his teacher,” Joginder said.Special child Kirandeep Kaur’s father Manga said, “My 13-year-old daughter cannot study on her own. Her teacher keeps in regular touch, but online education isn’t possible for Kirandeep.”There are 153 cerebral palsy-afflicted students in the district, while 176 are hearing impaired and 895 face mental disability.Several parents said they were noticing behavioural changes among their children. Charanjit Kaur, one of the Inclusive Education Resource Teachers, said, “Such students used to understand lessons and follow us in the class, but now they are facing various issues.”District Special Education Teacher Neelam said “Our volunteers/teachers make calls to the parents of such students every day. It is true that online teaching is tough for such students, but this is how we can keep in touch with them these days. We also encourage parents to have fun activity sessions with their children.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/online-studies-make-it-worse-for-special-children-156345
