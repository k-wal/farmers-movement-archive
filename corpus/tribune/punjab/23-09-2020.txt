The agitating farmers were on their way to New Delhi.On receiving the information, heavy police force blocked the highway by erecting barricades at the inter-state border and stopped the protesting farmers, led by the Bains brothers, from moving ahead.The busy highway remained blocked for vehicular traffic for a couple of hours and long queues of vehicles could be seen stranded on the arterial road, which connects major parts of Punjab with Haryana and Delhi.As the protesters, wearing white kurta-pyjamas and carrying black flags, remained adamant on crossing the barricades to gain access into Haryana, the heavy police force deployed on the spot used water cannons and mild force to disperse them.Raising slogans against the Union Government, the agitators kept trying to break the police barricading but in vain. On their part, policemen kept warning the protesters against moving forward and asked them to get back or face action.Ambala Range IGP Y Puran Kumar said the protesters were not allowed to enter Haryana in view of the prohibitory orders in place to maintain law and order situation.Meanwhile, the protest caused great hardship to the commuters with several stranded travelers, including women, aged and children, seen walking on foot through the Ghaggar riverbed to reach Ambala for their further journey.On Sunday, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar leading the farmers on tractors to Delhi in protest against the farm legislations was denied entry to Haryana and stopped at the inter-state border in Sadopur near Ambala.

23-09-2020||Amritsar||Navjot Sidhu conducts 'rosh march' in Amritsar against farm Bills||Congress MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday took to the streets of Amritsar against the farm bills.Among several slogans raised by the former minister's supporters, "aa gaya Sidhu, Chha gaya Sidhu", "Sidhu teri balle balle..baaki saare thale thale", and "Sidhu teri soch te...pehra diyange thok ke" stood out the most.Sidhu's cavalcade conducted a massive "rosh march" from Bhandari Bridge to the Hill Gate—the centre of the Holy City, that connects the Wall City to the Civil Lines areas.While addressing the gathering, Sidhu stressed, that he believed in "politics of solution", and the people of Punjab would infuse their strength to ensure its implementation, be it against sand mining, cable or liquor mafia, and, now the "Kaala Kanoon" (black laws) enacted in the shape of farm bills.“Kissan saada ‘Imaan’ hai…Saadi ‘gairat hai…‘pag’ hai ..te Saadi ‘pag’ nu ohna ne hath paya hai eh kanoon bana ke”. I have stepped out for farmers, and for the united cause of Punjab for which I will fight till my last breath. Above the party lines, 90 per cent MLAs opposed it. All Punjabis should unite against it”, he said.He cautioned that the BJP-led Centre has another Draconian bill in waiting, which is "Electricity Amendment (Draft) Act 2020".“Once it’s implemented, it will be the last nail in the coffin and destroy Punjab’s Agriculture model. The draft is already ready. Whenever they wish, they would implement it in no time”, he said.He said, that the electricity amendment act would equip the Centre to have control over power regulation. Now, the control is with the PSPCL.After this act, the whole control would shift to the Centre, and the biggest impact would be, that all power subsidies would be scrapped.He said, that the Centre was replacing the "successful mandi model" with the "free market model"—which has failed in the US and Europe. He said, that it would impact the state's revenue to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore per annum, that was incurred from mandis only.“Where there are no mandis in states, the farmers faced worst conditions and were resorted to doing petty labour jobs The MSP, since 1980 was raised just by 15 times whereas the employees of all sectors got enhancement of more than 500 times during the same pan. It was through farmers’ that the Centre procure food grains for underprivileged people on subsidised rates and the farmers were being ruined”, he said.The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed in both houses of Parliament, amid protests by opposition parties.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was passed in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.“The ‘roti’ is the most essential commodity. How could it be shunted out of the essential commodities list?. Similarly, hoarding which has been legalised that would resort to food inflation”, he concluded. However, farmers in Punjab will be intensifying their agitation after “Punjab Bandh’ on September 25. An indefinite “Rail Roko” campaign will be launched in the state from October 1 onwards.This decision was taken in a joint meeting of 31 farmer unions, held at Moga on Wednesday.The representatives of all these unions decided, that an indefinite campaign would be launched next week onwards, to force the BJP-led Central government to withdraw the three controversial farm Bills.It has also been decided, that they will be forcing the Capt Amarinder Singh government to call a special session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha to reject the Bills.“The Congress government, too, should show their sincerity towards saving farming by rejecting these Bills,” said Jagmohan Singh, General Secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).Other than this, the farmer unions will start "gheraoing" the houses of all BJP leaders in the state and boycott them.“The most important decision taken in the meeting today is to ask all Gram Sabhas in Punjab to pass resolutions against the Bills and reject them,” said Dr Darshan Pal of Krantikari Kisan Union.In the coming days, these Unions plan to intensify their agitation and start to "gherao" Delhi.
23-09-2020||Chandigarh||In a historic move, 31 farmer organisations join hands for Punjab bandh on Sept 25||Farmer organisations in Punjab are getting widespread support across the social spectrum, in their agitation against the Farm Bills passed by the Parliament, as they ready for a complete “Punjab Bandh” on Friday.Having refused help from the political parties, and insisting on keeping their movement—in a historic move—all 31 farmer organisations in Punjab have joined hands to ensure their band call is a success. Even as the representatives of these farmer organisations met at Moga on Wednesday to finalise their strategy post the September 25 band, they are busy mobilising their own block level workers, and strategising the joint protest by workers of all 31 farmer organisations.Jagmohan Singh Patiala, member of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, is leading the protests. He is responsible for the farmer unity in these protests. He says, that the angst among farmers against the government over these “kaale kanoon” has never been so visible. “Young computer-savvy children of farmers are busy spreading the word on social media and countering all false propaganda unleashed by the IT cell of those parties which have agreed to enact these Bills. Young girls are stitching banners and flags for the bandh; while our foot soldiers are moving door-to-door asking maximum people to join the stir,” he said. Echoing similar enthusiasm, Dr Darshan Pal of Krantikari Kisan Union, said, that the traders' organisations have assured them of complete bandha of markets as having the dairy farmer unions, assuring that there would be no milk supply across the state on Friday. In the run-up to the main protest on Friday, small protest marches are being held in villages, where farmers are burning the effigies of Central government. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) have held massive protest sit-ins at Patiala and Badal village (home districts of Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal), which ended on Tuesday. “It is a fight for our survival, as the government wants to wash off its hands from good procurement and leave farmers at the mercy of corporates. We will give all we have to oppose this, without taking any support from the opportunist political parties. We won’t allow them to launch their political tirades from our platforms,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, President of BKU ( Rajewal). In Ludhiana, BKU ( Lakhowal) and BKU (Rajewal) are leaving no stone unturned to ensure the success of their bandh. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of BKU (Lakhowal), told The Tribune, that for past three days he is coordinating with the workers of the other 30 Unions on places where they have to stage dharna and protests. Interestingly, women participation in farmer protests, too, is a relatively new phenomenon. In Barnala district, for the first time, women wings of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) have been formed in six villages as more and more women express their solidarity with the protesting Male farmers. Amarjit Kaur, who has been appointed the president of Women Wing of BKU( Dakaunda), said that the otherwise male-dominated 'Kisan Unions' realised, that women too are a big force for effective protests, after seeing women participation in the September 14 protests, where 15,000 women were there. “We are as much a part of the rural farm economy as men, and as much affected by these ordinances. Women will be stationed on railway lines and major traffic intersections on state and national highways on Friday, to ensure a complete bandh,” she said.

They claimed, that their calls for help had gone unheeded. Among them, 170 are junior resident doctors who are students in postgraduate medical courses here. The junior doctors are doing round-the-clock duties in COVID wards of the hospital here. Describing them as "cannon fodder" in the fight against the pandemic, the association of the junior doctors on Tuesday met the Superintendent of the medical college, and demanded safety and security for them in the hospital.They claimed, that unregulated and uncontrolled entry of a large number of attendants, relatives and other people in the hospital was not only exposing them to a high risk of infection, but also there were increasing incidents of threats to them. In a memorandum submitted to the Superintendent, the doctors claimed that many among them were women who were performing round-the-clock duties, adding, that the unregulated entry in the hospital was a threat to their security during the night hours.They alleged, that security personnel in the hospital don't keep a check on private vehicles entering the hospital premises. It led to an uncontrolled number of attendants and other persons in the hospital, increasing the risk of community spread as most of these entrants in the hospitals were without masks, they said.The doctors alleged, that there was no adequate lighting arrangement in the hospital premises during the night hours on the road to the emergency and even in Covid isolation wards that had led to many unwanted incidences in the past like harassment of doctors and theft of vehicles.They said there was no cafeteria working in the hospital 24x7 due to which the healthcare workers working continuously for long hours don't get to eat anything.The doctors alleged that a kitchen in the doctors' hostel was non-functional for the last many days, and they were relying on tiffin service. More than 50 doctors and paramedical staff in the hospital have already got infected with Covid-19 here.Dr Shleikh Mittal, Medical Superintendent, said: “The security issue of doctors has been raised with the police and we are solving their other problems also.”

I have asked the nodal officers to check the places where these farm fires were informed and submit a report by tomorrow,” said Bal.However, images from NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have revealed that the farm fires were started in Punjab and Haryana and that Amritsar had reported over 50 farm fires in September.An agriculture department official said, “Amritsar is among the first region where farms fires are reported during this period every year”. He said the administration should take up adequate measures for not only sensitising the farmers about harmful effects of this detrimental practice, but also taking some stringent measures.However, another official said that at current times when the farming community was agitated against the farm bills passed by the Centre and holding demonstrations, it would not be appropriate to take tough measures such as registering cases against offenders.Chief Agriculture Officer Bal further pointed out that as per the instructions of National Green Tribunal, the peasants are being sensitised to plough the crops residue in the land itself which would enrich it (agricultural lands) with beneficiary nutrients.Gurpreet Singh Khaira, Deputy Commissioner, said that the agriculture department had arranged 1,775 machines on subsidy to the farmers, farmer groups and cooperative societies for managing crop residue. He said that the owners of baler machines were called from the Malwa region so that farmers did not face any problem for managing straw. He said it would cost Rs 1,000 per acre for the same.

Members of various kisan unions and Congress activists claimed they would not allow Deol to enter his constituency for his “anti-farmer stance”.In Qadian, 200 activists led by Kanwar Partap Singh Bajwa, general secretary, Punjab Youth Congress, blackened the posters of the MP.Kanwar said despite claiming to be a farmer’s son, Deol had gone against the interests of farming community. “We will not allow Deol to enter his constituency. If he does try to come, he should be ready to face consequences. He knows nothing about the ground reality.”He said, “Instead of standing with people who voted for him, he stood with his party, which is doing things which are totally detrimental to the interests of farmers. Today, we blackened his posters and if he comes, we will blacken his face. In just one stroke, the Centre made farmers apprehensive whether they will get minimum support price (MSP) for paddy and wheat produce.”MLA Fateh Jung Bajwa said Deol has turned out to be a “disaster”. “Instead of going public on social media, Deol should have kept quiet. Now, people are repenting what sort of representative they have elected. I fail to understand why he has entered politics when he knows nothing about it,” said the MLA.In Pathankot, protestors led by Sanjeev Bains, working president, Pathankot District Congress Committee, held demonstration in front of the residence of Punjab BJP chief Ashwani Sharma.“Deol has proved to be a misfit in the world of politics. He is turning a blind eye towards the interests of farmers. Under no circumstances he will be allowed to enter the constituency. He calls himself a farmer’s son, but ironically he could not look after farmers. He should resign,” said Bains.Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, too, vented his ire on the MP. “We are fighting with the Centre, but for some inexplicable reason, MP Deol is battling farming community. He delivers good dialogues, but politics is not about acting. I ask Deol to keep in mind the anger of farmers next time he decides to come to Gurdaspur,” he said.“He is a man who carries misplaced confidence. If he is so sure and confident of himself, why does he not take up issues relating to the welfare of people of Gurdaspur in Parliament? Actually, we all are waiting for him to make his debut speech in the Lok Sabha,” added Randhawa.
23-09-2020||Amarjot Kaur||Students lose sleep for overseas online classes||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 22The pandemic has been nothing short of a nightmare for most students who came back to Chandigarh in March and are studying online at their universities abroad. While erratic timings, courtesy time-zone difference, have sent their biological clocks in a tizzy, most students are losing sleep over picking between pre-recorded lectures and live lectures.A second-year student from a university in Canada, who has been here since the lockdown, said, “We are expected to be up all night and sleep during the day. It is taking a toll on our health. I feel like I am isolated from family and friends. Our university gives asynchronous lectures. The pre-recorded ones lack interaction and if you want to be involved with the class, you need to attend live lectures.”A third-year student, who is studying in a university in Seattle, US, is facing a similar situation. “My classes start at 9 pm. The hardest are the lectures that start at 3 am,” he rues. The student added, “It’s easily five hours of classes and then we have assignments and mid-terms too. The hardest thing is to sit up at wee hours to give a mid-term (exam). While some professors are benevolent to give us a 24-hour bracket to choose from, others want us to appear for exams at the designated time.”Most students said they missed the classroom environment and community activities centred around academics. “In the online setup, you cannot even text someone else because those settings are blocked by professors to avoid spamming,” said a student. “I want to become an insurance actuary and we have a club for actuaries in my university, but I will not be able to join it,” he said.Another city-based student from a university in British Columbia said, “I didn’t have the transfer credits, so for me, in order to graduate in four years, I have to take a full course load. The classes are hectic. I am taking five classes and doing internship too.” He added, “On Mondays, my classes start at 10.30 pm till 5 am. On Tuesday, I have pre-recorded classes and have another class in the morning. So I stay up one day and the next day, I am sleeping early. It’s messing up with my health.”Another student studying in Canada is planning to leave in November. “My parents called me here in March. They said international flights would be shut in March. Only recently have they opened up flights for students with visas and I am going back. I am applying for medical insurance and looking for a place to stay.”One of the students’ parent shared: “It’s been a stressful time for our children and we are now sending them back to their colleges. That’s the only solution.”
23-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||Lok Sabha nod to Kashmir Languages Bill||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 22The Lok Sabha tonight passed the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill 2020 to include Kashmiri, Hindi and Dogri as the official languages of the UT apart from the existing Urdu and English.Before the Bill’s passage, the government said provisions had been made in the legislation to promote the Punjabi language, spoken by 1.78 pc of the population of J&K. Several Punjab MPs, cutting across party lines, had sought that Punjabi be included as an official language in JK.BJD’s Pinaki Mishra raises Punjabi issueBiju Janata Dal (BJD) member Pinaki Mishra raised the issue of Punjabi not being given official status in J&K, saying, “Since our opposition MPs are absent, someone should make a query on their behalf.”MoS G Kishan Reddy, piloting the Bill, said the UT’s Lt Governor had recommended that the majority of the JK’s population wanted the inclusion of Kashmiri, Dogri and Hindi among the official languages.Reddy said more than half (53.26 pc) the population of J&K speaks Kashmiri, 20.64 pc Dogri, 2.73 Hindi, while “only 0.16 pc speaks Urdu”.“These are Census figures. Even 70 years after being the official language of J&K, Urdu is spoken by just 0.16 pc people here. But Urdu will continue as the official language of J&K along with English and three more will be added,” the minister said after National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi questioned the Lok Sabha’s legislative competence over the Bill which is pending for scrutiny before a constitution bench of the apex court.Masoodi also asked the government if any other state had more than two official languages, to which the minister said, “Yes even a UT as small as Puducherry has five official languages, including Telegu, Tamil and French.” The NC leader demanded the revocation of the abrogation of Article 370, saying, “We want distance between people to end and the August 5, 2019, decision on Article 370 to be revoked. But you continue to treat us differently. Also if such few people speak Urdu in J&K, why have Urdu as an official language at all?”On BJP’s behalf, minister and Udhampur MP Jitendra Singh attacked Masoodi for “exposing himself” and said, “People who get elected on 10 pc of all votes want to maintain their dynastic hegemony in J&K. Today you have exposed yourself by saying that you do not want official status for Kashmiri language. It’s also surprising that a former judge like you should undermine the August 5 law which Parliament, the supreme democratic institution, passed.”Jitendra Singh also asked the NC what its definition of self-rule was.“Self-rule is the empowerment of masses. But your party boycotted the panchayat elections in J&K because self-rule for you is the rule for self, the rule of dynasty,” said Singh.The Bill was passed by voice vote with the Opposition absent after the boycott of the proceedings.

Harpreet used to ‘fight’ with children over small issues, he told the police.On Sunday, she scolded the children over combing of hair. He claimed when he was about to leave for work in the evening, Harpreet told him she could not take care of the children anymore. Gurpreet pacified her and went to work.Around 10 am on Monday, Gurpreet got a call from his brother who told him that one of his kids was missing.

The amount is to be paid from her pocket.The rap came nearly a month a Division Bench in the same matter ruled that the intent, approach and an order passed by the Patiala CWC, whereby the minor was removed from her father’s custody before being given in foster care, lacked bona fide.The matter was initially brought to the High Court’s notice after the child’s father, an Army officer, filed a Habeas Corpus petition. Among other things, the father alleged that an aunt and uncle, to whom the child’s custody was handed over, were influential persons of the area. The uncle was, in fact, related to a sitting MLA from the ruling party.Taking up the matter, a single judge Bench admonished the Patiala CWC for “colourable exercise of powers” in the nine-year-old child’s custody matter.Refusing to intervene in the single judge order on the appeal by the uncle and aunt, the Division Bench asserted the Army officer, being the biological father of the minor, was her natural and legal guardian in terms of Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. On the contrary, the appellant uncle and aunt failed to show whether they had any authority or lawful right to detain the minor. “In the given circumstances, the only and the inevitable conclusion we could reach is: She was in illegal detention of the appellants,” the court said.

The move will help end the strike by exporters and traders, who have refused to buy basmati from Punjab citing higher tax structure in the state.No refundsThe move will provide relief to the tune of Rs100 crore to basmati traders/millersHowever, no refund will be made to dealer/miller/ trader for export of basmati to other countriesEven as PUSA 1509 variety continues to arrive in mandis and sell at Rs 1,900 per quintal against last year’s price of Rs 2,400 per quintal, the exporters decided to buy the produce from neighbouring Haryana and Delhi.The move is being seen as a step to woo farmers who are on a warpath because of the farm Bills. The reason for farmers’ refusal to buy from Punjab was mainly because the Haryana and UP Governments have decided to go ahead with the Farmer Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, which allows traders to buy produce outside the agriculture produce marketing committees, by paying just one per cent tax. In Punjab, they were to pay 4.25 per cent tax.“We will buy from a state where the tax is low, in order to remain competitive. The government understood our predicament in this time of economic slowdown and decided to reduce the taxes,” said Ranjit Singh Josan, vice-president, Punjab Rice Millers and Exporters Association.The area under basmati in Punjab has increased by 25,000 hectares this year — from 6.25 lakh hectares in 2019 to 6.50 lakh hectares now.

The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) has rejected the hike, terming it a cruel joke on the farmers.Anticipating a financial bailout from the government, farmers said they had been let down by the paltry increment as the agricultural sector grappled with high input cost and other issues. They said the government’s move fell short of the MS Swaminathan Commission’s recommendation of the hike in MSP by 50 per cent more than the weighted cost of production.‘Don’t rub salt into our wounds’At a time when farmers are angry over the agri Bills, a meagre hike in MSP of wheat is like rubbing salt into the wounds of the already financially stressed farmers. — Harmeet Singh Kadian, BKU (Kadian) chiefFarmers said they felt cheated and insulted by various governments over the issue of the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report. Shingara Singh Mann, state secretary of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), reminded the BJP of its poll promise of fixing the MSP as per the Swaminathan commission report.He said the government had ‘failed’ to calculate the input cost of wheat cultivation and other expenses while tabulating the MSP.BKU (Sidhupur) district president Baldev Singh Sandoha said: “The government claims to double the farmer’s income by 2022. How would it do so when the MSP increase is not even 10 per cent? The government has once again showed its anti-farmer face.”“The MSP of cotton has been fixed by the government at Rs 5,710 per quintal, but farmers are forced to sell their crop to private buyers at Rs 4,500, as the CCI hasn’t yet started purchasing the crop,” he added. Gurmeet Singh, a farmer, said: “The hike in MSP rise should correspond to the inflation rate.”BKU (Kadian) president Harmeet Singh Kadian said: “At a time when farmers were angry over the farm Bills, a meagre hike in MSP of wheat is like rubbing salt into the wounds of the financially stressed farmers.” He said the MSP of wheat ought to be Rs 3,250 per quintal based on increase in the cost of inputs and cultivation.Meanwhile, senior SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal announced that the party cadres would join the ‘rail roko’ and traffic blockade protest on September 25.

They forced BJP leaders to leave the venue without holding the event.Mandi Ahmedgarh small farmers to boycott those not supporting the September 25 bandh“BJP leaders wanted to misguide locals by projecting that the farm Bills were in favour of farmers. We had announced that if they did not leave on their own, we would remove them forcibly,” said Bhupinder Longowal, convener, KKU.The police also reached the spot and tried to pacify the agitating farmers. But they refused refused to budge and kept raising slogans against the BJP leaders for almost an hour.As the number of protesters swelled, BJP leaders, including party’s state executive member Sarjiwan Jindal, district president Randeep Deol, Kisan Morcha general secretary Maninder Singh Kapial and BJP Yuva Morcha district president Navdeep Sharma, left the dharmshala under police protection.“Our party has done nothing wrong, but our political opponents are spreading false information about the Bills,” said Jindal. In Mandi Ahmedgarh too, small and marginal farmers have decided to adopt a do-or-die policy to get the farm legislations withdrawn by the Centre. They have decided to boycott all those who don’t intend to support the complete bandh on Friday.“The fact that not even a single farmer was ready to vouch for agricultural policies being brought in by the government reflects that the farm legislations were against farmers in all respects and if implemented would ruin the future of the peasantry gradually,” said Satbir Singh Sheera Banbhaura, an AAP leader from Amargarh.All India Kisan Sabha leaders Baldev Latala and Sikandar Jartauli regretted that successive governments had failed to protect the interests of farmers and the NDA government was hell bent upon appeasing the corporate sector by crushing the backbone of the economy of the nation.

He held a meeting with his supporters here today.The Congress leader has asked farmer unions to form cooperatives with small farmers as equal partners to protect them from exploitation by capitalists. He also said challenging the Bill in the Supreme Court appeared to be the best way to counter the Central Government’s decision.“There is a need to chalk out a common minimum programme to safeguard the farmers’ interests. Only six per cent of India’s farmers were benefitted of the basic MSP, whereas the 94 per cent who roam the markets end up doing petty labour jobs to make both ends meet,” he said, adding that farmers of Punjab and Haryana contributed substantially to distributing food through the public distribution system.The Punjab and Haryana farmers carried the load of the country’s PDS, supplying cheap foodgrain for 80 crore people by keeping the MSP much below the genuine market price. Punjab has 1,850 purchase centres including 152 big mandis.He said the Union Government had made the mistake of choosing a failed free-market structure from the US and Europe over India’s successful ‘mandi pattern’. “The move will favour big crony capitalists at the cost of public enterprises, farmers and labourers,” he said, adding that the Bills would adversely affect India’s federal structure and impinge upon the state government’s jurisdiction.“Who has spared the thought for 28,000 arhtiyas and four to five lakh allied labourers of mandis who are on the verge of losing their livelihood,” he asked.He also claimed that the Bills could lead to “unprecedented” food inflation.

He asked the Chief Minister to apologise to the farming community for encouraging corporatisation of the farm sector by accepting the Montek Singh Ahluwalia committee report which called for reducing procurement of foodgrain. He asked the Chief Minister to scrap the committee and reject its report which he termed as a ‘death warrant’ for Punjab farmers.A group of five AAP rebel MLAs led by Sukhpal Khaira has also made a similar demand to the CM to convene a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to rescind the “anti-farmer” laws as agriculture marketing is a state subject.Meanwhile, as part of its ‘sangharsh’ programme, the SAD plans to hold a simultaneous ‘kisan march’ from all three Sikh religious ‘Takhts’ to Mohali on October 1 to hand over a memorandum to the President through Governor of Punjab. While the SAD chief would lead the march from Damdama Sahib, former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal would lead the march from Akal Takht Sahib.

Why did your core committee today not take a decision on quitting the BJP-led NDA coalition?” he asked Sukhbir.Questioning the SAD announcement of holding ‘chakka jam’ across Punjab “in league with the farmers, khet mazdoors and arhtiyas”, the Chief Minister claimed there was some mala fide intent behind the Akalis’ decision to jump at this juncture into the farmers’ pre-planned agitation. He said the farmers wouldn’t be fooled by these antics.“The games that the SAD, led by the Badals, have been playing with the farmers for the past several months, beginning with the introduction of the vicious ordinances, have totally exposed their double standards on this issue of critical importance,” said Captain Amarinder.Meanwhile, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Sunil Jakhar said the Congress stood firmly behind them in the most difficult moment in the history of the Indian agriculture. Punjab Congress MPs and leaders are camping in Delhi, fighting the Centre’s despotic attempts to stifle their voices and bravely facing the brute force of the BJP-controlled Delhi Police, he said, asserting that the party would not succumb to these high-handed measures and would not relent.

The CM has approved deletion of clause 12 (j) of the Custom Milling Policy (CMP) 2020-21 for this purpose. The clause deals with those millers who are also commission agents/arhtiyas and, under existing rules, were not allowed to be allotted to the agency for which they were operating as commission agents. The move would help ensure staggered procurement, thus preventing crowding of mandis during the pandemic.
