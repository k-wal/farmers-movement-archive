All the cops had retired as Inspector from the UT police.Additional District and Sessions Judge Monika Goyal, while granting the anticipatory bail to the four ordered that they must join investigation by physically appearing before the Investigating Officer within seven days from today.The court further ordered that in that event they be released on anticipatory bail on their furnishing personal bonds in the sum of Rs 50,000 each with one surety of the like amount.The court orders further restricted them not to leave the country and also directed to surrender their passports with the police. The court also directed the Investigation Officer to join the accused/applicant in investigation by maintaining social distancing and by following all the precautions mentioned for prevention of Covid-19.It is pertinent to mention here that former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini had also been granted anticipatory bail by the court after being booked in the same case. The other two cops then Sub Inspector Satvir Singh and DSP Baldev Singh have passed away. Advocate HS Dhanoa and Himmat Singh Deol, counsel for the four cops, had contested the evidences of state by falsifying their claims of evidences produced in the form of statements of Sukhvinder Kaur, a resident of Phase VII and Sarabjit Kaur, resident of Phase X as well as the eyewitness Gursharan Kaur Mann, a practicing advocate at the Punjab and Haryana High Court that they have not named these cops in their statements.Dhanoa, while taking this as ground for seeking bail, argued before the court that witnesses have named then DSP Baldev Singh who has already passed away. “Apart from the statements of the Mohali residents and advocate G K Mann, Qadian police also could not ascertain the names of these four cops in any of any of their statements — which convinced the court to grant the anticipatory bail,” said Dhanoa.District Attorney Sanjit Batra, while opposing the anticipatory bail by refuting the claims of the defence submitted before the court, “Their claims are false and baseless and it seems that they have made the grounds before disappearing Multani as he was picked up by accused policemen from his house in Phase 7 on December 11, 1991 and statements of witnesses in this regard have been recorded by the police. Whereas now they are claiming that they picked him up from near KC Theatre. These cops were present in the team under former DGP Saini which had interrogated Multani.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/multani-case-after-sumedh-saini-4-former-chandigarh-cops-get-anticipatory-bail-86986

Four class IV employees of the hospital have tested positive for coronavirus and they have blamed the low-quality masks for contracting the disease. Earlier, doctors at the hospital had also complained about the substandard PPE kits.Dr Rohit Rampal, who works at the Civil Hospital, said the staff had never shied away from their duties but the department should ensure their safety.“The masks provided to us are of very low quality and it is the probable reason behind four employees getting infected,” he added.The fear of the spread of the infection is looming large over the staff. The class IV employees complain that they are working on meagre salaries, have no health insurance and the protective gear provided to them is of low quality.“We work at meagre salaries of Rs 4500-6500 per month. We have been requesting, since long, that our salaries be hiked. Now, with four class IV employees testing positive, fear of more testing positive is looming large. The government should think about our safety,” said he.After four employees tested positive, the samples of the entire staff of the Civil Hospital and Mothers Asif Child Hospital were collected on Monday, including class IV employees, nursing staff, ward attendants and sweepers.Earlier, doctors at the hospital had complained that PPE kits being provided to them were of substandard quality. Some of the staff members had even become unconscious after wearing them due to the low-quality material being used in their manufacturing.Dr Milan Verma, a surgeon at the Civil hospital, had raised a concern over the issue and had shot a letter to Civil Surgeon, Deputy Medical Commissioner and District Nodal Officer for COVID-19 in this regard on May 4.Civil Surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that the PPE kits and masks provided to the staff at civil Hospital were the ones supplied to them by the government.There are 54 suppliers approved by the state government for supplying PPE kits and masks and except for two suppliers—one from Mohali and one from Kapurthala—all the remaining suppliers are from Ludhiana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhiana-civil-hospital-staff-go-on-strike-to-protest-low-quality-masks-86898

However, it has been learned that the department has not reached a consensus so far.Dr Avneet Kaur, Director, Health and Family Welfare, said, “The discussions are on, but no decision has been taken so far. It is too early to make a comment, but we are considering this option.”As of now, the state health department is admitting every coronavirus patient to the hospital.Epidemiologists have maintained that Punjab has not witnessed a major outbreak so far and resorting to home isolation could prove fatal in the future. Moreover, the majority of the coronavirus cases in the state had been migrating cases, said experts.The Health Department will face a herculean task monitoring asymptomatic patients if they are home-isolated. In the past, several suspected patients—including the Patiala Senior Deputy Mayor—have violated the conditions of home-quarantine. The department is likely to track positive patients with the COVA application.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coronavirus-punjab-health-dept-mulls-no-hospitalisation-home-quarantine-for-asymptomatic-patients-86885

19-05-2020||Vijay C Roy||Garment makers default on loans to pay workers||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 18In his garment business spanning over 30 years, Ludhiana-based Prithvi Raj Jairath has never seen such a slump as he is witnessing now during the lockdown. Hit by disruption, he defaulted on loan repayment to pay his employees during the lockdown period. Like him, there are many who have borrowed from banks or opted for moratorium to retain the skilled workforce."Being in small scale industry, I don't have deep pockets. As my inventory was blocked, it was impossible for me to pay my workers and meet other fixed costs during the lockdown. Left with no option, I defaulted on my EMIs to pay their salary," said Jairath, proprietor, Jairath International.His son, running a different enterprise in garments sector, also opted for moratorium to pay his workers.Prior to the lockdown, he had around 40 workers and was mostly dependent on work outsourced from medium companies. However, amid the lockdown, cancellation of orders from domestic and overseas markets came as a huge setback for the garment makers of Ludhiana. Almost 90% of the garment units in Ludhiana manufacture apparels for big brands.With the exodus of migrants from the state, only 20 workers are coming to his unit currently."I don't know when the situation will improve. As I have raw material left with me, I have asked my workers to continue operations. I am not getting my receivables but my vendors are asking for payments," he said.Like Jairath International, there are 1,200 units in micro category in Punjab which are engaged in garment manufacturing and dependent on bigger units for outsourcing work and facing hard times.There are around 8,000 apparel manufacturers in Ludhiana which are linked with each other across the value chain. Out of this, around 90% are MSMEs.According to insiders, the manufacturers are having a huge pile-up of inventory because of the lockdown in domestic market and several countries. The lockdown has resulted in temporary shutdown of factories and layoff of low-income employees in the apparel and textile sector."Our summer inventory is stuck with buyers having already cancelled the orders. We have to start winter production but very few orders are in hand and the industry is facing liquidity issue," said Harish Dua, managing director of Ludhiana-based KG Exports.According to the industry, the cancellation of orders would lead to serious financial implications and their accounts would become non-performing assets for banks.Dua said the industry had demanded 25% interest-free working capital for one year from the Centre, but the government had not taken any decision in this regard.Ludhiana contributes around 10% to total exports from the country and caters to around 30% of the domestic apparel demand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/garment-makers-default-on-loans-to-pay-workers-86872

And now to contribute her bit in fight against the Covid-19, she has started taking online classes so that students do not suffer due to the lockdown.“While sitting on my wheelchair, I could do it. This is the only way I could justify my duty. I teach my students on Zoom app. It gives me energy to move on and be strong. When I will be self-sufficient, I would rejoin my duty”, she said.With her strong will power, she is trying to live a normal life. She has resumed her studies and working hard to complete her PhD in dermatoglyphics. Besides, she is also trying her hand in painting these days.“I am all prepared to undergo the prosthesis process. But due to the lockdown, my visit to New Delhi for the rehabilitation training process has been delayed. It is a mandatory two-monthcourse that I will have to attend. I am in touch with the service providers from Germany and the US from whom the prosthetic implant would be imported and assembled here”, she said.Around 7.30 am on December 10, Dr Anupma, head of the anatomy department at Dashmesh Dental College, Faridkot, and her colleague were on their way to the college when she spotted ahead-on crash of vehicles. Putting her social responsibility as a doctor above all, she immediately asked her colleague to stop the car and rushed to rescue the injured persons. As she was trying to open a mangled door of one of the cars involved in the pile-up, a bus coming from the rear hit her, leaving her unconscious. She lost her legs in the mishap.Dr Anupma said her husband Dr Raman Gupta, daughter Dr Arushi and son Raghav, also a medical student, were her pillars of strength. “That fateful day brought a total change in my life, yet I believe that the Almighty had pre-planned it to put me in another frame to experience a different life. Whatever has to happen, happens. There is no point wailing and going in depression. I have not given up because I believe that every problem has a solution and you just need to have the valour and willpower to accept the situation ”, she says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dr-anupma-gupta-an-epitome-of-strength-and-courage-86813

As the contempt petition filed by them through counsel Gagneshwar Walia came up for hearing through videoconferencing, Justice Raina asserted: “The Municipal Council, Batala, may be reminded that the compliance was due in December, 2019, and apparently, no steps have been taken to implement the directions”. Appearing before the Bench, state counsel Anu Pal, however, undertook to inform the MC to clear the entire outstanding amounts under the decree of the HC and make payment within 15 days to the legal representatives of the deceased employee through RTGS into their bank account. Disposing of the petition, Justice Raina enhanced the interest rate from 6 to 9% per annum. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-holds-batala-civic-body-to-be-clearly-in-contempt-86640

Unable to find a place in Shramik trains so far, many of them are now determined to head back home even if it meant pedalling down hundreds of miles.Varinder Mohto of Bihar says he has been receiving calls from his parents every day. “My elderly parents want me to return home immediately. Now, I have decided to move on, come what may,” he said.In fact, Mohto and 12 other migrants started their return journey on their newly purchased bicycles from Hoshiarpur today. They would have to pedal over 1,200 km to reach their native places, they said. They had to spend a major portion of their savings on purchasing new bicycles.These migrants had arrived here during the sugarcane season. They had planned to go back home in April, but couldn’t do so due to the announcement of lockdown.Prabhu Manjhi, a sexagenarian migrant, also purchased a new bicycle to go back to Bettiah district in Bihar. “My home district is over 1,200 km from here. I know it will be very difficult for me to ride a bicycle for 1,200 km, but I am sure my fellow workers will help me out,” he said.Inderjit Puri, owner of Puri Cycles, Hoshiarpur, from where these migrants purchased their bicycles, said he had been getting orders for bicycles from migrants desirous of heading back to their native places.“In the absence of workers, it is not easy for me to ready bicycles in bulk. I have been advising them to wait until some arrangement is made for them by the government and avoid going by bicycles,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/new-bicycles-only-to-reach-home-86659

The Covid-19 lockdown forced us to think out of the box on how to resume classes. Some private schools started online classes, so we decided to follow suit.”Under the Padho Punjab, Padhao Punjab project, the MIS wing of the department we started preparing online content for children of all classes. The next big challenge was to easy accessibility of the content to a wider section of children, considering that many do not have tablets or computers. So the content was uploaded on the department’s YouTube channel and links were shared with students.There are 12,838 government primary schools in the state, with 1,55,138 students enrolled in Class III, 1,82,379 students in Class IV and 1,85,889 students in Class V.Neel Kamal, assistant district coordinator of Padho Punjab, Padhao Punjab, claimed most students were enjoying the new way of learning. “In areas where Net connectivity is poor, children use YouTube links to listen to pre-recorded lessons.

The CBI had inquired into the case at the behest of the High Court. It had also filed an FIR in the case.The Supreme Court, had, however, quashed the High Court order regarding the CBI inquiry and the case saying it did not fulfil the technical criteria. It had given the petitioners liberty to pursue the case by approaching the police. Balwant’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani complained to the police on May 6 about the case, saying the original petitioner and his father Darshan Singh Multani, an ex-IAS officer, had died since. He said he could not file the complaint earlier as Saini was in service. He retired in June 2018 and after waiting for some time to collect more evidence, he filed the complaint.Subsequently, the Mohali police filed an FIR against Saini and six other cops under IPCSections 364, 201, 344, 330 and 120B. The case dates back to December 1991, when Saini was the Chandigarh SSP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sit-to-base-probe-on-cbi-report-86635

To be eligible for an SMQ seat (total 39 seats in SGRDMC), a candidate should have unshorn hair and his/her name should have Singh/Kaur (by birth or acquired) in it. However, the woman candidate, whose name does not have suffix ‘’Kaur’’, has been allotted a seat.The authorities in SGRDM claimed that they were in favour of physical verification for Sikh minority candidates before making allotment of seats last month, but the BFUHS opted for the online verification and counselling due to non-availability of students because of the Covid crisis.Now in view of the controversy and numerous complaints, the medical university has made the eligibility verification mandatory for all those who want to participate in the second round of counselling. They have to get their eligibility verified under the SMQ from SGRDMC before appearing in the online session or they would be declared ineligible.The BFUHS has made it compulsory for applicants for Christian minority seats also to get their eligibility verified from the CMC, Ludhiana, before appearing for counselling.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/online-admission-in-pg-med-courses-triggers-row-86639

The meeting was held through videoconferencing and chaired by the Chief Minister. To ensure that the three ministers attend the meetings, a senior political functionary in the government is learnt to have called them up.The development has raised a question mark over the unanimous decision of the ministers to abstain from any meeting attended by the Chief Secretary. Last week, the ministers had staged a walkout during a meeting on excise policy after the Chief Secretary allegedly misbehaved with them.Incidentally, none of the 13 other ministers, who were reportedly part of the unanimous decision to abstain from the meetings, preferred to speak on today’s development.Only Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa tweeted, “Today’s meeting is a litmus test for those who would answer the call of their conscience after deciding unanimously to boycott the Chief Secretary. The people of Punjab are closely watching.”Though ministers Manpreet Badal, Charanjit Singh Channi and Sukhjinder Randhawa did not respond to calls, sources close to them said they would prefer to stick to the presence of the entire Cabinet, whenever the issue of the Chief Secretary is discussed in near future. Other ministers are likely to tow the line of rapprochement with the top officer as the Chief Minister is learnt to have told his close associates that the Chief Secretary is retiring in August this year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/logjam-ends-as-ministers-attend-meet-in-chief-secretarys-presence-86623

In a statement, SAD leader Maheshinder Singh Grewal said the arrest of Sonu Baba in Moga with a consignment of 2,000 tramadol tablets had unearthed the new business started by Congressmen to earn money during the curfew.

This was in line with the target of the Punjab Government even before the conceptualisation of the Jal Jiwan Mission (JJM) by the Centre. The Chief Minister sought reduction in GST on treatment plants as well as purification sytem from the current 18 per cent to 5 per cent, in order to make the JJM schemes sustainable in the long run.Captain Amarinder also urged the Union Minister to recognise the 1,449 kandi villages as ‘hill areas’ to reduce the beneficiary contribution, from 10 per cent to 5 per cent, for construction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cm-allow-farm-ops-under-mgnrega-86625

Among other things, it will now hear anticipatory and regular bail pleas filed for the first time, protection matters involving runaway couples and habeas corpus cases, without prior request or mentioning.In legal parlance, mentioning denotes request for hearing cases. In normal circumstances, mentioning indicates out-of-turn requests, which are accepted in cases involving urgency.The HC was so far hearing cases through “mentioning” made before the judges, who determined whether a particular matter warranted hearing. The entire process was tedious and time consuming.The latest guidelines issued on Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha’s behalf by Registrar-General Sanjiv Berry made it clear that application for suspension of sentence in criminal appeals and criminal revisions filed for the first time would also be heard without mentioning. The order said cases not requiring mentioning could be filed directly in the DRR branch and would be listed in due course. But the petitioner/counsel would be required to supply advanced copy of the petition through email to the official respondents. The order added that mentioning would, however, be required in case of public interest litigations.The order said the cases would be listed after a gap of one day from the passing of the petition. But, this would be subject to maximum number of cases that can be taken up for hearing in a day.In case, the number exceeds, the matters will be listed the next date or as early as possible. Regular bails, in which mentioning has been accepted, will be listed after a week. Elaborating, Berry said an application filed on Monday would be listed for next Monday and applications filed on Friday and Saturday would be listed for next Friday. The applications for suspension of sentence will be listed after a gap of 15 days as per prevalent practice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-streamlines-case-hearings-86629
