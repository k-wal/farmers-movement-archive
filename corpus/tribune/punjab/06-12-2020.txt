Hailing from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, farmers  are committed to mobilise maximum support for the shutdown,  BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Shingara Singh Mann, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti leader Satyavir Singh from Hisar, Rajasthan leader Santvit Singh Mohanpura and member of five-member Kisan Sangharsh Committee Gurbaz Singh have said. “Farmers from three states are united and a massive mobilisation campaign has been launched in villages, towns and cities of these states and that any amendment in the laws passed by the Modi government is not acceptable,” according to a statement.Farmers’ leaders said “accepting the amendments proposed by the ministers mean paving the way to dismantle the whole system of marketing and opening it to the corporate houses. They said acceptance of these laws amounts of surrender of farmers’ and people’s rights which can’t be tolerated.  BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has divided the protest site in five sites and named them as Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Nagar, Chacha Ajit Singh Nagar, Gadri Gulab Kaur Nagar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura Nagar.  All these ‘Nagars’ have a stage from where BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan)’s leader Harinder Kaur Bindu, Parmjit Kaur Pitho, state committee member Jaswinder Singh Longowal, Janak Singh Bhutal and Manjit Singh Niyal addressed the gatherings. Prem Kumar, Rakesh Khasa and Sushila Kumari from Haryana shared their ideas with the gatherings. Leader of five-member Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Hardeep Singh Jaura also spoke.Most of the leaders appreciated the initiative of Punjabi farmers and acknowledged that now the expanse of the movement is much bigger with protesters from Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and MP joining in. They asked people from all walks of life to join the India Bandh call on December 8.Farmers, farm workers, shopkeepers, traders and other businesses should contribute to make the bandh successful, according to the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmer-unions-all-geared-up-for-bharat-bandh-on-december-8-180806

06-12-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana agri minister appeals to farmers to include SYL issue as one of their demands||Haryana Agriculture Minister J P Dalal raised the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue on Sunday, saying he appeals to the farmers protesting against the new farm laws to include its construction as one of their demands during their talks with the Centre.He said that SYL was a “lifeline” for Haryana farmers and its construction was very important for the peasants of the state and he appeals to those participating in and directly or indirectly supporting the farmers’ protest to include the issue in their list of demands.Dalal, while addressing a press conference in Gurugram, said in the farmers’ protests near Delhi borders, “(From Haryana), some people, some Khaps, former chief ministers, INLD leaders and some Independent MLAs are supporting the farmers’ agitation.”“Everyone’s emotion is attached with the farmers, everyone says I am with the farmers. Even I say that I am first a farmer, then a minister,” the BJP MLA from Loharu said.“But the biggest issue for Haryana’s farmers today is water for irrigation. All issues are secondary. In 7-8 south Haryana districts, the situation is such that the water table has gone down alarmingly. In my area Loharu, there is a drinking water problem too in some villages. There is a shortage of irrigation water. When water won’t be there, how will crops grow and if there are no crops who will decide the price?” He appealed to the protesting farmers to include the SYL canal construction issue as one of their demands.“So, I appeal to all those taking part in the stir, directly or indirectly supporting them that in their main demands one line should be added that SYL canal should be constructed in Haryana,” he said.“When negotiations take place on demands and farmer leaders and representatives of the Centre sit and meet, this demand on SYL too should be kept. This issue has been lingering for 40 years. Even though the Supreme Court has ruled in Haryana’s favour, we are yet to get our rightful share,” he said.Haryana has been seeking the completion of the canal to get its share of 3.5 million acre feet of river waters.It has asserted that Punjab should comply with the 2002 and 2004 Supreme Court orders for the completion of the SYL canal for its share of the Ravi-Beas waters.When asked when there was the BJP-led government at the Centre and in Haryana why he did not raise the issue with them, Dalal said his comments made on the SYL issue were in his personal capacity and like everyone making various demands he too has the right to make one.“Like farmers have some demands, some Khaps, INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda too are keeping some demands pertaining to farmers, so I too am saying this in my personal capacity that this one line should be added as SYL is a lifeline of Haryana farmers,” he said.Replying to another question on the SYL issue, he said, “I am not going into what has been done in the past or present, I am only saying that I have a small appeal that one line should be added.”When pointed out how will adding one line by protesting farmers on the SYL issue help when it was the Centre that has to get the canal constructed, he replied, “I am not going into all that. I am saying when there are negotiations being held on farmers issue, this one line should be added, there is no harm...J P Dalal is saying this as a farmer, not as a minister.”Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have stayed put at various Delhi border points for over a week, protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.He said in the next round of talks between the protesting farmers and the Centre he was hopeful that a “solution will be found soon and a decision which is agreeable to farmers will be arrived at”.Dalal also said the Modi-led central government and the Khattar-led government in Haryana have taken a number of steps and launched several schemes for the benefit of farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/haryana-agri-minister-appeals-to-farmers-to-include-syl-issue-as-one-of-their-demands-180798
06-12-2020||---||Amarinder seeks prioritised allocation of Covid-19 vaccine for Punjab on account of high fatality rate||Chandigarh, December 6Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking priority allocation of Covid-19 vaccine to the state, on account of its higher mortality rate resulting from the population age profile and high levels of co-morbidities.In his letter, the Chief Minister said despite its relatively low caseload, the higher fatality rate due to Covid in Punjab, which thus needs special dispensation in the allocation of the vaccine. Pointing out that the vaccines currently under consideration would not perhaps reduce transmission so much as prevent serious disease, Amarinder said the best use of these vaccines would therefore be in preventing serious illness in the most susceptible groups, including elderly and persons with high morbidity.Amarinder Singh also sought clarity as to whether the Covid-19 vaccination would be entirely funded by the Government of India, including the cost of vaccines and vaccination supplies.  He further asked for clarity on the principles based on which the prioritised groups are to be identified for sequential immunization phases, and leave the preparation of the list of prioritized groups to the state.The Chief Minister also sought expansion of the definition of frontline workers for the purpose of immunisation to include administrative officials and others responsible for essential functions. While the definition of healthcare worker was relatively precise and Punjab had compiled data based on it, but the definition of frontline workers lack clarity, he noted, adding that as of now it seemed to include only security forces (Police, Armed Forces) and Municipal Workers, with some mention of primary school teachers.The Chief Minister said that while it appeared that private sector healthcare workers would be enumerated and that the Centre also intends to provide vaccines for them, apart from government sector healthcare workers, the question did arise if the vaccines also be provided to other priority groups and the general population, should they wish to receive vaccines from government providers.Thanking Government of India for supporting the State Government in the Covid-19 pandemic and congratulating Modi for taking all special steps to make Covid-19 vaccine available to all the citizens of the country, Amarinder Singh said Punjab has already undertaken preparatory activities for an effective vaccination programme as per the guidelines received from the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.Outlining the action plan for Covid-19 vaccination, the Chief Minister said the data of healthcare workers, both in government and private sectors, had been compiled and shared on the digital platform, committees for monitoring the vaccination programme at the state and at the district/ block levels had also been formed and started functioning besides the audit of cold-chain availability for storage & transportation of the vaccine has been conducted and the shortfall in the equipment shared with the Central Government.On the issue of engagement of private sector for vaccination, the CM said at present, there are no adult immunisation programmes that target adults, even in campaigns, so there will be challenges in implementation. Given that private practitioners and facilities provide a significant proportion of healthcare services in cities, Amarinder Singh said it would be helpful to understand how the services of private group are to be best utilized to lessen the burden on the public system. Even if a decision is made that the private sector is not to be used for the delivery of publicly procured vaccines, the Chief Minister emphasised the need to clarify in what will be available to the private sector in terms of vaccines. For example, will the private sector be able to get and provide vaccines that are different from what is available in the public sector, questioned Captain Amarinder Singh, adding that this will create a two-tier system which will need to be carefully handled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinder-seeks-prioritised-allocation-of-covid-19-vaccine-for-punjab-on-account-of-high-fatality-rate-180778

Jede Modi sarkaar ne teen kaale kanoon banaye si, oanu rad karaan aaye si. (We have come here to make right, and get three laws cancelled, which have been enacted by Modi government). I, and my uncle have been here for the past three days, and are supporting the Punjab farmers wholeheartedly,” said 13-year-old Harshdeep—a 9th class student from Sahuwala village (Sirsa)—who was spotted helping men with the langar.A 10th class student from Ratia, Fatehabad, Arshdeep, while sitting atop of a mini truck and waving a flag, said his father is a farmer, and he knows the ordeal of the farmers, hence, came here to strengthen the protest.“Come what may, we will force the Modi government to repeal three black laws,” he said, adding, that studying was equally important for him, but it was time to get the three laws cancelled.Another 15-year-old student from Fatehabad, Ramandeep, sitting beside Arshdeep on the truck said, that farmers are food providers, and no one would be able to survive in case the farmers devastate.Harmandeep Singh, a 14-year-old, a student of 9th standard from Sangrur (Punjab), said he was not only attending online classes, but have also brought books with them.“I study two-three hours daily, and devote the rest of the time to the protest.

06-12-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray, SAD on same page over rights of states: Chandumajra||Shiromani Akali Dal MP Prem Singh Chandumajra on Sunday said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray agrees with his party on the issue of the Centre’s alleged interference into the “rights of state governments” in fields like education, agriculture and law and order.Talking to reporters here, Chandumajra, who met the chief minister here on Sunday, said Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, supported the Akali Dal’s stand on the farmers’ protest.Alleging that revenues of states were being diluted, Chandumajra said there was a need for regional parties to unite against “attempts to centralise” the country’s politics.The Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP after the Maharashtra Assembly polls last year over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) quit the BJP-led NDA in September this year to protest against the Centre’s new agri- marketing laws.Thousands of farmers are sitting on various borders of New Delhi since November 26 against the laws and have called for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on December 8.“If states are strong, the nation will be stronger.If states are weak, the country will be weaker. Today, the country’s political system is being centralised. The Shiromani Akali Dal is for federalism,” Chandumajra said.“Even Uddhav Thackeray is of the view that rights of states need to be protected,” he said.Regional parties need to be united, the leader said.“Thackeray agrees with the Akali Dal on the issue of central government’s interferencein state governments’ rights in education,agriculture and law and order,” he said, while alleging that “revenues of states are being diluted”.Chandumajra met Thackeray at ‘Varsha’, the official residence of Maharashtra’s chief minister here.He said Thackeray supported the Akali Dal’s stand on the ongoing farmers’ protest.Farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.“We want the ongoing talks to succeed. Otherwise, all political parties should unite in two weeks and discuss the future strategy. Laws for farmers were made without asking them. People for whom the laws are made are angry and are protesting on roads,” Chandumajra said.He said parties will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind on the issue.“Political parties will meet to discuss the future strategy. Thackeray agreed to attend the political parties’ meeting in Delhi,” he said.Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office here said the Akali Dal leader stressed during the meeting that the farm laws were against the interests of farmers.Thackeray said farmers are the “backbone of the country” and resolving their problems and difficultiesshould be the government’s priority, as per the statement.

Even though she hasn’t said sorry she deleted her tweet.”He continued: “Saada intention hain (our intention is) to support our farmers, so let’s focus there. She is crazy, so let her live her life.

We take out a march of 10 km in morning and evening daily while sitting atop Tata Safari and raising slogans ‘Punjab-Haryana bhaichara jindabad’ and ‘Modi Sarkar murdabad’,” said Virender Hooda from Sanghi village (Rohtak).“Our group of 10 members daily goes to the dhana spot at Tikri border and entertains and encourages the Punjab and Haryana farmers by singing ‘raagnis’ based on the farmers’ plight and patriotism. Though Punjab farmers hardly understand the lyrics but they enjoy the music and style of singing,” said Jitender from Jhajjar, adding that many times Punjab farmers too entertained them by singing in their language.Harsharandeep Singh, a farmer from Moga (Punjab), said they were enthused and motivated by seeing the colours of Haryana being presented by local farmers during the protest.“We are telling our people in Punjab about the support of Haryanvi farmers by posting their pictures at WhatsApp groups, Facebook and Twitter,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/haryanvi-swag-becomes-centre-of-attraction-for-farmers-at-tikri-bahdurgarh-border-180715
06-12-2020||Washington||Sikh-Americans hold protest rallies in US cities against farm laws in India||Hundreds of Sikh-Americans have held peaceful protest rallies in several cities across the US in support of the Indian farmers who have been protesting against the new agricultural reforms in India.A large car caravan of protesters from various parts of California blocked the traffic on the Bay Bridge on Saturday as they moved towards the Indian Consulate in San Francisco, while several hundreds gathered in downtown Indianapolis.The protesters at both the places demanded the new laws be repealed, saying they would push Indian farmers towards poverty and give the corporate sectors a monopoly.“Farmers are the soul of any nation. We must protect our soul. People around the world, including many cities in the US and Canada, have come together to dispose of the bills that will open India's agricultural market to the private sector; allowing major corporations to take over independent farming communities and dilute crops' market value,” said Indiana-based Gurinder Singh Khalsa.Khalsa was one of the organisers of the rally in downtown Indianapolis attended by nearly 500 Sikh Americans from various parts of Indiana.Thousands of farmers are protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.A day earlier, there was a gathering of Sikh-Americans in Chicago and a protest rally in front of the Indian Embassy in Washington DC. Another one is planned for Sunday.“No Farmers, No Food” and “Save the farmers” were the commonly-sighted posters at these peaceful protest rallies.“This is a peaceful protest and should serve as a loud and clear message to the Indian government. We must support our farmers,” said Amandeep Singh Hundal in Indian.“This is not a request to the Indian government, rather a demand to take all three bills back,” said another Sikh leader Darshan Singh Darar.The protest in Bay Area was organised by the Jakara Movement, a California-based grassroots organisation which seeks to strengthen community engagement and build empowerment by focusing on issues of civic engagement, education, health, and social justice.Organisers said the caravan protest taking place on Sunday in the Bay Area — along with similar recent protests in New York, Houston, Michigan, Chicago, and Washington, DC — was meant as a show of solidarity, as Sikhs around the world urge international condemnation of the farm bills.“Without farmers, there is no food. Without farming, there is no livelihood for the millions of people in Punjab who have relied on farming as a source of income for generations. These issues are deeply intertwined, and we will raise our voices to ensure that the families from Punjab who are putting their lives on the line to protest in Delhi can do so without facing threats from the Indian government,” said Naindeep Singh, executive director of the Jakara Movement.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting for the last eleven days at the borders of Delhi against three farm laws.Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.

06-12-2020||Geetanjali Gayatri||SYL canal non-issue as farmers of Punjab, Haryana join hands||Tribune News ServiceSonepat, December 5The Centre’s farm laws have their flip side despite the “good intention” rhetoric of the government. This is evident from the raging farmers’ protest. However, inadvertently, there is one good these have done and nobody seems to be talking of that — the laws have brought estranged brothers back together and they can’t seem to have enough of each other.After being engaged in a war of words for ever, they are making the most of the ongoing agitation to catch up with each other and reach out in the most loving ways. They are chopping vegetables together for langar all along the protest site, cooking side by side, they are eating together and they are resting under the same tents.They have many faces but speak in one voice — Punjab is the elder brother and Haryana, the younger.The bitterness between the states from the creation of the Haryana SGPC has been reduced to a non-issue as they are united in their fight against the government. The war over the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal is forgotten as the farmers from both sides sit together and break bread.“We have a lot of stock of water and there is no shortage. We are sharing all that we have. The only issue we are faced with is saving our farms and farming,” says Paramjit of Kurukshetra as he extends a helping hand to Jagdeep of Punjab in chopping vegetables while a few others start a fire.This one sentiment binds the farmers of both the states together. Though Punjab took the lead in raising its voice against the laws and went right ahead in demolishing barricades that limited them, Haryana’s farmers, seen as reluctant starters, are fast making up for the delay and even pitching in with the supply of essentials.While a lot of water has flown under the bridge since the SYL created bad blood and continues to remain unresolved, the farmers are wary of the subject. “We don’t want any divisions along water lines. We are brothers and we will sit and sort these out without any third party being allowed to play politics at our cost. We have family relations in both the states and those playing politics must understand that at heart, we are one,” says Gurinder Singh, a graduate from Patiala, sitting at the protest site alongside Gurpreet, a youngster from Ambala.Among the elders, Sukhpal Singh of Batala and Ram Phal of Sonepat are of the unanimous opinion that the SYL is only a political issue raked up to keep politics of the politicians going. “Why does it surface only around election time? We are not going to fall victim to such politics that wants to keep us apart. Let the government first deal with the issue on hand. There is plenty of water for both the brothers to share,” they maintain.Brothers in arms, the farmers of Punjab and Haryana, the many faces of brotherhood and camaraderie, are sure of finding their way out of these troubled waters together. “The long and short of everything is — united we stand, divided we fall. Everybody here realises that,” quips Kewal Singh of Majhi Kalan in Samrala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/syl-canal-non-issue-as-farmers-of-punjab-haryana-join-hands-180468

06-12-2020||TWO decades ago||A day spent with farm protesters on the outskirts of Delhi||The reporter and I set out in our quest to find cotton fields and the farmers who worked on them, and at the first instance that we needed to ask for directions, we stopped near a group of men.“Aithey kapah de khet kithe ne?” I asked in my fresh city-accented Punjabi. The men indicated that I should repeat my question and I did, with more emphasis and some misplaced confidence.“Hindi mein gal karo, behenji, sanu angrezi nai samjh aandi,” answered a young man. “Speak to us in Hindi,” he said, “we don’t understand English.”It took me a while to recover from the shock and begin to laugh at my obviously useless accent. This week when I travelled to the Singhu and Tikri borders of Delhi to witness the massive mobilisation of farmers in protest against the farm laws, I was tempted to practise my rusty Punjabi again, but I didn’t. I was proud enough to understand everything that was being said and translate for my colleagues.“The culture of resistance, of being ready to sacrifice oneself in the fight for justice goes back centuries in Punjab,” shared Sukhwinder Kaur from Bathinda as she explained the context for the farmers’ agitation. “The second thing is that Bharti Kisan Union and other organisations have been creating awareness in the villages consistently. People know the process for agitation. Who is our friend, who is not an ally — we are aware of this.”While we were recording an interview with her, a man interrupted to ask, “Are you national media?”“Yes,” I answered, assuming that he would take us seriously and step back. I realised quickly that it was the wrong answer. We learnt that many news teams have removed identifying logos from their mikes to escape the wrath of protesters after they have been vilified as “terrorists and Khalistanis” on various Hindi channels.On the Tikri border, we walked nearly 4 km to reach the spot where many of the leaders of various farmers’ unions were camping. On the way, we passed groups of farmers who were cooking dinner or had wound up and were putting away utensils. Many of them invited us to share the meal with them.“When did you learn to cook?” I asked one group.“The Modi government has taught us to make rotis also,” laughed one young man, raising his rolling pin in jest. “I’ve watched our mothers and grandmothers all my life. They will be proud of me.”One farmer was on a video call with his adolescent daughter in Faridkot and was showing her tractors and trolleys parked along the highway till the camera could see. “This is the protest site. Look at it. See these people from Delhi, they have come to talk to us,” he said, turning the phone towards us. I waved at a girl on the screen. She was already tucked into bed and smiled back at me. “Hello, aunty,” she said.Lachhman Singh Sewewala, who is a leader of farm labour and Dalits and part of the Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, unpacked the farmers’ demands in simple terms. “All Indians who want to live in a clean environment, breathe easily and in good health need to raise their voice against this black law.“When the government encourages contract farming by large companies, the question of what crop will be sown arises. Will the choice be dictated by the need of the people or according to what brings maximum profits to multinational companies? Corporatisation of agriculture will create food scarcity and the entire country will suffer the brunt of these laws,” he explained.My most inspirational meeting was with Harinder Kaur Bindu of BKU Ekta Ugrahan. The writer in me was trying to format the story simultaneously as I was listening to her on the history of the farmers’ struggles and their unionisation since 1984. “All farmers’ organisations are demanding the unconditional release of political prisoners,” she shared. “If intellectuals do not have the right to express their opinion safely, then all people will lose the ability to struggle and protest.”We made friends with Amolak Singh, who has been part of the street theatre and drama movement in Punjab since 1972. “We are performing many plays by Gursharan Singh as well as new scripts every day at the protest site and in the villages of Haryana around us. Come back and witness the cultural side of Punjab,” he said, handing us glasses of warm milk before we began our walk back to our car.We had had a long day, yet I returned with hope and energy. The farmers of Punjab may well be the spark that will ignite the inspiration we all need to see us out of the dark tunnel that the past few years have been.— The writer is an author and filmmaker natasha.badhwar@gmail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-day-spent-with-farm-protesters-on-the-outskirts-of-delhi-180518
06-12-2020||Jupinderjit Singh ---||Ties broken, Akalis moot national front against BJP||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, December 5  In the backdrop of farmers’ protest against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has set the ball rolling for forming a national front against the BJP by holding discussions with regional political parties.  It is aiming to contest the next Lok Sabha elections jointly with other parties. The SAD was one of the major regional parties in the NDA. SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal was among the founder members of the NDA. The party leadership feels that a political front against the NDA was the only way to check the “dictatorial decisions” taken by the Narendra Modi government. A delegation of the SAD led by ex-MP Prem Singh Chandumajra met West Bengal Chief Minister and All India Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee for forging a joint front.  Chandumajra told The Tribune that he had scheduled a meeting with Uddhav Thackeray, Chief Minister of Maharashtra and head of Shiv Sena, tomorrow. “A meeting with former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is also lined up early next week,” he said. Chandumajra said the response was encouraging. “The regional parties feel there is an urgent need for them to come together to save the federal structure of the country. Moreover, there is a complete absence of a strong opposition at the Centre due to which regional parties can come together and question the Central Government.” Chandumajra had met leaders of the Biju Janata Dal also a few days ago. “Things are moving in the right direction. We hope to issue a joint statement soon,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ties-broken-akalis-moot-national-front-against-bjp-180485

Are you saying that all those arms, ammunition and drones our security forces have captured along the Punjab border are no danger?” he asked Sukhbir.Earlier, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had said Capt Amarinder Singh had surrendered to the BJP on the farmers’ issue and “he is now resorting to brave and foul words merely to cover up his cowardice and panic”.The former Deputy CM had also “ridiculed” Capt Amarinder’s effort at pulling out the “cross-border card” and linking it with farmers’ movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-scared-of-ed-sukhbirs-charge-baseless-capt-180486

However, four goods trains are arriving in Amritsar district, but via a diverted route from Beas, Tarn Taran and Bhagtanwala to the railway station. Rajesh Aggarwal, Divisional Railway Manager, said: “More trains could not be plied on the diverted route as it has a single-line section where trains cannot be operated beyond 50 km per hour speed. So the Railways had to cancel the trains to decrease the load on the section.”  Besides, this section does not have an electricity line whereas all trains are being run with electric engine. Electric engines need to be replaced with diesel ones at the Beas railway station. The changeover of the engine consumes at least 45 minutes. Otherwise, the Amritsar-Delhi section is the busiest with dozens of trains being run over the route. In the absence of train connectivity, people are compelled to catch trains from Ambala and other railway stations. The industry in Ludhiana is facing shortage of raw material due to disrupted rail traffic. “Roads going to Delhi are also blocked and no train is running to Delhi from Ludhiana. Now, there is no other option left except the air route. Everyone cannot afford to travel by air,” said Badish Jindal, president of the Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association. “This has taken a toll on the manufacturing sector as raw material is unable to reach us. It has been a month since I ordered the raw material but it has not reached yet and production has been hit,” says a hosiery manufacturer from the city. In addition to Shatabdi, Bathinda-Varanasi Express Special, Amritsar-Ajmer Express and Dibrugarh-Amritsar Express Special remained suspended till today. Meanwhile, the Amritsar-New Jalpaiguri Karambhoomi Express, Amritsar-Korba Chhattisgarh Express and Amritsar-Jaynagar Humsafar Express remained short-terminated and short originated from Ambala Cantt till today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/trains-cancelled-industry-hit-hard-180487

Jagdish Dhanoa from Kotli Dewan village and Arshdeep Singh Robin Brar from Bhagsar village, along with some of their friends, have gone to support the farmers in tractor-trailers.  They have bought 10 waterproof tents along. Speaking on the phone, Arshdeep Singh Robin Brar said, “Many people are coming on two-wheelers. For their convenience, we have bought tents here. Two persons can stay in one tent. Not just youngsters, six elderly persons too are staying in our tents. At present, 20 persons are staying with us. We are thankful to our friends in Delhi and abroad for funding us.” He added, “We are planning to buy some more tents and slippers for some elderly farmers. We have plenty of everything here. The need of the hour is waterproof tents as the MeT Department has predicted rain in the coming days.” Meanwhile, Jagmel Singh, an elderly farmer from Amritsar district, said he had seen the young farmers not just offering accommodation, but also distributing handwritten charts with slogans like “we are farmers, not terrorists”. Meanwhile, the protesting farmers could be seen cleaning protest sites so that people living in the neighbourhood were not put to inconvenience. Young farmers from Muktsar district collected garbage from roadsides at the Tikri border. Gurpreet Singh, sarpanch, Khokhar village, said, “We have been appealing to the farmers to keep the sites clean.

On the issue of threat to national security, the CM had informed the Home Minister that being a border state, any restive movement in Punjab could be exploited by the agencies inimical to India. However, the state government, based on the ground reports, was confident that the protests were purely by the farmers and there was no involvement of any anti-India agencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-khalistan-sentiment-on-ground-punjab-police-180489

Swayed by the melody, elderly farmers express gratitude with money, but she just smiles and tells them “I am one among you, your comrade, your daughter.”For the past nine days, Jagdeep Kaur, popularly known as Nikki, along with 11 other women cultural activists, is camping in a trolly parked on the National Highway-1. The highway seems to have become just another bylane where these revolutionary artistes continuously move to and fro giving voice to words of rebel poets like Pash, Sant Ram Udasi and Minderpal Bhattal till midnight.A cultural troop built by Students for Society comprising mainly girls, which earlier was instrumental in changing the scene of student politics at Panjab University with their songs, is now performing at Kundli border and keeping farmers’ morale high with revolutionary ballads.“Delhi is now Punjab’s capital,” Nikki laughs. The PhD scholar in music at Panjab University had been at the forefront of every struggle in Chandigarh. She, along with other ‘comrades’, reached Kundli on November 27. Since then, a trolly with paddy stubble is their bed. Neetu, another BKU (Krantikari) activist from Hisar, says, “First night, we found it difficult to adjust in a small trolly. Later, they moved us to a bigger one.” This epicentre of struggle doesn’t have many women like the other centre, Tikri, where women number in thousands. Nikki says they don’t have any problem here. Pointing towards a nearby petrol pump, she says: “We can use those washrooms. And for bathing, we go to a friend’s house a few kilometres away.” “It is a historic struggle. So it’s worth taking all these troubles,” she says.
