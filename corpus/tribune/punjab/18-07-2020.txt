18-07-2020||---||Kidnapped Sikh leader Nidan Singh released in Afghanistan||New Delhi, July 18 India has thanked the Afghan government for the safe return of kidnapped Sikh Nidan Singh Sachdeva and has decided to facilitate the return of Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members facing security threats in Afghanistan to India, said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in a statement.There are about 1,000 Sikh and Hindus left in Afghanistan and the sense of insecurity was heightened after their massacre in Gurdwara Guru Har Rai in Kabul in May this year. At that time too, India had offered all possible assistance to the affected families of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan.Nidan Singh, a leader of the Hindu and Sikh Community of Afghanistan, was kidnapped in Chamkani district of Paktia province on June 22. The MEA said in a statement, “We convey our appreciation to the Government of Afghanistan and tribal elders from the area, whose efforts secured the return of Nidan Singh. The targeting and persecution of minority community members by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters remains a matter of grave concern.”Nidan Singh was an Afghan who had moved to India for some years after the Taliban gained ascendancy in the early 90s. Working at odd jobs in India, it is not clear how and by whom Nidan Singh was asked to return and man Gurdwara Tala Sahib in Afghanistan’s Paktia Province near the border with Pakistan. The wider region called “Loya Paktia” has been a Mujahideen and then Taliban\Haqqani Group stronghold since the early 1980s.Sources said he was the only person responsible for the upkeep of the Gurdwara where Guru Nanak was reported to have visited.India and other countries are worried over the narrowing of space for Sikh and Hindu minorities ever since US-Taliban talks got into high gear and India excluded itself from establishing contacts with the insurgent group. India has condemned Nidan Singh’s abduction and the government is hoping the Afghan government will be able to secure safe and early release of Nidan Singh.Soon after the May 15 massacre at the Kabul Gurdwara, former US Vice President Joe Biden had promised to raise the annual global refugee admissions cap to 1.25 lakh if he won the November US Presidential elections. Implicit was the assurance that some of the quota would be for Afghanistan’s embattled Sikh community.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kidnapped-sikh-leader-nidan-singh-released-in-afghanistan-114758

Since music has direct impact on our minds, singer should be cautious while using words,” she said.Sidhu Moosewala has allegedly been facing allegations of firing from an AK-47 rifle in Badbar shooting range and in his latest song “Sanju” he has compared his case to another registered against Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt.In his latest song, Moosewala croons: “Jatt Utte case Jehda Sanjay Dutt Te, Case Koos Pende Mardaan Te Sohniye, Tension Na Liya Kar (Jat faces the case as Sanjay Dutt faced; men face cases, do not be tense, girl).”Earlier last month, in his song “Bambiha Bole”, released with Amrit Mann, both the singers had claimed that “SHO, SSP and DC are their friends”. RTI activist Kuldeep Singh Khaira, who along with Parvinder Kitna, has filed a petition in Punjab and Haryana High Court, alleged that police officers were working as security guards of Moosewala rather than taking action against him.“In our petition, we have requested HC to direct police of both districts to make us complainants as we were the first one to lodge complaints, but police did not make us complainants, allegedly to help Moosewala. Apart from it, we have sought the investigations of both cases by ADGP-rank officers or CBI as Moosewala is releasing songs glorifying weapons despite the fact that he is still wanted in AK-47 case and has not got bail,” said Khaira.On May 4, after a video showing the singer shooting at a firing range in Badbar of Barnala district went viral on the social media, the Dhanauala police, on the directions of Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta, had registered a case under Sections 188 of the IPC and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act against Moosewala and eight others.They included Assistant Sub inspector (ASI) Balkar Singh, Head Constables Gagandeep Singh and Gurjinder Singh, Constables Jasvir Singh, Harwinder Singh and three others, Karam Singh Lehal, Inder Singh Grewal and Jang Sher Singh.Within 24 hours, another FIR was registered against all under the same sections at Dhuri Sadar police station on May 5 after another video showing Moosewala firing from his private pistol at Laddai Kothi shooting range surfaced.“We are conducting raids to arrest Moosewala in AK-47 case registered at Dhanaula police station as he has not got bail in this case,” said Barnala SP Sukhdev Virk. On May 17, police had added Sections 25 and 30 of the Arms Act, 1959, to both FIRs registered against Moosewala and others. All cops were suspended after the registration of FIR and since the addition of Arms Act. In the Sangrur case, all nine accused have got bail while in the Barnala case, Moosewala has not applied for bail.When contacted, Sangrur SSP Sandeep Garg said there had been no delay. “We are waiting for forensic lab reports about the weapon used by Moosewala and the authenticity of the video,” said the SSP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/avneet-sidhu-calls-out-moosewala-for-blatant-glorification-of-weapons-in-his-latest-song-114731

He has been awarded for his religious project — Nirmal Kutiya Gurdwara — under the ‘Realised Interior Design’ projects category and is the first architect from the state to win the title.Giving a tour of his masterpiece to this correspondent, which is based at Arjun Nagar on Ladowali Road here, Udayveer pointed out the contemporary elements of his architecture such as use of cantilever slabs, linear block with travertine stone cladding and a large glass at the exterior facade.About World Architecture Community AwardsThe World Architecture Community Awards (WA Awards) recognise remarkable projects that have the potential to inspire exciting questions about contemporary architectural discourse. The 34th cycle of this award was held online and Jalandhar’s Udayveer Singh has bagged the award under the ‘Realised Interior Design’ projects category.“When I started working on the design of this project in 2015, I had in mind that I want to design something that will be remembered for ages to come. I want that after a centenary, when visitors shall pay homage to this sacred place, the contemporary nature of the building and palatial interior design should take them down the memory lane of the 21st-century architecture of a gurdwara,” he said.He said it took him nearly three years to turn his vision into reality and the estimated cost of the project was about Rs 1 crore. In March 2018, the gurdwara was opened to the public, he added. Architecture and interiorof GurdwaraDivulging details about what makes his architectural design stand out, Thakur said the gurdwara has a skeleton dome that depicts its presence from a distance. “There is a splendid fountain erected outside the main entrance directly aligned with the dome above. A water source is present on both the ends of the structure to witness its reflection. Also, a unique element in the building is that one can see the refraction of a floating Nishan Sahib (sacred symbol at the top of a flagpole) with onyx light at the bottom.”He further said the interior of the building was beautifully canvassed with chandeliers, blind pointed arches at the rear wall, floral-patterned carpet floors and shades of beige on the embellishments. “There is also an opulent use of the diffused sunlight from the east direction that adds spiritual ambience to the interiors of the building,” he added.Udayveer said, “I was, since my childhood, fond of sketching. When I was in Class VI or VII, my father hired an architect from Delhi for the construction of our house. I showed my sketches to him and he advised me to make a career in the field. I decided to be an architect in future.”“I have completed my studies in architecture in 2010, from Guru Nanak Dev University. In 2013, I started my own firm. I have recently also won the ‘Most Innovative Young Architect of Punjab’ award,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/designing-gurdwara-wins-him-international-accolades-114632

18-07-2020||Bathinda||Eye ailments among kids up, excess screen time to blame||There is a surge in the number of students and teachers visiting eye specialists for the past couple of months due to the conduct of online classes by educational institutes.Editorial: Capping kids’ screen timeThe lockdown from March forced schools to shift to online classes to ensure that the syllabus was completed, but now, the excessive use of different mobile and computer applications for these classes is throwing up a new range of issues. This is a cause of worry for many parents because children spend extra hours on phones and laptops.‘Eat fruit, veggies’Giving rest to eyes at equal intervals, eating fresh fruit and vegetables and regular check-up are some of the dietary habits that must be adopted by children, said Dr Vitul K Gupta, a health expert. Doctors are also advising that children below three years should not attend any online classes.Bathinda-based eye specialist and surgeon Dr HS Sodhi said, “Cases are definitely rising and some are even detected with computer vision syndrome. Last week alone, I have seen around five to 10 cases of children and teachers with issues of blurring of vision, dry eyes and headache. Most of the time, we find children keeping the gadgets close to their eyes. This is harmful for eye muscles. When they put excessive effort, it causes blurring of vision.”City doctors said they were getting queries from parents on how to keep eyes of their children safe. Gurleen Kaur, mother of a Class V student, said, “I have to give my child a phone for the first half of the day for studies. He doesn’t have any option as online classes are going on and if we do not do so, he will miss his studies.”Dr Vitul K Gupta, a health expert, said, “Eye strain is among the most common problems. Some of its symptoms include irritation, excessive blinking, frequent rubbing of eyes, dry eyes, headache from eye strain and even tiredness. Parents must be extremely careful on how the child spends time online.”He said parents could encourage healthy lifestyle habits among their children which in turn would benefit their eyes too. Giving rest to eyes at equal intervals, eating fresh fruit and vegetables and regular check-up are some of the good dietary habits.Doctors are also advising that children below three years should not attend any online class and those between four and six years should have only 90 minutes of online teaching with a break in between.Children between seven and 12 should have up to four hours of lessons with two or three breaks while those up to the age of 16 should have up to eight hours of lessons, if required, but with several breaks and a long lunch break.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/eye-ailments-among-kids-up-excess-screen-time-to-blame-114372

The site had been closed for the public since February 15 and the restoration would get over by July-end.“Jallianwala Bagh is among the most-visited monuments, but it was lying neglected and lacked basic amenities. I repeatedly raised the issue in Parliament and apprised PM Narendra Modi about the dilapidated condition. The Centre granted a package to renovate it,” he said.In November 2018, the then Union Minister of Culture Dr Mahesh Sharma was left fuming after he saw the poor upkeep and directed officials concerned to prepare a blueprint for its makeover.Malik had immediately issued a sum of Rs 10 lakh from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme. The package was announced by the Centre as a part of commemorating the 100th year of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Restoration work and allied services worth Rs 19.36 crore are being done under the Ministry of Culture.In the first phase, the developmental works include a five-minute light and sound show in Hindi, Punjabi and English for visitors. The entry and exit points have been repositioned, walk-in through a narrow passage has sculptures on both sides of the wall and the landscape comprises a ‘white lilies pond’. Now, a glass wall panel surrounds the Martyrs’ Well and passage from the entrance to the well is also being redesigned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jallianwala-bagh-revamp-nears-completion-114416
18-07-2020||Chandigarh||Power demand dips, Punjab makes profit||There is no increase in the overall power demand in the state as compared to the last year’s figure, courtesy a dip in demand by industrial and commercial consumers due to the Covid-19 lockdown.Small gainsOn Thursday, the state bought 26.72 lakh units at Rs2.47 per KWh, while it sold 6.75 lakh units at Rs 4.05 KWhWith no power cuts imposed in the state as of now, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has started buying power on the power exchange at rates much lower than the cost of power generation at its own thermal and hydel plants. Also, the state is selling power generated on its own at the exchange. Yesterday, the state bought 26.72 lakh units on the power exchange for Rs 2.47 per KWh, while it sold 6.75 lakh units at Rs 4.05 KWh. This helped in making a small profit, even as the state power utility continues to be in losses because of less than anticipated demand.A Venu Prasad, Chairman-cum-Managing Director, PSPCL, told The Tribune that the overall demand for power had seen a fall of about 1,000 MW per day mainly because there had been a fall in demand from industrial and commercial consumers.“This year, there will be no overall growth in demand… it can see a fall of up to 5 per cent,” he said, adding that power consumption in the domestic sector had increased by 8 per cent and in the agriculture sector by 5 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/power-demand-dips-punjab-makes-profit-114417
