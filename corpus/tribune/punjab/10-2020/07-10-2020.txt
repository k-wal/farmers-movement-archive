07-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers give Amarinder government week’s time to reject agriculture laws in Assembly||Farmers in Punjab will continue and intensify their agitation in the next seven days, even as they have rejected the offer made by the Centre to initiate a dialogue and resolve the issue.Thirty farmer unions that held a meeting on Wednesday warned Capt Amarinder Singh’s government in Punjab that they would hold protests outside the houses of state Congress leaders unless the government calls a special Assembly to repeal the agriculture Laws passed by the Centre. The unions have given the state government until October 15.  Bhartiya Kisan Union, Lakhowal, has been barred by other unions from participating in the joint protest after they approached the Supreme Court of India against the contenting Agriculture Laws, without taking others into confidence. It was decided that the Lakhowal faction would be brought under the joint fold only after they formally withdraw the case from the Apex Court.Buta Singh Burjgill, president of BKU ( Dakaunda) said that they would continue with their ongoing agitation, as the Centre seemed in no mood to withdraw the laws, that threatened the entire agrarian economy of Punjab.“The invitation by Secretary Agriculture Sanjay Agarwal is clearly not to initiate a dialogue, but has been sent merely to “explain to the agitating farmers” how the laws were beneficial. Until the government initiates dialogue on revocation  of the Laws, we will not stop our agitation,” he declared.Talking to The Tribune, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), said that the farmers had no choice but to continue the Rail Roko campaign and protest outside houses of BJP leaders. He denied that stopping the trains would delay the arrival of much needed urea for the next crop, or the transfer of foodgrains from Punjab to recipient states. “These are things being spread by the government to brow beat farmers. If fertilizers could reach here in the lockdown, these can reach here now as well,” he said.All Union leaders also condemned the brutal lathi charge on protesting farmers in Haryana on Tuesday, and announced their unconditional support to them.“We will go in for a two hour complete Bandh in Punjab on October 9, between 4-6 pm, in solidarity with the Haryana farmers,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, President of BKU Rajewal.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh however refused to heed to the ultimatum. A press release issued in the evening quoted him as saying he would do what was necessary to protect farmers but using ultimatums to “force” the government’s hand was inappropriate.The chief minister has already agreed to calling a special session of the assembly to bring amendments to the three controversial laws.“My sole interest lies in protecting the state’s farmers and the farm sector at all costs, and not in appeasing farmer organisations,” the press release quoted him as having said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-give-amarinder-government-weeks-time-to-reject-agriculture-laws-in-assembly-152328

During this span, the SGPC executive members would continue to sweep the street for one hour for the days when Akhand Path will be in continuation.On September 18, Giani Harpreet Singh had publicly punished SGPC president and executive members from the Akal Takht’s podium for failing to check the misappropriation of 328 saroops that went missing from the records.The SGPC executive was also directed not to host or participate any religious programme for one month.  Besides this, the 2016 executive members were also barred from holding any position. Rajinder Singh Mehta had resigned from the post of SGPC senior vice-president in compliance with the Akal Takht directions soon after the hearing concluded. He also accompanied the executive members in cleaning up the street today.Longowal said that though the existing SGPC executive was never summoned at the Akal Takht, yet taking it as a moral responsibility they all decided to appear for atonement voluntarily.“Though, avoiding to hold the ‘pashchatap path’ was lapse on the part of 2016 executive, yet we accepted it as our liability too. Binding by the Akal Takht directives, we have started to undergo religious punishment. About the misappropriation of 328 saroops, we took the departmental action instantly on those officials and staffers who were named in the Akal Takht appointed probe panel report. Those found guilty were dismissed or suspended with immediate effect during executive meeting on August 25.  This report was also made public and available on SGPC’s website for anyone to have access over the investigation,” he said.It is the second time when Longowal was sentenced religiously by the Akal Takht. Earlier, he faced punishment in 2017 after he was accused of seeking votes from Dera Sacha Sauda during Assembly elections in violation of the Akal Takht edict.Former assistant supervisor of publication department Kanwaljit Singh had alleged that SGPC had tried to cover up the 2016 fire incident by not disclosing the actual number of saroops that got burnt fearing political backlash.Ironically, putting the SGPC in soup, an office note dated February 20, 2020 surfaced that speak about 80 saroops getting damaged in 2016 short circuiting incident.  This note was prepared by Kanwaljit Singh, and endorsed by the higher officials to put on records.On the other hand, the SGPC had claimed that only 14 saroops were damaged then, five directly whereas nine were destroyed with water showers during dousing the flames.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-president-led-executive-sweeps-street-leading-to-golden-temple-as-atonement-to-saroops-getting-destroyed-in-2016-fire-incident-152293

07-10-2020||Patiala||Will convene special Vidhan Sabha session to counter farm laws: Punjab CM||Backing a special Vidhan Sabha session against the three controversial farm Acts, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today rejected the suggestion that the Union Government was able to take unilateral decisions because of a “weak Opposition”.‘Indebted to state’Asked why Punjabis should trust him, Rahul recalled a childhood memory of how a handful of Sikhs had protected the family when his grandmother Indira Gandhi lost the parliamentary election in 1977. “There was nobody in the house except these Sikhs who protected my grandmother,” he recalled. “I owe a debt to people of Punjab,” he said.Following a query pertaining to convening a special session to protect farmers at a media interaction, Rahul asked Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, sitting alongside him, to answer the question. “We will not only call a special session to prevent these Acts from being implemented in Punjab, but also take legal recourse to ensure that our farmers are saved,” said Captain Amarinder.Takes swipe at ModiThe Congress leader slammed PM Narendra Modi for “wasting” thousands of crores of rupees on a plane just because “his friend Donald Trump has one”. He said it was strange that nobody was questioning the purchase of a VVIP Boeing 777-300 ER, but everyone was quick to point to the cushioned “gaddi” that some well-wisher had put on a tractor for him.Rahul said farmers’ interest was always supreme and even the party mainfesto supported setting up of grain markets. Later, after an hour-long standoff between Congress workers and the Haryana Police, the three-day Congress “Kheti Bachao Yatra” culminated in the state today.The Haryana Police refused to allow hundreds of tractors and supporters into the state, citing law and order situation. This led to a heated argument between party leaders and police. Rahul and others were later allowed into Haryana.Earlier at a rally at Francewala village near Sanaur, Rahul lashed out at the BJP-led government over its “anti-people” policies. “The poor have become poorer and the rich are getting richer while the Prime Minister is serving the interests of corporate houses at the cost of small businessmen, farmers, arhtiyas and farm labourers,” he said.“The farmers will die rather than bow to the unjust and barbaric laws,” said Rahul, adding the mandi and procurement system, which the new farm laws would destroy, was the protective shield for the farming community. “Do you need such a system where shopping malls are constructed while farmers die of starvation?” he said, adding that he would never allow this to happen.Castigating the BJP government, Captain Amarinder said farmers in the country had risen against the Modi regime. The Centre, he said, was hell-bent on finishing the farmers and farm labourers.“If the farmers are really happy with these laws, as the Centre claims, then why are they out on the streets?” said the CM, asserting Punjab’s war against these laws would continue until these were rolled back.Pledging to stand with peasants, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur said the CM had not left any stone unturned in the fight for the rights of the farmers. PPCCpresident Sunil Jakhar said the day the destiny of the farmers went into the hands of corporate giants, the PDS and mandi system would be finished.Prominent among those present were Cabinet ministers Vijay Inder Singla, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Brahm Mohindra, Manish Tewari, Jasbir Singh Dimpa, Chaudhary Santokh Singh, Gurjit Singh Aujala and Partap Singh Bajwa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-convene-special-vidhan-sabha-session-to-counter-farm-laws-punjab-cm-152003

A complaint had been filed with the authorities in this regard, but no action was taken against Surinder Singh as villagers claimed he was well-connected.Damandeep Singh, XEN, Drainage Department, confirmed that Surinder had dug up the riverbed illegally. He said Surinder was granted permission to clear wild growth in the river so that there was no obstruction in the flow of water adjoining his fields. However, Surinder Singh denied the allegations, claiming he had only cleared the obstructions in the river course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ropar-villagers-protest-as-farmer-digs-up-riverbed-152013

07-10-2020||Chandigarh||High Court rejects plea for preference to Covid warriors||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear it has full sympathy with Covid warriors, but directions could not be issued to the government to give preference, reservation or additional marks to doctors working in the Covid care centres. It amounted to asking the court to “propel in unchartered ocean of government policy making”.Legislature sole repository of powerDr Parampreet Kaur and two other doctors had moved the High Court for directing the State of Punjab and other respondents to give additional marks or the benefit to doctors working in Covid care centres while appointing medical officers (general) pursuant to an advertisement/recruitment notice.Justice Anil Kshetarpal observed the petitioners’ precise grievance was they were Covid warriors and had stood by the government in difficult time when most of the medical staff either resigned or refused to carry out duties in the centres. As such, they should be given preference/reservation/additional marks while carrying out the recruitment.Justice Kshetarpal also took note of the contentions that several state governments, private universities and institutions had taken a decision to grant either reservation or preference to Covid warriors and the doctors could be included under the classification “war heroes” defined in the Punjab Civil Service (General and Common Conditions of Service) Rules.Justice Kshetarpal added the aspect of policy making had been dealt with in a recent Supreme Court judgment in “Federation Haj PTOs of India versus the Union of India”.The judgment, among other things, said the legislature and its delegate were the sole repositories of power to decide what policy should be pursued. There was no scope for interference by the court, unless the particular provision impugned before it could be said to suffer from legal infirmity.Disposing of the petition, Justice Kshetarpal asserted: “This court finds that it would not be appropriate under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue a writ petition as prayed for by the petitioners. However, it is left open to the petitioners to make a representation to the government in this regard which shall be considered sympathetically.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-rejects-plea-for-preference-to-covid-warriors-152015

07-10-2020||Chandigarh||High Court to examine if CBI can probe sacrilege cases||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has decided to examine whether non-issuance of a notification by the Centre for withdrawing investigation from the CBI in sacrilege cases would have any effect after the withdrawal of consent by the Punjab Government for CBI probe has been approved by a coordinate Bench.Justice Amol Rattan Singh observed the consent for investigation by the CBI was no longer in existence as far as the Punjab Government was concerned. Another question required to be considered by the court was whether the Special CBI court in such circumstances would still have the jurisdiction to continue to consider the matter on a report submitted by the premier investigating agency.The matter will come up for further hearing on Wednesday when arguments on the issue will be addressed on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure.Justice Rajan Gupta of the HC on January 25, 2019, had upheld Vidhan Sabha resolution to withdraw consent for probe by the CBI. The Supreme Court had, subsequently, turned down the CBI’s plea challenging the withdrawal of sacrilege cases probe from it on technical ground of delay in approaching it. As of now a “parallel probe” is being carried out by the CBI and special investigation team. The matter was brought to the HC’s notice with the filing of two petitions by Shakti Singh, Sukhjinder Singh and another petitioner. The Bench was told by CBI counsel Sumeet Goel that a review application had been filed by the agency before the Supreme Court regarding the dismissal of the SLP.Appearing before the Bench on the complainant’s behalf, advocate GPS Bal submitted that the application was filed in the Supreme Court in March, but request for early hearing had not been made.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-to-examine-if-cbi-can-probe-sacrilege-cases-152017
