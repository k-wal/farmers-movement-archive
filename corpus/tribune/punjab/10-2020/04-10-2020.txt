The committee has ten other members.The core committee emphasised the need to safeguard “peace and communal harmony in the state as top priority”. The party however strongly condemned efforts by the state Congress leaders and others to vilify the farmers’ campaign as “hooliganism”.In another resolution, the core committee demanded the immediate sacking of Punjab minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot for “perpetrating an unprecedented scam of embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds belonging to the students from the Schedule Castes”. The core committee strongly condemned the shocking tragedy at Hathras and described it as an “outrage against humanity and disgrace to the spirit of our nation”.The guilty must be given exemplary punishment at the earliest.Meanwhile, the SAD core committee also strongly condemned the step motherly treatment meted out to the Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir, which had once formed a part of the Khalsa Raj.“The cultural, literary and lingual bonds between Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir have strong and unshakeable foundations and the decision of the government to leave Punjabi out of the official languages list is a gross injustice to the “sacred language.”SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has formed a special committee to fight for getting official language status to the Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir and for the promotion of Punjabi language, literature and culture in J and K as well as in other parts of the country with sizeable Punjabi population.The committee has Nirmal Singh Kahlon, Prof Prem Singh Chandumajra and Majinder Singh Sirsa as members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-demands-meeting-of-stakeholders-to-resolve-crisis-arising-out-of-farm-bills-151021

04-10-2020||---||SAD says farmers will not forgive Rahul for striking deal to sell off their interests||Chandigarh, October 4The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday said the farmers of Punjab would never forgive ex-president of Congress party Rahul Gandhi for striking a deal to sell off the interests of farmers by facilitating the passage of the Agri Acts and asked him to stop cheap ‘tamashas’ and direct his party’s government in Punjab to fulfil the promises made to the ‘annadaata’.Terming Rahul’s visit to Punjab as an exercise in political drama, senior SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra said, “Rahul Gandhi did not only run away from the country when the Agri Bills were to be tabled in parliament in the most cowardly manner but also facilitated their passage by refusing to issue a whip to party MPs to vote against them and even preventing senior leaders from speaking against the Bills in parliament. But for your cowardice the Bills could have been stopped, but you chose to help the BJP government rather than standing with the farmers of the country.”Stating that Rahul had now been brought to Punjab to stage a sham protest after the Congress party realized that the farmers would now turn against it, Chandumajra asked the Congress leader why he had refused to answer even one of the five questions posed to him by party President Sukhbir Singh Badal.He said even the Youth Akali Dal (YAD) had put up these posers across the state to ensure Rahul could read them loud and clear during his sham ‘yatra’.Also questioning the timing of the visit today, the SAD leader said it was strange that Rahul Gandhi had remembered Punjab and its farmers after a spate of years only because his party was in doldrums with only a little over a year left before the polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-says-farmers-will-not-forgive-rahul-for-striking-deal-to-sell-off-their-interests-151017

These laws are for the benefit of farmers, but they are spreading the falsehood that MSP, mandis and government procurement will end.”      “The prime minister and other senior leaders of our party have already given an assurance that all these will continue and farmers need not worry,” Sharma told reporters.“Shouldn’t the farmers not have the freedom to sell their produce anywhere and at a better price?” he questioned.Attacking the ruling Congress in Punjab, he said they are misusing farmers on the issue.“Captain Amarinder Singh government is misusing official machinery to misguide the farmers and spread falsehood. Amarinder Singh government wants to hide its failures which is why they are using the shoulder of farmers for this,” he alleged.BJP leader Dinesh Singh Babbu said the Congress has failed on all fronts.“They are raking up the issue to cover their failures. We are touring villages and we are approaching farmers to apprise them about the benefits of these laws,” he said, adding that farmers from across Pathankot had reached with their tractors for the rally.  Meanwhile, some youths protested with black flags, saying the BJP government at the Centre “wants to destroy farmers”.“Rather than taking out a tractor rally here, the BJP leaders from the state should put pressure on their government to take back these anti-farmer laws,” a protester said.Farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big companies.President Ram Nath Kovind has given assent to the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, which were passed by Parliament last month. ---- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-bjp-takes-out-tractor-rally-in-pathankot-says-farm-bills-will-benefit-farmers-151009

He has been very closely associated with Pak-based Babbar Khalsa International chief Wadhawa Singh Babbar and stayed with him in Pakistan for over 14 years,” he added.Gupta said a case under various provisions of the IPC, the Arms Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act had been registered at Police Station Mahalpur in Hoshiarpur district against the accused.He said Makhan had been engaging in various terror and other criminal activities in the past. As many as seven cases had been earlier registered against him. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-busts-khalistan-zindabad-force-terror-module-2-arrested-150959
04-10-2020||Moga (Pb)||Navjot Sidhu attends Rahul Gandhi-led tractor rally in Punjab's Moga||Punjab MLA and former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday attended a tractor rally led by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi here to protest against the Centre's new farm laws.Gandhi arrived here for holding tractor rallies across Punjab from October 4 till 6.The rallies, which have been named 'Kheti Bachao Yatra', would cover more than 50 km, spread over three days in various districts and constituencies.Sidhu's participation in the rally came three days after All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat met him at his residence in Amritsar.After the meeting, Rawat had said that the cricketer-turned-politician would attend tractor rallies.Addressing a public gathering here, Sidhu slammed the BJP-led Centre over the farm laws and dubbed them as an "attack on federal structure" and alleged the central government was being run by "capitalists"."They are robbing our rights," he said, adding that the Centre had imposed a "system" which had failed in Europe and the US.He said these new legislations would adversely affect five lakh labourers and 30,000 ''arthiyas'' (commission agents).Sidhu said that the Punjab government should give minimum support price (MSP) on pulses and oilseeds and set up infrastructure for storage of crops.Sidhu, who had been at loggerheads with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, had stayed away from all Congress activities ever since he resigned as cabinet minister last year.However, Sidhu last month had staged a protest against the farm bills in Amritsar but without Congress' flags. He had described the farm bills as an "attack on the federal structure" and had also said these "black laws" would "ruin" the farming community.Sidhu, MLA from Amritsar East seat, was stripped off key portfolios in the cabinet reshuffle in June last year.The chief minister had divested Sidhu of the Local Government and Tourism and Cultural Affairs Departments and allotted him the power and new and renewable energy portfolio.However, Sidhu had refused to assume the charge and resigned.The tension between the Punjab chief minister and Sidhu had come out in the open in May last year when Singh had blamed Sidhu for the "inept handling" of the Local Government Department, claiming that it had resulted in "poor performance" of the Congress in urban areas in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Singh had taken umbrage at Sidhu's "friendly match" jibe during electioneering in Bathinda on May 17.Sidhu had allegedly cornered the Congress government in the state over the issue of the desecration of religious texts, questioning why no FIR was lodged against the Badals, who ran the previous government in the state.

04-10-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Kheti Bachao Yatra: PM Modi 'puppet' in hands of Ambani and Adani, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and claimed that he was a "puppet of Ambani and Adani" at the 'Kheti Bachao Yatra' in Badhni Kalan in Punjab's Moga district.Gandhi said India was not ruled by Modi as the government was being run by "Ambani and Adani".Gandhi said that Modi was aided by the billionaires through the media, who give him 24-hour coverage. "It's a very simple relationship, Narendra Modiji gives them land, in turn they give him full support through the media," he said. Addressing farmers, Gandhi said: "India's billionaires want your land and your money."Gandhi hit out at the Centre on Sunday over the three new agriculture laws, asking why were the farmers agitating if these were meant for them.Gandhi asserted that the contentious Acts would be revoked if the Congress was voted to power. He wondered what was the "hurry" and need to implement these legislations amid the coronavirus pandemic."The prime minister says the laws are being framed for farmers. If the laws are being made for farmers, then why didn't you debate in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha?" Gandhi asked."And if farmers are happy with these laws, then why are they agitating across the country? Why is every farmer of Punjab agitating?"Farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm reforms would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big companies.He also said that the Prime Minister had been lying since the past six years.Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh labelled the Union government's approach to agriculture as "Kisan maaru, Punjab maaru (one that would kill farmers and Punjab)"."India used to borrow from across the world to feed its people till the time Punjabi farmers took the charge of feeding them," he added.Singh said that the people of Punjab have initiated a "war" against the union government to protect the rights of the farmers. "Punjabis comprise just 2 per cent of the population but they feed 50 per cent of the country. I don't know why the NDA government has brought these new legislations, which were not in the interest of farmers,"he added.Singh said he feared that the MSP will be taken back by the Union government in the coming years and farmers needed to unite for the common cause.He lashed out at the Akali Dal, claiming that former union minister Harsimrat Badal gave her nod to the controversial Bills in a Cabinet meeting."The people should not rely upon the Akali leadership. They were were now shedding crocodile tears," he added.Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu termed the contentious agriculture laws as an attack on India's federal structure and diversity."Punjab needed Green Revolution...India needed Green revolution. Punjab's farmers provided grains to the entire country. By giving Punjab less MSP, 80,000 crore people were fed. But today the government is trying to kill the farmer and his income," he said.The leaders were speaking at Congress' 'Kheti Bachao Yatra' on Sunday to protest against the contentious farm laws.Highlights: मोदी सरकार के काले-कानूनों के खिलाफ पंजाब से उठी आवाज अब पूरे देश का नेतृत्व करेगी। पंजाब देश को राह दिखायेगा। श्री राहुल गांधी जी की रैली में किसानों का अपार जनसमूह बता रहा है कि किसान के हर अधिकार की रक्षा करने के लिए पंजाब और कांग्रेस तैयार हैं।#KhetiBachaoYatra pic.twitter.com/3b8g7DzAMDAmbani and Adani will come with an army of lawyers. How will they negotiate with a farmer who has a 2-acre farm?: SidhuThis country is being run by capitalists. When you bail out farmers its called subsidies, when you give money to corporates, its called its called incentives: SidhuCongress leader Rahul Gandhi will hold tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana from October 4-6. Earlier, Gandhi was scheduled to hold tractor rallies from October 3-5, the party said. However, the rest of his itinerary will remain the same.“Change in @Rahul Gandhi tractor rallies programme; rescheduled to October 4, 5, 6. Rest (itinerary) remains the same,” Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s media advisor, Raveen Thukral, tweeted.Singh, state Congress president Sunil Jakhar, Congress' Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat, and all state ministers and party MLAs will join the protests, “to give voice to the angst and pain of the farmers, whose livelihood and future has been put at stake by the central legislations”.A spokesperson of Punjab Congress had said on Thursday that the tractor rallies were expected to be supported by farmers’ organisations and will cover more than 50 km over three days.The rallies will be conducted amid strict COVID-19 protocols, the spokesperson had said.Gandhi is likely to address rallies at Kaithal and Pipli in Kurukshetra district of Haryana on October 6 instead of October 5, following which he will return to Delhi.Farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big companies.Parliament had last week passed the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020; the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kheti-bachao-yatra-pm-modi-puppet-in-hands-of-ambani-and-adani-says-rahul-gandhi-150921

The chapters are filled with torrid experiences that majority of the new entrants faced while performing menial jobs and living in makeshift shelters.The earlier two books by Kahlon were ‘Sikhs in Latin America: Travels among Sikh Diaspora’ and ‘Sikhs in Asia Pacific: Travels among Sikh Diaspora from Yangon to Kobe’. He has attempted portraying the life of Sikh settlers in countries where their presence was lesser known unlike USA, Canada and England.He has visited as many as 80 countries on 24 passports for his books.Kahlon’s travelogue is based on oral accounts, documents and newspaper clippings. The valuable part is the first-person narrative by Sikh migrants. Also featured are peculiar tales of unscrupulous agents, police arrests, deportation and police raids.The book also has success stories like that of Dr Avtar (Billa) Singh Seth, who started as a barman in Austria in 1955. Choosing to pursue his studies in medical science, he was honoured by the President after his retirement in 2004. Rachpal Singh Kalsi, who came to Europe on a shoe-string budget in 1970, was conferred the Knighthood of Danneborg by the Queen of Denmark in 2006. We also have stories of certain strugglers who failed to find a home.Gurdwaras are the biggest anchors for the Sikh population as well as the newcomers.

Also, photographers themselves need to be good swimmers and have water-proof gadgets. I used Iphone for the shoot. The couple had to be given training on how to move in water, how to keep eyes open and give poses. It also consumes a lot of time.Recently, a Jalandhar-based couple chose to pose themselves inside a swimming pool. Freelance model Abhishek Gotra and his wife Neha, who works with a tourism company, got their photo shoot done in a swimming pool last week. “It involved a lot of effort but the results came out so well. Ever since I have posted these pictures on my social media pages, I have been getting a lot of inquiries from couples set to get married in due course of time,” said Charanjit Lagah, a wedding photographer.Says Lagah, “The concept was not earlier popular in Jalandhar as either the groom or the bride would say they were not comfortable with it. Also, photographers themselves need to be good swimmers and have water-proof gadgets. I used Iphone for the shoot. The couple had to be given training on how to move in water, how to keep eyes open and give poses. It took us the whole day. I clicked several pictures but ultimately could get the required quality only in about 15 pictures. We shot videos as well.”Abhishek, who got married three days back, said: “It was an awesome experience. We had a sitting with the photographer and we told him that we wanted an experience worth being remembered. He suggested underwater pre-wedding shoot and we agreed.”He said: “There was an issue that pools in all hotels of the city were shut owing to Covid but the photographer arranged a shoot for us at a private pool owned by one of his acquaintances. They first drained out the water, got it cleaned and refilled it for us.

Farmers consider it an “English law”, which used to be imposed on Indian poor farmers in the British era. The country knows that only Punjab and Haryana farmers who sell their farm products on or over MSP are far better off than other farmers in the country. Not introducing MSP means bringing all farmers into the same fate, which will be very unfortunate for the progress of country,” said Sunny Mehta, AICC member. The police later detained more than 15 members of both parties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nsui-iyc-protest-farm-laws-lock-punjab-bjp-office-in-chandigarh-150730
04-10-2020||---||Philanthropist Surinder Pal Singh Oberoi appointed member of Jail Development Board||Gurdaspur, October 3The Punjab Government has appointed Dubai-based philanthropist and human rights activist Surinder Pal Singh Oberoi and Monica Dhawan, director, India Vision Foundation, as members of the Punjab Prisons Development Board.The Board has been established up to engage prisoners in gainful economical activities and to ensure no human rights violations take place in jails. The Board is chaired by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh with Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa being senior vice-chairman.“It will help in putting a stop to crimes while simultaneously generating revenue by keeping inmates busy in various activities. It will also take care of human rights violations,” said Randhawa.Sources said Oberoi has been taken on board for his work in the field of human rights. The Dubai businessman, who donates 95 per cent of his earnings for charitable causes was instrumental in freeing 17 Punjabis from the UAE in 2013. The youths were facing a death sentence for allegedly murdering Mishri Khan, a Pakistani man following a brawl between two groups of bootleggers in Sharjah.“The CM, Capt Amarinder Singh, personally visited the youths in Sharjah Central Jail and assured them that he will take up their case with the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Later, Manmohan Singh gave instructions to the Indian Consulate General in Dubai and Embassy in Abu Dhabi to work closely with me to ensure the youths were freed. I paid blood money to the tune of Rs 4 crore to the family of Mishri Khan, which subsequently paved the way for the youths to return home,” said Oberoi.He has paid for air tickets for nearly 800 Indians languishing in various jails in the UAE. “They had completed their sentences, but were rotting in prisons due to an assortment of reasons. To me, this was a violation of their human rights,” said the construction magnate.“To deny people their human rights is akin to challenging their very humanity. Rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened. I will ensure that there are no violations of rights in Punjab’s prisons,” said Oberoi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/philanthropist-surinder-pal-singh-oberoi-appointed-member-of-jail-development-board-150789

Satnam Kaur (name changed) is now no more. Reason: By the time she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer, the doctors had already proclaimed it was “too late”. She was given treatment, but couldn’t be saved.‘Symptoms ignored’It’s not that Satnam, a resident of Talwandi Sabo, didn’t show signs of cancer. She had complained of a lump in the breast for over two years, but chose to defer a visit to the doctor. However, she did go for the ancient medicine system and even visited an occultist for treatment.Breast cancer has recently emerged as one of the most common cancers among women in the Malwa belt. Doctors at the government-run Advanced Cancer Institute and Hospital (ACI) here have cited delayed diagnosis and lack of awareness among people as the most challenging factors.The hospital records suggest as many as 920 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past four years, but only a minuscule percentage was diagnosed with stage I cancer. Besides, cervical cancer has been identified as the second most common cancer with 375 cases in the past four years, followed by ovarian cancer. Lack of hygiene was observed as one of major factors for cervix cancer.As per the doctors, there has been a sizeable increase in the number of breast cancer patients over the years. It is often seen that women from the rural belt of the region ignore the symptoms of the disease. Dr Deepak Arora, Director, ACI, says: “More than advancements in medical techniques or equipment for the treatment of cancer, efforts are required to spread general awareness about cancer, its symptoms and the right treatment for it.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/delayed-diagnosis-putting-breast-cancer-patients-at-risk-150819

We have asked him to clarify the whereabouts of the missing ‘saroops’, make public the entire 1,000-page probe report and reveal the names of those on whose behest the ‘saroops’ were issued without putting them on record. If the SGPC president does not furnish the details by October 18, we will have no choice but to take the legal recourse,” he said.The SGPC has put out details of just 10 pages of the report on its official website describing only the conclusion that 16 SGPC officials and staff members were indicted for misappropriation of the holy scriptures since 2013. “What was the hitch in disclosing the entire report? We fear that it was done to save several officials,” Randhawa said.Another SGPC member Gurmeet Singh Tolkewal said in the 2016 fire incident, since the ‘saroops’ could not be used for the ‘parkash’ ceremony, these were cremated at Goindwal Sahib. “But why were the facts of this episode not put on record?

Rahul is slated to kickstart a three-day tractor rally to protest the new laws from Moga.“I want to ask Rahul five questions — Did Congress’ 2017 election manifesto in Punjab say you will open private ‘mandis’ and allow e-trading of contract farming, which is in force now? If so, why haven’t you repealed the amended APMC Act in Punjab till now? Did you in the manifesto state you will abolish the APMC Act altogether and make agri-trade free from all restrictions? Why did you choose to leave the country a day before the farm Bills were to be taken up in Parliament and return the day they became Acts? Also, why didn’t you issue a whip to your MPs to vote against the Bills and field senior leaders to oppose these?”Sukhbir made it clear the cause of the farmers was common for all. “We must unite to fight this battle.

He, however, fell short of confirming Sidhu’s participation. CM Capt Amarinder Singh has extended an olive branch to Sidhu, saying he was welcome to join the Cabinet again.AICC general secretary and Punjab affairs incharge Harish Rawat on Thursday had gone to Amritsar and held a meeting with Sidhu. Describing the meeting ‘positive’, Rawat said he had conveyed Rahul’s message to him to participate in the tractor rallies. He was confident Sidhu would participate in these rallies.Sidhu’s participation in the tractor rallies was politically important within the Congress circles in the backdrop of organisational restructure of the PPCC, which was on cards. The party high command is likely to give a facelift to the organisational structure of the PPCC, including the state president’s post. Sidhu’s name, too, is doing the rounds for the post.Another senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa has been at loggerheads with the CM over the performance of the state government.

Even agencies are yet to gear up for the procurement. A commission agent claimed that there was no word from any agency official about the procurement.The reason for the slow arrival of paddy is harvesting is yet to gather pace. Moreover, the moisture content in the crop is quite high at the moment. Therefore, the Agriculture Department is urging farmers to bring completely dry produce to the market to avoid inconvenience.The government procurement guidelines require moisture content to be below 17 per cent. Private players usually purchase the crop with higher moisture at a lower price.Satpal Singh, a farmer from Gulabgarh village, on Friday brought 10 tonnes of produce in three tractor-trailers to a grain market in Bathinda, but it would be purchased on Monday. According to agriculture experts, the procurement season will gain momentum in the second week of October as some varieties, including PR 121, 122,128, 129 and 140, will be ready for harvest by then.“What was the point of starting early procurement when officials knew a majority of crop won’t be ready for harvest for the next seven days?” said Shingara Singh Mann, secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan).“Paddy crop has started arriving and procurement would be done tomorrow,” said Balkar Singh, secretary, Bathinda Market Committee.Deputy CommissionerB Srinivasan said: “All arrangements are in place for smooth procurement.

Though the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) had decided to start procurement at 21 centres in the state from October 1, it has not bought even a single bale in the past three days due to “high moisture content and low quality”.Talking to The Tribune, CCI General Manager Neeraj Kumar said, “Initial pickings of cotton farmers are not that rich in quality with moisture content varying from 15 to 22 per cent against the CCI’s permissible limit of 8 to 12 per cent. We have fixed a certain criteria and can only procure cotton that adheres to those quality parameters. We have been recommending farmers to dry the cotton properly and then bring it to the market. In its current shape, the CCI would not be able to procure the produce in the first week of October.”With the CCI not starting procurement in mandis, it is the private players who have been calling the shots and procuring cotton as per their convenience and rates.Sukhwinder Singh Bhokhra, a farmer from the Goniana block of Bathinda district, said, “I had to sell fine quality cotton picked from fields around five days ago for Rs 4,700 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5,725. Last year, I had sold cotton for Rs 4,500. It is surprising that the government fixes the MSP for farm produce, but it does not have a proper mechanism in place to facilitate even remunerative prices to the farmers.”Another farmer Gurpal Singh from Nasibpura village in Talwandi Sabo had to sell the produce for Rs 3,500 per quintal. An official of the Market Committee said cotton was sold between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,950 per quintal in the district on Saturday. A factory owner said they could not procure the produce at government rates as the quality was not good and the moisture content was high.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-forced-to-sell-cotton-below-msp-150765

The system can’t be run with the remaining 10 horsepower. It requires additional 30-40 horsepower to work smoothly. Further, if we will install the system, the baler machines bought by spending huge money will become useless,” said Manna Singh, a combine harvester owner from Sangu Dhaun village here. He said the officials had made the system mandatory without even knowing the ground realities.Notably, the system leaves little plant stalk, eliminating the need for setting the paddy stubble on fire, which causes air pollution.Meanwhile, the district administration impounded a combine harvester for operating without the system.It also appointed eight coordinators and 90 nodal officers to stop the illegal practice of straw burning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/combine-owners-at-odds-with-admn-150767

SAD leader Pawan Tinu said, “We have always been blaming the Congress government in the state, but the BJP is also responsible for spoiling the careers of over two lakh Dalit students who have no money to continue their college education.”“Rahul should also tell if he agrees with the Chief Minister’s decision to give an ‘open licence’ to ministers to loot Central funds sent for disbursal among SC students,” he said.Meanwhile, speaking to reporters in Jalandhar, SAD MLA Pawan Tinu said the party was not ready to accept the new inquiry report. “With the minister continuing on the post, a fair inquiry was not possible. No probe has been conducted into the role of ex-IAS officer and Phagwara Congress MLA BS Dhaliwal, who served in the Social Welfare Department before joining politics,” Tinu said.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Harpal Singh Cheema said the Rs 55-crore scam was exposed by an Additional Chief Secretary who pointed the finger at Dharamsot. He said instead of cracking a whip on the tainted minister, the Capt Amarinder Singh government gave a clean chit to him.Cheema said, “We reject the fake and frivolous clean chit given to the minister by the so-called investigation team.

The Bench had, at that time, observed in its order the FIR was registered at the behest of officials of the district administration.The order had said the government officials had found the petitioners, who were colonisers/developers, had sold the plots to over 400 persons without getting the colony approved. Even some part of ‘shamlat’ (common land) had also been sold. The developers had also sold land reserved for roads and parks.“There are serious allegations and the district administration has registered the FIR after getting the preliminary inquiry into the matter. There are 400 plot-holders, most of whom have already constructed their houses. In these circumstances, there is no ground to grant extraordinary relief of pre-arrest bail. All petitions are dismissed,” it had said.Dismissing the second bail plea, Justice Kshetarpal added the petitioner had failed to draw attention of the court to any fresh ground for the grant of pre-arrest bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/consider-forming-sit-to-probe-illegal-colony-high-court-tells-dgp-150771

04-10-2020||New Delhi||Covid-hit India not to reopen Kartarpur corridor||India has cited Covid protocols and a pending technical issue to justify the continued closure of the Kartarpur corridor despite Pakistan reopening it on Saturday.The Pakistan government had earlier announced that the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib Corridor on its side had been reopened as the Covid situation in the country had improved.But in India, which has fared worse with Covid deaths crossing the 1 lakh-mark, a decision on reopening would be taken in accordance with the Covid protocols and easing of restrictions, said Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. In the wake of the pandemic, the government had shut down the Kartarpur corridor in March. Pakistan too had imposed a ban on its nationals from accessing it.In June, Pakistan had reopened the corridor briefly to commemorate Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s death anniversary, but India had rejected the offer as the pandemic was a major worry.The MEA said it continued to remain in touch with the authorities concerned, including Ministries of Home Affairs and Health, on its reopening.A notification issued by Pakistan Ministry of Religious Affairs on Friday allows Indian visitors to come daily from dawn to dusk.The MEA also pointed out that Pakistan was yet to fulfil some commitments at the time of opening of the corridor and in the bilateral agreement signed in October last year. Even after a year, Pakistan has not constructed the bridge over Budhi Ravi Channel, while it is ready at India’s end. Despite a technical meeting with Pakistan, there is no progress by Pakistan, Srivastava said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-hit-india-not-to-reopen-kartarpur-corridor-150688

We have the documents. I dare the Union Minister to make the proceedings of the meeting public,” he said, pointing out that Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar had in a media interview admitted to Harsimrat having raised objections.Addressing the media here, Puri said: “I was present at the Cabinet meeting. I did not hear her raising any objection though later the Shiromani Akali Dal asked the Union Agriculture Minister to give in writing that the new laws would not end the MSP system. Som Parkashji (Hoshiarpur MP and Union Minister of State for Commerce) was present at that meeting too.” Som Parkash was seated next to Puri at the media briefing.Emphasising that the minimum support price (MSP) regime would continue, Puri further said that “lies” were being spread that farmers’ land would be “snatched” by big corporates. “Sale, lease or mortgage of farmers’ land is prohibited. Farmers’ land is also protected against any recovery,” he explained.To counter the Opposition on the farm laws, Puri said Jasmine Sandhu Sandhawalia had been appointed Punjab BJP’s media in charge. Sandhawalia has earlier worked with the SAD media unit and with Congress leader Preneet Kaur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/harsimrat-didnt-object-to-farm-laws-at-cabinet-meeting-hardeep-singh-puri-150676
