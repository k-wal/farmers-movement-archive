29-10-2020||London||British-Indian author’s Jallianwala Bagh story shortlisted for history prize||British-Indian journalist and author Anita Anand’s book that tells the story of a young man caught up in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar has been shortlisted for a prestigious history-literary prize in the UK.‘The Patient Assassin: A True Tale of Massacre, Revenge and the Raj’ will compete with six others for the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize for History 2020, awarded annually for a non-fiction book of specifically historical content.Entries are required to be works of high literary merit – that is, not primarily written for the academic market – and can cover all historical periods.“Modern history is well-represented with Anita Anand’s ‘The Patient Assassin’ showing us how empire continues to haunt us,” said Rana Mitter, Professor of the History and Politics of Modern China at the University of Oxford, who is the chair of this year’s judging panel.In the shortlisted book, Anand tells the dramatic story of an orphan Udham Singh’s 21-year quest for revenge, taking him around the world in search of those he held responsible for the Raj-era Amritsar massacre of April 1919, executed by British troops during a Baisakhi gathering in the city’s Jallianwala Bagh grounds.Others in the running for the 2,000 pounds prize include Julia Blackburn for ‘Time Song: Searching for Doggerland’; Hazel Carby for ‘Imperial Intimacies: A Tale of Two Islands’; Toby Green for ‘A Fistful of Shells: West Africa from the Rise of the Slave Trade to the Age of Revolution’; Caroline Moorhead for ‘A House in the Mountains: The Women Who Liberated Italy from Fascism’; Thomas Penn for ‘The Brothers York: An English Tragedy’; and Roel Sterckx, ‘Chinese Thought: From Confucius to Cook Ding’.“This is a shortlist of astonishing chronological and geographical variation, bound together by one factor: innovative and pathbreaking historical research… This range and depth is a highly positive sign of the vigour of history writing today,” said Prof Mitter.He added: “Two works combine historical depth with memoir, Hazel V Carby’s moving account of her search for her family history between Britain and Jamaica in ‘Imperial Intimacies’, and Julia Blackburn’s ‘Timesong’, which moves between prehistory and the present day with huge aplomb.“Caroline Moorehead’s ‘A House in the Mountains’ recalls the fight against fascism in the 75th year since the end of World War II.“Thomas Penn’s ‘The Brothers York’ is a meticulous study of medieval monarchy, and Toby Green’s ‘A Fistful of Shells’ opens up a story of West Africa in the early modern era known to few westerners. Roel Sterckx’s ‘Chinese Thought’ opens up an intellectual and emotional world thousands of years and as many miles distant from our own experience in the west,” he said.English PEN, which stands for Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, Novelists, is one of the world’s oldest human rights organisations championing the freedom to write and read. It is the founding centre of PEN International, a worldwide writers’ association with 145 centres in more than 100 countries.Marjorie Hessell-Tiltman was a member of PEN during the 1960s and 1970s and on her death in 1999, she bequeathed 100,000 pounds to the PEN Literary Foundation to found a prize in her name.The winner of this year’s prize in her memory will be announced on November 26. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/british-indian-authors-jallianwala-bagh-story-shortlisted-for-history-prize-162899

While this was not the first time the Government of India had gone for a scrutiny of the utilisation funds, this was, however, a first as far as non-release of RDF was concerned, he said, expressing serious concern over the development.The Chief Minister said doubts were being raised in various quarters about the timing of the Union Cabinet’s decision not to release to Punjab its due RDF funds to the tune of more than Rs 1,000 crore at the present juncture, amid the controversy and crisis over the Farm Laws. The timing is suspect and points to dubious motivation behind the move, he said, urging the Centre to immediately reconsider and give the state’s dues against RDF while the scrutiny continues, as has been the case in the past.The funds, as the Centre is well aware, are used for developing critical agriculture marketing infrastructure like construction of roads in the rural areas of the state, marketing yards, said the Chief Minister, adding that failure to release the funds would obstruct the development of villages and could further aggravate the angst of the farmers, who are in a prolonged agitation against the central farm sector legislations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centres-decision-on-rural-development-fund-unfortunate-amarinder-162863

With the rail service shut, the industry is suffering huge losses as their goods cannot be sent to their customers outside the state, nor can they get the raw material for manufacturing goods, as most shipments are sent through trains.The thermal plants in the state - both private and state-owned - have minimal stocks left and the state stares at a blackout in case it does not get the much-needed coal immediately, for running the plants.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of the Union, however, refused to lift the blockade. Taking to The Tribune, he said the state government should realise that the Centre is trying to impose an economic blockade on Punjab. “We are not sitting on the main railway lines. We had cleared these lines earlier and goods trains’ service can resume. Our agitation is only outside private thermal plants, on the service tracks that bring coal to these plants from the main railway tracks. We will not lift the blockades here. The state government should start running its own plants, rather than trying to help the private thermal plants,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/train-service-in-punjab-not-to-resume-as-bku-refuses-to-lift-blockade-162842

In the past year, over 150 mobile phones were recovered from the jail, which houses over 2,200 inmates, including over 12 gangsters.In 2019 alone, a total 100 mobile phones were recovered.While some unscrupulous jail staff members allowed the use of mobile phones in the jail for a monthly ‘fee’, the ‘mild’ punishment has failed to deter inmates. They don’t fear getting caught.The prisoners knew that even if they get prosecuted, they would get a concurrent sentence, said a senior functionary in vigilance department.As per the Act, a prisoner found guilty of possessing and operating a mobile phone or its components such as SIM card, memory card, battery or charger can be punished for a term not exceeding one year.Sources also said the inmates often took the extreme step of using their bodies to smuggle in banned stuff.“There have been instances when prisoners have tried to hide parts of mobile phones or drugs in their rectal cavities or even in the mouth where policemen generally do not check during searches,” the officer said.Women inmates, too, have been caught with mobile phones in the jail here.More than five women inmates have been found in possession of phones in the jail in the past 10 months.Sometime back, Ram Singh, a senior PCS officer here, had written a book, “Magistrate Mujrim”, representing a harsh critique of the jail system and rare insight into the lives of prisoners here.He wrote that mobile phones were easily accessible in jail. From lower rung to high rank, many jail officials were helping in providing these “prohibited” items to the inmates and prisoners for a price.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/arrest-of-asst-jail-superintendent-puts-faridkot-central-jail-authorities-in-dock-over-use-of-mobile-phones-in-jail-162827

He said the state government knew that the ongoing protest was peaceful and there was no threat to railways staff or property. He said that in such circumstances, the state government should have easily tackled the Central government’s designs by assuring them of safety.The farmer leaders stated that they were not against the economic interests of traders but the Centre by stopping goods trains had harmed traders’ interests.

They cornered the SGPC over its failed administration that led to misappropriation of the funds charged for issuing ‘saroops’ and feared that it was a deliberate attempt to conceal the facts which led to SGPC’s U-turn on taking criminal proceedings against 16 officials and staff members who were indicted by the Akal Takht-constituted probe panel.A Telangana High Court lawyer, who headed the probe panel, has prepared a 1000-page investigation report. The circumstances were thoroughly examined and the officials concerned and employees were questioned, but the moot question is where and on whose instance the ‘saroops’ were issued.The SGPC also faced opposition as uncertainty prevailed in the number of ‘saroops’ that were damaged in an accidental fire on May 2016 at its publication branch in Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib.Balbir Singh Muchchal, head of the Satkar committee, said they joined members of the United Akali Dal to stage a symbolic protest to sensitise to the sangat (devotees) about the SGPC’s failure to disclose the number of missing ‘saroops’.“The SGPC was successful in thwarting our ‘insaaf’ morcha (protest) that was staged on October 14 but on October 24, the SGPC taskforce indulged in a clash with us after which cross-FIRs were registered. We have demanded the police that the footage of CCTV cameras that were set up near Teja Singh Samundri Hall must be taken into possession,” he said.United Akali Dal’s Mohkam Singh said they wanted to know the truth about the ‘saroops’. He said during the May 2016 fire incident, the SGPC had declared that only 14 ‘saroops’ were damaged. Later, an official note surfaced which claimed that about 80 ‘saroops’ that were damaged then. “When the issue of misappropriation of funds charged for issuing ‘saroops’ surfaced, the SGPC claimed the figure to be 267, but later the Akal Takht investigation revealed it to be 328. No one knows about the number of ‘saroops’ issued and the funds charged for issuing them embezzled under the nose of SGPC,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/missing-saroops-satkar-panel-members-corner-sgpc-over-poor-management-162658

All three thermal power plants owned by private players have exhausted their coal stock following the “rail roko” stir by farmers.The Mansa-based Talwandi Sabo Power Limited has shut, Nabha Power Limited is expected to close by Thursday and the GVK's 540-MW power plant at Goindwal Sahib is left with just two days of stock.Ahead of the festival season, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is looking to buy power. Sources said 700 rakes of coal stationed in different parts of the country were waiting to be transported to Punjab.“We are left with no option but to buy power from the central grid. We are banking on 700 MW of power bought by us to meet our everyday demand. In addition, we are paying the fixed charges to private thermal plants even though they have shut down production,” said a top PSPCL official.The crisis deepened after the Railways suspended the movement of goods trains to Punjab in view of the stir till October 29. The state-owned Rupnagar and Lehra thermal plants are left with five-day stock but are currently shut as they are required to have coal in stock to meet any emergency.

In another post from the account, a photo has been posted which reads, “Kisan de putt ha, kisan naal hi khadage”.Another gangster, Lawrence Bishnoi, also shared a video in favour of farmers in which he has written, “Please share this video for farmers. Jai Hind”. Gangster-turned-social activist Lakha Sidana is also raising the voice of farmers against the three farm laws. Shera Khuban and Davinder Bambiha were killed by the police in encounters, but groups and accounts in their name continue to run actively on the social media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gangsters-add-muscle-to-farm-stir-show-support-online-162469

Notably, in 2.5 acres (one hectare), just four capsules are required, which cost a total of Rs 20. Besides, some things easily available in almost every house like jaggery and gram flour, which are required in little quantity.Gurmeet Singh, a farmer of Kattianwali village, who has been given the Innovate Farmer Award-2020, said, “As a trial, I today sprayed the solution prepared from these capsules in five acres. The IARI scientists told me that it will start decomposing stubble in the fields within a week. It is easy to prepare the solution. We have to mix 200-gm jaggery in 5-litre water and heat it. After five days, we have to mix 50-gm flour, four capsules and 200-litre water in this solution. It is then ready to be sprayed on the paddy stubble, which is spread in the field using a mulcher.”He said, “Many farmers showed their willingness to buy these capsules as it is a cheaper and environment friendly remedy. The IARI is sending these capsules by post as well.”NS Dhaliwal, Deputy Director, KVK, Muktsar, said, “This is a scientific and cheaper method to control stubble burning incidents. Further, it will make the land fertile by converting stubble into manure. We will regularly inspect fields of the farmer, who sprayed the solution prepared from these capsules.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-manage-stubble-on-2-5-acres-with-just-rs20-162470

The facility is being used only to provide training to arms licence holders. The gun-training-cum-shooting range situated on the premises of Mahant Gurbanta Das School for Deaf and Dumb was inaugurated by state Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal amid much fanfare in January this year.As per records, registration count at the shooting range was negligible with only a handful of budding shooters visiting the range for practice purpose, while a sizeable number of amateur shooters come there to check their weapons.Jagtar Singh, range safety officer, said: “People come here for checking their weapons, but only two persons have got themselves registered at the range for practice purpose. Besides, three more budding shooters came to practice the sport for a few days. Due to the lockdown imposed in wake of Covid-19 not many people turned up for registration this year.”Talking to The Tribune, Arjuna awardee shooter Avneet Kaur Sidhu said, “There’s certainly no dearth of talent in the region, but lack of willingness on the part of officials to utilise the shooting range for training budding sportsmen as well as established shooters who play at the state and national level. There are certain upgradations required in the shooting range and a permanent coach is needed to train the shooters and that can only be achieved with proper coordination between the administration and the district Rifle Association.”A former executive member of the association, requesting anonymity, said, “The shooting range was the dream project of a senior administrative officer posted in Bathinda who painstakingly made all-out effort to establish the state-of-the-art facility. After he was transferred from here, not much heed has been paid to run the range properly. The district administration needs to coordinate with the association members to utilise the shooting range optimally so that budding shooters can train here and earn glory for the state and country.” He added, “The administration should lower the fee, as Rs 21,000 for annual registration is way too much for many, especially for those living in the rural belt of the region.”Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan said, “Soon after its inauguration in January, it had to be closed down temporarily in the wake of Covid. If sportspersons (shooters) have any concrete plans to utilise the facility to the maximum effect then they must share it with the administration and we will be more than willing to incorporate their inputs.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bathinda-shooting-range-finds-few-takers-162471

As a result, water recycling is not happening and the water is getting dirtier with each passing day. Besides, the water level has receded up to 15 feet in the recent past. Personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), who train in the lake water and carry out rescue operations, have complained of skin diseases. Talking to The Tribune, Commandant Ravi Kumar Pandita of the 7th battalion of NDRF, said, “Since the lake water could not recycled on account of closure of the thermal plant, it is getting dirtier. In the long run, it will pose serious risk to our personnel. The training sessions which usually start in April and continue till October every year can’t be organised partly due to the Covid-19 spread and party owing to the unclean water. Apart from training, our personnel also carry out rescue operations by fishing out persons who jump in canal water and lakes here.”Pandita added, “If this continues, the lakes will lose their charm. We request the authorities concerned to intervene and provide a solution on priority.”One of the divers said, “We are developing skin allergies because of the contaminated water in the lakes. Besides non-recycling of lake water, people living in ‘jhuggis’ nearby also pollute the water by washing clothes in it and using it for toilet purpose. The local administration or the government must come up with a comprehensive plan to ensure that lake water remains clean.”A senior retired officer of the Bathinda thermal plant, requesting anonymity, said, “Once touted as the ‘city of lakes’, Bathinda is gradually growing indifferent to preserve its old glory, as thermal lakes that once added a unique aesthetic appeal to the city are falling prey to the apathy of officialdom. Not only are the lakes getting contaminated, but their water levels are also receding drastically.”Devinder Pal Garg, Chief Engineer, Bathinda and Lehra thermal plants, said, “The problems are bound to arise as the water is not getting recycled. The thermal land has been transferred to PUDA, and we will bring the matter to their notice in writing and request them to come up with a solution. We can reach a solution and for that all we need are heavy outlet water pipes to release the lake water in a canal to maintain the water levels.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gndtps-closure-takes-toll-on-bathindas-lakes-162472

However, that has not deterred people from stealing sand, as theft of sand goes on unabated. Moreover, the government has no separate record of beneficiaries, who had applied for the purchase of sand online.The information gathered by The Tribune reveals that 14 persons have been arrested, 13 have been booked and 25 sand-laden tractor trailers have been confiscated post the announcement was made, implying registration of one case of theft every alternate day.The authorities also impounded two sand-laden vehicles bearing “on army duty” stickers, to deceive the authorities and the police, on October 6.On September 12, Deputy Commissioner Arvind Pal Singh Sandhu had announced to sell sand online in the district at the rate of Rs 9 per cubic feet from government legal quarries despite the fact that there was no legal quarry in the district. The sand was to be provided to applicants from other areas, preferably from Ferozepur district, where there are two legal quarries.A source said most of the sand was excavated from the bed or the banks of creek of Sutlej passing through Fazilka and Jalalabad subdivisions. He had also announced to impose a penalty to the tune of Rs 2 to 4 lakh and had directed the departments concerned to cancel driving licenses and registration certificates of offenders and vehicles, respectively.The information also revealed that the accused had only been booked under Sections 379 of the IPC and 21 of the Mining and Minerals Act, and faced no other punishment as was announced by the administration.The source said very few persons had applied for buying sand online. The applicants said even website wasn''t operational for most of the times and the reason was best known to the authorities.When contacted, Pawan Kapoor, Executive Engineer, Mining, said the department had no record of how many persons had applied for purchasing the sand online. “Since it was a centralised online sand selling website, the record is available with the authorities in Chandigarh only,” said Kapoor.“I shall seek record of the offenders from the Police Department and only then will be able to take any action,” said the Deputy Commissioner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/despite-online-sale-of-sand-no-let-up-in-theft-cases-162473

29-10-2020||  BQ--- “With children already struggling with jobs and career-related issues due to the pandemic||As expenses plummet, parents nudge kids to tie the knot||Avneet Kaur Jalandhar, October 28 In the past two months, Tanisha Gupta (26) has paid as many as four visits to a mental health counsellor. Reason: She has been feeling stressed due to the continuous pressure from her parents to get married amid the pandemic restrictions.  Tanisha, who lives in Model Town here, said Covid-19 has proven to be a blessing in disguise for middle-class families as marriage expenses have reduced drastically, owing to a capped guests list and other restrictions. She said she had done everything she could and given every possible excuse to change the mind of her parents, who had now started ‘emotionally blackmailing’ her by saying “they will be at peace only when they see her well settled”. “I work for a finance company here on a salary of Rs35,000. I have dreams that I wish to fulfil and want to grow professionally. Above all, I am not mentally prepared to get married yet,” she said, adding that she did understand that once the pandemic abated, weddings would again become outrageously grand exhibits due to the societal pressure, but that did not mean she would ‘sacrifice’ her dreams. Like Tanisha, many young girls and boys currently living at home have a similar ordeal to share. Most of them are from middle-class families and say their parents have been pressurising them to tie the nuptial knot in a sober ceremony to save money. Ritika (name changed), who failed to convince her parents and got married last month, said: “My cousin’s wedding was scheduled in May and was supposed to be a big-fat event but due to the lockdown, the marriage was solemnised at our residence in the presence of 10 to 12 relatives. My uncle was happy with the way ceremonies were held. He then convinced my father to find a match for me and get free of his ‘responsibilities’.” Ritika’s father then contacted a marriage bureau and sought pictures of suitable matches. “Within three months, everything was planned and I got married in September. Though I am still angry with my parents for rushing things, destiny had its own plans and I must say I have got a quite understanding partner,” she added. Daleep Kaur, who runs a marriage bureau, said she had been receiving a lot of queries lately. “Covid-19 has failed to dampen the spirit of those willing to get married,” she stated. However, Aman Sood, assistant professor (psychiatry), Jalandhar Civil Hospital, said with children already struggling with jobs and career-related issues due to the pandemic, the pressure to get married had added to their woes. “Parents must show some understanding and support their kids, rather than taking such impulsive decisions regarding their future,” Dr Sood added.\\||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/as-expenses-plummet-parents-nudge-kids-to-tie-the-knot-162475

His counsel has claimed that the entire information earlier sought by the High Court in the matter has not been forthcoming. In fact, several other police officers were facing criminal cases. Some of them were continuing in service even after their conviction.Policing the police, the High Court has called for details of accused and convicts in uniform. It has asked the Punjab Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Home Affairs and Justice, to file an affidavit setting out the details of FIRs registered against the serving police officers of all ranks in the state.Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal has made it clear that the affidavit was required to mention that the nature and status of the FIRs along with the current posting of the officers.

29-10-2020|| Blurb||Despite CM’s intervention, power woes plague Abohar||Raj Sadosh Abohar, October 28 Even after the office of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on August 18 told the chairman-cum-Managing Director of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to take cognisance of complaints about erratic power supply in Abohar and initiate necessary action to improve it, there has been only a marginal relief.  A power outage in the residential colonies and small-scale industries under the 11kV area on the Kandhwala Road in Nai Abadi area was officially confirmed on the PSPCL portal at 11.30 pm on Monday but the revised information uploaded on the portal today claimed that supply went off at 7 am on Tuesday and may be restored by 9.30 am. However, it was restored at 12.20 pm, after 13 hours, when senior officials were approached. Such a long breakdown disrupted work in the industries, besides thousands of households. Meanwhile, power outage was reported from a dozen villages also.  The CM’s office had, in August, taken notice of the complaints that claimed power distribution management in Abohar subdivision had nosedived to the lowest possible level. Supply went off with the first drop of rain as if rain and electricity were parallel poles. The 11kV feeder of Sriganganagar road that feeds more than three dozen colonies, Border Security Force (BSF) complex, main water works and educational institutions located on the Abohar-Hanumangarh highway, reported breakdowns of up to eight hours in summers. Most of the time, the PSPCL supply status portal would claim there was no outage. After complaints were uploaded on the portal, the duration of outage was extended repeatedly.  The Abohar power division gets supply from the Muktsar circle for 220 kV and 66kV grid stations, that had been upgraded in 2018. The officials had claimed that Rs 24.5 crore was spent on upgrading the system but NGOs complained that funds were siphoned off by allowing private contractors to use sub-standard materials. In hundreds of streets, cables were found hanging low while meter boxes stayed uncovered and fixed close to ground level. Teachers in most of the schools in rural areas had complained that schools didn’t get regular power supply even for three-days in a week.  The Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat had urged the CM to intervene.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/despite-cms-intervention-power-woes-plague-abohar-162465

This is because the government has pledged its future income accrued from the RDF to various banks for availing a loan of Rs 4,500 crore.Manpreet Singh Badal, Finance Minister Legal recourse open, says fmWe will reason out with the Centre on the denial of RDF. If they do not agree, legal remedy is available to us. The Centre’s decision to “scrutinise the RDF” and not include this fund while making the provisional cost sheet for custom milled rice to be delivered to the Centre will mean that the entire loan taken against the RDF will have to be borne by the state. With its income shrinking because of Covid-induced economic crisis and the Central devolutions to Punjab, too, coming down, the debt-stressed state will be pushed to the edge in repaying the loan.Yesterday the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, had written to the state, demanding to know what percentage of the RDF was being used for improvement of procurement centres. The letter also accused the state government of using the funds for other activities. The provisional cost sheet sent to the state yesterday had not included the payment of the RDF (at 3 per cent of minimum support price) to the state for paddy being procured now. Punjab collects Rs 1,000 crore as the RDF on paddy and another Rs 750 crore as the RDF on wheat. The issue is to be discussed in a meeting of the Rural Development Board to be chaired by CM Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday.Official sources told The Tribune that this annual income of Rs 1,750 crore was being used to repay the interest on the loan of Rs 4,500 crore that the government had availed for the Farmers Debt Relief and Debt Waiver Scheme and for implementing the Smart Village Scheme. While Rs 4,000 crore has been spent on the debt waiver scheme, Rs 500 crore has been spent on the first phase of Smart Village Scheme. A sum of Rs 1,200 crore has been reserved for the second phase, an official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-rural-development-fund-punjab-govt-in-a-fix-over-rs-4-500-cr-loan-interest-payment-162434

29-10-2020||---||There’s no going back on farm Acts, says JP Nadda||Chandigarh, October 28Maintaining there was no going back on the three agriculture Acts, BJP national president JP Nadda today asked Punjab BJP leaders to fan out in rural areas instead of focussing on urban pockets to deepen the party’s reach in the state before the next Assembly elections.State govt misusing rural fund: ChughDelivering the first Kamal Sharma memorial lecture via video-conferencing, Nadda called upon the state BJP leaders to adopt an aggressive approach against the Congress’ propaganda and explain the good provisions of the Acts to farmers.“These farm Acts will remain as they ensure the farmer reaps one and half times profit on the sale of produce. Contractor or trader is bound by law to incur any damage to crops due to weather. Significantly, no contract with anytrader would include the land of farmers. The contract would be of the produce only,” he said.The BJP president claimed the party had a lot of support in Punjab and in order to become number one in the state, the party has to spread its wings in the rural areas.JP Nadda, BJP President Opposition LyingOpposition parties are against the Central agriculture Acts purely for political reasons and deceiving the farmers as they have failed to deliver anything reformative to them. Ridiculing the Punjab Congress and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Nadda said the Congress was, in fact, opposing the commitments it had made in its 2017 election manifesto.He said the Congress had promised to do away with mandis and promote contract farming and this was what the Narendra Modi government had ensured in the new legislations. “Will the Congress say that it made wrong promises in its manifesto?” Nadda asked.He said the three farm Acts would not only empower the farmers in the country, but would also release them from the age-old bondage. He asssured that there would be no change in the minimum support price (MSP) system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/theres-no-going-back-on-farm-acts-says-jp-nadda-162436
29-10-2020||Chandigarh||Don’t deny rural fund to Punjab: SAD||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal today said the Union Government should not “victimise” farmers for agitating against the agricultural laws by refusing to pay the Rural Development Fund (RDF) of Rs 1,100 crore on government paddy purchase. He said such mechanisations only confirmed the fears that the process to finish the ‘mandi’ system had begun.Sukhbir Badal, SAD President Help farmersThe Centre must remember that farmers who are agitating against its policies are the ones who fed the nation for 50 years. It should not use coercive measures against them. In a statement here, the SAD president condemned the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution for not making any provision for the RDF in the cash credit limit extended for the current paddy procurement season. He said this would adversely affect the foodgrain procurement system in Punjab. The money received by the state from the RDF, which was around Rs 1,850 crore per annum, was used to maintain 1,800 mandis and 70,000 km of rural link roads.Meanwhile, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia advised the state government to followthe Kerala pattern and declare minimum support price (MSP) on fresh farm fruit and vegetables. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-deny-rural-fund-to-punjab-sad-162437

Due to the strike, the auction in Fazilka district could not be undertaken.“The state government has failed to make arrangements for a hassle-free inflow of paddy to Fazilka district,” alleged rice miller Rajinder Gheek from Jalalabad. The millers alleged the paddy was being stopped at the inter-state border and other places by protesting farmers. With paddy-laden trucks stuck, millers claimed they were not able to do business.Deepak Bawa, Fazilka ArhtiyaGovt must interveneThe basmati paddy started arriving 10 days ago, but none of the buyers has entered the market due to the strike. For how long will the farmers have to wait to sell their produce? The government must intervene. They further alleged that many trucks carrying basmati variety have been been forcibly sent back, resulting in huge financial losses to them.Rice miller Harish Setia said the District Food and Supplies Controller, Sangur, had written to the district police for making arrangements for a hassle-free transport of 1509 and 1121 varieties of basmati paddy across the Haryana border to prevent inconvenience to the traders, but no action has been taken on their request yet.Notably, the rice millers and exporters are the bulk buyers of basmati paddy as it does not fall in the minimum support price (MSP) category. Many millers complained basmati paddy trucks were being stopped at the inter-state border as the protesters thought it’s non-basmati paddy.“For the past five days, I have been waiting for the auction to take place at the local grain market, but there are no signs that the purchase will begin anytime soon,” said Mal Singh, a basmati grower of Mahatam Nagar village.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fazilka-millers-strike-halts-auction-of-basmati-paddy-162439

Party leaders would raise the matter with the Governor as well, he added.He said the Congress government ignored a 44-page report and gave the clean chit to the minister. “A writ petition has already been filed in the high court.

Gurpal Singh Chahal, DC, Ferozepur, said, “It is a treat to watch the removal operations of stubble straw by farmers in Naraingarh and Hakumat Wala villages. Hopefully, a large number of farmers should be able to reap the benefit of this initiative, so that we can eradicate the menace of stubble burning.”The farmers are able to make money by selling the bale at Rs 130 per kg. Jasbir Singh Awla, Managing Director, Sukhbir Agro Energy Limited, said they have set up three biomass plants using technology from Denmark which converts paddy stubble into power. “Already, three plants are operational at Jaitu, Lambi and Ferozepur, and the fourth one at Patiala in under construction,” said Awla.He said the power being generated is directly sent to the grid, for which they had signed a MoU with the PSPCL. “These plants have generated employment avenues in the region. They prevent farmers from burning stubble, thus helping in decreasing air pollution, and at the same time, the PSPCL gets local power that saves line losses incurred if purchased from other states by 15 per cent,” said Awla.“The biomass plant has come as a boost for us. We can do away with the practice of burning paddy stubbles,” said farmers Lovedeep Singh and Sukhwinder. “Selling the residue will help farmers, who have been struggling because of the rising cost of sowing and growing crops, said Joginder Singh of Hakumat Wala village.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ferozepur-farmers-devise-novel-way-to-deal-with-stubble-162441
