10-12-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws: No farmer died due to police action during year-long protests, says govt||The Union government on Friday said that no farmer died due to police action during the year-long protests by farmers.Various farmer groups were protesting against three new farm laws, which have now been scrapped. The year-long protest at the Delhi borders was suspended by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday after the Union government accepted their key pending demands, including withdrawal of police cases against the protesters and on Minimum Support Price (MSP).In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said: “The subject of compensation, etc., to the families of the deceased farmers in the farmers movement is with the concerned state governments”.“No farmer died as a result of police action during the farmers’ agitation,” he said.Tomar was responding to a joint question by Congress leader Dhiraj Prasad Sahu and AAP leader Sanjay Singh.The members had asked whether the government is planning to provide or made any provision towards livelihood monetary compensation to the families of the farmers who died during farmers’ protests.Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been raising the issue of deaths of farmers during the year-long protests.The SKM, which suspended the protests after receiving a formal letter from the Union government accepting their key pending demands, on Thursday also said that farmers would celebrate December 11 as ‘Vijay Diwas’ and take out victory marches following which they will head home. The SKM is an umbrella body of 40 farm unions.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, were protesting at various Delhi borders from late November 2020, seeking repeal of the three farm laws.On November 29, Parliament passed a Bill to repeal the three laws.Replying to separate queries on the MSP, Tomar said, “a formal formation of a committee to promote zero budgeting based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent is under consideration.”     Asked if the government proposes to bring a law to give legal guarantee to MSP for every crop as recommended by Swaminathan Commission, the minister said the government has already implemented in 2018-19 the recommendation made by the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) to fix MSP at at least 50 per cent profit on weighted average cost of production.The Centre fixes MSP for 22 mandated agricultural crops and Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The MSP for toria and de-husked coconut are also announced based on the MSP of rapeseed and mustard and copra, respectively.

10-12-2021||New Delhi||It's pack-up time for farmers at Singhu as they dismantle a makeshift town||Large parts of the Singhu border protest site lay vacant on Friday after a number of farmers bundled up their belongings and headed home on tractors, while others worked long hours to dismantle the makeshift accommodations they built painstakingly over the last year.Tractors bedecked with colourful lights rolled out of the protest site blaring songs of victory. The elderly flaunted their colourful turbans and danced with the youngsters.Ladders, tarpaulin, poles and ropes lay scattered at the once-buzzing protest site, while blankets, pillows, mattresses and chairs were neatly stacked on the roadside.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which spearheaded the farmers’ agitation, had on Thursday announced the suspension of the protest that began over a year ago to seek the repeal of the Centre’s farm laws.Weeks after the government withdrew the contentious laws, the farmers will head home on Saturday morning.Harjot Singh from Punjab’s Barnala said people who had little luggage left for home on Thursday evening.“Some are leaving today. Those who built large structures and had more goods will depart tomorrow,” he said before breaking into a Punjabi song as tractors passed by.The movement of tractors in large numbers led to a heavy traffic jam, similar to the initial days of the protest when protesters poured in from different states.The young and the elderly worked together to dismantle the sturdy temporary structures erected by them on the long dusty stretch of the Delhi-Karnal road.Time and again, they chanted ‘Bole So Nihaal’ to pump themselves up.Jassa Singh, 69, a farmer from Punjab’s Faridkot said, “More men means it will be over quickly. We had ample time to build them, but we leave tomorrow. Hence, the haste... I have eaten a lot of ghee in my life. My muscles are as good as those of a 30-year-old man.”       As the men bundled up the clothes and mattresses and swiftly loaded them onto the trucks, women prepared lunch and tea.“The gas stoves and the utensils will be packed at last. We still have to cook dinner and tomorrow’s breakfast,” said Mai Kaur, 61, from Jalandhar in Punjab.Cardboard, thermocol, iron wire mesh, PVC sheets and mosquito nets lay around the dismantled structures.The youngsters inspected the tractors, cleaned the trolleys in preparation for the journey back home.They stop to have lunch, or tea, or a snack and return to work.Some farmers even donated their belongings to the needy in nearby villages.“We have a lot of clothes and ration that could be of use to them. Earlier we were also feeding a lot of people from neighbouring areas,” said Surjeet Singh, 64, from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur.Before setting out for their respective places, farmers clicked group pictures and shook a leg together one last time.Many volunteers, however, won’t be leaving on Saturday.“We have decided to stay back for some time to lend a hand to farmers who may need help in dismantling their tents and packing up belongings,” said Jasveer Singh, who managed the ‘Jangi Kitaab Ghar’ library here.Bakshish (30), who managed the 10-bed Kisan Mazdoor Ekta Hospital, said he will start packing up only after everyone has left.“There should be someone to cater to medical emergencies,” he said.

Situated on the banks of holy Bein, this is the tree under which Guru Nanak used to meditate and hence it is historically important. When the gurdwara was renovated, a platform was constructed around the tree leaving huge gaps around it so that it had space to spread out more. Just near the tree is the ‘Tap asthan’ or the meditation place, where the first Sikh master used to sit and recite hymns during his stay of 14 years, nine months and 13 days in this holy town.Gurdwara Palah Sahib (Gumtala)Guru Hargobind Sahib used to come to this place for resting and hunting. The first ever Sikh war in history was caused by an incident, which occurred at this place. The Sikhs caught a hawk, which was owned by Mughal emperor Shahjahan. When the Mughal soldiers came to this place and asked for the hawk, the Sikhs replied: “You are talking about the Baaj (hawk), we will soon lay our hands on your taj (crown).” As a result, an army under Mukhlis Khan was sent back. The place is named after the tree ‘Palah’ which no longer exists.Guru Ka BaghSikh Gurus had planted an orchard near the Darbar Sahib. Recently, the SGPC had initiated the revival of the Guru Ka Bagh on a 2.5 acre plot on the Darbar Sahib complex.Gurdwara Bhai Salo di Beri (Pandori Waraich)Bhai Salo ji, a prominent devotee, who was a contemporary of fifth Sikh Guru and in-charge of the construction work of the new town had stood under a jujube tree at Pandori Waraich village and stated that whosoever would donate fuel (dung cakes, wood) for baking bricks would be blessed with a son. A gurdwara has now been constructed at the place.Gurdwara Lachi Ber SahibIn 1577, when the excavation of Amrit Sarovar began, Guru Arjan Dev and Bhai Salo ji used to sit under this tree. In another historically important incident, Bhai Mehtab Singh and Bhai Sukha Singh tied their horses with this tree before proceeding to behead Massa Rangar to punish him for desecrating the holy place in 1797. Due to its small-sized berries (size of cardamom), it is called lachi ber.Gurdwara Dukh Bhanjni BeriThe story of Bibi Rajni and the metamorphosis of her leper husband is believed to have happened under this jujube tree. The believers take a dip in the sarovar under this tree till date to find solace from their troubles.Gurdwara Ber Sahib (Mattewal)The place is associated with Guru Hargobind Sahib. It is believed that the Sikh master rested at the site under a jujube tree.Ber Baba Buddha SahibUnder this holy tree, which exists till date, Baba Buddha, who remained closely associated with the first six Sikh Gurus, camped to oversee the excavation of the holiest of the ponds — the Amrit Sarovar.Gurdwara Bohri Sahib (Kot Khalsa)The place is on the old route from Amritsar to Guru Ki Wadali. Guru Arjan Dev used to stop under this tree whenever he travelled on this route.Gurdwara Toot Sahib (Sultanwind)The place in Sultanwind village is named after a mulberry tree associated with the Sixth Sikh Master. In an interesting incident, Bhai Manjh Ji had fallen into a well near the tree, when he had gone to bring the firewood for the langar. Guru Hargobind and devotees found him standing in the well with the wooden logs on his head, as he did not want these to get wet.Gurdwara Pipli Sahib (Putlighar)The place on Amritsar-Lahore-Kabul route had a pipal tree under which Guru Arjan Dev welcomed devotees from Afghanistan and north-western districts for the excavation of holy sarovar at the Darbar Sahib. It was at this place, that the 6th Sikh master — Guru Hargobind Singh — rested after killing Mukhlis Khan in the first battle with the Mughal army in Sikh history.Gurdwara Tahli SahibThe place on Kathunangal-Mattewal Road is associated with Baba Bir Singh Naurangabadi, a prominent Sikh figure of the 18th century. Several other gurdwaras in Punjab associated with him are known as Tahli Sahib.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/spiritual-roots-348590

Besides Mann, the court has also allowed the anticipatory bail application filed through Counsel Ankur Chaudhrie to another leader and MLA Master Baldev Singh in the case.The police had registered a case against 10 AAP leaders, including Bhagwant Mann, Harpal Singh Cheema and Aman Arora, for allegedly pelting cops with stones in a demonstration held opposite the MLA Hostel.Mann’s counsel argued that the FIR was an outcome of a political stunt of the party in power just to tarnish his reputation. The police registered the FIR in haste without verifying the facts and the allegations levelled against Mann are purely a work of fiction. There is no specific role or injury attributed to him. He has not used any type of criminal force upon any public servant to deter him from performing his lawful duty. No injury has been caused to any public servant.In reply, the Public Prosecutor argued that the accused, along with other workers, committed the offences of rioting, disobeying the DM orders and assault on public servant, which were serious in nature.After hearing of the arguments, Dr Rajneesh, Additional Sessions Judge, Chandigarh, allowed the anticipatory bail application of Mann and directed him to join the investigation before the investigating officer/SHO concerned within 10 working days.“In the event of arrest, the applicant is ordered to be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs50,000 with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the SHO/arresting officer for the offences mentioned in the FIR, subject to certain conditions — that the applicant will make himself available for investigation/trial of the case, as and when required; the applicant will not influence the prosecution witnesses; and the applicant will not leave the country,” the order stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/court-allows-manns-anticipatory-bail-plea-348450

However, in Tikri many chose to leave right away.On receiving a letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, the matter was discussed by SKM’s five-member committee and then at the general house. Subsequently, SKM leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Shiv Kumar Kakka and Hannan Mollah announced suspension of the protests at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, national highways and toll plazas.The letter by the Centre reportedly says the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana have agreed to withdraw cases against farmers with immediate effect.“It has been decided to put off celebrations by a day as a mark of respect to General Bipin Rawat and other defence personnel who will be laid to rest on Friday,” said Darshan Pal. “The boycott of the BJP and JJP in Haryana has been revoked,” he added.“This is not the end as the movement has only been suspended. We have decided to meet again on January 15 to ‘review’ the Centre’s assurances,” SKM core committee member Balbir Singh Rajewal told mediapersons.The Morcha leaders had on Wednesday accepted the Union Government’s revised draft proposals on key pending demands. Dedicating the “victory” to the farmers who died during the course of the agitation, the SKM thanked local residents, the media and social organisations for their support.“The story may be far from over,” warned some experts, claiming the farmers’ “victory” had exposed the “inability/limitations of the RSS-BJP strategy to counter agitations without any religious tinge”.“With Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand elections round the corner, the Modi government decided to accept the farmers’ demands,” said agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar from western Uttar Pradesh, who is associated with the Samajwadi Party.Amid reports that BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who gave a fresh impetus to the agitation with his emotional outbreak after the January 26 Republic Day violence, was not in favour of ending the agitation till MSP was made a legal entitlement, Panwar too said the farmers were “divided” on the issue. “This also shows the dominant role of Punjab and Haryana farmers in the agitation,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/stir-off-for-now-farmers-to-head-home-from-dec-11-348379

Farmers will start vacating Delhi borders on December 11 and will offer prayers at the Golden Temple on December 13.Back in their villages, their families have decided to distribute ‘laddoos’ on their return. Those who had lost their dear ones are finally at peace as their fellow brothers are coming back victorious.Shinder Kaur of Malout, whose husband and son were at the Singhu border, said no day in her life had been this special. “Our whole family will be together after more than a year. Someone from our family had always been at the border. I too went there twice and spent 15 days at the border. It’s a tale of hardships but we are happy that all the hard work has paid off. I along with other women of my village have decided to call our village ‘halwai’ and prepare laddoos and jalebis to welcome our family members on their return,” said Shinder Kaur.“The day is no less than Diwali for us, as the head of our family will be coming back victorious. The thought of our land going out of our hands was disturbing us and it was the main reason which led the farmers to protest. Diwali this year was a mere formality but now that my husband will be back, we will light ‘diyas’ at our home and ancestral gurdwara,” said Jageer Kaur from a small village near Machhiwara. Meanwhile, the families of those farmers who lost their lives during the protest are finally relieved as the sacrifice of their loved ones has not gone in vain.Hussan, grandson of Jai Singh from Dhindsa village who lost his life on September 19 at the Singhu border, said the soul of his grandfather would now be at peace when his fellow brothers would be returning home.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kin-plan-rousing-welcome-for-victorious-farmers-348346

Serving as the vice-chairman of the dera management committee, Nain was seeking at least seven-day advance notice if coercive action was be taken against him.He had filed the petition after being summoned as a witness in a sacrilege related case in which dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was examined by the Punjab Police. As the matter came up for resumed hearing before Justice Raj Mohan Singh’s Bench, Punjab Advocate-General DS Patwalia with Sehaj Bir Singh submitted that the petitioner was only required to make statement in pursuance of notice under Section 160 of the CrPC.“As of now, there is no such contemplation to arrest him,” Patwalia submitted, adding that the investigating officer would visit his residence in terms of proviso to Section 160. Nain’s counsel submitted that the petitioner undertook to remain present at the time of visit and cooperate in the investigation.Fixing the case for December 16, Justice Raj Mohan Singh added: “Let further course of action be intimated to this Court on the next date of hearing”.

Parmar said the SIT was visiting Sirsa owing to Nain’s “illness”. Earlier, the SIT had summoned both on November 26 and December 3. The SIT had taken a decision to question Vipassana and Nain after dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh denied his involvement in the sacrilege incidents.During his questioning by the SIT at the Sunaria Jail in Rohtak last month, the dera chief had claimed he had no role in the functioning or decision-making of the dera. He had claimed his role was confined to doing ‘satsang’ for the purpose of preaching dera’s ideology, said Parmar.On July 6, 2019, the dera chief was named as accused in the sacrilege incidents. Though the SIT had got the production warrants of the dera head to bring him from the Rohtak jail to Faridkot for questioning, as per the directions of the High Court, instead of bringing him here, the SIT had gone to the jail for questioning. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sit-to-quiz-2-functionaries-today-348352
10-12-2021||Saurabh Malik||Court puts to rest controversy over definition of ganja in Act||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 9Putting to rest a controversy over the meaning of ganja in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Punjab and Haryana High Court made it clear that flowering or fruiting tops of a cannabis plant would be considered ganja even when accompanied by seeds and leaves.The ruling by Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri came on two petitions where the counsel for the petitioners-accused claimed that the seized material was not ganja, but only ganja patti. As such, the petitioners were entitled to grant of bail.Referring to the provisions of the NDPS Act, the counsel had submitted that ganja was defined as “flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant excluding seeds and leaves”. The FSL report in the present case had, on the other hand, stated that the flowering/fruiting tops were found along with seeds etc. and as such, the confiscated material was not covered under the definition given in the Act.Justice Puri asserted: “A plain reading of the same would show that when flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant are present, even if they are accompanied by seeds and leaves, it would still be ganja and furthermore, by whatever name they may be known or designated. Therefore, the argument raised by the counsel for the petitioners is wholly unsustainable and contrary to the plain language incorporated by the legislature in Section 2 (iii) (b) of the NDPS Act,” Justice Puri asserted.Turning down the bail pleas, Justice Puri added the description of confiscated narcotic drug — greenish brown vegetative material having flowering/fruiting tops and seeds etc. — coupled with the opinion of the Forensic Science Laboratory identifying the material as ganja would fall within the definition contained in the NDPS Act.Justice Puri added the expression ganja patti used by the police would not confer any right upon the petitioners to escape from the definition of ganja, especially when the FSL report was of the opinion that the material was ganja. As the confiscated narcotic drug in the present case was of commercial quantity, the bar on granting bail under Section 37 of the NDPS Act would be attracted. No ground was available to the petitioners for making any departure from the bar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/court-puts-to-rest-controversy-over-definition-of-ganja-in-act-348353

The event has organised by Dal Khalsa to mark International Human Rights Day on Friday.On Saturday evening, a special unit of the Army mistakenly opened fire at a pick-up van carrying coal miners from the Tiru area to Oting village (about 15 km away), killing six on board. Seven more civilians and a soldier died when villagers, alarmed by the gunshots and the death of their brethren, clashed with the troops about an hour later.Neingulo Krome, secretary of the Nagaland organisation, said though the Centre had expressed grief and termed it as a case of mistaken identity, it was a totally fabricated botched operation that claimed innocent lives.“The ones who lost lives were local labourers who used to take the same route to reach their work place. After killing them, the forces also tried to brand some civilians as militants by planting weapons and dressing them in camouflage and boots,” he alleged.Former secretary general of the organisation Dr Veenuh said after the abolition of Article 370 and 35 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Centre had turned a blind eye to the rights of Nagaland residents.“In 2015, the Government of India led by PM Modi and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland had entered into an agreement to respect Naga people’s separate identification and existence for sharing the sovereign power to end the violent confrontation once and for all. It was recognised by the erstwhile Atal Bihari Vajpaee government too.

10-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers turn nostalgic, say protest sites were like home, will be lifelong memory||After spending over a year agitating against the three farm laws at three Delhi border points, many farmers became nostalgic as Samkyukta Kisan Morcha announced that thousands of protesters would start vacating the protest sites from December 11.Read also:Farmers call off agitation after Centre accepts their demands; to vacate Delhi borders from Dec 11Amrik Singh, aged around 65, from Patiala said he felt at home in his tent at Singhu border and thought of the possibility of leaving it with a heavy heart.“I don’t feel like leaving it all behind and all those memories of struggle, moments of joy and friendships we have formed,” he said.“It often occurs to me that I should rent a house here if the protest ends,” Singh added in a lighter vein.Riding hundreds of tractors and other vehicles, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the last week of November 2020 moved towards Delhi demanding repeal of three farm laws of the Narendra Modi government.Since November 26 last year, the farmers have laid siege at highways at Delhi’s border points at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikari setting up makeshift accommodation and arrangements of daily life.Saudagar Singh, a middle-aged farmer from Ludhiana, reminisced his struggles during the yearlong protests, narrating the bonds he forged and how many new friends he found at the protest site.“We thought the government will not listen to us and we will have to stay here. But finally we won and farm laws are gone. Now it’s time to go home and we are feeling awkward now,” he said.Preparing to go home, many farmer protesters said they will dispose of items of daily use and back carrying their personal belongings and vehicles.“There is not much to take back home. Most of it will be given to local people many of whom are regular visitors for us,” Saudagar Singh said.With the Centre repealing the three farm laws and accepting most of their demands, many protesters felt it was time to end the stir and go back home.Most felt their experience of protest at Singhu Border will be a lifelong memory and they will miss the place.“We have demanded a memorial for our farmer brothers who died during the protest. Once the memorial comes up here, we will visit this place again and again,” said another protester Harkeerat at Singhu border.The farmer unions claim over 700 farmers died at different places during the year long agitation against farm laws.The leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) were holding a meeting at Singhi border to consider the Centre’s written assurance to their other demands including withdrawal of police cases and compensation to kin of farmers died during the protests, before taking a call to end their stir.There were many protesters who were ready to stay at protest venue for many more days to come if their leaders wished so.“We have all the arrangements here. Also, we take turns to visit our home and come back again to join the protest. If needed, we can stay year for months and years,” said Kamalapati Baghi from Ayodhya.A young protester Balpreet Singh from Fathegarh Sahib said the protest might end but the struggles over pending issues of farmers will continue.“We gave them (Centre) an example of our resolve and hope they will listen to us more seriously now and meet our other demands, including legal guarantee of MSP of crops,” he said.The SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, on Thursday decided to suspend the farmers’ movement and announced that farmers will go back home on December 11 from the protest sites on Delhi’s borders.Farmer leaders said that they will again meet on January 15 to see if the government has fulfilled their demands.
