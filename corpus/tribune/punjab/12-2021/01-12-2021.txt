01-12-2021||New Delhi||AAP amps stand favouring MSP||With the assembly elections in five states, including Punjab where it has high stakes, in the offing, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday amped up its stand for statutory backing for MSP on agricultural produce.It cautioned the government not to drag feet on the farmers’ demands, including for legal status to MSP in the current session of Parliament.AAP’s Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha Sushil Gupta said outside Parliament that the Union government’s move to repeal the three contentious farm laws, albeit after a year of protests, is welcome, but it must not shroud other demands of the farmers, including a law on MSP.Besides, the government should consider compensation to families of farmers who lost their lives during the year-long protest, and withdraw criminal cases against large number of farmers for their participation in the protest.“There is no merit in continuing with the cases registered against the farmers when the government has conceded that the farm laws were not just,” Gupta said.The AAP has made an all-out effort to win the election in Punjab, and make a mark in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Goa which will also go to polls in February-March 2022.Parties have already waded into their political manoeuvring via these elections.With the ruling Congress in Punjab in tumult after quitting of Capt Amarinder Singh as chief minister in the wake of his sharp difference with party president Navjot Singh Sidhu, and now Sidhu’s alleged upmanship with incumbent Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, AAP sniffs a chance to win the election and form a government.Punjab was the epicentre of the farmers’ protest against the farm laws. The AAP had supported the protest.The party would not pass over further opportunity to endear itself among the farming community, even after annulment of the farm laws.“The AAP had supported the farmers’ demand, and will back them all through,” Gupta said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-amps-stand-favouring-msp-345172

Sikh Panth accepts this challenge and will meet it head on," the SAD said in a statement.It said that earlier a case was registered against Sirsa, SAD Delhi president Jathedar Harmeet Singh Kalka and 11 other members of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which was headed by Sirsa."But while all other members  lived up to the traditions of the Khalsa Panth in fighting repression, it is unfortunate that Sirsa buckled under pressure and betrayed the Khalsa Panth and spirit," it said."Khalsa Panth is too big for any individual. Individuals come and go. Khalsa Panth goes on and will go on forever," said the statement.  "It is clear that the enemies of the Panth can never win against the Sikh masses. So they always try to weaken the quom by resorting to these conspiracies…these conspiracies have always been defeated and will always be exposed and defeated in future also," it said.The Akali Dal leader also resigned as the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee chief just before joining the BJP in the presence of senior party leaders and Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.After the joining ceremony at the BJP headquarters, Sirsa met Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda.Sirsa has been a prominent face of the Akali Dal in the national capital and was a strong supporter of the farmers' protests against the three contentious farm laws. Parliament recently passed a bill to annul the three laws in what has been seen as the BJP's effort to placate the protesting farmers, a large number of whom are Sikhs from Punjab. After joining the party, Sirsa told the media, "I have always raised my voice for the issues related to Sikhs. I had a chat with Home Minister Amit Shah ji with regard to issues concerning Sikhs across the country. I am happy that not only did he talk to me but said that he wants to solve these issues and will raise them with the Prime Minister as well." Sirsa was considered a close aide of SAD chief Sukhbir Badal and was one of the party's most visible faces when it came to Sikh religion-related issues.His joining the saffron party ahead of 2022 Punjab polls is seen as a jolt to the SAD. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/he-betrayed-khalsa-panth-sad-after-manjinder-sirsa-joins-bjp-345163
01-12-2021||New Delhi||SKM condemns govt’s response in Parliament on compensation to kin of farmers who died during protest||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday condemned the Centre’s response in Parliament on compensation to the kin of farmers, who died during the protest against three agriculture laws, and reiterated its demand for financial assistance to the families of those deceased, an official statement said.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar reportedly said the government has no information about farmers’ deaths during the protest and therefore, the question of financial assistance does not arise.In the statement, the SKM alleged that the BJP government was trying to divide protesting farmers by not starting formal dialogue again and not responding formally to the letter sent by the SKM, reminding it about the pending demands.“The BJP government should stop attempting to divide farmers even at this stage. Farmers’ unions stand united and the Modi government should stop its continued divisive agenda. The SKM is awaiting formal communication with all required details from the government,” it said.Criticising the Union government’s response, the SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, said through such remarks the Centre continues to “insult” the huge sacrifices made by protesting farmers.“The SKM condemns the response of Government of India in Parliament where Narendra Singh Tomar in a written reply said that the government has no information about deaths in the farmers’ movement and therefore, question of financial assistance does not arise.“The SKM reiterates its demand for compensation and rehabilitation of the kin of more than 689 martyrs in the ongoing agitation,” the statement said.Senior farmer leader and SKM core committee member Shivkumar Sharma ‘Kakkaji’ alleged that the government was “lying” and running away from its responsibilities by making such remarks.“Teams of the Intelligence Bureau were collecting information from us about farmers who were martyred during the course of the movement but still the government is saying that they have no record of such deaths. It shows the government is lying in Parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to provide compensation to the families of deceased farmers,” Sharma told PTI.He said the government can also check with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) about farmers’ deaths during the agitation as they also collect data about all types of deaths in the country.The farmers’ body also clarified that the agitation is still continuing and no one is leaving protest sites.“Morchas around Delhi borders continue, with more tractor-trolleys reaching the protest sites and the struggle will continue. More farmers are coming so that everyone can go back together victorious,” the statement said.The SKM appealed to farmers not to believe falsehoods being spread about protests ending.It added that the SKM will hold its meeting on December 4, as announced earlier, and decide the future course of the agitation.On Monday, a bill was passed in Parliament to repeal the three contentious farm laws.Repeal of the farm laws was one of the main demands of the thousands of protesters. But the stalemate continues as their other demands such as legal guarantee on MSP, compensation to families of farmers who died during the movement and withdrawal of cases against them are still to be met.The Centre on Tuesday demanded five names from the SKM for a panel to deliberate on MSP and other issues.However, the SKM in a statement said that its leaders had received a phone call from the Centre on the issue but they were yet to get a formal communication in this connection.

01-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab exempts 1.5 lakh cases of traders from Form 'C' assessment||In a major reprieve to traders ahead of the assembly polls, the Punjab Cabinet on Wednesday decided to exempt about 1.50 lakh cases from assessment related to cases of 'C' form from 2014-15 to 2017-18.The decision would mean that about 8,500 would now be assessed under this category every year."This trader-friendly decision would cost Rs 200 crore to the state exchequer," an official statement said.To further boost trade and economic activity, the Cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Charanjit Channi, here also gave the approval to exempt the traders from making payment of 70 per cent of the excess demand and now they would be only required to deposit 30 per cent of the surplus demand.This decision would cost the state exchequer to Rs 940 crore. Subsequently, they would now be required to deposit the amount i.e. 20 of the 30 per cent portion of the additional demand by March 31, 2022, and the remaining 80 per cent by March 31, 2023.Notably, the state has taken these significant decisions to facilitate traders in the wake of the recent Covid-19 pandemic.Although it has been nearly four and a half years since the end of the VAT regime, there was still a heavy burden of VAT assessment on the traders coupled with difficulties in providing C-forms, etc., to them.The Cabinet also approved One-Time Settlement Policy-2021 for Punjab State Industrial Development Corp Ltd, Punjab Financial Corp and Punjab Agro Industries Corp for settlement of dues.The new policy will help resolve long-pending litigation and settlement between the corporations and the private investors, besides creating a more business-friendly environment in the state, said the statement.It also approved upgrading Gharuan (Mohali), Rajasansi (Amritsar) and Dorangla (Gurdaspur) as sub-tehsils.It gave ex-post facto approval for providing financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh each to the tune of total Rs 2 crore already paid by the state government to the families or legal heirs of the four farmers and one journalist who died in an incident in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh in October this year, from the Chief Minister Relief Fund.The Cabinet also accorded approval for the implementation of the Chief Minister Scholarship Scheme in Higher Education for government colleges.It would help the poor students, particularly of the general category, besides helping further improve the gross enrollment ratio in higher education which is very low at present.The scheme would involve an annual financial implication of Rs 36.05 crore.What is Form ‘C’?Since the end of the VAT regime, there was still a heavy burden of VAT assessment on the traders coupled with difficulties in providing C-forms etc. to them. Forms ‘C’s are used for filing returns against the tax already paid in interstate sale of goods.— With IANS inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gst-punjab-exempts-1-5-lakh-cases-from-form-c-assessment-345112

The farmers' demand of (legal guarantee for) MSP as well as other demands, the government should do justice to them," he said.Congress MP from Fatehgarh Sahib, Amar Singh, also demanded that a law be made providing legal guarantee for MSP.Rashtriya Loktantrik Party's Hanuman Beniwal demanded that the cases that had been filed against the farmers during the farm laws agitation be taken back.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha last month had written an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate resumption of talks with the government over their six demands, including a law guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) for all farmers.

The cops are investigating whether these men are linked to Sukhwinder.  “Questioning is still on. Clarity will emerge once we finish our investigation,” said an officer.On November 22, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts were put on a high alert after two motorcycle-borne men lobbed a low-intensity hand grenade at the army camp in Pathankot.Nanak Singh ruled out any link between Sukhwinder and those involved in the Pathankot grenade attack.    Rumours of various kinds were doing the rounds in Dinanagar after the news of the RDX seizure spread.

A team of the Rajasthan Police conducted a raid on November 26 and managed to rescue three hostages and nabbed the kingpin of the extortionists, identified as Arun Kumar Sharma (59), a native of Bihar.Though Ropar SSP Vivek Sheel Soni as well as Superintendent of Police (Investigation) HS Atwal feigned ignorance about the case, SP Vikas Pahtak from Kota in Rajasthan said three persons, including two belonging to Kota, were rescued by them from Muzafat village near Chamkaur Sahib.All three victims were in captivity of the accused for nearly a month as their relatives had not paid the ransom demanded by the accused. The victims were construction contractors who were taken to Ropar by the accused on a fake promise of landing them big contracts there, said the police.Pathak, the brother of a hostage, Devkinandan Sharma, had filed a complaint in Kota. According to the complainant, Devkinandan had left for Ropar on October 21 and his wife received a call from his mobile phone number last week demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh.On November 17, the police got a similar complaint from the family of another victim, Bharat Singh, alias Rinku. On investigation, both calls were traced to Muzafat village of Ropar district and a raid was conducted with the help of the local police, said the SSP.The police found that along with Devkinandan and Rinku, another victim Tapeshwar Mukhiya had been kept hostage by the accused.

It is expected to boast of the best of amenities, but the reality is otherwise. Common civic problems are far more pronounced here.There is hardly anything in the name of smart city. Except for some wall graffiti around BMC Chowk or PAP Chowk, there is hardly anything which can be shown as development work accomplished in the past almost five years.A rail over-bridge for a better connectivity of Ladhewali area was started by the PWD Department a few months ago, but barely 25 per cent of the work is completed yet. Open sewage pond spread on 4 acres in the Surya Enclave area has become residents’ bane. Nearly 6,500 residents of Old Jawahar Nagar have been complaining of water shortage for long. The constituency is also marred by the same old problems of streetlights and bad roads.Area MLA Rajinder Beri however, claims upgrading the government school at Chugitti as a fully AC school besides developing new parks in Chugitti and Chohakan. He also claims starting the repair of Dhilwan road, but the Opposition slams him for doing too little, too late.Past trendThe Congress and BJP have won four times each in the past eight polls.

The latest is a new Rs 170-crore sewerage system,” said Dr Satnam Singh Nijjar, chairman, Gurdaspur Planning Board.The three ruling party men who have interest in this seat are Cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Member of Parliament Partap Singh Bajwa and former legislator Ashwani Sekhri. All three are outdoing one another as far as ushering in new ventures is concerned.Tript Bajwa kick-started the development race by getting the Hansli drain brick-lined. Its capacity has been doubled which means the city no longer remains flood prone.The credit for laying the new sewerage system also goes to him. Likewise, Sekhri is also bringing new projects. Partap Bajwa has often taken up cudgels in Parliament on behalf of the area’s ailing industry.Past trendIn all polls held since 1985, Ashwani Sekhri remains the common factor. He won on three occasions and lost on four. The electoral battle has primarily revolved around the Congress, SAD and BJP.

The Local Government Department is yet to approve the general house’s proceedings of Sharma’s suspension of November 25.The MC general house had deemed the Mayor suspended after he got only 25 votes, while 36 members voted against him. The proceedings signed by Senior Deputy Mayor Yoginder Singh Yogi were sent to the department but Director, Local Government, Puneet Goyal said the office was deliberating upon the matter legally.Sharma said, “I have filed a petition in the court as the opposing councillors were supposed to prove no-confidence motion against me. They failed as they did not have the two-thirds majority, so my suspension as Mayor is wrong. I will continue to function till the matter is in the court.”He also issued orders on his official letterhead to Commissioner Vineet Kumar asking him to speed up work on the shifting of dairies.Yogi, who was given the officiating charge of Mayor by the general house, said: “The majority of the house had decided that he (Sharma) failed to prove majority, and thus suspended him. Today, he sat in the Mayor’s chair by violating the constitution of the house. In fact, the quorum of the general house is complete with the presence of more than half the councillors, but he has the confidence of less than the required number.”The MC Commissioner said the house proceedings were awaiting the approval of the department.

The assertion by Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri came in a case related to the alleged recovery of 100-kg poppy husk.The matter was brought to the HC notice after an accused filed a petition seeking anticipatory bail in a case registered on August 11 under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at the Mukandpur police station in Nawanshahr district.The petitioner’s counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated. His name was nominated on the basis of a disclosure statement made by a co-accused. As such, his case may be considered for the grant of anticipatory bail.The Bench, during the course of hearing, directed the state to file an affidavit on the petitioner’s antecedents. It was also asked to specify whether there was any other material available to connect the petitioner with the present recovery apart from the disclosure statement of a co-accused.An affidavit was filed by the DSP on behalf of the state. Referring to the affidavit, Deputy Advocate General Randhir Singh Thind submitted that 100-kg poppy husk was recovered from the co-accused. As such, the petitioner’s case was hit by the bar contained under Section 37 of the NDPS Act. Dismissing the petition, Justice Puri asserted it was not a case where sufficient material was unavailable with the prosecution to connect the petitioner with the present crime. It was also not a case where the prosecution was proceeding against the petitioner purely on the basis of disclosure statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-need-to-determine-source-of-narcotics-to-check-drug-menace-344866

However, the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee is adamant on taking legal action against them.Talking to The Tribune, Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee chief Ameer Singh said Pakistan Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Ahmad Khan Buzdar Rao had taken strong cognizance of the incident at the shrine which recently reopened. The case is being followed up by Pakistan Punjab IG Sardar Ali Khan.“The model and the firm have already tendered an apology for their folly, but we have already started the process for taking legal action so that such incidents are never repeated,” the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee chief said.He said a strong mechanism was being adopted to spread awareness among the visitors about the Sikh ‘rehat maryada’ (code of conduct) while visiting the shrine. Extra ‘sewadars’ were being deputed at the shrine to keep a watch on compliance of the norms, Ameer Singh said.Meanwhile, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa has expressed outrage over the pictures taken at the shrine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kartarpur-photoshoot-psgpc-to-take-legal-action-against-model-company-344854

He said it would help make the youth become job creators.Targeting SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Sidhu said the Akali government’s investment summit of 2015 could draw only Rs 6,650 crore from 46 companies despite signing 391 MoUs for Rs 1.20 lakh crore investments.He claimed five businessmen close to the Akalis had announced Rs 9,250 crore investment. “When these five did not trust the SAD’s investment summit, who else would?” he said, adding not even 5 per cent investment of what companies had promised was made.

In his reply, Tomar said: “There is no such proposal for setting up a new agricultural university in Punjab by the government”.Mann had also asked if the government had allocated funds to encourage education in agricultural universities located in Punjab, in reply to which Tomar said: “Financial support of Rs 110.30 crore has been provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, and Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, during the period of 2017-18 and till date for strengthening and development of the universities”.The question gains importance in the context that there was a talk in the academic circles, during the earlier years of the current state government, that the state had planned a new agricultural university on the patterns of GADVASU which came up in 2006. The PAU too had lost about one fourth of its campus and related administration activities.A section of the agriculture experts say that the university can consider the option of setting up new centres for areas such as horticulture, however it will not be wise to set to set up a new university.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-plan-to-set-up-agricultural-university-in-punjab-centre-344849

There will be a reckoning. It will either come from ourselves and our own conscience or it will come from our generations when they will ask that inconvenient question of what were we doing or what we did for those who fed us and for those who carried out the biggest democratic struggle of independent India. Let history judge us by our deeds and that, when the moment of reckoning arrived, we did not fear but boldly turned the tide,” read the letter.Reminding the PM about his announcement to withdraw the farm laws, Channi said the farmers and government had moved a step closer to resolving some major pending issues that had taken centre stage apart from the demand to repeal the three laws. The foremost, of course, being the issue of farm debt.CM Channi further said the farm leadership recently met him in Chandigarh with their demands and only one major issue that remained pending at his level was that of debt. “A glittering ray of hope has however shone after GoI’s changed stance,” he wrote.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-letter-to-pm-punjab-cm-channi-bats-for-farm-debt-waiver-344847

A day later, he played a cricket match and attended a function — both without a mask. Now, he is running fever and is yet to undergo Covid test.A family that came back from England two days ago to attend a wedding went shopping in Patiala and Ludhiana in addition to visiting all their relatives on their three-week trip to Punjab. Strangely, even the district administration or the health authorities have no information about their Covid status, as they are fully vaccinated.Report mandatoryFrom December 1, the Civil Aviation Ministry has directed all international travellers to submit 14-day travel history, negative RT-PCR report on the Air Suvidha portal as well as declare the Covid-19 test report.A fortnight after India decided to allow the entry of all foreign tourists following a decline in Covid-19 cases, hundreds of NRIs have come back to Punjab to attend weddings and other functions. With the increased pace of vaccination and state governments relaxing Covid-19 rules, the floodgates for weddings have opened up this season, despite the threat of a new variant, Omicron.After almost two dull seasons, the big fat weddings are back with a bang in the state. With no Covid protocols being followed, experts warn of greater risk at such events, especially with NRIs attending such events by ignoring norms.India has now allowed entry to fully inoculated tourists from 99 countries, including the UK, USA, Israel, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Kuwait, Colombia, Russia and Germany. These countries have recognised the Indian vaccination certificate and also allowed WHO-recognised vaccinated Indian travellers in their countries.While the Civil Aviation Ministry has released new guidelines in view of the Omicron variant, the district authorities have also advised caution to citizens in the region. With the NRIs coming to the region in large numbers on a regular basis, the state has asked the district health authorities to follow central government’s Covid norms.OP Soni, who holds health portfolio, said, “If international travellers test positive, then their samples are to be sent for genomic sequence test and they are to admitted to a separate isolation facility, where treatment will be as per the standard protocol. If the genomic testing is found positive for the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant, then a strict isolation and treatment protocol is to be followed.”“All district civil surgeons have been briefed and we will keep monitoring the NRI arrival.
