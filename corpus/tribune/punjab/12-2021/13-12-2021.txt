This movement has strengthened the brotherhood. Proving to be the younger brother of Punjab, Haryana strongly stood in support in every difficult time," said Dhami.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said, "Many difficulties were encountered during the farmers' morcha (agitation) but by the grace of the god, every difficulty was overcome." BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said he had vowed that after the “victory” of their agitation, he would return home after thanking the Guru at the Golden Temple.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha had last week decided to suspend their stir.

13-12-2021||Chandigarh||Channi will end up a ‘night watchman only’: Capt Amarinder||Former Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh Monday said he felt sad about the way Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi was being treated by the Congress party.He said despite having “tremendous potential”, the CM is being made to be subservient to the whims of State Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.“Channi will eventually end up as a night watchman only,” the former CM said.Reacting to the appointment of Sidhu as the Chairman of the Congress Election Committee for Punjab, Singh said it was “unprecedented” that a Chief Minister was made subservient to the PCC president.“No self respecting leader should accept such humiliation”, he said.Congress on Monday announced the formation of an election committee for the upcoming state assembly polls.Besides Channi, senior party leader Ambika Soni, former Punjab Congress chief and campaign committee chairman Sunil Jakhar, and chairman of manifesto committee Partap Singh Bajwa, are part of the committee, including many of the party’s Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs and state ministers.Amarinder, who floated his own party to contest the upcoming polls after his unceremonious exit as CM, was succeeded by Charanjit Singh Channi.He also accused the Congress of playing Dalit card by choosing Channi as the CM.“Was he just a showpiece to get the SC votes?” he asked.“Just because someone is behaving like a spoilt child and throwing tantrums day in and day out, you are submitting to all his blackmail and in the process insulting and humiliating your Chief Minister, who is doing a good job”, he said, adding, “the Congress is going down the dumps”.Punjab, where the Congress is seeking to retain power, will go to assembly polls early next year.

There is no place for such corrupt people in our party”.       AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet on Monday said that his party would never bring corrupt people into its fold.“Aam Aadmi Party is going to form the government in Punjab after a few months. That is why many leaders from other parties are approaching to join the Aam Aadmi Party. But we will never take corrupt and criminal leaders under any circumstances. We will give a clean and honest government in Punjab,” Kejriwal said in a tweet.AAP MP and Punjab state president Bhagwant Mann said, “Congress government is about to go. Only one month is left. That is why many of their big leaders are looting Punjab. We will not bring any dishonest leader in our party.”                  Interacting with the media in Kharar, Chief Minister Channi attacked Chadha for “spreading false rumours” and warned the party to “desist from mouthing lies in order to create unnecessary hype”.“The AAP only wants to create its nuisance value by indulging in misleading and malicious talk but these tactics would backfire,” the chief minister said.Assembly polls in Punjab are due early next year. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/raghav-chadha-claims-four-punjab-ministers-wanted-to-join-aap-but-were-refused-channi-hits-back-349899

If I had to fight for posts or positions, then I would not have left Rajya Sabha membership and chairman posts for my family.”Sidhu addressed a rally in Naruana village in Bathinda Rural assembly segment, in which he raised questions on his own government in the state over the sand, cotton compensation and other issues.Waving a copy of The Tribune newspaper in his hand in the rally, Sidhu said, “A report printed in The Tribune claims that sand is still selling at high price. Despite government orders, sand is selling at Rs 25 to 30 cubic ft, and till the time contract system is not ended, sand can’t be sold at a low price.”He also said Rs 17,000 per acre compensation has been announced for the cotton damaged due to pink bollworm attack, but why farmers are not getting it and farmers should get Rs 25,000 per acre compensation for the damage.Sidhu said the mafia has not ended yet in the state as Rs 200 liquor bottle is selling at Rs 1,000 in the state and money is going in the pocket of someone.The PPCC president said in the last 25 years, Punjab has faced huge losses, so it will be rectified in five years by implementing his Punjab model.Targeting Arvind Kejriwal and Sukhbir Badal, Sidhu said Kejriwal is a fraud person as in Delhi industry is being given power at Rs 13 per unit, whereas in Punjab it is quite low.He also claimed that when he was engaged in a fight against Majithia over drugs, Kejriwal cowardly sought an apology from Majithia.Sidhu said, “On coming to power, they will build a school on the Sukhvilas of Sukhbir Badal.”Talking to media-persons, Navjot Sidhu said, “The new CM has shown intent but he is not fully satisfied as we have to fulfil all our promises.”Sidhu also condemned the cane charge on protesting teachers during Chief Minister Charanjit Channi’s rally in Mansa a few days back.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/its-fight-between-punjab-and-mafia-in-this-poll-says-sidhu-349881

It has to be taken on a mission mode and the zero budget natural farming also. Very soon in near future, it (the committee) will be set up,” Agrawal told the media here.Agrawal was briefing about a three-day national event with focus on natural farming to be held at Anand, Gujarat, from December 14. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address virtually the valedictory function on December 16.Gujarat Chief Secretary Pankaj Kumar was also present virtually during the press conference.Asked what aspects of natural farming and if the outcome of the national event will be discussed in the proposed committee to be set up soon, the secretary said that the contours of the panel has not yet been decided.Modi on November 19 while announcing repeal of the three controversial farm laws, which had triggered a massive farmer protest at Delhi borders, had also said the government will set up a committee to make MSP more effective and transparent as well as suggest ways to promote zero budget natural farming.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh had staged relentless protests at Delhi borders against these three laws for over a year.The three farm laws were repealed in Parliament on November 29 but the stalemate continued as farmers sought government assurance on their other demands such as legal guarantee on MSP, compensation to families of farmers who died during the movement and withdrawal of cases against them.Protesting farmers agreed to suspend their agitation and return to their homes on December 11 after the government promised to fulfil their remaining demands.

13-12-2021||Milkha Singh Aulakh||Groundwater pollution: Need to make food production eco-friendly||The quantum jump in agricultural production in the past several decades has impacted human and animal health, environmental safety and climate in various ways. One of the most important challenges facing humanity today is to conserve and sustain natural resources, including water, for increasing food production while protecting the environment. As the global population grows, stress on natural resources increases, making it difficult to maintain food security. In recent years, efforts have increasingly been focused on environmental pollution and its ill effects on human and animal health.Groundwater quality depends upon geogenic and anthropogenic factors. There are naturally occurring minerals, which control the concentration of geogenic pollutants, such as arsenic, uranium, fluoride, boron and selenium in alluvial aquifers. However, naturally occurring pollutants such as selenium, fluoride, boron and arsenic in different regions do affect water quality for human and animal consumption. With the overdrafting and exploitation of groundwater from deep aquifers, the entry of these pollutants in the food chain is through the direct use of groundwater for drinking and/or irrigation purposes.ArsenicArsenic is poisonous, especially when present in high concentrations. People are exposed to arsenic most of the time through drinking groundwater, usually unknowingly. An investigation by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) revealed that arsenic concentration in alluvial aquifers of Punjab varied from 4 to 688 microgram per litre (µg/l). In groundwater of Zone I, comprising Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Ropar districts, arsenic varied from 4 to 42 µg/l. The concentration of arsenic in groundwater of Zone II, comprising Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana, Patiala, Mohali, Barnala and Moga districts, varied from 10 to 43 µg/l. In the arid southwestern zone (Zone III), comprising Sangrur, Mansa, Faridkot, Muktsar, Bathinda, and Ferozepur, arsenic concentrations varied from 11 to 688 µg/l. According to the safe limit of 10 µg/l, only 3% groundwater samples from Zone I and 1% from Zone II were fit for dinking purposes with respect to arsenic concentration. In Zone III, all water samples had arsenic concentrations of greater than the safe limits and thus were not suitable for drinking purposes.Studies suggest that regular monitoring of arsenic concentration in deep-tubewell waters by water-testing laboratories be done. Consumption of water with arsenic concentrations above the safe limit must be discouraged. In southwestern districts of Punjab, the use of canal water over groundwater is recommended after treatment for drinking purposes and domestic use by rural and urban populations.UraniumIn India, the average reported range of uranium in groundwater is from 0.01 to 19.6 µg/l. In Punjab, uranium content in groundwater ranges between 1.08 and 244 µg/l. The high values of uranium more than the permissible limit of 30 µg/l of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and 60 µg/l of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board occur at scattered places. High concentration hotspots are more common in the south-west parts of Punjab, lying in Bathinda, Faridkot, Moga and Ferozepur districts. However, such spots also occur at other places like around Amritsar, where sample containing 45.5 µg/l of uranium was reported. Canal water has very negligible concentration of uranium and is safe in this regard.FluorideBased on the total daily intake, the lowest fluoride concentration in drinking water that poses a risk of developing fluorosis is approximately 0.5 milligram per litre (mg/l) for dental fluorosis and 1.1 mg/l for skeletal fluorosis. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has given a guideline value of 1 mg/l for drinking water.High concentrations of fluoride, often significantly above the safe limit, constitute a severe problem in some semi-arid areas of Punjab. The use of groundwater for drinking in these areas has resulted in the onset of widespread fluorosis symptoms, from a mild form of dental fluorosis to crippling skeleton fluorosis. A PAU survey of groundwater samples of five blocks of Ludhiana district revealed that the fluoride concentration varied from 0 to 10.1 mg/l, suggesting that 3%, 5%, 9% and 38% of the total samples collected were high in fluoride concentration in Sidhwan bet, Ludhiana-I, Pakhowal and Jagraon blocks, respectively. Only about 9% samples from Ludhiana had fluoride concentration above the safe limit.BoronBoron is a constituent of practically all natural waters in concentrations varying from traces to tangible levels. It is essential for plant, animal and human growth, but is exceedingly toxic at concentrations only slightly above the optimum level.A PAU investigation reported that boron concentration in irrigation water samples of 100 villages in five development blocks of Bathinda district ranged from negligible to 5.75 mg/l. Considering the maximum permissible limit of 2 mg/l, 37% samples in Rampura, 15% in Nathana, 29% in Mansa, 44% in Budhlada and 22% in Phul block were high in boron.SeleniumIn Nawanshahr and Hoshiarpur districts, an area of about 1,000 hectares is affected by selenium toxicity. A PAU study determined the selenium quality of groundwater drawn from 90 tubewells located in this seleniferous region, which ranged between 0.25 and 69.5 µg/l with a mean of 4.7 µg/l. The maximum permissible limit of 10 µg/l for drinking purposes was exceeded by 11% of the tubewell water samples. Gypsum application resulted in substantial reduction in selenium content in wheat, maize, oats and sugarcane crops grown on such soils. Among tree species, poplar, eucalyptus, and mulberry have the potential for phyto-remediation of excessive selenium from the soil.Summing it up, in northwestern states of India, excessive use and mismanagement of groundwater are leading to contamination of groundwater and water bodies from geogenic sources, posing a great threat to the ecosystem. There is an urgent need to draft and implement a roadmap for minimising the depletion of groundwater and mitigating water pollution. Educating farmers and public at large about increasing food production while protecting the environment, and about the consequences of pumping out polluted water for drinking and domestic purposes, is desirable.The author is a former Senior Soil Scientist and Dean, PAUSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/features/groundwater-pollution-need-to-make-food-production-eco-friendly-349800

They have demanded a rollback of the proposed hike in the GST.Piara Lal Seth, president of the PPBM, said the GST rate on garments and footwear costing less than Rs1,000 per piece so far, would be hiked from 5 to 12%. “The move could only fuel inflation and traders are likely to see this change in cost overruns and low demand in the domestic and export markets,” he said.The MSME sector (micro, small and medium enterprises) of the textile industry, which is struggling with inadequate working capital, will be hardest hit by this blow. “We should not forget that the MSME sector provides most of the employment in the country after agriculture,” he observed.Sameer Jain, general secretary, PPBM, said factories and shops with stocks of cloth, garment and shoes will have to be sold at 12 per cent GST rate from January. So, they will have to increase prices of these commodities by 7% as they had taken its input credit by 5 per cent. Its entire burden will be passed on to the customers. The Central Government had collected a record GST collection of Rs 1.31 lakh crore in October and it is expected to increase in the coming months.The Shawl Club of India has also expressed concern over the increase in the GST of these articles, stating that shawl is a seasonal commodity and most of its sales and production are in hilly and cold areas like Jammu and Kashmir. The shawl is a labour-intensive product and the increase in the GST will affect both the domestic and export markets. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/proposed-hike-in-gst-may-up-prices-of-cloth-garments-349762

We now have someone in Moga, Ludhiana, Hoshiarpur, Mansa and Sangrur districts. Their year-long peaceful struggle has also taught us a lesson of keeping patience even in adverse conditions. Their departure left many locals emotional but we are glad and elevated over their triumph,” said a 67-year-old Baljeet Singh Dalal of Bahadurgarh town (Jhajjar), who provided water to farmers during the whole protest.Also read: Khap leader says Punjab, Haryana farmers can find way out on SYL tooLike Baljeet, many other locals, closely associated with the protest, believe that the agitation has succeeded to strengthen bonhomie between Haryana and Punjab to a large extent as it was for the first time when they spent such a long time with Punjabis and got an opportunity to understand, feel and share their pain over the condition of farmers.Baljeet said, “Punjab farmers realised the support we extended to them during the protest, hence they exchanged hugs with us before going back home. They clicked pictures with us for memory and exchanged their cell numbers with an invitation of coming to Punjab.”Virendra Hooda of Sanghi village (Rohtak) said, “No doubt, farmers of Punjab and Haryana have become life-time friends. The protest also ironed out all sorts of differences between people of both states. Their affection with us now can be gauged from the fact that some farmers have taken promises from us for coming to Punjab to attend weddings of their children. We have also taken the same from them to make this bond of brotherhood life-long.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/now-weve-lifelong-friends-in-punjab-locals-349653

A visit to the interiors is enough to prove that a lot of work still needs to be done. “Recovery of drugs from some nearby villages and complete politicisation of the police in Nabha has troubled us for long. Even for a minor accident case, the police waits for a political signal,” allege local residents Rajbir Singh and Jaspal Singh.

13-12-2021||---||Despite Punjab Govt claims, no drop in sand prices||Tribune News ServiceFaridkot, December 12All ‘attempts’ of the state government to curb the high prices of sand have come to naught in the area.Despite the government making tall claims of slashing sand prices and fixing these at Rs 5.5 per cubic feet last month and big-sized publicity hoardings dotting every nook and corner in this regard, the sand prices in the open market are sticking to the old rates of Rs 24 to Rs 26 per cubic feet.‘No relief to user’While the district administration in Faridkot claims it was strictly enforcing the state government instructions of selling the sand at Rs 5.5 per cubic feet at the sand pits and it was being sold between Rs 21.50 and Rs 23.52 per cubic feet in different towns of the district after including the transportation charges, the buyers in the area said they were still paying the same price.“We are unable to see any impact of the end of sand mafia as claimed by the government. What is the point of erecting big hoardings and billboards?” said most of the buyers constructing their houses.Vimal Setia, Deputy Commissioner, Faridkot, said there was no government-approved sand-mining site in the district and all sand being sold was brought from adjoining districts. The sand rates in different towns of the district have been fixed between Rs 21.50 and Rs 23.52 per cubic feet, he said. This included the transportation charges. These rates are Rs 21 per cubic feet at Faridkot and Golewala, Rs 22 at Kotkapura and Panjgrain, Rs 23 at Jaito and Sadiq and Rs 24 per cubic feet at Bajakhana. The claim notwithstanding, in the open market, sand is being sold between Rs 24 and Rs 26 per cubic feet.While one cubic feet of sand at the pit-end is Rs 5.5, the transportation charges are 300 to 350 per cent of its actual price. Though the state government in its policy on November 10 announced that a consumer was free to take his own transport, these vehicles are not allowed at the mining sites. “It is ‘transport mafia’ in place of ‘sand mafia’ now, and there is no relief to the end user,” said retail dealers in sand and gravel in Faridkot, preferring anonymity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/despite-govt-claims-no-drop-in-sand-prices-349571

The issue, however, has become a political albatross around the Channi government’s neck.Fulfil promiseWe were promised that the Land Ceiling Act will be implemented and excess land will be distributed to the landless. The CM is not for poor labourers, but the rich. — Lachman Sewewal, khet mazdoor unionIf the Channi government were to go ahead with the exercise, it would face the wrath of the powerful Jat Sikh community. Even after the government has decided to “hold back” the decision, the Jat Sikhs are now “wary of the intentions” of a non-Jat Chief Minister. It is after over four decades that the state has seen a non-Jat CM. Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu, when confronted on this issue today at a public function here, was also tightlipped.The government now also faces the wrath of some Left-oriented farmer unions, including BKU (Ugrahan) and farm labour organisations, which have been demanding redistribution of land. BKU (Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, the largest farmer union in the state, and Lachman Singh Sewewal of the Pendu Khet Mazdoor Union have now accused the Channi government of working under pressure of the “powerful” lobby of landowners.The decision to keep on hold its decision seeking details of all landowners, having over 17.5 standard acres of (cultivable irrigated) land and 52 standard acres of (barren) land, was taken late last evening. The letter, issued yesterday, within hours of the previous letter seeking details, says “no further action should be initiated in this regard”.Sources say the fresh instructions follow a massive backlash from the politically well-entrenched rich landlords as well as non-resident Indians (NRIs), who conveyed their displeasure to Jat leaders of the Congress. With the Assembly elections just weeks away, this has snowballed into a major political issue. It may be mentioned that no latest official data on landholding is available with the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/post-flak-govt-puts-land-order-on-hold-349573

Whatever responsibility they will put on my shoulders, I will deliver. But I will not take Punjab for a ride. But if anybody says I should shoulder responsibility and make govt, but after that sand, liquor and cable mafias continue to thrive, Sidhu will die rather than being a witness to all this.”“I have the guts to say no.

We are a democratic party…. This time it will not be about 5,000 promises.”Sidhu said Punjab would not change by offering lollipops and spreading lies. It needed vision and research-based policies for budgetary allocations, he said, referring to Rs 100 monthly cable connection fee announced by CM Charanjit Singh Channi. He was pointing to his revenue model of regulating the big players in the cable business.Without referring to himself as the most suitable candidate for the CM face in the Assembly elections, Sidhu urged the participants to use their moral authority to vote and not get influenced by false promises and manipulated voter’s surveys. “I have the power of honesty, and my devotion for Punjab,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-wont-be-showpiece-to-win-poll-349555

In the 2017 elections, the 18-39 age group comprised 53 per cent of the total electorate. Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala has joined the Congress. All set to contest from Mansa, he drew large crowds at a rally last week where the CM was present too.AAP has fielded two singers — Balkar Sidhu from Rampura Phul and Anmol Gagan Maan from Kharar. There is speculation it may field singer Balbir Chotian from the Bathinda-Rural constituency. Also, Bollywood actor Sonu Sood’s sister Malvika has announced she will be contesting from hometown Moga. Sonu Sood has held meetings with leaders of all major parties, but his sister is yet to join a party.The entry of singers in the electoral arena has made party workers aspiring for the party ticket uneasy. Moosewala faced a protest by Youth Congress workers as he got up to deliver a speech at the Mansa rally. That the CM was on the dais was no deterrent.In the past, several singers and artistes— Mohammad Sadiq, Hans Raj Hans, Gurpreet Ghuggi, Jassi Jasraj and Satwinder Bitti — have tried their luck in politics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/banking-on-singers-to-woo-youth-349556

As such, the state is not in its favour.”Thirteen states — Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana, Goa, Sikkim and Tripura — were yet to spell out their stand on the issue.Among the high courts, the ones in Sikkim and Tripura were in favour. Thirteen HCs, including those of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras, were against it, while six others wanted changes in the proposal.Two other HCs were yet to respond.

I have never even asked people for votes,” Sidhu said while responding to a question from whom on whether he would be named as the chief minister by the Congress if it wins the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls.He was speaking at a public discussion programme —“Bolda Punjab”— here.“Responsibility either makes you better or bitter. I have a bitter experience. I had a role in making three governments in Punjab. I was campaigning. But in this system, a good man is made a showpiece. He is only kept for winning elections.“I will never be a showpiece.... I will also never lie to the people of Punjab for coming to power. Can anyone say that I have ever lied? Because I have nothing to lose,” Sidhu said.Referring to his stint in the BJP before joining the Congress, he said he left a Rajya Sabha seat, was asked to contest elections from Kurukshetra and was also offered the post of Union information and broadcasting minister.“Then I was told that you become a face (of the Congress) in Delhi and was also told that I would be made a (party) general secretary by (late Congress leader) Ahmed Patel. I told him that had I wanted to become a (party) face in Delhi, I would have been a three-time minister in the BJP,” Sidhu said.He further said he was committed to Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.“I am committed to two people. I have seen them from very close and I have complete trust that they are good people and are not fake—Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi.“I gave my word to them and will stand by it.

13-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Punjab, Himachal, six other states oppose All India Judicial Service||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 12Thirteen high courts and eight states, including Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, have opposed the idea of having All India Judicial Service (AIJS) even as Haryana and Mizoram supported it.“In view of the existing divergence of opinion amongst the stakeholders, the Government is engaged in a consultative process with the stakeholders to arrive at a common ground,” Law Minister Kiren Rijiju has told the Lok Sabha.However, the Government maintained that a properly framed AIJS was important to strengthen overall justice delivery system as it will give an opportunity for induction of suitably qualified fresh legal talent selected through a proper all-India merit selection system as well as address the issue of social inclusion by enabling suitable representation to marginalised and deprived sections of society.According to a written reply given by the Law Minister on Friday, Haryana and Mizoram were the only states in favour of AIJS. “The proposal seems to be justified,” maintained Haryana.Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh were not in favour of AIJS while five states—Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Orissa and Uttarakhand wanted certain changes in the proposal.The Punjab Government said, “The State Government does not favour creation of AIJS.” Similarly, the Government of Himachal Pradesh maintained, “Keeping in view the ground realities, it will not be appropriate to have All India Judicial Service. As such, the State of Himachal Pradesh is not in favour of the creation of an All India Judicial Service.”The Madhya Pradesh Government said, “The State Government had earlier forwarded the comments of MP High Court. The High Court is not in favour of the formation of the All India Judicial Service.”Arunachal Pradesh said the proposal may not suit a tribal state, while Maharashtra favoured such recruitment only at the Judicial Magistrate First Class Level.Thirteen states—Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana, Goa, Sikkim and Tripura were yet to spell out their respective stand on the issue.Among the high courts, only the high courts of Sikkim and Tripura were in favour of creation of AIJS. Thirteen High Courts, including those of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras, were against it while six other high courts wanted changes in the proposal. Two other HCs were yet to respond. The Patna High Court said judicial services can’t be compared to civil services, while the high courts of Punjab & Haryana and Calcutta said the AIJS would be against federalism.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-himachal-six-other-states-oppose-all-india-judicial-service-349538
