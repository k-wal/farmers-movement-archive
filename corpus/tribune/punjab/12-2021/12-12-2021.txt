12-12-2021||New Delhi||How a job in Nehru’s team eluded ‘father of optics’ Narinder Singh Kapany||Jawaharlal Nehru had recommended the name of ‘father of fibre optics’ Narinder Singh Kapany for the post of scientific adviser to the defence ministry, but delay in the appointment process to “filter through the bureaucracy” ensured that the renowned US-based physicist’s future was not in India.Credited as the “man who bent light” and invented fibre optics, Kapany had a wish of telling his story himself. And one of the last things he did shortly before he passed away in December 2020 was to finish and submit the final manuscript of his memoir, which has now been published by Roli Books.In “The Man Who Bent Light: Narinder Singh Kapany, Father of Fibre Optics”, readers will also get to know his commitment to championing Sikh heritage and culture besides his contribution to science.Kapany, who was awarded the Padma Vibhushan earlier this year (posthumously), amassed one of the world’s largest collections of Sikh art and sponsored a number of exhibitions and permanent rooms in various museums around the world.He had about 100 patents and a similar number of publications and was the one to have used for the first time the term ‘fibre optics’ in an article published for the famed Scientific American publication in 1960.It was his pathbreaking research in the 1950s on fibre optics, which paved the way for high-speed broadband internet, laser surgeries and endoscopy, among others.It was during these years that Nehru wanted Kapany to work as the scientific adviser to the defence ministry.Kapany recalls how he met in the US Krishna Menon, who as defence minister was the nation’s second most important man at that time and a permanent delegate to the UN.“I’ve been following your career and I want you to work for me. In Delhi, at the Defence Department,” Menon told him.He paused again and said: “I want you to be my scientific adviser...” Kapany says he was extremely flattered by the offer.“But it wasn’t in any way part of my plan, which, wherever it might take me, would, I believed with all my inventor’s heart, definitely involve optical devices - inventing them, designing them, and manufacturing them,” he writes, adding Menon could sense his imminent resistance to his offer.But Menon cautioned Kapany not to make any hasty decision.Six months later, Kapany was in India for a vacation. Menon asked him to give a little talk at a Defence Service Conference.“There was an audience of about a thousand attendees at Menon’s Defence Service Conference on opening day. Highlighting that morning were opening remarks by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, a presentation by Menon himself, and another by Homi Bhabha, the head of India’s Atomic Energy Commission. Fourth on the printed program was another name: ‘Narinder Singh Kapany’. I could barely believe it,” Kapany recalls.Menon later told him that Nehru was very impressed with his talk and wanted to speak with him personally.“My hour with Mr Nehru was one of the most refreshing and personally rewarding hours I have ever spent. He seemed altogether understanding and interested in what I wanted to accomplish, both in science and with my life,” Kapany writes.“… And at some point in our quite disparate ramblings, I agreed to become Krishna Menon’s science advisor,” he says.As their talk-session was drawing to a close, and on Nehru’s urging, Kapany looked over his shoulder as he penned a note on official stationery to the Union Public Service Commission, the group in charge of the hiring of high-level Indian public servants.“In it, he recommended that I be given the position of Krishna Menon’s science adviser and be paid the highest possible salary for that level of government employment. Also, that I be given as much as six months to wrap up my affairs in America before starting the job in Delhi,” the book says.“He (Nehru) then signed the note, placed it in an envelope, addressed it, and laid it on top of some other envelopes on his desk. ‘I should warn you, though, Narinder,’ he said in closing, ‘that these higher-level appointments often take time to filter through the bureaucracy - two months possibly, or even longer’,” it says.Kapany told his wife Satinder: “I should have an official job offer in about two months though the prime minister cautioned that sometimes things take just a little longer.”He then told everyone in the US about the new plan and his direct recommendation from none other than Nehru.“But then, as two months became three, then four, then five, and still no job offer, I began getting nervous. I called the Union Public Service Commission, and they assured me that the offer was virtually a done deal,” Kapany writes.“By the end of month five, however, with our lease about to be up on the apartment and my work at the institute drawing to a close, Satinder and I decided that no news from India was simply fate telling me that my future was not in India, after all, but in America.“So just like that, I stopped thinking about the Indian position and concentrated all my energies, sizable as they were, on Silicon Valley in sunny California. It was time, finally, to become an entrepreneur,” he writes.About a month after they settled in their new home, a year since Nehru’s personal recommendation, the offer from the UPSC finally arrived.

12-12-2021||Guna (MP)||State govts to take decision on withdrawal of cases filed against farmers: Union minister Tomar||Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday said since law and order is a state subject, a decision on withdrawal of the cases registered against farmers during their anti-farm laws protest will be taken by the respective state governments.Talking to reporters, he also welcomed the farmers’ decision to call off the agitation.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an amalgamation of various farmer unions that spearheaded the protest against the three contentious farm laws, had on Thursday announced the suspension of its over a year-long agitation after they received a formal letter from the central government accepting their key pending demands including withdrawal of police cases against the protesters and on MSP.“The issue of law and order falls under the jurisdiction of state governments. So they will take a decision in this regard,” Tomar said when asked about the withdrawal of cases registered against the farmers during their agitation.The letter sent to the SKM by the Centre said the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana have agreed to withdraw cases against farmers with immediate effect. Cases registered against farmers in Delhi and other states will also be withdrawn, it added.Tomar said he has been in contact with the farmers’ leaders since the last more than a year.“I also talked to them today morning. We are saying that this is not a question of victory or defeat and you should also not see this issue like this,” he said.Responding to a question about the delay in taking a decision on the farmers’ agitation, Tomar said that this is not a hidden issue and everybody knows about it.“All farmers have welcomed the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which ensured the respect of the agriculturists. Now, farmers have ended their agitation and are returning home,” he said.On November 29, a bill was passed in Parliament to repeal the contentious farm laws, one of the main demands of the protesting farmers.In reply to another question, Tomar said the supply of fertilisers to farmers is being ensured.Addressing a programme later, the minister said that all the money released by the Centre for the people is reaching the beneficiaries as the role of middlemen has been eliminated.

12-12-2021||---||Government schools in Punjab are in bad shape, seek people’s support for improving them: Arvind Kejriwal||Chandigarh, December 12Scaling up the inter-state spat on school education, AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said government schools in Punjab are in a bad shape and sought people’s support to bring his party to power in the state to improve the condition of the educational institutions.“In Punjab, the state of education is very bad. Government schools are in a bad shape. There is no study at all in government schools. Punjab’s teachers are very good, but they are sad. In government schools in Punjab, 24 lakh students from poor, Dalit, SC community study. Think about what is the future of these children?” Kejriwal said in a video message.Punjab goes to polls early next year and Aam Aadmi Party is looking to wrest power from the ruling Congress.Notably, ruling Congress and AAP leaders have in recent weeks exchanged barbs on the state of education in their schools in Punjab and Delhi.Earlier this month, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi had called his Delhi counterpart Kejriwal a “power greedy outsider” who wants to rule the state and accused him of misleading Punjabis.In his video message, in which he spoke in Punjabi, Kejriwal said earlier the condition of government schools in Delhi was also pitiable, “but we improved their condition”.“Now, those schools have improved to such a level that this year 2.5 lakh students of Delhi shifted from private schools to take admission in our government schools,” he said.“Shouldn’t Punjab government schools be good like Delhi? But Channi sahib says that Punjab schools are very good when compared to the national-level and there is no need to improve them,” he said.Kejriwal asked the people whether they thought Punjab’s government schools were the best in India.Without naming anyone, he said, “For 75 years, these political leaders and parties deliberately kept the government schools in a bad shape so that the poor and (people from) SC brotherhood cannot progress”.“I don’t know politics, but I am worried about the future of 24 lakh students studying in Punjab government schools. We will not allow their future to be spoiled more. We will improve the condition of these schools and build grand ones.”                 “We will give a golden future to these children. We only need your support,” he told people of Punjab.In a bid to woo the Scheduled Caste community ahead of the Punjab assembly polls, Kejriwal during his visit to Hoshiarpur district had on Tuesday promised to provide free education to their children, besides bearing their coaching fees for higher studies, if his party comes to power.Punjab has nearly 32 per cent Dalit population.Kejriwal, who has in recent weeks increased his visits to the poll-bound state, asked the gathering to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party once, saying they had given many chances to rival political parties, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/government-schools-in-punjab-are-in-bad-shape-seek-peoples-support-for-improving-them-arvind-kejriwal-349501

By evening, it was all quiet at Singhu with most of the bamboo huts and tin sheds raised by the farmers on both sides of NH-44 gone. At Tikri too, the protest site was almost cleared.“We are glad we are going back home after winning a tough battle against the Union Government,” said Harjinder Singh of Amritsar. “Our Haryana brethren gave us love and support. We will never forget their kindness,” said an elderly farmer from Jagraon, Ludhiana. However, for slum dwellers, who for a year were served langar by the protesting farmers, it was a sad farewell. “This protest site was not only our bread and butter but also a place where we played with our friends,” said a 12-year-old ragpicker.People gathered at several places on the Delhi-Karnal-Ambala and Delhi-Hisar national highways as well as other routes, welcoming the farmers with garlands. At Khanauri in Punjab’s Sangrur district, villagers burst firecrackers. Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader Balbir Singh Rajewal was felicitated at the Shambhu border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/victorious-farmers-head-home-after-year-long-stir-given-warm-sendoff-349289
12-12-2021||---||Punjab Government moves Supreme Court over more powers to BSF||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 11The Punjab Government has moved the Supreme Court against the Centre’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in the state from 15 to 50 km along the Indo-Pak border, saying it went against federalism and will lead to chaos.‘Against Federalism’In its original suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution, the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government said, “Punjab is a small state, but has a very potent history and, therefore, its case and concerns are distinguishable and no reason can justify the extension of jurisdiction (of the BSF) to the belt of 50 km.”Noting that over 80 per cent areas of border districts and all major towns and cities, including district headquarters, would come under BSF’s jurisdiction, the Punjab Government submitted that the MHA’s decision “is likely to give rise to unrest among the populace, including peasantry which has to cross the bribed wire to cultivate their land along the border”. It termed the MHA’s decision a “unilateral declaration” without consulting the state and without conducting any consultative process.Contending that it can lead to chaos and conflict in trial of offences between law enforcement agencies, the state government has urged the top court to stay the October 11, 2021, notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs.It assailed the notification on the ground that it “defeats the purpose of Entry 1 and 2 of List-II of Schedule-7 of the Constitution of India and encroaches upon the plaintiff’s plenary authority to legislate on issues that relate to or are necessary for the maintenance of public order and internal peace”.Under Entry 1 and 2 of List-II (State List) of Schedule-7 of the Constitution, “public order” and “police” are enumerated as subjects on which states are empowered to make laws and exercise executive powers.“To this extent the defendant (MHA) has departed from the principle of federalism inasmuch as the defendant has no power to make any laws in respect of the matters enumerated in List-II of Schedule-7 of the Constitution of India,” it maintained. “The original suit filed by the Punjab Government was taken up for hearing on Friday by a registrar’s court that asked the Attorney General to respond to it and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks,” Punjab Advocate General DS Patwalia told The Tribune.After the filing of response by the Centre, the original suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution would be listed before a Bench for hearing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-moves-sc-over-more-powers-to-bsf-349290

He had, however, not named the BSP to be the beneficiary partner of any post.He also condemned the brutality inflicted on unemployed teachers yesterday by a DSP in the CM’s security team at Mansa.

On discrepancies in the GST and alleged harassment of industrialists, she said the matter would be taken up with the minister concerned.

12-12-2021||Patiala||PSPCL lists Rs125-cr deficit before regulator||The financial burden on the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has increased with recent Punjab Government announcements of subsidised/free power ahead of the Vidhan Sabha polls. The 2021-22 expenditure is estimated to reach around Rs 12,245 crore, up from Rs 10,621 crore.However, in its tariff petition for the year 2022-23, the PSPCL has projected a gap of Rs 125 crore only, in view of the poll season, claim experts.As per the annual revenue requirement (ARR) filed by the PSPCL, the gap of previous years amounts to Rs 1,611 crore thus making a total revenue gap of Rs 1,912 crore. The total ARR has been worked out Rs 36,484 crore and the revenue receipt on the basis of present approved tariff has been worked out as Rs 36,702 crore.As the power regulator always reduces the expenditure proposed by the PSPCL, there may not be any hike in power rates, despite the government reducing the prices. As per the ARR, the major expenditure is for power purchase. The purchase has been estimated at Rs 24,910 crore, including interstate transmission charges.The other major expenditure is of employees’ salary and pensions and this has been worked out at Rs 5,552 crore. However, in order to subdue the ARR in the election year, the PSPCL has not included any payments to employees against pay revisions. As per information, against pay revision, the total arrears will amount to about Rs 3,000-3,500 crore, of which around Rs 1,000 crore are payable in 2021-22 and balance in the coming years.Experts suggest the subsidy burden on the state government for subsidised power for 2021-22 is estimated at Rs 12,245 crore and for 2022-23 at Rs 13,929 crore .“Initially, the figure for 2021-22 was Rs 10,621 crore but the current pre-poll announcements by the government have resulted in additional burden of Rs 1,624 crore,” they said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pspcl-lists-125-cr-deficit-before-regulator-349275

Jagdish Singh Garcha has driven back to Punjab, but instead of a smooth passage, he is stopped by hundreds of farmers at Shambhu, the gateway to Punjab on the Delhi-Amritsar national highway. “We will not allow anyone enter Punjab without garlands, flower petals and loads of selfies. You are true warriors,” the crowd cheered as he got off his tractor on a bed of flowers.Minutes later, Garcha, along with his fellow villagers, is greeted warmly, and served hot tea, samosas and jalebis with religious hymns playing in the background. An emotional Garcha says the victory is a tribute to all farmers who lost their lives over the past one year of struggle.As hundreds of tractor-trailers entered Punjab, farmers on the Haryana-Punjab border erected gates and decorated these with flowers and flags, ready to welcome the hundreds who braved the cold, hot and rainy weather to raise their voice in support of farmers. As tractors continued to enter Punjab, huge traffic jams were witnessed on both sides of the highway all throughout the day.“In our village, everyone talked about the protests. It was a do-or-die situation. Now it is time to celebrate,” said 30-year-old farmer Rajinder Singh.With traffic snarl-ups stretching to several kilometres on both sides of the national highway, the commuters felt harassed as there was little the police could do to divert traffic. “We will finally be in our farms and in the comfort of our homes. It has been a long struggle,” said farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal.Meanwhile, a thanksgiving recitation of Guru Granth Sahib was started at the Golden Temple by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.

12-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Punjab moves SC against Centre's decision to extend BSF jurisdiction to 50 km||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 11The Punjab Government has moved the Supreme Court against the Centre’s decision to extend the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF) in the state from 15 to 50 km along Indo-Pak border, saying it went against federalism and will lead to chaos.In its original suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution, the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress Government said, “…geographically, the State of Punjab is a small state, but has a very potent history and, therefore, its case and concerns are distinguishable and no reason can justify the extension of jurisdiction (of BSF) to the belt of 50 kilometers.”Noting that more than 80% areas of the border districts and all major towns and cities, including all the district headquarters of Punjab would be covered under BSF’s jurisdiction, the Punjab Government submitted that the MHA’s decision “is likely to give rise to unrest among the populace, including peasantry which has to cross the bribed wire to cultivate their land along the border”.I congratulate Punjab and it’s legal team to be the 1st to approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court by filing an original suit challenging the notification extending the BSF jurisdiction.  Contending that it can lead to chaos and conflict in trial of offences between law enforcement agencies, the Punjab Government has urged the top court to stay the October 11, 2021 notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).“The original suit filed by the Punjab Government was taken up for hearing on Friday by a registrar’s court which asked the Attorney General to respond to it and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks,” Punjab Advocate General DS Patwalia told The Tribune.After the filing of response by the Centre, the original suit filed under Article 131 of the Constitution would be listed before a Bench for hearing.While the MHA notification extended the BSF’s jurisdiction from 15 to 50 km in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam, it reduced the same from 80 to 50 km in Gujarat. In Rajasthan the limit remained unchanged at 50 km.The Punjab Government termed the MHA’s decision a “unilateral declaration” without consulting the state and without conducting any consultative process.Maintaining that the concerns of Punjab are “totally different and distinguishable” from the geography and concerns of other border states and union territories, the Punjab Government complained that densely populated areas of the state have now been included in the jurisdiction of BSF.“In the case of Gujarat, most of the area falls in Kutch and saline marshes, whereas the areas in the State of Rajasthan is a desert land, permitting only sparse vegetation to sustain low populace in the relevant area to which jurisdiction of BSF has been extended,” it submitted.“In the case of Punjab, the area is highly fertile, heavily populated, and covers most of the physical areas forming part of the border districts of Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Fazilka, etc.,” it contended.It has assailed the notification on the ground that it “defeats the purpose of Entry 1 and 2 of List-II of Schedule-7 of the Constitution of India and encroaches upon the plaintiff’s plenary authority to legislate on issues which relate to or are necessary for maintenance of public order and internal peace”.Under Entry 1 and 2 of List-II (State List) of Schedule-7 of the Constitution, ‘public order’ and ‘police’ are enumerated as subjects on which states are empowered to make laws and exercise executive powers.“To this extent the defendant (MHA) has departed from the principle of federalism inasmuch as the defendant has no power to make any laws in respect of the matters enumerated in List-II of schedule-7 of the Constitution of India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-moves-sc-against-mhas-decision-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-to-50-km-349186
12-12-2021||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||Draft plan for Guerrilla operations during 1971 Indo-Pak war was prepared within 24 hours: Brig Sukhjit||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 11While recalling his service at the Directorate of Military Operations in 1971, Brig Sukhjit Singh (retd) on Saturday revealed that it was he who prepared the draft plan of Guerrilla operations in East Pakistan.Brig Singh later won the Maha Vir Chakra (MVC) for his role in the Battle of Basantar in the Shakargarh sector. He was Lt Col at that time. He was sharing his experience at the Military Lit Fest, which started today.His boss Lt Gen KK Singh asked him and his senior Lt Col Rai Singh Yadav to prepare a paper on Guerrilla operations. They were to report back at 7 am in morning. “We used our imagination and worked through the night. Those were the days of the typewriter,” he remembered.Lt Gen KK Singh, while going through their 30-page long paper, with a red pen either said nonsense or rubbish but noted each detail. “He redid it in a precise military language and reduced it to 12 pages.”The plan started taking its shape.“I was asked to contact Capt Oscar Stanley Dawson who later rose to Chief of Naval Staff. At that time, he was Director Naval Operations. Lt Gen KK Singh had underwater operations for Guerrillas (Mukti Bahini) in his mind,” said Brig Sukhjit.He added that when he met Capt Dawson in his room, there were a number of the officers present. But the message was to be sent across. So, he started asking him about his favourite dish in French cuisine during his naval tours to Europe. Though he named few, but Brig Sukhjit pressed him to tell about a very special dish. When Capt Dawson said frogs, Brig Sukhjit nodded, and this was how the message was sent across.Dawson was to provide training to Geurillas who later blew up enemy ships in East Pakistan under Operation Jackpot.Brig Sukhjit also revealed that while leading a tank column in Pathankot, a milkman led him to Dinanagar in Punjab. “He was going there only, so our whole regiment followed him. So a milkman led the regiment to a war zone,” said Brig Sukhjit.Lt Gen Depinder Singh (retd), who was military assistant to Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw in 1971, revealed about a meeting of PM Indira Gandhi, her ministers, and Manekshaw.The Chief of Army Staff wanted to delay the war but the ministers wanted an early start of the operations.“The Chief got up and went up to her table and said that if she liked him to resign, he would do it on mental health or something. She laughed and said Sam, of course not.”“She said you are right and will give you time. You take all the time and when you are ready, let me know. We can commence the operations,” said Lt Gen Depinder.For 13 days of the war, neither the PM or defence minister had questioned any single action by the Chief of Army Staff, he added.Former IAS officer SS Boparai, who won Kirti Chakra for his contributions in the 1971 war as Ferozepur DC, shared that the civil administration never said no to Army for any support right from digging an anti-tank ditch to fulfilling their entertainment needs.“While the first show was being inaugurated in a cinema hall in Fazilka, we heard the sounds as the war started,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/draft-plan-for-guerrilla-operations-during-1971-indo-pak-war-was-prepared-within-24-hours-brig-sukhjit-349185

12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Celebrations break out as Punjab, Haryana farmers head home after 'victory' of their protests||Farmers from Punjab and Haryana were accorded a rousing welcome with sweets and garlands at several points on their return journey on Saturday for the “victory” of their protests after the suspension of the agitation against the repealed farm laws.Families of farmers along with fellow villagers at many places on the Delhi-Karnal-Ambala and Delhi-Hisar national highways along with other state highways enroute were welcoming and honouring the peasants coming in tractor trolleys with garlands, ‘ladoos’, ‘barfi’ and other sweets.Villagers and others who supported the farmers’ agitation carrying farmer bodies’ flags showered petals on peasants as they assembled on the roadside of the highways to welcome them.Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal was given a warm welcome at the Shambhu border upon his return and he congratulated the farmers for their “victory”.  “I congratulate all the Punjabis and the countrymen. A big battle has been won... Also thanks to those who supported it (agitation),” said Rajewal while talking to reporters at the Shambhu border.“We have won the ‘morcha’... the central government was forced to bow down,” he said.Rajewal also said he remembered “sacrifices” of farmers in the fight against the Centre’s farm laws and paid tributes to them, adding that more than 700 farmers laid down their lives.A family came all the way from Chandigarh to welcome farmers near Singhu on the Delhi-Haryana border.“We are elated and our happiness cannot be described in words. It (the victory) was the result of ‘tapasya’ (penance) of farmers who faced all sorts of hardships, including harsh weather conditions,” said the Chandigarh resident who actively supported the farmers’ stir.Because of the large convoy of tractor trolleys and other vehicles, vehicular traffic slowed down at many places on Delhi-Ambala and Delhi-Rohtak national highways.Some elated farmers, especially youth and women, performed folk dance ‘bhangra’ to the beats of ‘dhol’ as they were on their way back to their homes in Punjab and Haryana.At Khanauri near Punjab, villagers assembled in large numbers to welcome the agitators and also burst firecrackers amid a celebratory mood.“We are returning victorious,” said a farmer from Ludhiana.Preparations to welcome farmers were made at different toll plazas and other places along the national highways.A large convoy of tractor trolleys started returning to Punjab and Haryana in the morning after performing ‘ardas’ (prayer) at the Singhu border.Farmers headed home after the suspension of the year-long agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws.Tractors decorated with flowers and colourful lights and sporting the national flag and farmer bodies’ flags were playing Punjabi victory and patriotic songs while frequent chants of ‘Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal’ rent the air.Tractor trolleys were carrying cots, mattresses, utensils and other belongings that the farmers had carried with them during the agitation.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana even hugged each other and raised slogans of ‘Punjab aur Haryana Bhaichara Zindabad’. Farmers said the brotherhood and bond between farmers of both the states have further got stronger because of the protests.Many farmers from Punjab have expressed their gratitude to the people of Haryana for extending support to them during the stir.Some farmers, including women, were dancing and performing ‘bhangra’ at the Shambhu border to welcome the agriculturists.Near Bastara toll plaza in Karnal and at Shambhu border near Ambala, an arrangement of ‘langar’ was made for farmers returning to their homes.Notably, Shambhu inter-state border on the national highway was the place where the Haryana police last year on November 26 had used water cannons and tear gas to prevent farmers from heading towards the national capital.Meanwhile, two farmers from Punjab returning to their homes in Muktsar district on Saturday from the Tikri border were killed while another one was injured when the tractor trolley they were travelling in was hit by a truck from behind in Haryana’s Hisar district, police said.The Haryana Police had made arrangements to ensure hassle-free movement of traffic on national highways in the state.A Haryana Police spokesperson on Friday had said the district Superintendents of Police have been instructed to ensure appropriate traffic, security, and law and order arrangements to ensure smooth flow of traffic in all districts between Delhi and Ambala, and Bahadurgarh and Hisar/Jind.The Samyuka Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmers’ unions, on Thursday had decided to suspend the over a year-long farmers’ movement against the three contentious farm laws and announced that farmers would go back home on December 11 from the protest sites on Delhi’s borders.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, started protesting at Delhi border points on November 26 last year against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.
