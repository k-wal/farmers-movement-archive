17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab-born German writer Rajvinder Singh passes away||Punjab-born German writer and four-time Poet-Laureate, Rajvinder Singh, passed away at a hospital in Berlin after a brief illness, his family said. He was 66 years old.He is survived by his wife and a daughter.Based in Berlin since January 1981, the bearded Rajvinder Singh’s latest project was to make literature in modern Indian languages accessible to the wider world through translations.To this end, he was translating the Punjabi novel ‘Parsa’, by Gyanpeeth award winning novelist Gurdial Singh, into German.And, for getting the hang of the Malwai Punjabi culture and the Malwai dialect of the Punjabi language, in which almost all of Gurdial Singh’s books are written, Rajvinder Singh was visiting the places around which the novel revolves.This three-time German poet laureate, who has been lauded for enriching the German vocabulary, said that it will be more than a word-to-word translation of the 380-page ‘Parsa’, penned in 1991.Rajvinder Singh, who wrote his Ph.D thesis in semiotics at Berlin’s Technical University, held that translating from Punjabi to German was not an easy task. Both the languages have completely different dictions.“Parsa is the rarest of the rare novels. It revolves around the complex simplicity of village life, with the inroads of all that goes with it. It showcases how traditions and cultures determine the life of a man,” Rajvinder Singh had told IANS in one of his interviews.“Translation itself is a herculean task, especially when the expressions are written in a colloquial style,” Rajvinder Singh, who in addition to German and Punjabi, was also writing in English, Hindi and Urdu. He was also a former National Fellow of the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) in Shimla.“The basic purpose of my translation is to showcase Indian literature in world literary circles. It’s simply the dominance of Indian English writings over the other Indian language writings that is preventing the multi-dimensional literary works from 23 Indian regional languages getting global recognition,” he had said.Rajvinder Singh, who was born in Punjab’s Kapurthala town and had spent his initial years also in Chandigarh and Jammu, occupied a pretty prominent place in the German literary circles.His poems are inscribed in stone, and are displayed at four public places, which include the city park and three senior schools in Trier, one of the oldest German cities where Karl Marx was born and brought up.Rajvinder Singh was the only living poet, certainly the only living Indian poet whose verses have been cast in stone and displayed in public park and schools.Taking a clue from Guru Nanak’s philosophy of dialogue, Rajvinder Singh, who was twice invited by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier when he was the Foreign Minister during 2005-09 and 2013-17 to join him on his official visits to India, and he did accompany him, had put the socio-cultural exchange as central and indeed foundational to the larger cultural and socio-political understanding amongst various nations and political entities.“The Sikh social worldview teaches us to go beyond our personal ‘self-ness’ and care about the ‘other-ness’ as well,” the poet and dubbing actor had told IANS.To promote an Indo-German dialogue amongst the youth, Rajvinder Singh had created Indo-German School Partnerships back in 2005 and had brought them to India many times. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-born-german-writer-rajvinder-singh-passes-away-351507
17-12-2021||Chandigarh||Congress has no moral right to seek votes, it failed to fulfil promises: Bhagwant Mann||AAP’s Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann on Friday said the Congress has no moral right to seek votes for the upcoming Assembly polls as it failed to honour its 2017 election promises. He accused the ruling party of being “disrespectful” towards the mandate given by people by not keeping its promises. The Sangrur MP claimed that Congress leaders did nothing in Punjab in the past five years.“That is why today 75 per cent of Punjab is staging strikes on roads, squares, water tanks and towers,” he told reporters.Mann said the state government has become a “spectacle” as Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi does not get along with party leader Sunil Jakhar, who does not get along with another leader Partap Singh Bajwa.“While Navjot Sidhu doesn’t get along with anyone,” he said, adding that the Congress leaders “fighting” among themselves cannot give a better future to Punjab and its people.Mann said the Congress has “trampled” on the mandate of people.“The Congress has also made a mockery of the government. No one knows who is running the government in Punjab. Officers are transferred overnight. The advocate general and the director general of police have been changed twice,” he said.Meanwhile, AAP launched an election campaign, “Nawan Ate Sunehra Punjab”.AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal announced this new campaign by releasing a video on Friday. In a statement, Kejriwal called upon people to come together in this mission for the progress and prosperity of the state and also issued a missed call number to join the campaign. Kejriwal said, “Today, we are starting our mission ‘Nawan ate Sunehra Punjab’ for the prosperity and progress of Punjab. This mission will contribute to the progress of Punjab.”“Through this mission, we all together will change Punjab and make plans for the development of the state. Power, water, agriculture, trade and all other issues will be discussed with people in detail, and on the basis of discussions, a plan for change will be prepared,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-has-no-moral-right-to-seek-votes-it-failed-to-fulfil-promises-bhagwant-mann-351501

As per the seat-sharing arrangement, the Mayawati-led party will fight 20 of the 117 Assembly seats in Punjab while the rest will be contested by the SAD.Taking on AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, the CM dared him to explain why Punjabis should believe him when his own “flock does not have faith in him”. He claimed three of four AAP MPs elected in 2014 have left the party and even 11 out of 20 MLAs elected in 2017 have too left.Channi said this is indicative of the fact that the Aam Aadmi Party is a “house of cards that is bound to doom in a day or two”.The chief minister said Kejriwal has no basic knowledge about the state due to which he does not know that in Punjab, every youth has to do multitasking every day for running his household. Kejriwal does not even know how to milk a cow, what does he know about problems of the state, Channi said. Terming AAP the “modern East India Company”, he said Kejriwal’s party aims at “plundering wealth of the state”.Channi said he himself faced hardships, so he is well aware of problems of the common man. Due to this reason only, he is ensuring optimal utilisation of all government funds for the wellbeing of the poor and common man, he claimed.Addressing the gathering, former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar urged people not to vote by falling in the “malicious” propaganda of any party.“Those leaders who are teaching the lesson of nationalism to us today were nowhere in scene when India was fighting for freedom and only the Congress Party did the fighting,” he added.In his address, AICC general secretary Harish Chaudhary slammed the Akalis, the BJP and the AAP leadership for working against the interest of the state. He said Channi is the representative of the poorest of poor in the state. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bsp-leadership-sold-party-to-sad-aap-modern-east-india-company-channi-351493

We have already clarified that we are here to fight for farmers’ rights and not for any politics. We would not support any political party and our members are free to vote for any party they want,” said Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president of BKU Ugrahan, after a state-level meeting at Bhotna village of the district.Their main demands include Rs 17,000 per acre financial aid to farmers, who have suffered crop losses and its 10 per cent payment to labourers, guarantee of Rs 360 per quintal of sugarcane from each sugar mill, Rs 3 lakh financial aid to families of labourers and farmers, who have died by suicide and complete debt waiver to them and a government job, cancellation of FIRs registered against protesting farmers, Rs 5 lakh financial aid to farmers and labourers, who died during New Delhi agitation and a government job to their families and quick release of tubewell connections to farmers.“The farmers are already in agitation mode and they have only taken a rest of few days. We have decided our agitation plan as per the demand of farmers,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of BKU (Ugrahan).The other demands include registration of an FIR against police officials, who allegedly cane-charged protesting unemployed teachers during the Mansa rally of Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi some days back, rollback of hike in toll plaza charges and adequate supply of Urea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-rest-of-few-days-bku-ugrahan-announces-five-days-agitation-in-front-of-dc-offices-351473

I asked how many of them had labour cards to which they said officials demanded money,” he said.“You cannot give benefits of government schemes if you do not know who the recipient is,” he said.Sidhu pointed out the hardships faced by daily-wagers in the wake of rising cost of essential commodities.The Punjab Assembly polls are due early next year.

If at all, the unions should throw their own hat in the ring and contest the elections.Of 32, 25 invited, 22 participateThis was the feeling of a majority of the 22 farmer unions, all part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), who met at an undisclosed destination at Samrala in Ludhiana today.Of the 32 kisan unions that are part of the morcha, only 25 had been invited for the meeting, following differences between BKU Rajewal president Balbir Singh Rajewal and BKU Sidhupur chief Jagjit Singh Dallewal, threatening the historic unity of 32 farmer unions of Punjab.Seven constituents of the SKM — Krantikari Kisan Union, BKU Krantikari, Azad Kisan Committee Doaba, BKU Sidhupur, Lok Bhalai Welfare Insaf Committee, Ganna Sangharsh Committee Dasuya and Jai Kisan Andolan — had not been called for the meeting, and at least three others reportedly could not make it because of “prior commitments” and “felicitation functions” to commemorate the win of the year-long struggle.These seven unions held a separate meeting today. Jagjit Singh Dallewal of the BKU Sidhupur told The Tribune that their meeting was not called to discuss the political scenario in the state or to extend political support, but only to chalk out the plan for their march to Harmandar Sahib in Amritsar on Friday, to pay their obeisance.Sources say during discussions on the scheduled meeting of SKM representatives with the Centre on the issue of assured minimum support price next month, the role of the farmer unions in the upcoming elections was also taken up at the meeting of 22 unions called by Rajewal.A majority of leaders reportedly gave a feedback that the unions should not support the traditional political parties, “as people are fed up with their inability to keep promises and misgovernance”, a union leader present at the meeting told The Tribune.Sources said the recent verbal public spat between Rajewal and Dallewal was also discussed. Efforts are on by some farmer leaders to soothe “frayed nerves”, and ensure the SKM does not split. A meeting of all 32 kisan unions has now been called on December 18 at Mullanpur (Ludhiana) to resolve all issues and take a joint decision on the political foray of the kisan unions, said Prem Singh Bhangu, president of the All-India Kisan Sabha.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wont-back-parties-to-contest-if-needed-unions-351131

However, information gathered by The Tribune reveals that “PPAs are yet to be cancelled” and all three private thermal plants continue to receive payments and supply power to Punjab.Promotion before action?Sources within the government claimed that the Public Relations (PR) Department had spent crores in projecting that the state government had “cancelled all expensive PPAs”. “Hoardings, boards and poles have already been put up across the state, featuring a photo of Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, claiming that all agreements have been cancelled,” they said.However, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) continues to buy power from all three thermal plants, to meet the demand of around 7000 MW, an official claimed.Till three days ago, Talwandi Sabo and GVK were running at half load due to their limited coal stock while one unit of the Rajpura thermal plant was under maintenance and the second was supplying at full load.It has been a month since Channi approved PSPCL’s proposal to terminate GVK Goindwal Sahib (2x270 MW) Power Purchase Agreement after it served a preliminary default notice to the plant on October 30, for cancellation of the PPA due to high power cost and low ranking in the merit order. “This step has been taken to safeguard the interest of consumers by way of reducing the burden of costly power,” Channi had claimed after the termination notice was served.However, GVK had challenged the termination notice and is still supplying power, shut only due to coal paucity.“The GVK was supplying power till its coal stock exhausted a day back and is shut now till stocks arrive. The other two thermal plants, including a state owned, are supplying power,” confirmed CMD A Venu Prasad. On the issue of termination notice served to GVK, Prasad said: “They have three months for consultation”.Former minister Bikram Majithia said the Channi government was trying to befool the people with false claims.AAP senior leader Harpal Cheema said the government could not hide its failure in termination of contracts with private plants. While two Cabinet ministers and a MLA refused to comment on the issue, a senior Congress leader said power rates were reduced by Rs 3 already and it was a matter of time when such PPAs would be scrapped.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ppas-cancelled-pspcl-still-buying-power-from-plants-351135

Community leaders had for long been demanding an increase in the number of burial grounds. The CM said he had instructed officials in all districts to scout for vacant government land where more cemeteries could be established.He also announced the setting up a ‘Bible Chair’ at Guru Nanak Dev University where students could have a meaningful understanding of the Christian faith, its history and practices.Christian community centres will also be constructed in all districts. Since Independence, Christians in the state had been voting en bloc for the Congress. However, post 2017, with the emergence of AAP, a substantial shift of voters to the party was noticed.“This time, all 117 seats will see a four-cornered battle. In such a scenario, the winning margins will be narrow. Even a slight swing of Christian votes to the Congress can turn out to be the deciding factor,” said a senior Congress leader. Earlier, moments after his chopper landed near the grain market, Channi surprised everyone by insisting on paying a visit to the Civil Hospital to check if any expired medicines were being sold.Meanwhile, in Ludhiana, CM Channi said the government would soon complete the process of regularising services of ‘safai sewaks’ in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-gurdaspur-channi-promises-more-cemeteries-bible-chair-351137

It will generate employment opportunities and in turn curb drug addiction, which is rampant in the region, they feel.Past trendThe seat used to be the stronghold of the Left due to its proximity to Chheharta, an erstwhile textile hub. SAD’s Tara Singh ended the Left control in 1985. Akali leader Gulzar Singh Ranike won the previous editions of the Assembly elections in 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1,83,204Male - 98,592Female -  84,607Third gender - 5Locals’ key demandsFurther, a shuttle service between historic sites such as Pull Kankari and Samadh of General Sham Singh Attariwala to the city will boost tourism. The local mini primary health centre (PHC) was proposed to be elevated to a full-fledged PHC but it has only remained on paper. With no regular doctor at the centre, residents demand adequate staff at the facility.Since 1985, Attari has largely been a Panthic constituency, with 1992 and 2017 elections as exceptions. With the SAD tying up with the BSP and the Congress banking on Dalit CM Charanjit Singh Channi, a keen contest is on the cards in the reserved seat this time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/banking-on-resumption-of-trade-351140

Don’t ask us about development, it’s a very touchy subject for us,” comes the often repeated quip from many residents when asked about growth in their constituency in the past few years. Currently, bad roads and shoddy patchwork are among the grouses that residents in the constituency have.

On the other hand, the tax of ordinary buses has been slightly decreased, from Rs 2.69 paise per km/per day (per vehicle) to Rs 2.56 paise per km/per day.Besides other transporters, the bus companies owned by the Badals plied super integral coaches from different towns in Punjab to Chandigarh under a reciprocal agreement with the Chandigarh Administration, signed during the tenure of the previous Akali government in 2008.“A total of 73 permits of integral coaches had been issued in the state. Of these, most of the permits belong to transport companies owned by the Badals,” Transport Minister Amrinder Raja Warring said.The minister said in the monopolistic luxury buses business, the road tax had not been increased. “The department has also issued show-cause notice to the stakeholders under the inter-state reciprocal agreement with the Chandigarh Administration to run buses between the UT and different towns in Punjab,” said the minister.JS Grewal, general secretary, Small-Scale District Bus Operators Association, said while regulating the big private players, the small bus operators were at the receiving end and needed urgent measures by the state government to rehabilitate them.“The government needs to exempt the motor vehicles tax from January 2021 to March 31, 2022, on operators having a fleet of buses not more than 10,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/govt-hikes-tax-on-luxury-buses-351144

VK Seth, director airport, said, “They are still waiting for the required equipment to arrive, after which the problem would be completely resolved.” He added that CAT-II and CAT-III systems were defunct at the present and they only had CAT-I system functional.Meanwhile, passengers faced heavy inconvenience as their flights did not reach the desired destinations. While several of them were off boarded at New Delhi, others had to wait for resumption of normal air traffic.They complained that the airport authorities had no system in place to provide comfort, alternate travel arrangements or other facilities to the passengers who had faced difficulties due to an administrative fault on part of the airport authorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fog-snag-hit-24-flights-in-amritsar-351145

Nationalised banks have played a major role in the development of agriculture, small trade, small business, transport and uplift of weaker sections of the society. Way back in 2008 when the world economy was plunged into a deep financial crisis and meltdown, it was PSBs, which helped the Indian economy to sustain and privatising them means handing over people’s money to private vested interests.”“Bad Loans and NPAs in the banks have been increasing each year because of corporate defaulters. Instead of taking action on them, the government wants to white wash the balance sheets by shifting these bad loans from the books of the banks. This will only benefit corporate defaulters and remove all bad loans from public glare and silently write them off,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bank-employees-strike-work-351146

With the work suspended, treatment of cancer patients visiting the NCD clinic situated on the premises of the Civil Hospital, Bathinda, is getting affected. Besides Bathinda, patients from other districts of south Malwa region and adjoining districts of Haryana and Rajasthan also visit the OPD and IPD sections of the NCD clinic for treatment.Notably, under the Centre’s National Health Mission (NHM) programme, free treatment is provided at the NCD (non-communicable diseases) clinics established under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) scheme.As per the scheme, patients do not have to pay even for medicine here. Cancer patients get examined, get chemotherapies done, and are administered medicines and blood transfusion here. Two doctors, four staff nurses, two lab technicians, one counsellor and a clerical staff have suspended work. As a result, the NCD unit is lying non-functional for the past one month. The unit here provides treatment for diabetes and BP patients too. Started in 2011, the NCD unit here received an average of 25 to 40 patients at its OPD.Gagandeep Kaur, attendant of Palwinder Kaur (65), a breast cancer patient from Jhumba village, said, “We got two cycles of chemotherapy done at the NCD clinic but after the strike, we had to go to a private hospital, which charged us exorbitantly for the chemotherapy, medicines and other treatment expenses. She is a stage-3 patient and since her condition had started improving, we cannot afford to discontinue her treatment at this juncture. She needs to undergo eight more chemotherapy sessions. We are from a humble family and cannot afford to bear the expensive treatment but will have to manage somehow.”Amar Kaur, wife of Amandeep Singh, a 29-years-old cancer patient from Bareta in Mansa district, said, “We had been getting treatment at the NCD clinic for the past two years. But with the strike on, now we are forced to seek treatment elsewhere where we have to pay for medicines and other treatment charges.”Sources said an Advanced Cancer Hospital is also located in Bathinda but patients who cannot afford to pay often opt for the NCD clinic.Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon, Civil Surgeon, Bathinda, said, “Overall work has got affected due to the strike by staff members. We have asked the Advanced Cancer Institute authorities to provide treatment to cancer patients sent from the Civil Hospital.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-end-to-nhm-staffs-stir-cancer-patients-suffer-351148

They came to India under a treaty, but were now asking that the law of prison in India should be made applicable to them.One of the petitioners was convicted of brutally murdering his wife and her family by burning them alive in the UK in September 2004 to continue his affair with another woman. Justice Sant Parkash added it was clear from the provisions of the Punjab Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act and the Indo-UK TSP agreement that parole cases of the petitioners repatriated from the UK and other foreign countries were to be considered as per the provisions of agreement of repatriation arrived at between the foreign country concerned and the Government of India.“Thus, the irresistible and unerring conclusion can be drawn that parole cases of the petitioners are to be governed by the terms and conditions of the Indo-UK agreement,” Justice Sant Parkash asserted.Referring to the sentence order, Justice Sant Parkash asserted the petitioners could be released only after undergoing minimum prescribed sentences. An Article of the Indo-UK TSP agreement also made it clear the receiving state was bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the transferring state.As such, the state authorities were merely the custodian of such convict located/ placed in a jail within the territorial jurisdiction of the state of Punjab. The limited role of a state authority/designated officer was to receive and hold in the custody.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-pacts-terms-to-apply-on-convicts-transferred-from-uk-351155
