I have to work for the welfare of common people and likewise our police force too has to work for their welfare,” he said.He said if any criminal element raises an evil eye against the police force, or if anyone speaks against them and uses any wrong language, then he considers it being done against him and his government.Hailing the Punjab Police for maintaining peace, law and order and earlier eliminating terrorism in the state, Channi said the sight of a Punjab policeman instils fear in criminals.“Those who are criminals and anti-social elements, their pants become wet on seeing a Punjab policeman,” said Channi.Channi said he wants to tell anti-national elements and those trying to spread anarchy by carrying out bomb blasts that the Punjab Police is that force which eliminated terrorism from the state and which has always “defeated nefarious designs of inimical forces by even not caring about their own lives”.He told police to ensure that no innocent is ever harassed whereas, anyone who is criminal or has done anything wrong, he should be dealt with as per law.                 Channi also announced a slew of incentives for police personnel.The chief minister said the service in armed forces and police is a challenging job and only those people who have zeal to serve the country and its people join these forces.He said the state government fully recognises the immense contribution of the Punjab Police in socio-economic development of the state and added that no stone will be left unturned for the welfare of police personnel.Channi, accepting a major demand of the police personnel, announced to restart uniform allowance from coming year, for which expenses will be borne by the government.He announced free travel for on duty cop in government buses.The Chief Minister said the bomb disposal unit of police put their life in peril during discharge of duty, so the state government will provide risk allowance to them.He also announced to enhance the diet money for sportsmen in the Punjab Police from existing Rs 150 to Rs 250 per day during camps.Channi also announced ground renovation in the PAP campus at a cost of Rs 1 crore to boost sports.Channi said Police Sanjh Kendras will be opened at Amritsar and Mohali airports to facilitate NRIs coming into the state.Channi also announced to enhance the police welfare fund from existing Rs 10 crore to Rs 15 crore from next budget.While lauding the services rendered by the police force in maintaining peace and law and order, Channi said the nation’s progress cannot be imagined without them.Channi expressed hope that the police will uphold its rich tradition of serving the state by wiping out curse of drugs from the state.He said in wake of coming elections, some forces inimical to the state are hell bent upon disturbing the hard-earned peace of Punjab. Punjabis have always fought the nation’s war to protect its unity and sovereignty, he said, adding that now also they will be at forefront to serve the nation.Channi expressed hope that with support and cooperation of people, these challenges will be overcome soon.Earlier, in his address, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa hailed the Punjab Police for rendering exemplary service to the nation.

Sidhu, on the other hand, has backed Ashwani Sekhri (Batala), Harvinder Laddi (Bathinda Rural) & Navtej Cheema (Kapurthala).Debt concernsSidhu said the GST compensation grant would discontinue in June 2022, increasing the fiscal deficit by Rs18,000 cr annually and leaving the state at the mercy of the Centre.Even as the Congress screening committee is yet to come out with its final list of candidates, Lal Singh said no one except the high command could announce candidates.Addressing party workers at Anaj Mandi, Devigarh, in the segment, Sidhu said he would ensure local leader Mann’s victory in the elections. “Mann had lost the elections by 4,000 votes in 2017, but he will win by over 40,000 votes this time,” he claimed.Sidhu promised to drive out mafia that had taken over the state and bring in a new ‘Punjab model’. There was a need to implement a cooperative policy to uplift the living standards of farmers, he added.Opposing the announcement in favour of Mann, Lal Singh said Sidhu could say whatever he wants, but ultimately the screening committee and high command would decide the candidates. “I am still a claimant from the seat and will not speak anything more on the issue,” he said. On his part, Mann said everyone in the segment knew the “deceitful deeds done to them by Lal Singh” along with Shiromani Akali Dal leaders.“I was allotted the ticket in 2017 due to resentment within the Congress cadre. Being the only Jat Sikh Congress leader in the fray from Patiala district, I am sure to win,” he claimed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-sidhu-bats-for-mann-from-sanaur-356411

They said a pro-farmer agriculture model was needed to replace the Green Revolution model. The existing model had proved to be “Green Genocide”, they said. Along with alternative farming model, implementation of the Land Ceiling Act to distribute land among small and marginal farmers, unemployment and drug addiction were the main issues, they said.“Unemployment is the reason for drug problem. To solve it, Punjab needs industries, especially those based on agriculture. But our resources, technology and market has been captured by imperial forces. Foreign capital must be seized and nationalised. Employment is mainly available in three sectors — agriculture, industry and service sector,” they said.KKU leaders said: “Due to privatisation, people were being denied basic amenities such as health, education, electricity, water, etc. The policy of privatisation must be abolished.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/contesting-polls-not-in-farmers-interest-kisan-union-356415

He won the seat in 1997, 2005, 2012 and 2017. In 2007, SAD’s Jagjiwan Singh Khirnia won the election.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1,71,083Male - 90,216Female - 80,862Third gender - 5Locals’ key demandsHaving won four Assembly elections out of five, Dhillon might face opposition from his own blood this time as the Shiromani Akali Dal has pitted one of his close relatives Paramjit Singh Dhillon as candidate.Though the constituency has received abundant funds and seen development, inadequate sewerage system and lack of parking facility for shops situated on recently widened Ludhiana-Chandigarh highway may go against Dhillon. Contrary to expectations, the six-laning of the highway resulted in disappointment among shop owners situated in the main markets at towns situated along it as customers find it difficult to park their vehicles now.Despite spending huge grants, executing agencies failed to accomplish development projects to the satisfaction of residents. Dhillon, on the other hand, claims: “I have left no stone unturned to work for residents of my constituency. The government overtook a private college at Machhiwara besides establishing a new ITI. We have also succeeded in widening major roads passing through the area and at least 400 km long link roads were reconstructed or repaired.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/awash-with-sewage-woes-356422

The residents, however, alleged that the police came there without any valid reason and resorted to lathicharge to vacate the land.“The land belongs to the SC community and the Tapa Nagar Council does not have any right to construct a park there. The police have registered a false case against 165 members of the community. We will launch a stir if the case is not withdrawn,” said Satnam Singh Rahi, SAD candidate from Bhadaur.The council authorities claimed the land belonged to the council, but the SC community members maintained they were its owners. An SHO, three other policemen and some members of the SC community were injured after a clash erupted here on Wednesday. The situation turned tense after a few locals were stopped from constructing a gurdwara on a vacant plot near the Tapa tehsil complex.

Out of four BJP victories, ex-Health Minister Surjit Kumar Jyani has won thrice. The Rai Sikh community, which has the major chunk of votes, is likely to be the deciding factor this year.Electorate strengthTotal voters - 1,62,981Male - 86,211Female - 76,768Third gender - 2Locals’ key demandsDue to the run-up to the elections, the government is keen on inaugurating “incomplete” hospital building, the construction of which was started during the previous SAD-BJP regime, to derive the mileage before the enforcement of model code of conduct in the state.The information gathered by The Tribune revealed that the Fazilka Municipal Council carved out four colonies in the town and sold out nearly 577 plots by earning crores of rupees out of it. “None of the colony has been developed by the council so far and the continuous demand for development falls on the deaf ears of successive governments,” said a plot owner, Kranti Kumar, of Shayama Parsad Mukherjeet MC colony. He said heaps of garbage could be seen everywhere in the colonies and anti-social elements had encroached upon the buyers’ plots in connivance with council authorities.The only government college has been striving for its existence as all posts of professors and principal have been lying vacant since long. “Our repeated memorandums, requests and continuous agitation for filling up the vacant posts have fallen on deaf ears,” said Dheeraj Kumar, president, Punjab Students Union, Fazilka.The issue of untreated water being released into Fazilka drains is yet to be addressed. The National Green Tribunal had fixed March 31, 2021, as the deadline to resolve the issue of polluted water, but the problem still persists. In July 2019, a local farmer, Vikram Ahuja, had filed a petition in the NGT, seeking its intervention to get rid of the problem of polluted water in Fazilka drains, citing reason that the sub-soil water had turned unfit for human consumption and for irrigation purposes for different reasons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-development-project-in-5-years-356427

It would not be possible without the govt’s protection. The FIR against him is just a ploy by the Congress government to gain political mileage by fooling people. — Harpal Singh Cheema, Leader of oppositionAAP said Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu were promoting the FIR against Majithia as if they had won the Trojan war, but “the Akali leader is yet to be arrested”.“Channi and Sidhu should clarify whether their action in the drug case was limited to just an FIR and few statements,” it asked.Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said: “Where can Majithia take refuge that even the STF and SIT fail to track him. It would not be possible without the government’s protection.” He further said we had been saying from day one that the FIR against Majithia was just a ploy by the Congress government to gain political mileage by fooling the people.He further doubted that the new Advocate General (AG) was same as the previous AGs who took no actions against such politicians, and it seemed they’re waiting for Majithia to get bail through his anticipatory bail plea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-govt-deliberately-not-arresting-majithia-356429

Despite heavy investment on stubble management machines, the problem has persisted.Rue delay in getting clearancesAs of now, only six plants are commissioned, though many more applications are pending. If the government addresses this delay in getting clearances, we can see a much better paddy straw management on the ground. — Sanjeev Nagpal, Veteran in industrial use of stubbleThis year, though the number of stubble burning incidents have come down (from 79,000 last year to 71,299 this year) and the burnt area has reduced from 17.42 lakh hectare to 14.11 lakh hectare, the reduction is not in consonance with the heavy investment of hundreds of crores that has been made on buying stubble management machinery.Realising this, some entrepreneurs, who are either into making bio CNG or bio manure from paddy stubble, are now keen to set up new projects in the state. With 20 million tonnes of paddy straw generated in the state annually, these entrepreneurs are eyeing it as a perfect business opportunity. Also, the Government of India’s Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme is keeping them enthused for making compressed bio gas.Ashish Kumar, managing director of VERBIO India, the biggest bio fuel plant in the country, that is coming up in Lehragaga, told The Tribune that renewable gas had the potential of emerging as the most promising industry in Punjab.Sanjeev Nagpal, a veteran in the industrial use of paddy stubble in Punjab, said there had been an inadvertent delay on the part of various departments in giving clearances for setting up the projects.Information gathered by The Tribune from the state Industries Department reveals that 27 applications of investors willing to go for industrial use of stubble have been received.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bizmen-eye-setting-up-stubble-mgmt-plants-356432

Along with rice, testing to determine the age of wheat is also being initiated to stop recycling and diversions.“The age testing of rice aims to curb leakages and diversion of PDS rice and avoid recycling.

During the discussions held yesterday, the panel decided on the names of most of the ministers and sitting MLAs.Undecided on...Factors at playWhile it has been learnt that the proposed rally of Rahul Gandhi at Moga on January 3 has been postponed, another meeting on the selection of candidates has been called by the AICC on January 2.Meanwhile, the tussle between CM Channi and Navjot Sidhu goes on over the CM face of the party even as Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Choudhary has already clarified that the CM face would not be declared before the elections.Sidhu has been pushing for an announcement on the CM face, while Channi has been seeking “another opportunity” to serve people at rallies.Sources said after Navjot Sidhu stepped up pressure on the party leadership to announce the CM face ahead of the polls, the top brass was keeping a close watch on his political activities.“If the PPCC chief and the Chief Minister are not seen on the same page in the coming days, it would harm the party.
