This, he argued, was done belatedly after more than one year and four months.“This application is not only illegal but politically motivated and apparently seems to have been moved keeping in view the coming assembly election in the state of Punjab. There is no change in the circumstances and also no further evidence has apparently come forth before the Investigating Agency to change its stand and move the application now. This fact in itself is sufficient to show the biased and vindictive attitude of the investigating agency towards me,” Dera Chief has submitted in his plea.Referring to Section 267 of the CrPC, the dera chief added a warrant for producing a prisoner could only be issued for the limited purposes of answering a charge or giving evidence. It could not be issued for handing the prisoner’s custody to the investigating agency in the aid of an ongoing investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sacrilege-case-dera-chief-moves-hc-seeking-bail-in-case-of-arrest-330462

Another five Judges are retiring next year. The problem of plenty, under the circumstances, continues to be a matter of concern for the High Court. National Judicial Data Grid — the monitoring tool to identify, manage and reduce pendency of cases — indicates the pendency of more than 4 lakh cases in the High Court.The names were cleared for elevation by the Supreme Court collegium in September after being forwarded by the Centre in April this year.The process of appointing judges is lengthy and time-consuming. Once cleared by the States and the governors, the file containing the names with intelligence bureau reports is placed before the Supreme Court collegium when it meets.

27-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Channi, Sidhu endangering national security; Amarinder has exposed Congress, says BJP’s Tarun Chugh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27The BJP’s Punjab pitch for the upcoming Assembly election built around national and internal security appears to be falling in place. Praising Captain Amarinder Singh for “exposing the Congress party”, the BJP on Wednesday accused Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and state president Navjot Sidhu of “endangering national security”.Party’s national general secretary and Punjab leader Tarun Chugh said the former Chief Minister had “exposed the Congress which would be completely wiped out in the coming Assembly election”.Though he did not elaborate on the much-anticipated tie-up with Singh in the upcoming election, Chugh said for the saffron party internal/national security of the country is of prime importance. “We will ensure that those who are a threat to it do not come to power in Punjab. It is very important to stop and expose those who support international and local mafias, whether drugs or transport,” the BJP leader from Punjab said, adding that there are no deadlines in politics.Terming Singh a “nationalist”, BJP’s Punjab affairs in-charge Dushyant Gautam has already specified that the party is open to an alliance with all those who put the country and its interests first. “All parties that want to form an alliance with us on this agenda are welcome,” Gautam had said.Endorsing the security concerns raised by Singh, Chugh said this necessitated the BSF to increase its operative areas in the border states like Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal. He also slammed the Congress and the Akali Dal for opposing the Centre’s decision on the BSF jurisdiction and ridiculed their contention that it was an attack on the federal rights of Punjab.“By doing so the Congress government in Punjab has been demonstrating its support to drug mafias and anti-national forces which have been operating on the border.“Instead of joining hands with the Centre to check anti-national forces on the border, the Congress government and PCC president Navjot Sidhu seem to be extending support to them,” Chugh said, accusing both Channi and Sidhu of “trying to sabotage the efforts of the Centre to guard the borders”.“We understand Sidhu’s sympathy for Pakistan but it is tragic that he is not sensitive to the national security concerns of a border state,” he added.Chugh also praised Singh for “his efforts to resolve the farmers’ issues”. “While the Centre has always been open to talks with farmers and has welcomed any intervention to resolve the deadlock, farmers’ doggedness has been a matter of concern,” he said. Meanwhile, sources said the Centre is “always in touch with the farmers regarding their welfare issues”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/channi-sidhu-endangering-national-security-amarinder-has-exposed-congress-says-bjps-tarun-chugh-330394

A day after Justice Agnihotri’s term as an additional judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court came to an end, his name was today removed from the list of the judges on the HC’s official website.With this, the confusion over his continuation as a High Court judge has come to an end. The High Court under the orders of the Chief Justice, Justice Ravi Shanker Jha, also came out with a new roster without his name in it. His name has, however, not been included so far in the list of High Court’s former judges.This is the first time in recallable past that an additional judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court has not been made permanent. The only other recallable example is during the Emergency, when Justice Rajendra Nath Aggarwal was “punished” along with another judge, for passing an order. Justice Aggarwal’s term was not extended, following which he was reverted to his former position as a District Judge in Delhi. The end of Emergency saw Justice Aggarwal’s elevation permanently to the Delhi High Court.

The fireworks timing has been restricted to 35 minutes on Christmas in the state.On November 4 (Diwali), crackers are allowed from 8 pm to 10 pm, for Gurpurb (November 19) crackers are allowed in two slots from 4 am to 5 am and 9 pm to 10 pm, on December 25 (Christmas) from 11.55 pm to 12.30 am and New Year’s eve (December 31) from 11.55 pm to 12.30 am.Meanwhile, no crackers are allowed in the two districts of Mandi Gobindgarh and Jalandhar following the air quality monitoring done on the Diwali night last year. Mandi Gobindgarh will see “no-cracker Diwali” for the second year in a row.Further, the PPCB has decided to promote community celebration of the festival, while e-commerce sites have been prohibited from selling or delivering the crackers in Punjab. “Only green crackers, allowed by the court are allowed in all districts of Punjab,” said senior PPCB officials.The announcement is contrary to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directions that call for a complete ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in cities that had poor average ambient air quality levels during November 2019.Only green crackers would be allowed in compliance with the NGT directives as well as various judicial orders passed amid reports of firecrackers likely to aggravate the Covid-19 problem.Complete ban in two districtsNo crackers are allowed in the two districts of Mandi Gobindgarh and Jalandhar following the air quality monitoring done on the Diwali night last year.

The CAAQMS will help the PPCB monitor real-time air quality. Any such station requires an investment of Rs 1 crore — Rs 80-lakh installation charges and Rs 20-lakh running expenditure.“For measuring the AQI, the stations depend on the flow of air through their machines despite the fact that wind velocity is as low as 2 km per hour for most part of the day,” say officials.The 18 manual monitoring stations will be installed in Faridkot, Fazilka, Moga, Mansa, Tarn Taran, Barnala, Sangrur, Malerkotla, Fatehgarh Sahib, SAS Nagar, Hoshiarpur, Muktsar Sahib, Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Ferozepur, SBS Nagar and Ropar.“These new stations will help us study the impact of stubble burning, vehicular emissions and industrial pollution throughout the year and frame policies accordingly,” said PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg.Even as air quality in the state deteriorates after paddy harvesting season, the PPCB has no mechanism to record the AQI. The state depends on the air monitoring stations in six cities, whereas stubble-burning occurs in villages.As per the PPCB, Punjab AQI is “satisfactory”, (0-50 good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe), following the recent spell of rain.‘Delay in harvesting behind more farm fires’The paddy harvesting was delayed due to inclement weather in the past week and this will narrow the winter crop sowing window, which can lead to more stubble burning cases as farmers will get less time to clear fields, say experts||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/21-more-stations-to-monitor-real-time-air-quality-in-punjab-330124

The petition was filed in 2019, and after following a due process, including giving hearings to the MLA, the Speaker passed his orders today.Interestingly, Baldev Singh is the second rebel AAP MLA to lose his seat in the Vidhan Sabha this month. Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s resignation was also accepted by the Speaker earlier this month. Both had rebelled against the party in 2018 — a year after being elected on AAP ticket.He, like Khaira, had also contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Faridkot as Punjab Ekta Party candidate. He lost the election and had subsequently returned to the AAP fold.Talking to The Tribune, Vidhan Sabha Speaker Rana KP Singh said following the filing of the disqualification petition, hearings of the petitioners as well as Baldev Singh were conducted. “During the course of the hearings, the MLA himself admitted that he had contested elections from the Punjab Ekta Party. Thus a decision to disqualify him was taken today,” he said.With the dismissal of Baldev Singh, the strength of AAP in the Vidhan Sabha has been reduced to 17, though they continue to be the single largest party. Of these 17, three MLAs — Pirmal Singh, Nazar Singh and Jagdev Singh Kamalu — have already joined the Congress, while another MLA Kanwar Sandhu continues to be a rebel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-vidhan-sabha-speaker-disqualifies-aap-legislator-baldev-singh-kalyan-330119

They have alleged the minister’s aide Gora Gill has his backing in Bholath, his son Inder Partap Singh Rana has started activities in Sultanpur Lodhi. In Phagwara, too, Rana Gurjeet has been reportedly ignoring MLA Dhaliwal and engaging with ex-minister Joginder Mann.Khaira in a public event yesterday lashed out at the minister. He said: “Rana Gurjeet Singh should confine himself to his constituency. As a minister, he does not get the right to create frictions within the party in other constituencies. It is wrong on his part to promote his family member from Sultanpur Lodhi.“A perception is being created that his son could contest from the seat. Navtej Cheema is the sitting MLA and won two consecutive terms. Rana Gurjeet is interfering in Phagwara too.”Khaira also talked about Rana’s alleged interference in his seat. “Rana Gurjeet’s interference is not new in Bholath. He has been doing it since 2002. He has an understanding with my Akali opponent Jagir Kaur, ” he alleged.Cheema, too, targeted the minister on the sidelines of a function at Jainpur village. “The ministers are indulging anti-party activities. They should bind the party, not weaken it. Instead of commenting on the winnability of party candidates on other seats, the ministers should instead focus on their standing in their own constituencies.”“Rana Gurjeet should worry about his falling popularity. His son has said he is keen to contest from Sultanpur Lodhi and has the full support of his father. Rest, it is up to the party to take a final call,” he said.Focus on your own seatRana Gurjeet Singh should confine himself to his constituency. He does not have the right to create friction within the party. Sukhpal Khaira, Bholath ex-MLAWorry about popularityThe minister won with a margin of 28,000 in 2017. In the 2019 LS polls, it was down to 6,000. He should worry about his popularity. Navtej Cheema, Sultanpur Lodhi MLARana Gurjeet refutes meddling charge Cabinet Minister Rana Gurjeet Singh denied interfering in other constituencies or conspiring with rivals. “I respect Jagir Kaur and I touch the feet of Upinderjit Kaur, wherever I meet her. That does not mean I am a SAD supporter,” he said. Regarding his son’s keenness to contest from Sultanpur Lodhi, he said, “It will be the party’s decision.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kapurthala-congress-leaders-complain-of-rana-gurjeets-interference-330117

He may abandon the Amritsar East seat this time, but only for his wife Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu.Apparently due to his “over occupancy with the state issues” Sidhu could hardly spare time for his constituency. Even his “missing” posters, too, surfaced lately.However, in his absence, Navjot Kaur has got active in the constituency, which she represented during the SAD-BJP rule in 2012. After inaugurating development works worth Rs 50 lakh each in Vallah and Mudhal village on October 23, she again inaugurated projects worth Rs 1.75 crore in Preet Nagar today.Earlier, their daughter Rabia Sidhu inaugurated development works in Amritsar East on October 5, followed by works for beautification of parks in New Amritsar B-Block on October 14. Navjot Kaur had already shown her inclination to contest the elections from the East constituency only.Launching a scathing attack on Capt Amarinder Singh, she said he remained passive for over four years during his stint as CM. When the party high command came into action, he started showing concern about Punjab and announced to float a new party.About Captain’s declaration to defeat Sidhu, she dared him to contest from any seat. “No one can stop anyone’s elevation. It’s the people who give the mandate. Capt Amarinder’s MLAs, OSDs and leaders abandoned him due to his inaccessibility and non-performance,” she said.Nonetheless, with Dr Sidhu’s activities, the prospects got blurred for other aspirants, including former Amritsar Improvement Trust chairman Dinesh Bassi and Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu.Bassi said he had got works worth Rs 61.47 crore, either executed or underway. “It is the party high command which decides the candidates. I will certainly claim my candidature for East constituency,” he said.Mayor Rintu, who also took a keen interest in the constituency, claimed that works worth Rs 50 crore were executed or still underway in several pockets of the area. “Let the party decide from where I can contest the elections”, he said.Other claimants||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/eyeing-amritsar-east-seat-navjot-kaur-sidhu-on-inauguration-spree-330115

The ban comes on the back of an order from the National Green Tribunal orders after air quality plummeted in these towns in November 2020.The rest of the state must strictly adhere to a fixed time limit for using firecrackers—fireworks must be limited to two hours on Diwali, from 8 pm to 10 pm; on Gurpurb (November 19) from 4 am to 5 am and later from 9 pm to 10 pm; on Christmas and New Year’s Eve between 11.55 pm and 12.30 am.The order also bans e-commerce websites, including Flipkart and Amazon, from selling fireworks online.The new order appears somewhat at odds with a November 2019 order of the National Green Tribunal, which called for a complete ban on the sale and use of all kinds of fireworks in cities with poor ambient air.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-limits-use-of-firecrackers-to-two-hours-on-diwali-gurpurb-329982

Members of Calgary Sikh community and Punjabi NRI MPs and MLAs in Canada have condemned the act.Sikh Society of Calgary was the target of racist vandalism today. Gurdwara security footage failed to capture evidence of those behind the hateful messages. The city had the graffiti removed after police attended the scene.

This action is unacceptable and we are committed to conducting a thorough investigation to hold the responsible parties accountable.”Dasmesh Cultural Centre, which runs NE Calgary Sikh Gurdwara has tweeted, “We are extremely disappointed and saddened to hear our SW Gurdwara Sahib had racist graffiti sprayed outside on roads leading up to entrance. While we believe this is the actions of a few, we encourage everyone to accept everyone as one and take the time to learn about your neighbours. Doors to our Gurdwara Sahib are open to all, we encourage you to visit and learn about Sikhi. While this display of racism is very hurtful, we want to take this time for all of us to come together and show support to all people regardless of background or beliefs.”The World Sikh Organisation (WSO) of Canada condemned the racist vandalism that took place on the road leading up to the Sikh Society of Calgary Gurdwara early Monday morning.

I promise my people that I will do what it takes to ensure peace and security, which is today at stake," read an earlier tweet, quoting Amarinder.Since his resignation as chief minister, Amarinder has been targeting state Congress president Navjot Sidhu by publicly saying that he would fight his possible elevation to the chief ministership tooth and nail, and is ready to make any sacrifice to save the country from such a “dangerous man”.
