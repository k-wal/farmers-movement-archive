02-10-2021||Saurabh Malik||Appointment of Rajwinder Bains as special public prosecutor for sacrilege matters stirs legal debate||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 2When senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains was appointed special public prosecutor for the politically sensitive sacrilege matters, one of the factors that weighed with the Punjab government was his appearance for the main complainant in a related “police” firing case. This very factor has now generated a legal debate primarily on the premise that a lawyer for the complainant legally cannot be appointed as a prosecutor in the same case.Bains was chosen for the special PP’s post following a political storm over senior advocate APS Deol’s appointment as the Advocate-General for the State of Punjab. Navjot Singh Sidhu, who had abruptly resigned as Punjab Congress chief, had, among other things, cited Deol’s appointment for stepping down from the post on September 28. His objection was that the senior advocate was the counsel for former top-cop Sumedh Singh Saini and IG Paramraj Singh Umaranangal — both accused in the Behbal Kalan police firing case.Deol’s appointment was also objected to on the ground of conflict of interest as he, being Saini and Umaranangal’s counsel, would neither be able to appear nor advise the State in their cases and related matters. Bains, on the other hand, was counsel for the main complainant Ajit Singh in the Kotkapura firing cases and had represented the complainant when the investigation in the matter was quashed by the High Court. Available information suggests the decision to appoint Bains may, however, be not legally sound and the prosecution conducted by him could be a subject matter of challenge on the ground of being vitiated in law. The accused could seek the setting aside of the entire trial at any stage on this technical ground.There are, in fact, a plethora of judgments on the subject, starting from 1924 verdict in Anant Chanderkar’s case right up to 2002 in Rekha Murarka’s case, where the Supreme Court struck down the appointment of public prosecutors, who were in some manner either connected to the filing of the criminal case, had taken a public position in the matter or where the counsel for the victim had been given a role in the prosecution of the matter.In any case, the sole aim of the public prosecutor is not to seek a conviction, even though he is appointed by the State. His role has been interpreted by the Courts as an “officer of the Court” and “minister of justice” required to place before the Court all evidence in his possession, whether it is in favour of, or against, the accused. He is not to single-mindedly seek conviction regardless of the evidence — tough thing for counsel for a complainant to do.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/appointment-of-rajwinder-bains-as-special-public-prosecutor-for-sacrilege-matters-stirs-legal-debate-319257

This is a tremendous victory for the farmers,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The government will also have to take back the three farm laws, he said.In another tweet in Hindi, Surjewala said, “Now our demands are :- Every grain lying in the ‘Mandis’ should be procured and payment made, guidelines for procurement 2021-22 be issued, in view of unseasonal rains and delay in procurement, the moisture content of the crop should be relaxed up to 25 per cent, compensation for the damage of crop be given within seven days.”Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar met Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey on the issue on Saturday in Delhi. “I am happy that the Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey has accepted our request, and procurement will start in Haryana from October 3,” Khattar, who was flanked by his deputy Dushyant Chautala and Agriculture Minister J P Dalal said after the meeting.Chief Minister Channi, who had taken up the issue during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, said that farmers will be satisfied with the decision as it will ensure smooth and hassle-free procurement.The procurement of Kharif crops - Paddy and Millet- was earlier to start from October 1, but due to heavy rains, the central government had postponed the procurement till October 11 as the moisture content in fresh arrivals was beyond permissible limits.The decision irked farmers and many of them protested on Saturday in several parts of the two states, laying siege to the houses of many ministers, MPs and MLAs.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the agitation against the three central agri laws, had on Friday had given a call for holding protests outside the residences of legislators in Punjab and Haryana.

Frequent road and rail blockades, besides fear of contracting Covid-19, has forced tourists to shun public transport.Harjap Singh Aujla, a tourist said, “By the grace of god, tourits are back, but now they prefer to travel on their own vehicles. Saragarhi parking near the Golden Temple always remain full. It gets difficult to park a vehicle within the walled city. The need for another parking lot is being felt.”SP Singh, who is trader, said a large number of locals started using two-wheelers as they do not find adequate parking space. “The entire area around the Golden Temple is a hub of blankets, suiting and shirting, besides retail market of gold ornaments and utensils, among others,” he said.Akshay Kumar, a contractor of Saragarhi parking, said, “ A total of 800 four-wheelers can be parked here. There’s no space for Tempo travellers. At least four more parking lots, with each having capacity to accommodate 2,000 vehicles, should be developed.”He said a proposal to add seven more storeys to Saragarhi parking has been forwarded to the Local Government.Notably, the multi-level automated parking lot proposed under the Smart City project at Kairon Market is situated close to Saragarhi parking. Akshay said land of Old Sabzi Mandi outside the Hall Gate could be used as a automated parking lot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/as-tourist-flow-rises-parking-issues-crop-up-around-golden-temple-319130

All are waiting to cross over to Pakistan since September 23.Camping at a parking lot near the International Check Post (ICP), the group caught the attention of Saurab and Mandeep, who run a sweet shop nearby.“It had already been 24 hours and none of them had hardly purchased any food or cooked anything. It seemed odd as the group has 47 children under the age of 10 years. They seemed poor but we had no idea that they were so broke,” said Saurab.Next, the duo discussed the issue with others at the village. “It was already 5 pm. We decided that women would make chapattis and men would cook daal. By 6.30 pm, we had 800 chapattis — much more than we needed,” said Jodhbir Singh, a former panchayat member from Attari.“Ever since that evening, the residents are providing three meals, tea and medicines to them. Another resident of the village purchased 100 steel bowls for them as they had no utensils. Some have given clothes to the children,” said Jasbir Singh Sahoora, president, Ex-serviceman Sainik Welfare Society.The residents have also convinced the parking contractor to open toilets for them. Instead of sleeping in the open, like they did on the first day, they now use the sheds of nearby dhabas.As the group has at least six children below the age of six months (who were born in India), the youth from Rorawala village give them 10 litre milk every day. “The milk is delivered to Saurab’s shop, who keeps it refrigerated and gives it to children’s mothers whenever they ask for it,” said Jaswinder Singh, another ex-serviceman.While most of them are from Sanghar district of Sindh province, a few of them are from West Punjab. A few of them had come to India for “Ganga Snan” before the lockdown was announced in March last year and were stranded. There are others, too, who came in 2017 and later on the same pretext overstayed their visa.Kewal Das, a member of the group, said all of them had been staying in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. “The authorities here say that we require permission from the Jodhpur police for which we have applied now,” said Mohan, who had come to India in 2018.Maghia Ram from Rahim Yar Khan district of West Punjab said: “We request the officials concerned to expedite the process of sending us home as soon as possible.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/99-pak-hindus-get-help-from-local-community-gurdwaras-to-stay-afloat-319111

On this, the SKM stated that they would hold protests in Punjab and Haryana from Saturday till the government starts the procurement process.SKM leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said farmers are annoyed with the Centre’s decision in both states. The duty of the government is to make arrangements for procurement on time. The SKM has decided today to protest against the government’s decision, he added.Rajewal appealed to all farmer unions to gherao residences of BJP-JJP MPs and MLAs from tomorrow (Saturday) in Haryana and residences of Congress MLAs in Punjab.Earlier, it was decided to gherao DC offices in Punjab. But as offices would be closed on the next two days, the programme was changed, Rajewal added.Gurnam Singh Charuni, Haryana farmer leader, said that it was decided in the nine-member committee of the SKM on Friday to launch the protest from Saturday.The Centre has not only delayed procurement but also limited procurement to 25 quintals per acre in Haryana. That could not be tolerated, he said.Charuni appealed to all farmer unions to gherao the residences of BJP-JJP’s MPs and MLAs at 10 am tomorrow in the state. He said that the dharna would continue till the government rolls back its “anti-farmer” decisions.Dr Darshan Pal Singh, president, Krantikari Kisan Union, said that the protest would continue till the government starts paddy procurement; does not remove the limit on the procurement of paddy and millet (bajra) and gives compensation for the loss in cotton crop due to heavy rain.Morcha members to fast on Gandhi JayantiThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha said day-long fasts would be observed on Saturday to mark Gandhi Jayanti.

Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan has set a month’s deadline for the purpose.A custody certificate reflects the period of imprisonment undergone by a convict or an undertrial and his involvement in other previous cases. The certificate is taken into consideration by a Judge while deciding the issue of bail. The issuance of an e-custody certificate would not only make it readily available to the Bench and others concerned, but also provide accurate and complete information to the Judge during the decision making process.In his detailed order, Justice Sangwan directed the initiation of process to activate e-custody certificate module of e-prisons on the pattern of “Phoenix” application of Haryana prisons. Directions were also issued to the state of Punjab through the Chief Secretary, the Advocate-General and Additional Director-General of Police (Prisons) to apply to the High Court for availing the application programming interfaces (API) for integration with e-Prisons.Justice Sangwan also asked the central project coordinator of the High Court to recommend and forward the request to e-committee of the Supreme Court for further processing. Justice Sangwan directed the Punjab Chief Secretary to provide access to all prisons department-related data to the Punjab Advocate-General to review it on a timely basis.Punjab Deputy Advocate General Joginder Pal Ratra and Haryana Deputy Advocate-General Himmat Singh have been appointed as amicus curiae to monitor the initiation process.“A status report be filed by the amicus curiae, Punjab Advocate General, Chief Secretary to the Government of Punjab and the Additional Director General of Police, Punjab,” Justice Sangwan asserted.

The police are hopeful of nabbing more members of the gang.After a tip-off, the police conducted a raid and apprehended Harnam Singh and Karan Goyal of Dabwali who had in their possession such SIM cards. Faridkot SP (D) Balkrishan Singla said the police were investigating the case.Preliminary investigation revealed that some members of the gang had been working at mobile phone shops and selling SIM cards procured on fake IDs for the past year.The police believe many of the SIM cards were sold to jail inmates here. With recovery of over 100 mobile phones from jail inmates here this year, the easy accessibility and use of mobile phones in the Faridkot Jail has been a cause for concern for the police. The mobile phones were also recovered from gangsters in the jail here.Under the Prisons Act, 1894, a prisoner or inmate found guilty of possessing, operating a mobile phone or its components like SIM card, memory card, battery or charger can be punished for a term not exceeding one year under Section 52-A of the Act.However, inmates do not worry about the crime committed inside the jail, said a senior functionary in the jail. “Inmates don’t have any fear of being caught with phones. They think that if they are caught or prosecuted, they might get a concurrent sentence,” said the officer.This is the reason that the inmates who’ve committed heinous crime are involved in more criminal activities from inside the prison, he said.Four gangsters nabbed in Moga||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fake-sim-card-gang-busted-318853

In all, 39 Benches, comprising 45 judges, are currently holding court through videoconferencing and physical mode. As of now, 12 Benches are hearing cases physically.The High Court had shifted to the virtual mode of hearing in March-end last year. Limited physical hearing was ordered to be resumed from February 8, but it had to be suspended as the second wave took in its grip High Court judges, judicial officers in the subordinate judiciary, advocates and staff. The High Court was forced to go back to restrictive functioning from April 19.

They have been brought on product warrant from Delhi and Rajasthan, respectively, and were produced in a local court today.Accusing the police of implicating them in a false case on the complaint of deceased’s father, they apprehended they would be eliminated in a police encounter, in connivance with the complainant.In reply, the Faridkot police claimed they did not have shackles but maintained the suspects were “secure” in their custody and that there was no threat to their life.In February, district Youth Congress president and zila parishad member Pehalwan was shot by two assailants. While the Delhi Police arrested the two shooters two months after the crime, the Faridkot police were unable to procure their custody for almost six months.The murder was allegedly orchestrated by a Canada-based gangster, and his associate and jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.‘No threat to life’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pehalwan-murder-direct-police-to-ensure-our-safety-gangsters-urge-court-318855

Among other things, a decision was sought on concluding the disciplinary proceedings “based on inquiry proceeding concluded on August 31, 2018, returning the finding of guilt against the stated delinquent official inter alia on the charges of corruption”.Appearing before the Bench for the High Court, advocate Vikas Chatrath prayed for a short adjournment to seek instruction in the matter. Taking a note of the prayer, the Bench adjourned the hearing.Narwana on Rai’s behalf had earlier submitted the “delinquent official” had been held guilty of demanding and accepting illegal gratification in the regular departmental inquires. As such, he deserved to be dismissed forthwith for safeguarding the judiciary’s image and reputation.Going into the background, Narwana submitted the officer posted as Patiala CBI Special Judge erred in law in convicting the petitioner for cheating under Sections 420 and 120-B of the IPC before sentencing him to seven years of rigorous imprisonment as he and others convicted refused to pay bribe of Rs 40 lakh each demanded by him.Narwana added Gopal was found guilty of demanding illegal gratification from the petitioner in its discreet inquiry report dated September 6, 2013, submitted by then Registrar (Vigilance) Arun Kumar Tyagi, who recently retired as a judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.In the regular departmental inquiry, the inquiry officer in her report dated March 31, 2018, held all allegations contained in the Article of Charge were proved against the “delinquent officer”. The petitioner made a representation on April 2, 2019, to the High Court and the Chief Justice seeking action against “delinquent officer” on the basis of regular departmental inquiry. But “to date, action had not been taken for reasons best known to the High Court”, Narwana added.Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan of the High Court in a related matter has already asserted: “Though no final order has been passed by the High Court qua Hemant Gopal, Additional District and Sessions Judge, who is continuing under suspension for the last about four years, yet prima facie, his indictment as per the inquiry report is apparent on record”.Suspended 4 yrs ago over graft charges||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-inform-about-action-on-delinquent-judge-by-october-end-318856

The recovery of illegal paddy from other states last year showed farmers were being exploited by private players. Several FIRs were registered against traders and the investigation revealed that the illegal paddy was first purchased at lower prices and then transported into Punjab, where it was sold at a much higher price.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-seals-border-with-haryana-to-curb-illegal-inflow-of-paddy-318859

The same was done in the presence of a deputy general manager-level officer and was recorded at 12.9 per cent against the allowed moisture content of 17 per cent.Meanwhile, in a statement issued from the party headquarters here on Friday, AAP MLA and Kisan Wing state president Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the Centre's move was aimed at taking revenge from farmers for the ongoing protests against the three agricultural laws.Terming the decision to defer the procurement of paddy as a 'Tughlaqi farman', Sandhwan demanded immediate withdrawal of the order. “The paddy has started arriving in the mandis of Punjab and it will be difficult for the farmers to handle it for 10 days,” he added. — TNS‘BJP bid to avenge agri law protest’AAP MLA and Kisan Wing state president Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the Centre’s move was aimed at taking revenge from farmers for the ongoing protests against the three agricultural laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/paddy-procurement-sad-hits-out-at-congress-aap-blames-centre-318860

Since the purchase will start after October 11, we are trying to arrange private purchasers so that farmers can sell their crop. — Inderjit Singh Bedi, president, Lehragaga Arhtiya AssociationEarlier, paddy procurement used to start in Punjab from October 1. Some farmers from Bhutal Kalan village have unloaded their paddy in the local grain market while arhtiyas and private purchasers have refused to purchase the paddy as the official purchase will start after October 11. This has created problems for farmers, who will have to sit in the grain market till the start of the purchase as they are unwilling to take their crop back to their houses.“The government should not have deferred the purchase till October 11 as in many areas, the crop is ready. If in some areas recent rain has increased the moisture content, the authorities should have asked the farmers to bring their produce only with permissible limit of moisture,” said Rajpal Singh Mangwal, BKU Ugrahan leader.Another farmer Surjan Singh said there was no need to delay the purchase of paddy as the Punjab Government had already fixed the limit of moisture and the recent rain should not have been used as an excuse to defer the purchase.“Some farmers have brought their paddy to our market. Since the purchase will start after October 11, we are trying to arrange private purchasers so that farmers could sell their crop,” said Inderjit Singh Bedi, president of the Lehragaga Arhtiya Association.

02-10-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Furore over delay in paddy procurement in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 1The Centre’s decision to delay paddy procurement in Punjab by 10 days has met with stiff resistance from the farmers, state government and political parties in the state.Also read: Centre puts off paddy procurement from Punjab, Haryana till Oct 11Got assurance on farm stir resolution, raised procurement too: Channi after meeting PMWon’t take crop back, govt making excuses: Punjab farmersThis is because paddy in many districts of the state has already matured and is ready to be harvested. In four districts, farmers have already started bringing paddy to mandis. To date, 13,000 metric tonnes of paddy has arrived in the mandis. The early transplanted and the early maturing paddy varieties are ready for harvest or have already been harvested.Balbir Rajewal, SKM leaderGovt can’t keep farmers waitingThe mandis in some districts are seeing a surge in paddy arrivals. It is unfair to keep farmers waiting in mandis. This is just a way to harass farmers agitating against the Centre.Late last evening, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution decided to postpone the procurement from Punjab and Haryana till October 11, considering the high moisture content in the crop because of the recent spell of heavy rainfall in the region. Paddy procurement was scheduled to begin in Punjab today.The Centre’s decision has led to a furore in the poll-bound agrarian state. Officials in the state Agriculture and Food and Supplies Departments said the paddy harvested till date was more than 1 lakh metric tonnes — almost similar to what was harvested in the corresponding period last year (1.16 lakh MT).“Since the procurement has not yet started, farmers of Amritsar, Tarn Taran, some parts of Patiala and Sangrur have harvested their crops and are waiting to bring it to mandis. If it rains any day till October 11, their entire crop will be damaged and they will suffer huge losses,” said a senior officer in the Agriculture Department. Mohinder Kishan Chand Arora, a commission agent in Rajpura, said almost 5,200 MT of paddy had arrived in the mandi till date. “Though some of the crop had high moisture content, we are drying it and helping farmers fill the crop in bags till the procurement starts. The farmers are not ready to leave mandis till their crop is bought,” he added. Dr JS Mahal, Director Extension Services, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, said early maturing paddy variety had to be harvested now, so that the grain was not damaged.Meanwhile, with the postponement of the procurement date, heaps of paddy are piling up in the grain markets of Fatehgarh Sahib, causing anxiety among farmers. The harassed farmers raised slogans against the Modi Government at the Sirhind grain market today. MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra interacted with farmers and told them the state government was concerned about their problem.1 Lakh MT harvestedOfficials in the state Agriculture and Food and Supplies Departments said the paddy harvested till date was more than 1 lakh MT, almost similar to what was harvested in the corresponding period last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/furore-over-delay-in-paddy-procurement-in-punjab-318862

The rice grain will be vulnerable to shrivelling, blackening, discolouration and infestation. This may result in rejection of paddy at procurement centres and trigger distress sale, causing losses to the farmers,” said officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.They cited a letter from the Haryana Government requesting relaxation in moisture content in view of untimely rains. The moisture problem could be minimised if paddy crop was harvested after 10 days, they said.The officials said the FCI’s regional offices had found paddy samples having moisture ranging from 18 to 22 per cent in Punjab and 18.2 to 22.7 per cent in Haryana against the permissible limit of 17 per cent. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/postponement-to-rule-out-moisture-in-paddy-modi-government-318939

The Bench was told that the elections to the Legislative Assembly in the state were just about two to three months away and the dispensation within the ruling party had changed.Free sand to the public was being offered with intent to gain political mileage, even though it was legally and practically unfeasible. It was likely to cause complete chaos in minor mineral extraction and would lead to environmental disaster.“The ruling party with intent to fulfil the promise mentioned by it in the last election manifesto regarding free sand to public is doing this all,” it was added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-mulling-policy-changes-for-cheaper-sand-gravel-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-told-318867

Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi issued directions to the Patiala DC in this regard after dairy farmers called on him in Chandigarh late on Thursday.As per the Patiala MC orders, the dairies were supposed to be shifted to the new site by September 30. Devising a plan to ensure compliance of its orders, the MC had been issuing challans to dairy owners for various violations, including dumping waste into the sewerage lines.In a video that has gone viral, the CM can be heard directing an official that the dairy farmers be shifted to the new site only after the access road and internal roads along with facilities, including water supply and others, are provided there. On the request of the dairy farmers, he said, “The Mayor in Patiala is stating that the dairies will be evicted forcefully, but that should not be allowed. The needs of the dairy farmers should be cared for.”Deputy Commissioner Kumar Amit said he had received verbal orders on the issue from the Chief Minister. “We have been directed to provide all basic facilities to the dairy farmers at the site before shifting them.

While Gilzian asserted no minister in the Cabinet should be removed at this stage, Pargat chose to remain mum, but added retaining or removing ministers was a decision to be taken at a higher level.The ministers today visited Jalandhar for the first time after assuming office. Casting aspersions on the newly formed government and perhaps also CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Pargat said: “Sometimes, a new government tends to make mistakes. We will definitely come together and make those corrections. All issues the party is currently facing and those expected in the coming days will be resolved through the coordination committee.”Gilzian, asked whether he agreed with Pargat that the government had made mistakes, said: “These are not mistakes. It has been just one week since the new government took over. The new government has been taking some very good initiatives. There are often differences within the party or problems in coordinating at some levels. These will be sorted out soon. No officer is bad.”On former CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s announcement that he would quit the Congress, Gilzian said he had enjoyed his 22 years in the party on all top posts. “He remained PCC chief for many years. Twice he remained the CM. He made mistakes while remaining in power. At his age, he is not expected to be yearning for more power. The Congress is like a huge sea.

AICC observer Harish Chaudhary, who was in Chandigarh, met Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa and minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa to resolve the ongoing deadlock.Yesterday’s deliberations to end the impasse do not seem to have gone down well with leaders of the Majha brigade, who are part of the Channi-led government. It is learnt Home Minister Randhawa, who is part of the Majha brigade involved in toppling Capt Amarinder Singh, is not comfortable with Sidhu interfering in the Home affairs.

02-10-2021||---||Harish Rawat, Capt Amarinder Singh in war of words post Amit Shah meet||New Delhi/Chandigarh, Oct 1A day after Capt Amarinder Singh declared he would quit the Congress which had “insulted him”, the party launched a frontal attack on the veteran dismissing the charge of humiliation and said the former CM did not deliver on poll promises and ran the government from his farmhouse.AICC general secretary incharge of Punjab Harish Rawat also questioned Captain Amarinder’s secular credentials in the wake of the latter’s meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah.“At this time, Captain Amarinder should have stood shoulder to shoulder with Congress chief to save democracy. We hope he will not come under any pressure to directly or indirectly help the BJP. His secular credentials are on test,” said Rawat in Uttarakhand.The former CM hit back, saying the “world saw his humiliation” and that the “only pressure he had was of his own loyalty to the Congress” because of which he continued to tolerate insults after insults by PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. He said even his enemies could not doubt his secular credentials.Veterans take swipe at one anotherEven after his defeat from Patiala in 1998, Capt was inducted into the Congress and appointed state chief thrice and CM twice. Harish Rawat, AICC General SecretaryI have worked with stalwarts like Pranab Mukherjee, Motilal Vora and others but never had a problem. I fail to understand Rawat’s actions. Capt Amarinder Singh, Ex-CMThe Congress, through Rawat, attacked Captain for the first time publicly, saying MLAs were restless over his “non-performance” and 43 wrote to party president Sonia Gandhi seeking his replacement. Rawat said the CLP meeting had to be called to prevent anything “untoward” as MLAs had threatened to call their own meeting otherwise.“After meeting Shah, the theory of humiliation is being circulated to gain sympathy. The humiliation-based sympathy politics may help a person but it will not help Punjab. Captain Amarinder was controlling both the government and party from his farmhouse. No one asked him a question regarding absence from the secretariat,” said Rawat. The AICC general secretary added despite reminders, Captain Amarinder “failed to keep his promises on Bargari, drugs and electricity and there was a general perception that he and the Badals have a secret understanding”.The former CM dismissed Rawat’s claims as “outrageous”, saying these were prompted by the party’s “pathetic situation after being on a winning spree in the state for four and a half years”.“Three weeks before stepping down as CM, I had offered to resign but Sonia Gandhi told me to continue. The humiliating manner in which I was pushed into resigning hours before the CLP meeting is a matter of public record. The world saw the humiliation,” he said.‘Why Sidhu still dictating terms?’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/harish-rawat-capt-amarinder-singh-in-war-of-words-post-amit-shah-meet-318824

02-10-2021||---||Rawat questions Amarinder’s 'closeness to BJP’, says 'insulted by Congress' charge baseless; Capt hits back||Chandigarh, October 1Congress Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat on Friday questioned Capt Amarinder Singh’s “humiliated” remark, saying that no facts suggested that the former chief minister was "insulted by the Congress".Rawat, who is in Dehradun, said that the party had retained him as the chief minister for several years, “how can that be humiliation?”He alleged Amarinder’s “closeness to some BJP leaders” and questioned his credibility, alleging that "Capt was acting under the BJP leadership pressure".“It appears from Amarinder's recent statements that he is under some sort of pressure. He should do a rethink, and not help the BJP directly or indirectly,” said Rawat.Capt rejects Rawat’s claims, says Congress clearly on back foot in Punjab nowTaking strong exception to Harish Rawat’s no-holds barred attack against him, former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday rejected the Congress Punjab in-charge’s outrageous claims and allegations, which he said were clearly prompted by the pathetic situation the party now found itself in the state after being on a winning spree for four and a half years.“Three weeks before stepping down as CM, I had offered my resignation to Mrs. Sonia Gandhi but she had asked me to continue,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that the humiliating manner in which he was pushed into resigning just hours before the CLP meeting, which was clearly convened to oust him, was a matter of public record.“The world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet Mr. Rawat is making claims to the contrary,” he remarked, adding “If this was not humiliation then what was it?”Rawat, he said, should put himself in his (Capt Amarinder’s) shoes, and then, perhaps, he would realise how insulting the entire affair was.The former chief minister of Punjab recalled that Rawat himself had publicly stated after meeting him that he was satisfied by his government’s track record on the 2017 poll promises.In fact, the Congress in-charge of Punjab had categorically stated, as recently as September 1, that the 2022 elections would be fought under his (Capt Amarinder’s) leadership and the high command had no intention of replacing him, he pointed out.“So how can he now claim that the party leadership was dissatisfied with me, and if they were, then why did he deliberately keep me in the dark all this time?” he asked.Ridiculing Rawat’s remarks that he (Capt Amarinder) seemed to be under pressure, the former chief minister said the only pressure he had been under for the past few months was that of his own loyalty to the Congress, because of which he continued to tolerate insult after insult.“If the party did not intend to humiliate me then why was Navjot Singh Sidhu allowed to openly criticise and attack me on social media and other public platforms for months? Why did the party give the rebels, led by Sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? Why was no cognisance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins I handed over to the party through the 4 and a half years I was in the saddle?” he asked.Capt Amarinder asked why the Congress was allowing Sidhu even now to hold the party to ransom and continue to dictate terms.“What is the pressure he exerts on the party leadership that they are so defenceless against him and are allowing him to have his way even to the cost of the Congress’ future in Punjab?” he asked.Reacting to Rawat’s comment regarding his secular credentials, Capt Amarinder said even his worst critics and enemies could not doubt his integrity in this regard.“But I am no longer surprised that a senior and seasoned Congress leader like Mr. Rawat is questioning my secular credentials. It is quite evident that I am no longer trusted and respected in the party that I have served loyally all these years,” he added.Categorically denying Rawat’s allegation that he (Capt Amarinder) had refused to meet Channi after the latter’s swearing-in, the former chief minister said Channi had called him up on the day of his swearing-in and was supposed to come over but failed to turn up.As for not taking Rawat’s calls, Capt Amarinder said it was all humbug. “We spoke just a day before the CLP meeting was called. Mr. Rawat told me then there was nothing in the works and even claimed he had not seen any letter sent by 43 MLAs. I am shocked at the blatant way in which he is now lying about this,” the former chief minister added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rawat-questions-amarinders-closeness-to-bjp-says-insulted-by-congress-charge-baseless-capt-hits-back-318733
02-10-2021||Tribune Web Desk||Archana Puran Singh had decided to vacate her seat on The Kapil Sharma Show for Navjot Sidhu. Read what her plans were||Chandigarh, October 1It’s a task sitting for six to seven hours in a particular position in a sofa, facing the stage and listening to every joke that is being cracked and then react to it.A debate within the fans had arisen with the possibility of Navjot Singh Sidhu returning to The Kapil Sharma Show and how it would affect Archana Puran Singh.Archana has an answer to all those who feel that she will not have anything to do if she has to vacate the show, in case Navjot Singh Sidhu wanted to re-enter.It all began with Sidhu quitting the Punjab Congress chief post and paved a way for memes, a few of which Archana Puran Singh, too, shared on her Instagram account.A post shared by Archana Puran Singh (@archanapuransingh)  Archana Puran Singh, in an interview had said, “If Sidhu would seriously re-enter the show in my place, I will have many other things to do, which I have refused in the past few months. Since I am shooting for two days in a week for the show, I can't take up any assignment, which is out of Mumbai or India. In the past few months, I got several opportunities to shoot in London and other foreign countries but I had to say a no because of my commitment to the show.”The cast has also often joked about how Sidhu's return could pose a threat to Archana's position on the show. Addressing these jokes, Archana said, “Kapil's show writers come up with all kinds of jokes and I can't help but laugh at them because they are funny. It is a task to come up with gags everyday and keep the show running for the last 10 years. But all those who feel I don't have anything to do in the show should come on the sets to see how it is not easy to sit 6-7 hours in a particular position, facing the stage. I have to constantly sit in an angle for 4-7 hours on that sofa and face the stage, listen to every joke that's cracked and then react to it.”Actor Archana Puran Singh had replaced Sidhu as the guest judge on the show when he left in 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/archana-puran-singh-had-decided-to-vacate-her-seat-on-the-kapil-sharma-show-for-navjot-sidhu-read-what-her-plans-were-318728
02-10-2021||New Delhi||Punjab CM Channi meets PM Modi, seeks repeal of farm laws; evades queries on Sidhu||Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded repeal of the three farm laws, resolution of the farmers’ pending issues and urgent commencement of procurement.Speaking to reporters here after a half-an-hour meeting at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the CM said he flagged three major issues with the PM in his first official meeting after taking up the chief minister’s position.“It was a courtesy call but I did raise three issues. The first was procurement. Procurement season in Punjab always begins on October 1. In the past nearly 70 years, procurement may have been preponed but it has never been delayed. This time the Centre has delayed it to October 10. I have demanded that procurement be commenced immediately and the PM said he would look into the issue,” CM Channi said.On farmers’ issues, the CM said the prolonged agitation over the three farm laws was “hurting the agriculture driven economy of Punjab whose people had fought and died for the country”.“I urged the prime minister to end this agitation over the three farm bills. He heard me patiently and said he also wants the problem to be solved and was working in the direction. I told the PM that agriculture was the mainstay of our economy and incomes. I also requested the PM to resume the stalled dialogue with farmers and repeal the laws,” the CM added.He said Punjab was suffering and could progress only if the farmers and farm workers were satisfied and happy.The CM told the PM that Punjab’s people had sacrificed their lives in the freedom struggle and for the unity of the country.Evades queries on Navjot Singh SidhuCM Channi did not take any questions on Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and the ongoing deadlock in the state over key appointments he has made. When asked what he had to say on Sidhu, the CM deflected the issue telling reporters, “What kind of intelligence do you have that you came to know even before me that I had a 40 minute talk with the PM? We are proud of you.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-channi-meets-pm-modi-seeks-repeal-of-farm-laws-evades-queries-on-sidhu-318719
