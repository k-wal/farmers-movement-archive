03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Centre has got positive help from Punjab, Haryana, UP, Delhi on stubble burning: Union Environment Minister||The Centre has got constructive cooperation from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments on the issue of stubble burning, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said on Sunday.Yadav had held a key meeting last month with the governments of Delhi and its neighbouring states Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on the action plan to mitigate air pollution caused by stubble burning.Yadav, who is also the minister for Forest and Climate Change and Labour and Employment, said on the issue of pollution caused by stubble burning, the Centre has got constructive cooperation from these northern states.He said discussions were held last month over the implementation of action plans by states to mitigate pollution due to agriculture stubble burning, dust, construction and demolition waste, and vehicular pollution.The minister, while interacting with reporters here, said with technologies available now, there was economic viability of stubble nowadays.The state-run NTPC had earlier floated a tender to buy farm stubble for use as fuel at power plants, he said.Some private companies too have come up with good experiments under which stubble or crop residue is turned into manure, said the minister.Touching upon the issue of machines needed to deal with stubble, Yadav said the Union Agriculture Ministry has given nearly Rs 700 crore to these northern states.Notably, farmers in Punjab, Haryana and some other states set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato.Experts have claimed it is one of the main reasons for the spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR at the onset of winters.The paddy harvesting season is between October 15 and November 15.In the country’s 132 cities, equipment to monitor air quality has been set up, he said.Replying to a question on climate change, Yadav said it is a global challenge.India recognises the urgency of strong climate action to stay within the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, he said.Yadav also said India has taken many steps on clean energy, energy efficiency and biodiversity.He said the country has set an ambitious renewable energy target of 450 Gigawatts by 2030.Earlier, addressing an event at the Shram Bureau (Labour Bureau) Bhavan here, Yadav said following the motto of “Mehnat Ko Samman, Adhikar Ek Saman”, the Government is focused on the welfare of workers through evidence-based policymaking.During the event, he mentioned that data on all aspects of labour is crucial and scientifically collected data is the bedrock for any evidence-based policymaking.With the increasing importance of data in the time to come, coupled with the fact that India is a labour abundant nation, a dedicated organisation for labour and price statistics like the Labour Bureau merits strengthening and full support, said the minister.The Union Minister further said over the years, the Labour Bureau mandate has increased exponentially which now includes the collection and compilation of data on all possible aspects of labour.On the occasion, certificates of appreciation were also given to many of the Bureau officials.The minister also held discussions with the state labour ministers, labour secretaries & commissioners of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh & UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh on progress in the registration of unorganised workers on the e-Shram portal and preparedness of the states and UTs on the implementation of various schemes and reforms, an official statement said.The Minister also visited a special camp for the registration of unorganised workers under “e-Shram” portal organised by the office of chief labour commissioner (Central) under the Union Ministry of Labour & Employment.The minister distributed e-Shram cards to unorganised workers and had an interaction with trade union leaders, employers and unorganised workers.The e-Shram portal was inaugurated on August 26. The portal is the first-ever national database of unorganised workers including migrant workers and construction workers.An estimated 38 crore workers are engaged in the unorganized sector and employment (Economic Survey, 2019-20), Yadav said.As of October 2, 2021, a total of 2,46,57,524 workers have registered on the portal.Of these almost 55 per cent of the workers are engaged in the agriculture sector followed by almost 15 per cent registration from the workers in the construction sector and six per cent in the apparel industry.

Agarwal—a single parent with some medical issues—alleged that due to blockades enforced by agitating farmers travelling between NOIDA and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes and that it had become a nightmare to commute between Noida and Delhi.Earlier, in an affidavit filed in the top court, he Haryana Government had said it’s making “sincere” efforts to remove the blockade for resumption of free flow of traffic. The UP government had also filed a similar affidavit stating that it’s making all efforts to convince farmers that their act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.Giving details of its efforts, the Haryana Government said a state-level committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary was formed to find a way out. The panel’s September 19 meeting wasn’t attended by the farmers’ leaders.As farmers continued to block key roads connecting Delhi to NCR regions, the Supreme Court had on September 30 wondered how highways can be blocked perpetually and made it clear that it’s the duty of the executive to implement the law laid down by it.“The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had asked.“We may lay down a law but how to implement the law is your (the government’s) business. The court can’t implement it. It is the Executive which has to implement it,” it had noted.On October 1, another Bench of the top court had questioned the rationale behind blocking roads even after approaching the judiciary and reminded the agitating farmers that citizens had equal rights to move freely without fear.“You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city and start protesting again here… The residents around... are they happy with the protest? This business should stop. You are obstructing security and defence personnel. This was in the media. All this should stop…There has to be a balanced approach,” a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar had said.The Bench was hearing Kisan Mahapanchayat’s plea seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt. Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow them to hold dharna at Jantar Mantar in the capital.Both the matters are listed for hearing on Monday.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the top court had on October 7, last year ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.The top court had on August 23 asked the Centre and governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to find a solution to the blockade of roads connecting Delhi with NCR towns by farmers agitating against the three farm laws.The farmers have a right to protest at a designated space, but they can’t block the traffic, a Bench had said. “The solution lies in the hands of the Union of India and state governments...Mr Mehta what is happening? You have to find a solution, they might have the right to a place to agitate, but the roads can’t be blocked like this.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/haryana-seeks-to-make-farmer-leaders-parties-to-pil-seeking-removal-of-blockades-319636

But not scared of the threat, the protesting farmers occupied the helipad where the minister was supposed to land. In protest, the minister’s son and his close aides came in cars and mowed down farmers. At least 10 farmers are seriously injured, besides the three who have died,” he alleged.The BKU leader said their message to the farmers was clear – “BJP is not with us, but we are with our country”. “We are asking them not to take law in their own hands. We demand that an FIR on charges of homicide be registered against the minister and his aides and a sitting judge of the Supreme Court conduct an investigation into the incident. The minister should be immediately sacked by the BJP government,” he demanded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-samyukt-kisan-morcha-appeals-to-farmers-to-maintain-peace-319635

I was already saying he is more allied with the BJP and Akali Dal. His party will ultimately be supported by the BJP. Because he has also met Amit Shah already. It is possible they form an alliance before the 2022 elections. He has been keeping such alliances since the beginning.”Responding to queries on the presence of CM Charanjit Singh Channni’s son with his father, in an official state meeting, Pargat said, “Langhde varde bande di photo khich ho jandi hai. (A photo of a person is clicked while they are passing by). There is no such thing. He wasn’t in the meeting officially.”Speaking on the resistance to the appointments of the state DGP and AG, Pargat said, “Everything has been settled. A high powered committee had been made in which state CM, Navjot Singh Sidhu and state general secretary as chairman will be present. We are sorting out the issue.”Pargat was at the local mandi reviewing paddy procurement, accompanied by Jalandhar MP Chaudhary Santokh Singh and DC Ghanshyam Thori.Meanwhile, Capt Amarinder Singh termed Pargat’s allegations “nonsense”.What nonsense? Do you really think the people of Punjab will believe I'd ever collude with @BJP4India to delay procurement? And have you forgotten it affected BJP-led Haryana too? Or are you too naïve to understand these things?': @capt_amarinder to @13pargatsingh  'And do you have any proof for these lies?

Even prices of other items have also gone high, he said.At the end of his address, Parkash Badal said, “Today I have come out in public after a long time, I want to say my health is not well as my age is also increasing, but for Punjab, wherever I am needed, I am ready to go.”Further, he said that by coming to this meeting, I have increased my age by 2-3 years and if the SAD-BSP government is formed then I have definitely completed my century.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and Harsimrat Kaur Badal also addressed the meeting and they listed out their achievements during SAD government.They also warned the government and gave an ultimatum to announce compensation for farmers whose cotton crop has been damaged within a week, or else SAD would gehrao the house of the chief minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/former-cm-parkash-singh-badal-makes-comeback-to-political-stage-during-protest-rally-in-bathinda-319612

But, a day earlier, Rawat had, in a press statement, said 43 MLAs had written to the high command on the issue. “It seems the entire party has become imbued with Navjot Singh Sidhu’s sense of comic theatrics,” he said.“This is the state of affairs in the party.

Upon being asked to stop by local residents for fear of sub-standard work being carried out, the labourers refused. Thereafter, local residents live-streamed the work on Facebook and demanded a high-level inquiry and action.“The labourers were laying bitumen near the Zila Parishad office during rain and locals were opposing it. I was passing by, but when I saw the work being done amid rain, I also interfered but they refused to stop. Then I streamed live on Facebook the construction of road amid rain.

After being stopped, the farmers sat on a dharna on the road leading to the Deputy Commissioner’s office.Meanwhile, a large number of farmers carried out a protest march and raised slogans against the state and the central governments. The cavalcade of protesting farmers was stopped by heavy police force deployed outside the DC’s office, which the protesters had planned to gherao.Ram Singh Bhaini Bagha, district unit president, BKU Ugrahan, said: “This was the first step in the direction of moving towards the new agricultural laws. Already the limit of moisture content has been reduced from 17 per cent to 16 per cent and by delaying procurement, the Centre wanted to favour private players who could loot farmers as per their vested business interests.” Inderjit Singh, union general secretary, said: “If the government had already fixed quality parameters to purchase paddy, delaying the procurement on account of heavy rainfall did not make sense.Massive Protest in AboharAbohar: Protesting delay in paddy procurement, farmers on Saturday staged a dharna outside the residence of BJP MLA Arun Narang on the Gaushala Road here.However, the police did not allow them to go beyond the main street.

Transmitters on these towers have been relaying terrestrial transmission to TV sets through the old-fashioned roof-top antennae. Satellite channels have drastically reduced the use of terrestrial transmission.Erected at Bathinda, Fazilka, Jalandhar and Amritsar, they cover the entire state. Barring Jalandhar’s tower, sources in the Prasar Bharti said the rest of the three would cease to operate in the coming months. The country’s third oldest tower in Amritsar, which has been in operation since 1973, will cease to operate on December 31, Bathinda’s tower by the fag end of October and Fazilka’s by March 2022.The border district’s 100-metre high tower at Basarke Gillan village has two high-powered transmitters of 20 kilowatts each relaying Doordarshan Punjab and Doordarshan National, on VHF channel seven and UHF channel 29. Signals of these transmitters are picked up by using roof-top antennae in the neighbouring area of Pakistan too. In addition, the tower is also being used by four private companies running FM programmes.Hardeep Singh Chahal, a local, said, “On the line of Jalandhar’s tower, the local tower must be kept intact as its programmes are watched in and around Lahore. So they perfectly work to disseminate the Indian viewpoints directly to the people of Pakistan. This anticipated closure of Doordarshan transmitters is an unfortunate development.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-to-stop-ops-of-3-terrestrial-towers-in-state-319347

The arrested person has been identified as Bhola Singh, alias Khalsa, of Jeonwala village of Faridkot. He is facing as many as five criminal cases, including murder and extortion.Security threatThe police had got a tip-off about the threat to the life of Shakti Singh after four KTF operatives were arrested and interrogated by the Moga police in May this year. These operatives were arrested by the police for the alleged killing of a dera follower in Bathinda last year.Shakti Singh and five other dera followers were arrested by the police on May 16 this year. However, after Shakti Singh was released on bail on July 28, there were increased threats to his life.After three suspicious persons visited Shakti Singh at his house in Daggo Romana village here, the police had registered a criminal case against three persons for trespass and theft attempt under Sections 449 and 511, IPC, on September 15. The police were on a high alert in view of increased threat perception.On Saturday, the police arrested Bhola Singh when he was moving around the house of Shakti Singh.The police were further investigating the case to trace the links of Bhola Singh, said Bal Krishan Singla, SP (D), Faridkot.In view of increased threat perception to the lives of these dera followers and family members of late Mohinder Pal Bittu, the accused in the sacrilege incidents of 2015, the Faridkot police had tightened their security here some time back.The police had advised the dera followers to stay home in view of increased threat to their lives.

03-10-2021||Saurabh Malik||Legal debate over Bains’ appointment||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 2When senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains was appointed as a special public prosecutor for the politically sensitive sacrilege matters, one of the factors considered by the Punjab Government was his appearance for the main complainant in a related ‘police firing’ case. This very factor has now generated a legal debate primarily on the premise that a lawyer for the complainant legally cannot be appointed as a prosecutor in the same case.Bains was chosen for the special PP’s post following a political storm over senior advocate APS Deol’s appointment as the Advocate-General of Punjab. Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu had, among other things, cited Deol’s appointment for stepping down from the state chief’s post on September 28. Deol’s appointment was objected to on the ground of conflict of interest as he, being Saini and Umaranangal’s counsel, would neither be able to appear nor advise the state in their cases and related matters. Bains, on the other hand, was the counsel for main complainant Ajit Singh in the Kotkapura firing cases and had represented the complainant when the investigation in the matter was quashed by the High Court.Information suggests the decision to appoint Bains may, however, be not legally sound and the prosecution conducted by him could be a subject matter of challenge on the ground of being vitiated in law. The accused could seek the setting aside of the entire trial at any stage on this technical ground.There are, in fact, a plethora of judgments on the subject, starting from the 1924 verdict in Anant Chanderkar’s case right up to 2002 in Rekha Murarka’s case, where the Supreme Court struck down the appointment of public prosecutors, who were in some manner either connected to the filing of the criminal case, had taken a public position in the matter or where the counsel for the victim had been given a role in the prosecution of the matter.In any case, the sole aim of the public prosecutor is not to seek a conviction, even though he is appointed by the state. His role has been interpreted by the courts as an “officer of the court” and “minister of justice”, required to place before the court all evidence in his possession, whether it is in favour of, or against the accused. He is not to single-mindedly seek conviction regardless of the evidence — a tough thing for a counsel for a complainant to do.Accused could cite ‘technicality’Information suggests the decision to appoint Rajwinder Singh Bains may be not legally sound and the prosecution conducted by him could be a subject matter of challenge on the ground of being vitiated in law. The accused could seek the setting aside of the entire trial at any stage on this technical ground.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/legal-debate-over-bains-appointment-319353

The number of 1.10 lakh in 2020 was almost 20 per cent less as compared to the average cases reported in state government hospitals in 2019, which stood at 1.34 lakh. However, the cases started increasing this year. Till July, around 73,000 cases have already been reported in state government hospitals.State programme officer for rabies Dr Preeti Thaware said people avoided going outside during the lockdown, which led to a significant decrease in stray dog-bite cases. “But when the lockdown opened, the cases again started increasing,” she said.Looking at the trend, so far in 2021, the number of cases may increase even more than the cases reported in 2019, she said. Significantly, the number of dog-bite cases is on a continuous increase as despite intervention at the highest level, the coordination between Local Bodies, Rural Development and Panchayats and Animal Husbandry Departments is lacking.Almost four years have passed but the dog population control programme could not go beyond a few districts. As per the government estimate, at present, the dog population in the state is around 5 lakh and of them, over three lakh are street dogs.A data of dog-bite cases of the past five years reveals in the last four years, around five lakh cases of dog bites were reported. Ludhiana is the worst affected where around 15,000 cases have been reported. It is followed by Patiala and Jalandhar with around 10,000 cases and Hoshiarpur with more than 9,000 cases. The situation in Sangrur is also not good with more than 6,000 cases.Booklet on rabies awareness launchedChandigarh: On the occasion of World Rabies Day recently, director, National Health Mission, Kumar Rahul released a booklet to increase the community awareness about rabies, responsible dog ownership, bite prevention and post exposure prophylaxis. Rahul said rabies was a viral and fatal disease that accounted for 20,000 deaths in India annually but it was entirely avoidable.

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Will halt projects in Sangrur: State to HC||The state of Punjab has undertaken not to go ahead with “any further construction activity” after a petition filed before the Punjab and Haryana High Court alleged carrying out of unsanctioned public works, constructions, and uprooting of very old trees in Sangrur merely at the instance of a minister.The undertaking by the state counsel before the Bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli will remain in force at least till October 5, the next date of hearing in the matter. Taking up the petition filed by Jasinder Sekhon and two other petitioners, the Bench issued a notice of motion to the state of Punjab through the Chief Secretary and other respondents.At the outset, the Bench also accepted the petitioners’ prayer for deleting the minister’s name from the array of parties. Senior counsel for the petitioners RS Bains with advocate Aarush Garg submitted that the minister was not a necessary party.After accepting the notice, Assistant Advocate-General Avinit Awasthi prayed for a short accommodation to file reply/affidavit. On instructions from Principal Secretary, Department of PWD (B&R), Vikas Partap Singh, Awasthi submitted that the state was conscious of its responsibility. As such, “it would not undertake any further construction activity, till the adjourned date”. Appearing before the Bench, Bains contended the minister wanted to spend as much money as possible in the shortest possible time for extraneous reasons. In the process, he was not only going against the basic plan of the city and the master plan, but the process was being carried out without the sanction plans of the municipal committee which was the authorised authority. “The expenditure is wasteful to the extent that when the Civil Hospital and the schools are crying for attention, public fund is being used for complete beautification which itself makes the city ugly,” Bains submitted. Giving a list of works being executed, Bains added the petitioner’s first grievance was that the Public Works Department was constructing four welcome gates — Sunami Gate, Patiala Gate, Dhuri Gate and Nabha Gate. These were being constructed arbitrarily, without sanctioning of site plans and requisite permissions of the Sangrur Municipal Council.“The petitioners are aggrieved by the state of affairs in the city of Sangrur where the authorities have closed their eyes and ears towards a number of illegalities happening in the city which is ripping the city of its heritage character and turning it into a slum city,” it was added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-halt-projects-in-sangrur-state-to-hc-319355

03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress turmoil: Comedy of errors from a panic-stricken party, says Amarinder; counters accusations||Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh accused Congress of spreading “preposterous lies to cover up” the political crisis in the state.A press release from Capt Amarinder Singh’s camp on Saturday said conflicting numbers were shared by Harish Rawat, the AICC general secretary in charge of Punjab, and Randeep Surjewala, a spokesperson for the Congress, over the purported letter received by the party’s central leadership expressing lack of confidence against him and said they were a “comedy of errors”.His remarks came after Surjewala claimed that 78 of the 79 Punjab Congress MLAs had written to the party leadership asking for Captain Amarinder’s ouster. Just a day before that, Rawat had told the press that 43 MLAs had written to the high command. “It seems the entire party has become imbued with Navjot Singh Sidhu’s sense of comic theatrics,” he said. “Next they will claim that 117 MLAs wrote to them against me!”“This is the state of affairs in the party. They cannot even coordinate their lies properly,” the press release quoted him as saying. “The fact of the matter was that the 43-odd MLAs who had signed the said letter had been forced to do so under duress,” he claimed.He said Congress was in a state of disarray and that several senior leaders of the party were disenchanted with it.  Its state of panic was evident in the statements of its leaders and, grappling with internal chaos, it was trying hard to shift the blame of its own failures.“It’s sad to see the way they are resorting to blatant lies to justify their wrongdoings,” he added.He claimed the whole affair had been orchestrated by a few leaders at the behest of Navjot Singh Sidhu. “This was evident from the lies Harish Rawat had mouthed yesterday, even on a sensitive and emotive issue like Bargari and the subsequent police firing cases,” said Captain Amarinder, claiming that these “falsehoods” could cost the party in the upcoming elections.“Had I been hand in glove with the Badals, as they are alleging, I would not have spent the last 13 years fighting them in courts?”  SacrilegeHe claimed his government “successfully” dealt with all three major sacrilege cases between June and October 2015. “In fact, the 3 main accused (Mohinder Pal @ Bittu, Sukhjinder Singh @ Sunny & Shakti Singh) wanted for the sacrilege incidents were arrested on July 5, within 16 months of the Congress government taking over,” the press release quoted Capt Amarinder as saying.“Further, in the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan firing cases, senior-most police officers, including IGP Pramraj Umranagal and SSP Chanranjit Sharma, were arrested within two years of the Congress taking over the state’s reins,” he said.“About 12 people, including DGP Sumedh Singh Sani and former MLA Mantar Singh Brar, were nominated and chargesheeted in the case.  In both these cases, 7 chargesheets were filed but some of these were struck down by the high court,” he said, accusing Sidhu and his aides of raising what he called was a “bogey of no action” to grab power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-congress-turmoil-comedy-of-errors-from-a-panic-stricken-party-says-amarinder-counters-accusations-319240

Had we not changed the CM, you would have accused us of being a dictator. Seventy-eight MLAs are on one side and a CM is on the other side and you are not listening to them,” said Surjewala while addressing the media here.“Sonia Gandhi is the president of the Congress party and the decision on changing the CM in Punjab was not taken by her. As I told you, 78 MLAs had written and then we changed the CM,” added Surjewala.Notably, Amarinder Singh had earlier rejected the charge of the Congress leadership that he had lost the confidence of the MLAs.The former chief minister had said he would quit the Congress which he had asserted was going downhill with senior leaders being ignored.Surjewala said it was for the first time in Punjab a person belonging to the Scheduled Caste community became chief minister and a new history was created.He questioned the BJP whether they have any chief minister belonging to the SC.“If the Congress has made a move, what is their problem?” he asked the BJP.Surjewala also took a dig at the BJP, referring to changes of chief ministers in BJP-ruled states of Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Karnataka.To a question on some party MLAs of Chhattisgarh camping in Delhi, Surjewala said it is the party’s internal matter.

The Chief Minister thanks Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his personal indulgence to resolve this issue expeditiously,” the Punjab CMO tweeted.The Punjab Chief Minister met PM Modi yesterday, who “assured him of early resolution of this issue”.Farmers in Punjab and Haryana today held protests at many places against postponing paddy procurement, prompting the Centre to hasten the process. TheCentre had earlier decided to delay the procurement of paddy under MSP to October 11 in Punjab and Haryana is in the “overall interest of farmers and consumers as well as to accept paddy stock as per FAQ”.“Procurement of paddy at high moisture content is fraught with risk of increase in damage percentage of rice grain. The grain will become vulnerable to shriveling, blackening, discolouration and prone to infestation. This may lead to rejection at procurement centres and would lead to distress sale of paddy and consequent loss to the farmers,” officials said, adding that the Haryana government had also written to the Centre intimating about the untimely rain and requested for relaxation in Moisture Content in the paddy.“The better course would be to harvest the paddy crop offered after a period of 10 days, that is after proper maturity then the problem of moisture in the paddy grain can be minimised. Accordingly, State Government of Punjab and Haryana have also been requested to advise their agencies to dry the paddy already arrived and further produce may be brought to the mandi after proper drying,” the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said yesterday.According to officials, widespread untimely showers across Punjab and Haryana during the second fortnight of September have affected the standing paddy crop in both the agrarian states. The maximum temperature at most of the places has also been recorded below normal due to downpour.“There was heavy downpour on September 29 and 30 in some parts of the States of Punjab and Haryana. Because of the untimely rains, maturity of paddy grains is delayed,” they said.Quoting the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), officials said rainfall during September 2021 is 77% and 139% above normal in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.“On the basis of moisture content check by FCI’s regional offices at Punjab and Haryana, it was reported that paddy samples are having moisture ranging from 18% to 22% in Punjab and 18.2% to 22.7% in Haryana against the permissible limit of 17%.“Accordingly, to save farmers from inconvenience and to protect farmer’s interest, Government of India decided that procurement of paddy under MSP operation would commence from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana and advised all agencies to gear up dying to help farmers,” the ministry stated yesterday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-relents-after-protests-paddy-procurement-to-begin-in-punjab-haryana-from-sunday-319232
