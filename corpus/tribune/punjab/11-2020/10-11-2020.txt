The entire strategy for the meeting with the Centre will be jointly decided, before we go to Delhi,‚Äù said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU Rajewal.Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU Dakaunda, said they remained steadfast in their demand that the laws passed by the Centre had to be repealed.Farmers in Punjab have been protesting against the three agriculture laws passed by the Parliament in September, saying these laws are aimed at corporatising the agriculture sector. While farmers held a Rail Roko protest, sitting on the railway tracks from October 1 to November 3, they have also been holding protests outside the residences of BJP leaders and businesses run by corporate houses.The farmer unions have only allowed passage to the goods services trains, while they remain adamant that passenger trains would not be allowed to run. The Centre has decided to keep all rail services suspended. As train services in the state remain suspended, the state has suffered huge economic losses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-invites-protesting-farm-unions-of-punjab-for-talks-on-friday-168804

After some time, such persons become addicts. Turning down his regular bail plea, Justice HS Madaan also made it clear that drug peddlers were required to be dealt with firmly and sternly. Any misplaced sympathy for them in granting bail liberally would result in increased drug trafficking, exposing more people to the menace and creating turmoil in society.Justice Madaan also made it clear that the accused could not plead parity and claim benefit similar to the one granted to a co-accused. The court granting bail was required to take into consideration various factors.The factors included ‚Äúthe role played by each of the accused in the incident, the past criminal record of each accused, the control which could be exercised over each accused to ensure appearance in the court regularly, chances of trying to threaten the prosecution witnesses or influencing them and chances of absconding from the proceedings‚Äù. In his detailed order, Justice Madaan asserted counsel for the petitioner‚Äôs argument was that the contraband‚Äôs weight with polythene was 255 gm. If the polythene and heroin were weighed separately, the recovered contraband would come out to be less than 250 gm, making it non-commercial. It was not explained how the weight of the recovered heroin would be less than 250 gm after deducting weight of the polythene, and from where it could be inferred that its weight was six gm or more.Normally, the polythene used for wrapping did not weigh that much. Merely on the basis of presumptions and suppositions, the polythene‚Äôs weight could not be taken to be so to bring the recovery under the non-commercial quantity category.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/drug-peddlers-need-to-be-dealt-with-sternly-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-168453

Behind, the government was suspected to have increased the limit of paddy to be allotted to mills under the release order scheme, between 375 metric tonne and 2,000 metric tonne.Mitra said though they were sure it was not possible as all processes for getting release orders were transparent and done online, upon receiving some complaints, they immediately swung into action and started getting physical verification of the mills done.‚ÄúThe department has already verified all such rice mills in Fazilka district and most of the mills in Sangrur. Checking of such mills in Patiala is under way. So far, we have not found any mill where the stocks were short,‚Äù she said, adding in a case where rice meant for the public distribution system was found, the mill was immediately blacklisted and FIR registered.The Director, Food Supplies, said they were also getting checks conducted in all mandis that had seen an unusually high arrival of paddy. ‚ÄúNineteen such mandis were examined today. We have observed that this phenomenon is more prevalent in mandis near the Haryana border. It is assumed Punjab farmers are not going to Haryana to sell their produce because of the Covid guidelines, but are selling it here,‚Äù she said.182.98 LMT procured||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/physical-checking-at-mandis-as-paddy-target-exceeded-in-punjab-168415

The authorities in every district should work on this. We will study the orders in detail and monitor the situation accordingly.As per the orders, if anyone in Delhi is caught bursting firecrackers during the ban, he/she can be sentenced to 1.5-6 years in jail. The ban has been imposed ahead of Diwali to prevent further rise in air pollution and will be applicable to more than two dozen districts across four states that are part of the National Capital Region (NCR). Only green crackers ‚Äî considered less polluting ‚Äî will be sold in cities and towns where air quality is ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù.‚ÄúOur super stockists in Delhi are offering discounts on crackers exceeding 20 per cent, and with down payments in cash, it touches 36 per cent over and above the discount,‚Äù said Amandeep Singh, a wholesale dealer from Ludhiana‚Äôs Daresi road.Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that wholesalers in Punjab are being offered heavy discounts, in addition to delivery of the crackers within Punjab for bulk orders.

No plan was scheduled to observe the occasion owing it to Union Government‚Äôs denial to open the visa-free passage on ‚Äòhealth grounds‚Äô from its side. Nonetheless, at Dera Baba Nanak, there was clamour to reopen the corridor.The corridor was closed by India on March 15 as part of measures to curb the Covid-19 spread.

Later, it was adopted as a part of series of policy briefs on Punjab by the Centre for Development Economics and Innovation Studies at Punjabi University, Patiala.According to the study in 2019, 10 types of crop residual management machines, including zero till drill, paddy straw chopper, RMB plough, mulcher, super SMS, cutter-cum-spreader, super seeder and super master were sanctioned for distribution in Punjab. As many as 22,854 machines were to be delivered among farmers on subsidy. However, the state government could make available only 14,625 machines.Besides, the study found that in-situ management machines were still unaffordable to many farmers despite the provision of subsidy. A ‚ÄòHappy Seeder‚Äô costs Rs 1.5 lakh and requires a 65-horsepower tractor. Small farmers can‚Äôt buy the machinery, even with the 50 per cent subsidy. ‚ÄúConstraints in the supply chain and rental markets are other issues impacting adoption of machines like the Happy Seeder,‚Äù it said.Though the government provides 80 per cent subsidy to cooperative societies to rent out machines to farmers, most of the societies do not have funds to buy the machinery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-unable-to-afford-stubble-management-machines-study-168419
