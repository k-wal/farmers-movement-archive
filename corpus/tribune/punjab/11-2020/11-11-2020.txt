11-11-2020||Rajesh Sharma||Shortage of fertilisers in Una due to agitation by Punjab farmers||Una, November 10Wheat sowing is underway in Una district, which is considered the food bowl of the state. However, farmers, who cultivate wheat crop on 36,000 hectares in the district, are upset over the non-availability of fertilisers recommended by the Agriculture Department to be used at the time of sowing.The required fertilisers could not be transported to the state due to the ongoing farmers‚Äô agitation in Punjab against the new agriculture laws. NPK and urea are the two major granular fertilisers the farmers use at the time of sowing. Both commodities are not available either at the IFFCO store in the district or at the village-level primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS).District Agriculture Officer Santosh Kumari says the sowing of rabi crops has begun and about 15 per cent of wheat seeds have already been sown in the district.Santosh says that the recommended application rate of NPK fertiliser is about 50 kg per acre (around 150 kg per hectare). For urea, the application rate is around 50 kg per hectare. According to the data provided by the department, the farmers will require 5,400 metric tonnes of NPK and 1,800 MT of urea at the time of wheat sowing.IFFCO supplies a major share of fertilisers to the PACS in the district, while HIMFED is the second procurement and distribution agency. IFFCO Area Manager Bhuvnesh Pathania says that two rail rakes containing about 5,200 metric tonnes of NPK meant for this region are stuck on the way due to the farmers‚Äô agitation. He admits that not even one bag of NPK or urea is available at their store. He adds that uncertainty prevails regarding the transportation of fertilisers. HIMFED district manager Kamlesh Kumar says that their office has ordered 100 metric tonnes of NPK, which are still awaited.The district agriculture office has expressed helplessness over the issue and it has apprised the head office of the prevailing situation. Meanwhile, farmers have already tilled, leveled and readied their fields for sowing but their visits to the PACS for fertilisers are proving to be futile.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/shortage-of-fertilisers-in-una-due-to-agitation-by-punjab-farmers-169093
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||2-hours window to burst green crackers in Punjab||The Punjab Government today announced a two-hour window for the use of green firecrackers on Diwali and Gurpurb across the state, barring Mandi Gobindgarh town. The fireworks timing has been restricted to 35 minutes on the Christmas Eve in the state.A complete ban has been imposed in the industrial town of Mandi Gobindgarh from November 9-10 to November 30-December 1 midnight on account of its poor air quality index (AQI) levels.What orders sayThe announcement is contrary to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directions that call for a complete ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in cities that had poor average ambient air quality levels during November last year.Four major towns ‚Äî Amritsar, Jalandhar, Khanna and Ludhiana ‚Äî that fall in the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù air quality category classified by the NGT have been spared from a total ban, as per the orders issued by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today.The state government said only green crackers would be allowed in compliance with the NGT directives as well as various judicial orders passed amid reports of firecrackers likely to aggravate the Covid-19 problem.Drive to stop illegal sale in Muktsar failsMuktsar: The district police on Tuesday conducted a drive in some busy markets to prevent illegal sale of firecrackers. However, a number of shopkeepers got the information in advance and rolled down the shutters before the police arrived. Meanwhile, the fire safety office has written to the SDM, expressing its inability to deal with the sale in narrow markets. TNSWhile on Diwali (November 14), green crackers can be burst from 8 pm to 10 pm, on Gurpurb (November 30) these will be allowed from 4 am to 5 am and from 9 pm to 10 pm. On Christmas Eve, people can burst crackers from 11.55 pm till 12.30 am.The Chief Minister has asked DGP Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict compliance of the restrictions and initiate penal action against offenders as per the law.Government officials said since the state had been hit hard first by the pandemic and then the farmers‚Äô agitation, the sale and use of green crackers would boost the economy and help the cracker industry, worth over Rs 200 crore.Kurali, one of region‚Äôs biggest cracker sale hubs, sees a business of nearly Rs 8 crore every year. Till last evening, the Department of Science, Technology and Environment had been contemplating implementation of the NGT orders in the four cities.As per this month‚Äôs data, the AQI level in Amritsar stood at 263.8, Jalandhar 253.9, Patiala 276.1, Khanna 237.7, Ludhiana 253 and Mandi Gobindgarh 230.9. In comparison, the AQI level on last year‚Äôs Diwali in Amritsar was 265.16, Jalandhar 258.83, Patiala 286.67, Khanna 210, Ludhiana 264 and Mandi Gobindgarh 253.83.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2-hours-window-to-burst-green-crackers-in-punjab-168895

The core committee said Punjab was paying a heavy price due to the ongoing fixed match between the BJP-led Centre and the Congress government in the state. ‚ÄúWhile farmers are not getting supply of much-needed fertiliser for sowing wheat, the trade and industry is losing crores on a daily basis due to the blockade.

It was decided to switch to an alternative fuel in the boilers, which was otherwise a costly affair.Ensuring regular supply to farmersThe company also made arrangements to pick coal from its nearby Panipat unit as a temporary arrangement, as movement of trains in Haryana was operating normally. But this resulted in huge transportation costs to the company. With these collective actions, the company was able to manage sustained running of plants in the state under the crisis.The NFL‚Äôs production operations were initially affected due to non-supply of coal. Both the plants require around 2,000 MT coal every day and the supply of the same remained stuck in the state since October 1 after the halt of rail movement. With each passing day, the coal stocks were depleting in plants.The rail dispatch of urea from Nangal and Bathinda plants was also affected due to halt of movement of goods trains in the state due to ‚Äúrail roko‚Äù agitation.More than 80 per cent of the 5,200 MT urea produced daily from Nangal and Bathinda plants is normally dispatched to fields through railway wagons. Rest of the quantity (20 per cent) is sent through trucks to nearby areas in Punjab and neighbouring Himachal and J&K.Due to the non-receipt of railway wagons after the agitation, the urea stock in these plants started piling up, taking the silo stock to the brim.To handle this situation, the company deployed additional trucks for transportation of urea. Mayank Sharma, an officer at NFL Bathinda, said: ‚ÄúWith these efforts, the company not only maintained sustained production of urea, but also ensured timely supply of fertilisers to farmers.‚Äù||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/out-of-coal-stock-nfl-switches-to-natural-gas-for-urea-production-168905

Government employees must be tested routinely and with schools and colleges opening up, it was important to make proper schedules and enhance the number of mobile teams for testing, he said.Expressing concern over the high mortality rate in the state, the Chief Minister asked the medical experts team headed by Dr KK Talwar to evolve effective strategies to tackle the problem caused mainly by late admissions/treatment, co-morbid complications, lack of adherence to guidelines with regard to use of drugs in some hospitals, lack of expertise and monitoring modalities, among others.Dr Talwar apprised the Chief Minister of the steps taken to strengthen Covid management facilities in the state, including evaluation of L-3 facilities currently in progress by an expert team from the PGI.Health Secretary Hussan Lal informed the meeting that data received from certain hospitals and analysed by experts from the PGI and AIIMS showed higher mortality among patients having significant co-morbidities and old age, but the data was inconclusive for establishing other factors.While the overall number of cases had declined in the state, 11 districts had shown increase in positivity rate in the past four weeks, he said, identifying them as Rupnagar, Bathinda, SAS Nagar, Faridkot, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mansa, Amritsar, Moga, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Sangrur. He disclosed that currently 1,600 patients were in home isolation in the state.Hussan Lal said the department had enhanced IEC activities during the festival season regarding Covid appropriate behaviour to create awareness about early testing/management, wearing of mask, hand hygiene and social distancing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/maintain-testing-at-30k-a-day-cm-punjab-168933
