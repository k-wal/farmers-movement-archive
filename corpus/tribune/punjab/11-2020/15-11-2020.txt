Gurmit applied to stay but has been refused even though she has no family to return to in Punjab, India,” reads the petition for Change.Org addressed to the UK Home Office and UK Parliament.“Gurmit is a very kind woman, even though she has nothing she is still generous and will always give what she can, when she can. Most of her days are spent volunteering at the local gurdwara,” it notes.“At a local Black Lives Matter protest Gurmit was giving out fruit to protesters in solidarity with the cause. Gurmit is an asset and a kind auntie to Smethwick. We want her to stay here. Smethwick is home,” it adds.Speaking through a translator, Sahota told ‘Birmingham Live' that if she was to return to India, she would have nowhere to go and no home to return to as she has no family there."I fear the loneliness and the impact on my mental health going back there all alone. Being here in Smethwick is my true home, it's where I work to help the community, it's where I give back, it's where I know and love the people who have become my family. The people in the temple here have become my true family," she said."This is the society I am part of and the place I have made my home. I have spent my life helping and giving to others and want to be able to continue to do this," she added.The Home Office was quoted as saying that it had communicated with Sahota recently explaining how she can apply to remain in the country legally.

15-11-2020||Amritsar||Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee turns 100, celebrates in low-key manner at Amritsar||The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages Sikh shrines and runs a 'langar' (free community kitchen) for hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis at different gurdwaras, on Sunday celebrated its centenary in a low-key manner owing to the coronavirus pandemic.The main function to mark the centenary was organised at the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, and Manji Sahib in Darbar Sahib complext here.The SGPC was constituted on November 15, 1920, and was notified through a Sikh Gurdwara Act in 1925 by the then British government.Its present President Gobind Singh Longowal told the media that the SGPC's glorious history would be showcased through documentaries and books. He said that its executive committee has decided that 100 years of Nankana Sahib Shaheedi Saka would be observed in February next year.The SGPC was raised to wrest the control of Sikh shrines from 'mahants' and priests. The prominent gurdwaras included the Golden Temple.In its initial years, the SGPC also fought against untouchability and the caste system.Besides giving 'karah prasad' and maintaining shelter homes and helping the poor and needy children as well as students and performing a host of other social activities, the SGPC took major steps to provide succour to the Sikhs in Pakistan and Afghanistan as well, sending relief material in earthquake-battered Nepal in 2015.The cash-rich SGPC runs the world's largest community kitchen -- feeding an average 50,000 devotees on weekdays and over 100,000 on weekends and festivals with freshly cooked food at the Harmandar Sahib, popularly known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar.Besides the Golden Temple, the SGPC runs the 'langar' service in other famous Sikh shrines like Takht Keshgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib (where Khalsa Panth was established on April 13, 1699, by tenth Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh), Takht Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district and scores of other gurdwaras under it.The 'langar sewa' is part of the Sikh religious ethos started to emphasise equality in society regardless of religion, caste, colour or creed. The completely vegetarian langar service is funded from donations made by people at gurdwaras.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning: Maximum cases in Punjab; anger over farm bills among major reasons||Punjab has recorded around 74,000 incidents of stubble burning this season, the maximum in four years, with experts saying anger over farm bills and the government not paying the Supreme Court-ordered financial incentive to farmers could be among the reasons for the spike in farm fires.According to data released by the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, the state recorded 73,883 incidents of stubble burning between September 21 and November 14, which is the highest since 2016.Punjab had reported 51,048 cases of stubble burning in the corresponding period last year and 46,559 such incidents in 2018. The number of farm fires was 43,149 in the state during the same period in 2017.An official from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) said the incidents of stubble burning hit the peak between November 4 and November 7. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi-NCR's pollution peaked to 42 per cent on November 5, when 4,135 farm fires were recorded in the region."It was a bumper harvest this year, so the amount of crop residue was also large. Also, it was a cloud-free season as compared to last year. The biomass was drier and prone to burning."It also appears that the farmers are not willing to cooperate. There could be anger over farm bills," he said.According to a Punjab government official, "farmers are not happy" as the ruling dispensation has not disbursed the financial incentive to them as directed by the Supreme Court to prevent stubble burning.Following the apex court's guidelines to incentivise farmers to stop stubble burning, the governments of Punjab and Haryana announced a bonus of Rs 2,500 per acre for small and marginal farmers last year. Farmers say the incentive can help them cover the cost of fuel used in operating machinery for in-situ management of stubble.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, the general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Punjab, also said the number of farm fires is "very high this year and anger over farm bills is one of the major reasons"."Unavailability of labourers -- many returned to their native states due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- is also a reason why farmers are burning stubble to clear the fields quickly," he added.The IARI official said the increase in the number of incidents of stubble burning does not mean that the policy of providing farm equipment for in-situ management of crop residue has failed."The numbers of stubble burning incidents in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh tell a different story altogether. The figures have come down significantly," he said.According to IARI's data, Haryana recorded 4,699 farm fires between October 1 and November 12 while Uttar Pradesh reported 2,288 such incidents during the period, which is the lowest in both the states in the last five years.Haryana recorded 5,807 incidents of stubble burning and Uttar Pradesh 2,653 cases during the corresponding period last year."In Punjab also, the number of cases was reducing every year till 2019. Only 2020 has been the 'odd' year out," the IARI official said.According to a study conducted by IARI scientists in Tarn Taran and Amritsar districts of Punjab, stubble burning incidents between October 1 and October 10 in Amritsar increased from 180 in 2019 to 515 in 2020 -- a rise of about 2.9 times.In Tarn Taran, the number of stubble burning incidents increased from 92 in 2019 to 341 in 2020 -- a rise of about 3.7 times."It is estimated that the harvested area increased by 35,500 hectares in Amritsar and by 39,300 hectares in Tarn Taran by October 10 this year as compared to last year."It indicates a significant early harvesting of paddy in these two districts this year, which may be on account of early planting of paddy by about 7-10 days, an increase in the proportion of area under short-duration varieties, and a clear weather during 2020 as compared to a cloudy weather in 2019 during the same period," the study said."By October 10, the proportion of burnt area to harvested area in Amritsar increased from 38 per cent in 2019 to 74.6 per cent in 2020. In Tarn Taran, it increased from 30.9 per cent in 2019 to 60.9 per cent in 2020," it added.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting paddy and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.Last year, Punjab produced around two crore tonnes of paddy residue, of which 98 lakh tonnes were burnt by farmers.Farmers in Haryana burnt 12.3 lakh tonnes of the 70 lakh tonnes of paddy residue produced.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between the harvesting of paddy and the sowing of wheat.The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing a 50 to 80-per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble burning.

The first vehicle reportedly reached within 15 minutes but gauging the gravity of the fire spreading fast, another fire tender was called from Fazilka, about 32 km from here.It is leant that about 2,500 bales of ginned and processed cotton may be found damaged.While the Government of India has fixed weight of 170 kg for a bale, many states still have bales with 160 to 165 kg. Ginned cotton is quoted in candy while exports take place in terms of tonnes. The market price of 2,500 bales is estimated to be Rs 5 crore.Most of the stack belonged to the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) that had entered Abohar market last month and was so far the prime purchasing agency, private traders had not purchased much of cotton since CCI was offering a higher price despite of controversies that had cropped up due to protests by labourers and farmers union over labour charges and lower price given due to moisture content.Fire tenders were still carrying out the operation till filing of this report as flames catch the bottom layers of the stacks when upper layers are removed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cotton-worth-rs-5-crore-feared-gutted-as-firecracker-hits-open-plinth-in-abohar-factory-170657
