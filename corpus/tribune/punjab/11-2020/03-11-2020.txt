03-11-2020||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Protesting farmers gherao BJP leader Madan Mohan Mittal in Bathinda||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, November 3Farmers protesting agriculture laws gheraoed BJP leader and former minister Madan Mohan Mittal at the circuit house in Bathinda on Tuesday.Situation became so tense that police were forced to make Mittal escape from the back door of the circuit house after barricading the front gate area to keep the protesters at bay.Farmers under the banner of BKU Sidhupur blocked the main entrance of the circuit house and staged a protest against the BJP leader after they came to know that Mittal was in the city to meet local leaders of his party.Addressing protesters, BKU Sidhupur leader Baldev Singh Sandoha said: “Modi-led NDA government is trying to suppress the farmers by taking away their lands. When everyone is supporting us on these issues, BJP leaders are the only ones justifying anti farmer laws”.Mittal was in the city to hold meetings with local BJP leaders on the party’s stand on farm laws and also to discuss about the upcoming MC elections in Bathinda.Interacting with mediapersons later, Mittal alleged that most of the people protesting against the farm laws were not farmers, but “naxals”.BJP leader also said that the laws were for the betterment of farmers and they were being misled by political parties.Replying to a question about the former ally SAD not being taken into confidence ahead of passing the farm Bills, Mittal said: “Both Sukhbir Badal and Harsimrat had agreed in the meeting that these Bills would benefit farmers.”“But when farmers staged protest outside their house for more than a week, which they did not expect, then they chose to oppose these Bills,” he added.Mittal also said that goods trains were not coming to Punjab as farmers had blocked railway tracks at many places in protest against the farm legislations. Moreover, the state government did not ensure safe passage of trains in the state, he added.The Former minister said if farmers’ union agrees they should come to him and he can arrange their meeting with the Union Agriculture Minister, but with a condition that then they would not say that they want a meeting with Prime Minister.Earlier, when they went to meet the Union Secretary, Department of Agricultural – a meeting about which they were intimated in advance, they tore the Bills claiming that they wanted a meeting with the Union Minister, Mittal pointed out.He, however, said that the ongoing issue could only be resolved through talks and farmers’ unions should come forward for the talks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protesting-farmers-gherao-bjp-leader-madan-mohan-mittal-in-bathinda-165401
03-11-2020||---||Punjab braces for long power cuts as coal stocks dry up||Chandigarh, November 3Punjab on Tuesday braced for massive power cuts after completely running out of power, with coal stocks in the state drying up fully as a result of the prolonged suspension of goods supply trains by the Railways.As day-time power shortage rose to 1,000-1,500 MW, with last of the state’s power plants, GVK Thermal, also running out of power, the Power Department has been left with no option but to impose power cuts on all residential, commercial and agricultural consumers beginning Tuesday evening.According to a government spokesperson, at present, the day demand in the state stands at about 5,100-5,200 MW and night demand is about 3,400 MW. Supply, on the other hand, is totally inadequate with only Agricultural Power (AP) load of vegetable feeders (800 MW) being given supply for 4-5 hours during day time every day. The other AP load is currently insignificant (about 300 MW).The situation, said the spokesperson, was grim as PSPCL was left with no generation control and market rates of power continued to be highly volatile and could further spike any time, resulting in increase in the cost of power purchase, on which the state is now completely dependent to feed its cables.Due to the increase in market rates leading to lesser clearance of day-ahead power, load shedding had to be carried out today on all AP /vegetable and Urban Pattern Power Supply (UPS) in rural feeders early in the morning. Otherwise too, load shedding is now being carried out regularly on various feeders of the state after 4 pm, for 4-5 hours every day, while AP/vegetable supply is also being curtailed on regular basis, said the spokesperson.Giving details, the spokesperson said the situation worsened today, when the one unit of GVK (2x270 MW) that was operational at around 12 noon headed for shut-down by 5 pm, when the coal stock was slated to completely run out. Other Private Thermal Power plants -- NPL (2x660 MW) and TSPL (3x660 MW) have already exhausted their coal supplies and are out of operation.The state’s own thermal power stations of Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat (4x210MW+2x210MW+2x250MW=1760 MW) are also boxed up at present. However, one unit at each of these plants shall be synchronised by today evening to make up for GVK generation loss and to provide stability to the system, said the spokesperson.Incidentally, in normal circumstances, the day-time demand in the state is typically met from the following sources:Centre Public Sector Stations (Punjab Share/Long Term Power) – 2,500 MWOwn Hydro Power Stations (375)GVK Thermal (1 unit) – 250 MWRenewable (mainly Solar during day time) – 450 MWPurchase from Power Exchange/Tenders – 2700 MWAfter deducting the state government’s day-time banking obligation of about 1,070 MW, this totals 5,200 MW, which is sufficient to meet the average daily power demand in the state during the day in normal circumstances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-braces-for-long-power-cuts-as-coal-stocks-dry-up-165398

03-11-2020||---||Prez declines request for meeting, Capt Amarinder announces dharna at Rajghat tomorrow||Chandigarh, November 3With the President not giving time for a meeting, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday announced that he would lead a relay dharna of MLAs at Delhi’s Rajghat on Wednesday to highlight the state’s power crisis and critical essential supplies situation amid the Centre’s adamant refusal to allow movement of goods trains, a press release by the state government read.As the crisis triggered by the suspension of the goods trains aggravated further in the state, resulting in a complete shutdown of all power plants, as well as curtailment of agricultural and vegetable supplies, the Chief Minister said he had decided to hold a symbolic relay dharna at Rajghat to bring the state’s grim situation to the Centre’s notice.“Since Section 144 was in place in Delhi, MLAs will go from Punjab Bhawan to the ‘samadhi’ of the Father of the Nation in batches of four only,” he said, adding that he would lead the first batch at 10.30 am.Captain Amarinder reiterated his appeal to the MLAs of other Punjab parties as well to join the dharnas in the interest of the state, which was facing a dire situation at present with the last of the private power plants also shutting down today.GVK has announced that it will close down operations at 3 pm today since coal stocks had completely run out. The public and other private power plants in the state had already shut down earlier.The Chief Minister said the situation on the ground was grim as the state had run out of coal, urea/DAP and other essential supplies due to the decision of the Railways not to ply goods trains even after the farmers eased their blockade to allow such movement.With its bid for power purchase not cleared for today, the state was facing extreme power shortage, all agricultural and vegetable supplies had been curtailed and high loss feeders power supply had been cut, he said, adding that the people of Punjab were staring at a dark festival season.Further, the continued and inexplicable suspension of the goods trains by the Railways was also facing serious consequences for other states such as Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, he pointed out, reiterating his warning of the Armed Forces becoming sitting ducks for the enemies if they do not get their essential supplies before snow sets in.Soon after the Vidhan Sabha session, in which all parties had unanimously resolved to seek time from the President for November 4 to seek his intervention on the Farm Bills issue, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) had, on October 21, sent a letter to the Rashtrapati Bhavan seeking a meeting.A reminder was subsequently sent on October 29, in response to which the CMO received a DO letter on Tuesday rejecting the request for a meeting on grounds of the State Amendment Bills still pending with the Governor for consideration. Subsequently, the CMO sent another letter yesterday itself, stating that the Chief Minister and other MLAs needed time to bring to the President’s notice the situation on the ground and to seek his intervention for resolution of the issues that have cropped up.However, the President’s Office responded saying “the request cannot be accepted at this juncture for reasons cited earlier”.Expressing concern over the development, the Chief Minister said as far as the State Amendment Bills, introduced under Article 254 (ii) were concerned, the Governor’s role was limited to forwarding the same to the President in accordance with the Constitutional provisions.In any case, as the letter from his office had made it clear, that was not the only issue on which the state needed the President’s intervention, he added.The Chief Minister also took serious note of the refusal of two Central Ministers to meet Congress MPs from Punjab to discuss grave issues of importance to the state. The Ministers had sought time from Railways and Finance Ministers to discuss the suspension of goods trains and non-payment of GST dues.The Central Government’s treatment towards Punjab was pushing into a deep crisis, said Captain Amarinder, terming the recent developments as against India’s Constitutionally-mandated federal character. The situation, if not checked, could snowball into a major catastrophe and spell doom for the nation, whose foundations were built on the ethos of democratic federalism, he warned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/prez-declines-request-for-meeting-capt-amarinder-announces-dharna-at-rajghat-tomorrow-165367

03-11-2020||Jalandhar||Leading Punjabi artistes mobilise support for protesting farmers||“Theatre during the farmers’ stirs is coming out of a myth. A myth that theatre dies in tent and canvas canopies or in the open. The protests reaffirm that theatre is of the people. It is committed to tell the stories of the people,” says playwright Dr Sahib Singh.In more than one way the angst of the agitation manifested at the 29th Mela Gadri Babeyan Da at the Desh Bhagat Yadgar Hall here on Sunday, the theatre groups active amid the stirs across the state lent wholehearted renderings during the cultural night at the fair. Subjects such as farmer stirs, migrant crisis, Hathras rape incident ruled the roost on the night.A woman carrying a child on a suitcase (migrant crisis), a play warning of the perils of a madari making the public dance to its tunes, a satire on opportunist politicians were the themes echoing on the stage. In Sahib Singh’s play “Rangkarmi Da Baccha”, five children born on the highways during the crisis, asked the audience what their birthplace was.Amolak Singh, cultural convener, Desh Bhagat Yadgar Committee, said, “Amid farmer agitation, themes of theatre took digs at the political system in the country and aligned themselves with people’s issues. Art and theatre have had a major role to play in the agitations and farmers’ groups are also actively supporting newer voices and ways which assert their demands.”Interestingly, it isn’t the fringe groups or small theatre troupes which support the stirs but the leading theatre luminaries in the state have channeled their resources to supporting the farmers. As farmers of the BKU extended solidarity with the Mela leaving their morchas, so did the members of myriad theatre groups active during the protests across the state. In the past months many theatre groups have trailed farm agitations holding plays at toll plazas, petrol pumps, roadsides, streets and grounds.Kewal Dhaliwal, playwright and founder Manch Rangmanch, Amritsar, whose group has been performing plays across the morchas in the state, said, “We brought our plays ‘Agg Di Jaai Da Geet’ based on the Hathras rapes and the play ‘Haarhian Sawnian’based on the farmers’ agitations.” They have travelled the state and performed at Barnala, Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda among other places. “People in thousands watch and identify with plays. At least 12 to 15 groups, including those of Dr Sahib Singh, Kirti Kirpal, Ikattar Singh and Moga groups have all been actively engaging with farmers.”Playwright Dr Sahib Singh, whose play “Rangkarmi Da Baccha” stirred audiences, said, “Theatre in Punjab isn’t a mainstay of the auditoriums anymore. A wall has been breached. During the stirs, it has found a new platform. It has been successful in engaging with the audiences. For ages, it was thought theatre can’t survive in the open or in tents. That myth is busted. It doesn’t need plush auditoriums. We have performed 22 shows at villages, toll plazas, railway tracks and theatre has asserted its voice everywhere. Farmers have expressed keen interest in all the themes of the plays.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/leading-punjabi-artistes-mobilise-support-for-protesting-farmers-165281

The women leaders raked up the issue of soaring prices and said that even poor man’s vegetable like potato was getting out of the reach of the common man.Kalia asked the Congress leaders to first explain the problems like Tanda rape incident and shoddy treatment meted out to the SC students on Post-Matric Scholarship scheme. Sethi reverted saying the state’s police had already held the rape accused and even issued challans against them in 10 days. On scholarship scheme, she said that the state government had already released its new scheme for the SC students. The Congress workers said that the main issue affecting all households these days was escalating prices of vegetables and the Centre was to be squarely blamed for it. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/soaring-prices-cong-workers-hand-over-veggie-hampers-to-manoranjan-kalia-165286

He said a CBI probe was needed to ascertain the real scope of the scam.Majithia said it was strange that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who liked to visit states for photo ops as he did recently by sitting on a sofa on a tractor, did not deem it fit to visit Dalit students who had been robbed by his minister. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-jail-dharamsot-once-in-power-sad-165121

The armed forces submitted a report to the police and 24 persons, including 14 doctors, were booked for fraud.The Army authorities found that several veterans misled the ECHS cardholders to collect cards and later connived with hospital managements to fabricate record in order to usurp funds from the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare.The ex-serviceman lured ECHS cardholders by saying the Centre was providing a relief fund in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and asked for their cards. Later, they made fraudulent admissions in hospitals during the lockdown and claimed hefty medical bills from the department.Malik said as the investigations involved a lot of documentation, the probe was taking some time. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/doctor-veteran-among-3-held-in-echs-scam-165130

Those arrested include Rajan and Sheelu of Prem Nagar in Abohar; Hasan Alam and Jani Alam of Hapur; and Nabi Hyder of Rampur in Saharanpur district of UP.A case under Sections 295A (outraging religious feelings), 428 (commit mischief by killing animal), 429 (punishment for killing animal), 153A (wanton vilification or attack on religion) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act had been registered at the Wahabwala police station. The arrests were made on a complaint by Paramdeep Bhadoo of Waryamkhera village in this regard. Members of the Bajrang Dal Hindustan, Gau Raksha Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Akhil Bharatiya Jeev Raksha Bishnoi Sabha organised a protest claiming an organised gang had been rounding up stray animals.At least three truckloads of animals had been intercepted this year but the suspects, who fled leaving behind the vehicles, were yet to be nabbed, they said. The protesters raised slogans alleging police inaction in curbing the menace. They later buried the meat by digging a pit using a JCB machine outside Sukhchain village.The families of the local suspects, however, claimed they had been lifting dead animals and taking the meat to Muzaffnagar to sell as fish feed. They claimed no wrongdoing and demanded cancellation of the criminal case.

Issuing a notice of motion for December 8, Justice Sudip Ahluwalia asserted: “Any appointment to the post in question shall not be made in the meantime.” The direction came on a petition filed against the state of Punjab and other respondents by Dr HS Kahlon and another petitioner through counsel Vivek Sharma. Appearing before the Bench through video-conferencing, Sharma contended advertising the post for filling it on a deputation basis was against the rules. The petitioners were eligible for the post, but the respondent was not considering them for promotion to the post in an illegal and arbitrary manner. Directions were also sought to the respondent to consider the petitioners for promotion to the post as they were fully eligible in accordance with the relevant rules. The Bench was told the post was to be filled on a deputation basis for three years on an extendable basis. It was added the respondents had opened the post for all departments in the Central and state governments, besides universities and research institutes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/appointment-of-animal-husbandry-director-stayed-165132

The admonition and direction came on a petition filed by Ajay Kumar against the state of Punjab for anticipatory bail in an FIR registered on June 28, 2018, for murder and other offences under Sections 302 and 120B of the IPC and provisions of the Arms Act at Jodhewal police station in Ludhiana district.No genuine effort to nab accused The averment that efforts were made to arrest the petitioner, prima facie, does not seem to be genuine. — High CourtJustice Sethi asserted even though his first anticipatory bail application was dismissed in November 2018, the petitioner did not surrender and was also declared a proclaimed offender. The order was set aside by the High Court on technicalities, but the fact remained that he was evading law even after his prayer for anticipatory bail was rejected.Justice Sethi added: “The conduct of the petitioner is such that he is evading arrest for the last more than two-and-a-half years and his custodial interrogation is necessary to find out the source of weapon, which has been used in the incident, wherein a person lost his life...No ground is made out to grant the benefit of anticipatory bail to the petitioner.”Before parting with the order, Justice Sethi asserted the inefficiency of the police was required to be commented upon. For the last two years, the petitioner was evading arrest and the police authority in its affidavit only mentioned that efforts were made to arrest the petitioner, which were to no avail.The petitioner, on the one hand, was evading arrest. On the other hand, he successfully challenged the order declaring him a proclaimed offender and filed a second petition for the grant of anticipatory bail after two years of rejection of his first anticipatory bail plea. “This averment that efforts were made to arrest the petitioner, prima facie, does not seem to be genuine,” Justice Sethi concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-raps-punjab-police-for-inefficiency-in-murder-case-165134

State Transport Commissioner Dr Amarpal said they had received the notices and would be serving these to the errant operators.Last year, notices were reportedly issued to 140 private bus operators, seeking their reply on how they got extensions in the original bus route permits, beyond the 24 km allowed under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Under the Act, a single extension of 24 km is permitted in the original bus route. This provision was allegedly flouted during the previous Akali-BJP regime, and many private bus operators got two to three extensions in the original bus route permits, which were allowed in the Transport Policy of 2011. Since 2011, as many as 6,700 route permit extensions have been given.The Congress government had promised to cancel these illegalities in permits when it came to power in 2017. A new transport policy was also brought in by the government, which besides making these extensions illegal, had also announced that diversions and curtailment of routes and increase and decrease in trips were illegal.Strangely, the department stopped issuing notices to private bus operators last year after two of them approached the High Court, which granted a stay in their favour. There was no stay on issuing the notices to other operators, but the exercise was stopped midway, said a senior official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-transport-department-to-serve-notices-on-erring-bus-operators-165137

Since rail traffic has been facing disruption for over a month, the supply of both raw materials and finished goods has been stuck at various places.IMJS Sandhu, president, Vardhman Textiles, termed it as an “unsavoury” situation. He said the supply of certain raw materials was stuck for days together and even the delivery of finished goods was facing inordinate delays of seven to nine days initially, forcing them to switch over to the costly option of using roadways.“Efforts to arrange transportation through roads has enhanced the input cost to almost double as shortage of raw material and delay in dispatching the finished goods forced us to use the roadways. An unavoidable delay of two or three days is also being faced,” said Neeraj Jain, Joint Managing Director, Vardhman Textiles.Other textile units like Indorama, which is another EOU, in Baddi is also facing similar problems. The image of the domestic industry is taking a severe beating in Europe and the US as supply orders cannot be delivered within the stipulated time.Sandeep Verma, director, Ashoka Spanners Private Limited, Baddi, which exports its engineering goods to Europe and US, said, “Though manufacturing had picked up after the lockdown, the disruption of rail traffic in Punjab has severally hit us as finished goods are piled up in the units.”“The delay in meeting the export orders is severally tarnishing our image abroad and our customers are even exploring the option of shifting their orders to countries like China as such disruptions have become routine,” said Verma.SL Singla, Advisor, Himachal Drug Manufacturers Association, while echoing similar views, said, “I am awaiting transportation of my goods since the last about 20 days to Tehran, Afghanistan, Pakistan. In the absence of any alternative, my containers packed with finished goods are lying on the unit premises as engaging trucks for their transportation will also invite additional costs.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-stir-hits-himachals-bbn-industry-hard-164993

Prof Ravinder, who was 13 and a witness to the arson, said she had to hide away to save herself from the mobs, which had surrounded their house in East Delhi.Dr Ishmeet and Pav Singh had detailed these scenes and other violations in their books “Black November” and “1984: India’s Guilty Secret”.Pav, who was brought up in the UK, under the shadow of Jewish Holocaust felt that 1984 and the pogrom against the Sikh community should be put down as a crime against humanity.“Acts of such magnitude in different parts of the globe have received attention from the world community, but in the case of 1984, there has been a deafening silence and the crimes have gone unrecognised,” he said and added that he had campaigned about this and put up an exhibition at Weiner Holocaust Library in Central London.Arguing that 1984 incidents were mentioned as anti-Sikh riots, Pav said, “There was no riot. It was an act of premeditated murders and targeted attacks on innocent men, women and children of a certain community for no fault of theirs.”According to him, there was an urgent need to do something for the third generation of the victims, many of them growing up in widow colony of Tilak Vihar — a place that relives 1984 every day. Apart from the discussion, launch of the book of short stories set in 1984 “Night of the Restless Spirits” by author and podcaster Sarbpreet Singh was also hosted.Sarbpreet said he was motivated to learn about 1984 and thus decided to read the real narratives, something he had not known before. He first wrote a short story poem “Kultar’s Mime” that his daughter had turned into a play, which was staged in the USA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1984-anti-sikh-riots-experts-speak-on-agony-of-survivors-165085

Inderjit Singh uses modern farming machinery for the proper handling of straw. He spreads the straw in his fields with the help of Rotavator and then sows wheat.  He has appealed to farmers not to burn the straw and use fertilisers as per the recommendations and varieties approved by experts of Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.  He said the burning of straw not only caused pollution-related diseases, but also killed friendly insects in fields. “The fire burns the soul of our motherland, which nurtures us and provides us with everything,” he added.  He called upon the farmers to avail benefits of various schemes of the state government. “The government is giving agricultural machinery to individual farmers at 50 per cent subsidy and to farmer groups, panchayats and co-operative societies at 80 per cent subsidy,” he said. He owns 11 acres and has taken 300 acres on lease. He got paddy harvested with a combine having Super SMS facility.

As a result, the cost of DAP and urea was set to rise, affecting wheat sowing, which starts on November 5, as well as hundreds of fruit orchards in the region.“Instead of accepting PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar’s challenge for an open debate, senior BJP leaders were trying to vitiate the atmosphere by claiming the farmers’ movement was being run by middlemen, Naxals and trade union leaders,” he said.Taking a dig at the Akali Dal, Jakhar said Harsimrat Kaur Badal was a Union Minister when the Central Minister drafted the anti-farmer laws and passed these in the Cabinet.

But Sharma, like other BJP leaders, has no realisation of this.”They pointed out that the security and safety of trains was the responsibility of the Railway Protection Force (RPF), with the state government having no say in the matter. The ministers asked what the Captain Amarinder government had to do with the safe movement of trains, adding this was not the first time tracks had been blocked by farmers in a state.They stressed instances of such blockades had been reported at many places, irrespective of the government in power, even in the past. “So does that mean the Chief Minister of that state becomes responsible?” the ministers quipped.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-leaders-lying-misleading-farming-community-punjab-ministers-165118

The sales vary from dealership to dealership and also depend upon the brand they are handling,” said Joshi Autozone managing director Deepak Joshi.In percentage terms, Kia and Tata dealership registered 60-80 per cent increase in sales this October compared to last year. Dealers expect the demand to continue through Diwali, which will further accentuate growth for the industry at large.The auto industry always banks on the festive season for sales. With Diwali round the corner and Christmas to follow soon after, the industry is hopeful of seeing better sales in the last couple of months of this year to make up for a dismal start.The total dispatches of all carmakers (excluding luxury) combined to dealers was around 3.34 lakh units in October, as against 2.84 lakh during the corresponding period of last year, witnessing an 18 per cent growth.The northern region, comprising Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, J&K, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, contributes 25-30 per cent to the total sales.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/regions-car-sales-see-double-digit-growth-165129

They will not only be trained in the functioning of the PRIs, but also be made aware of social welfare schemes of the government so that they could ensure the benefit of the scheme to the last person, he added.Claim on CHANDIGARH NOT BENEFICIALIf we leave (claim on) Chandigarh, I don’t think it will benefit Haryana. But if both states make Chandigarh a UT like Delhi and form separate independent capitals and HC Benches, it will benefit them. —Dushyant Chautala, Dy CM“The PRI representatives need special training to be aquatint about functioning of the PRIs and knowledge about utilisation of funds for the development of their village. So, the academy will train them in all aspects so that they don’t face any problem in discharging their duties,” the Deputy CM added.He said the BJP-JJP alliance government was in favour of empowering the panchayat system so it was trying to ensure 50 per cent reservation for women and one to eight per cent reservation for backward class in the PRIs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dushyant-chautala-for-separate-capitals-for-punjab-haryana-165050
03-11-2020||The railway station||Pagri, Jatt and Punjab||Alexander conquered the then known world but struggled when he entered the land of the five rivers. His empire could not expand any further. The Mughals and the Persian rulers used all their might to subdue this lot, but failed to tame them. Abdali, who massacred them in thousands, was frustrated when the survivors looted his convoys with booty on his way back to Afghanistan. It was a matter of time when the Khyber pass, the gateway to Hindostan, exchanged hands from Kabul to Lahore. A revision of history was necessary for the benefit of my friend and the audience gathered around us.Long before Gandhi’s call for Satyagraha, it was Baba Ram Singh who started the boycott movement, resulting in his followers being blown by cannons. The Ghadar movement, an international political movement to overthrow the British, comprised mostly of expatriate Punjabis. Events like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre gave birth to the likes of Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai, Udham Singh etc, who not only galvanised the Indian youth, but also expedited the achievements of Swaraj.Come Independence and half the state found itself partitioned right down the middle. While the rest of India rejoiced at the stroke of midnight, Punjab was up in flames. But it took less than a decade for them to get back to their feet. They carved a niche for themselves through sweat and toil when the Green Revolution provided the much-needed food security for the country. Being the sword arm of the nation, it defended its borders with blood and valour in all wars post Independence. When the Emergency was imposed, Punjab was the first state to pioneer the movement for the restoration of democracy. It was Punjabiyat that got the better of evil forces during the dark days of militancy. My adrenaline levels had lowered as I finished.Love them, hate them, or ridicule them, Punjabis have brought far too many laurels for Bharat desh to be ignored. ‘Pagri sambhal Jatta’ is not just a revolutionary song but a way of life for these people. My friend’s silence after the discourse suggests that he now has a better insight into the Punjabi psyche.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pagri-jatt-and-punjab-165104
