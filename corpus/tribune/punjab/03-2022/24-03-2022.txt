A request was made on the previous date of hearing by the State counsel that he was not having instructions due to current changes.“Today again a request for short accommodation is made, stating that the Advocate-General, Punjab, has to argue the matter and is awaiting instructions,” Justice Jhingan asserted, while fixing the case for April 8.The High Court, in September last year, had ordered a clear stay on the investigation in all the cases against Saini and his arrest in all the registered or likely to be registered cases. The Bench, on March 3, had extended the operation of the order till April 20 — the next date of hearing in the case.Taking up the special leave petition filed by State of Punjab the next day, the Supreme Court had asked the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to take up the matter either himself or assign it to any other Bench. Directions were also issued to dispose of the matter in accordance with law, preferably within two weeks.In view of the Supreme Court order, the matter was listed before Justice Jhingan. Saini was represented in the matter by counsel S.P.S. Sidhu. The earlier Bench in its last year’s order had asserted that Saini’s involvement in multiple cases could be a “political ploy in wake of the coming state legislative Assembly elections”. The order, passed on September 10, last year, was directed to remain in force at least till the general election in the State in February.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-counsel-seeks-time-to-argue-sumedh-singh-sainis-case-380403

However, during 2020 and 2021 they were 89,430 and 102,379 respectively, as compared to 61,332 during 2019,” it said“The burning events were higher particularly in Punjab and it may be due to protest burning by farmers of Punjab. The efforts made have resulted in 52 % reduction in crop residue burning incidents as compared to the base year 2016,” DARE told the Panel headed by Bagalkot MP PC Gaddigoudar when asked about the steps taken to mitigate the problem of Stubble Burning in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi, causing air pollution and how far they have been successful in mitigating/containing the problem.Notably, under the Central Sector Scheme on “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for in-situ management of crop residue in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi”, Rs 1151.80 crore were allocated for two years (2018-19—Rs 591.65 crore, and 2019-2020—Rs 560.15 crore) and Rs 600 crore in 2020-22.During four years, as many as 2.13 lakhs machines were supplied to the states for in-situ residue management. Currently the department is working on promotion of equipment for in-situ management and creating awareness among farmers and other stakeholders against ill effects of crop residue burning on soil fertility and environment.Notably, episodic events like crop burning are among the other major sources of air pollution in India like vehicular emissions, power generation, industrial waste, biomass combustion for cooking and the construction sector.While appreciating the efforts made so far by the department, the committee recommended them to develop technologies and equipment and bio-decomposers for in-situ management of residue that can be bought by poor farmers. The panel also asked it to create awareness among farmers through demonstrations, training programs, ‘kisan melas’, leaflets/pamphles to contain stubble burning and consequently reduce air pollution.“Air pollution due to stubble burning in various parts of the country and specifically in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi, has been a major concern and to contain and mitigate this perennial problem, in-situ management of crop residue is required,” the panel said. #dare #stubble burning||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-increased-during-farmers-protests-parliamentary-panel-report-380389

As such, the accused should be released on bail as the trial was likely to take considerable time to conclude.The state counsel, on the other hand, produced before the Bench the petitioner’s custody certificate, indicating that he was an under trial in a similar case registered in April 2019 under the NDPS Act. He also prayed for dismissal of the petition as the recovered quantity of heroin was commercial in nature.Justice Bajaj asserted the court found that interim regular bail was granted on the strength of an order dated September 1, 2021, passed in some other case. It had no relevance with the present FIR, but it was necessary to note that extraordinary concession could not be granted if exceptional ground was non-existent.Unforeseen emergencyJustice Manoj Bajaj of the HC asserted that concession could only be granted in consideration of some unforeseen emergency, such as illness of an accused, bereavement in family or “any such circumstance”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/concession-for-interim-bail-only-on-exceptional-ground-rules-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-380150

Maximum temperature recorded on Tuesday was 35°C.To prevent the impact of this unusual rise in temperature at grain filling/formation stage, farmers have been advised by agriculture experts to do need-based irrigation for wheat crop.According to Punjab Agricultural University’s Department of Climate Change and Agricultural Meteorology head Dr Pavneet Kaur Kingra, there are not western disturbances and the weather is expected to remain hot and dry in the coming days too. It will have a negative impact on the wheat crop as it needs lower temperatures at this stage.Agriculture experts have advised farmers to do need-based irrigation and spray salicylic acid by dissolving 15 gm of it in 450 ml of ethyl alcohol, using 200 litre of water per acre, at early milk stages to mitigate the effect of high temperature at grain filling and enhance the wheat yield.“Farmers should regularly survey the crop for the occurrence of yellow rust. If symptoms appear, they should spray Custodia/ Caviet/ Opera/ Tilt/Stilt/Bumper/Shine/Markzole @0.1 per cent or Nativo @ 0.06 per cent. To produce Karnal-bunt free seed of wheat, farmers should give a single spray of 200 ml Tilt per acre using 200 litre of water at the ear emergence stage,” said an agri expert from the PAU.Harvinder Singh, a farmer from a village near Samrala, said they were getting only three to four hours power supply in a day, which was insufficient. “Wheat needs water at this stage as the temperature has risen suddenly but we are unable to irrigate due to lack of power. We need at least eight-hour power supply.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/soaring-mercury-worries-wheat-growers-380147

Advocate Binat Sharma said the Director took the step after village sarpanch Barinder Kumar moved the court in this regard.According to the sarpanch’s counsellor, the panchayat had formed a committee under the Jal Shakti scheme and the panches, without the knowledge of sarpanch Barinder Kumar, collected money from villagers and also didn’t deposit it with the panchayat.When the sarpanch objected, the panches stopped participating in village panchayat activities and hampering development works. They even lodged a complaint against the sarpanch with the Director alleging that he was not working properly and they would not be able to work with him.The Director after looking into the matter directed the said panches to participate in panchayat works. They didn’t comply with the orders and no action was taken against them despite the fact that the sarpanch had informed the authorities about the collection of money from village residents, he said.The counsellor said on the contrary, the authorities appointed an administrator diluting the powers of village panchayat following which the sarpanch moved the court in September last year.The Director, on March 16, filed an affidavit in the court regarding suspension of all seven panches on March 14. He also informed the court that subsequent action would be initiated against the said panches and a decision in this regard would be taken within a period of four weeks. — TNSCollected money from villagersThe panchayat had formed a panel under the Jal Shakti scheme.

Based on the report, payment made and bank guarantee encashment etc, it has been concluded that a recovery of Rs 6.70 crore should be made from the contractor, ASC Builders Private Limited. The BoG then decided to go ahead with the recovery by issuing a notice to the contractor along with the WAPCOS report.It has also been decided that the VC has been authorised to make further payment to WAPCOS, subject to maximum 90% of the agreement amount. This payment of fees of WAPCOS should be adjusted against the deduction made from the contractor for not appointing a quality control agency.Meanwhile, university VC Prof Buta Singh Sidhu said: “In the BoG meeting, it has been decided to conduct a Vigilance inquiry into the work executed by the contractor pertaining to the construction of the buildings.”In 2020, taking a serious note of the inflated cost of works at the university, its then BoG chairman IAS Anurag Verma had ordered a third-party audit of the entire project for the construction of an administrative block, lecture theatre and departments.The issue surfaced after the contractor wrote to the Principal Secretary, seeking the payment for the pending bills in August 2020. Against the estimated cost of Rs 115 crore, the work was awarded for Rs 98.31 crore. During the execution of the work, the scope was enhanced to Rs 115 crore, which was released to the contractor. But due to further enhancement, the project cost rose to Rs 140 crore.The BoG chairman had formed a panel, which pointed out that the additional work was executed without the order along with various other irregularities in its detailed report sent to him.Need to recover Rs 6.70 cr from contractorBased on the techno financial report of the audit firm, payment made and bank guarantee encashment, it has been concluded that Rs 6.70 crore should recovered from the contractor, ASC Builders Pvt Ltd.

It had also sought to “livestream the work done by revenue officials.” The missive had immediately sparked off a controversy following which the PROA was forced to step ostensibly to “safeguard the interests of their employees.” The immediate trigger for the DC to issue the letter was to toe the line of the new dispensation in Chandigarh, say sources.Ishfaq, however, remained unfazed. He said he had withdrawn the directions after he got to know that discontent prevailed among revenue officials and that they would go on strike from tomorrow.The letter, among other things, had urged officials to complete all pending work in the next few days and added that pendency of work in the future should be kept to the bare minimum. It also called for “time bound completion of work pertaining to registries and mutations.”Sources say what irked the revenue officials, including tehsildars and naib-tehsildars, were the directions that they had to submit a day-to-day report of their working to the District Revenue Officer (DRO). The DRO, in turn, was to give a copy of the report to a clerk who was asked to call up people and to enquire “if any bribe was being taken by revenue officials.”Gurdev Singh Dham, PROA president, claimed that the letter was “derogatory and was meant to demean and insult revenue officials.”He said: “The spirit and gist of the letter is that revenue officials are the only source of corruption and that their subordinate clerks were being asked to inquire into their deeds.” “The actual source of corruption is higher authorities and that revenue officials were compelled to fulfil their greed and expectations,” said Dham.In a letter, PROA also said officials would not perform field duties till they get fuel for their vehicles.Had issued dos and don’tsDC Mohammad Ishfaq had issued certain ‘dos and don’ts’ to administration officials, including those belonging to the Revenue Department.

They want the services of all 70,000 contractual employees, including those working in boards and corporations, to be regularised.Many of the employees hired under different schemes in the Health Department (12,000) and Education Department (15,000) have been working on contract basis for over 10 to 15 years.As the broad contours of the legislation being framed is yet not known, anxiety has gripped the contractual employees who are hoping that the new government comes up with criteria that also includes the staff hired under different government schemes and not against regular posts in the bill too.The Punjab Protection and Regularisation of Contractual Employees Bill passed in the state Assembly on November 11 by the previous Channi-led Congress government to regularise the service of 36,000 employees did not see light of the day after the Governor reverted the file to the CM’s office with six queries relating to pending court cases, reservation and funding raised on the proposed legislation. The issue was lost in the election din, as the model code of conduct for the 2022 Assembly elections came into force.Not doubting the intent and intention of the AAP government to help the contractual employees, Ashish Julaha, leader, Contractual Employees Action Committee, said: “Most of the contractual employees have been hired under various government schemes such as midday meal, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, National Health Mission and Atma scheme, besides others. The government must ensure that these employees are regularised too.”He claimed there was no need to take the legislative route as the Council of Ministers was empowered to regularise the employees.A senior government functionary, however, said in 2017, the office of the Punjab Advocate General had advised the state government that the process of the regularisation of employees had to be in conformity with the law laid down by the Supreme Court in a 2006 case of Uma Devi versus the state of Karnataka.AD HOC STAFF ACT PASSED BY SAD-BJP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/regularise-services-of-all-70k-demand-contract-employees-of-punjab-380129

This year, 132 lakh metric tonnes of wheat is to be procured from the state.Have sufficient gunny bagsWe are comfortably placed with the stocks of gunny bags. We have already procured 85 per cent of the required gunny bags. — Senior officialOfficial sources say Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has already instructed Chief Secretary Anirudh Tiwari to personally supervise the entire procurement process. The latter is reportedly personally looking into the release of CCL of Rs 28,151 crore for the purchase of paddy. A team of officials from the Food and Supply Department is also expected to meet officials of Reserve Bank of India on Monday to seek timely release of CCL. “We are working to ensure the stock reports of the previous season’s CCL are submitted soon, so that CCL for purchasing wheat can be sanctioned,” a top government officer told The Tribune, adding that they are sure the CCL limit would be sanctioned by the month-end.The wheat procurement is also expected to be discussed by the Chief Minister with the Prime Minister, in their meeting scheduled for Thursday. Though for past several years, the market arrivals of wheat begin only after April 10, this year the high temperature for almost 10 days would advance the maturing of wheat and its early harvesting. The market arrivals of the grain are expected in the first week of April. Officials in Food and Supply department say they have already finalised 524 of 545 labour and cartage contracts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wheat-procurement-punjab-govts-next-challenge-380123

Majority of them have pledged that they won’t sell their produce to silos even at high rates. — Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, BKU (Ugrahan) General SecretaryFarm leaders admitted that some farmers had been selling their produce at higher rates directly to private silos in Punjab, but they said they had intensified their campaign and were conducting meetings to prevent the practice. They alleged that private silo owners were purchasing wheat at higher rate only for a short time to weaken government purchase system.“Many farmers have admitted that they had directly sold their produce to silos in various areas on higher rates. Apart from high price, farmers said silo owners complete the process instantly and free their tractor-trailers immediately, while in government grain markets, they have to wait for long,” Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of BKU Ugrahan, told The Tribune.About their future course of action to prevent direct sale to silos, he said they had further intensified their campaign that was launched sometime back for the purpose.“We have been conducting special meetings and making farmers aware of the conspiracies of silo owners to weaken government purchase system. Majority of them have also understood it and have pledged that they would not sell their produce to silos even on high rates. We are not compelling any farmer, but convincing them by sharing the losses that we may have to suffer in future,” he said.Chhajli silo director Puneet Bansal said they had never purchased any crop directly. “We are offering our services only for storage of government purchase and never conduct any direct purchase.” he said. A Sangrur farmer, Gurpartap Singh: “If farmers are selling their crop to private players, it’s because they are offered better prices by them. Farmer unions should launch indefinite agitation for increase in MSP as per our input cost to save government purchase system,” he said.Sangrur District Food and Civil Supply Controller Narinder Singh said they could not stop farmers from selling their crop to private players directly. “Any private player could purchase the crop of any farmer by paying the mandatory fee.
