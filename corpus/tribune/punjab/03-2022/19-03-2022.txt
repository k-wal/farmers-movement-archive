But the respondents have not decided the applications, as yet,” it said and requested the court to order Lahore Police to ensure security for the event.Qureshi told PTI here that since the event has a threat from religious zealots, police should provide fool-proof security.He said the organisation had already launched a campaign to name the Shadman Chowk after Bhagat Singh but the authorities concerned seem to be afraid of a backlash from religious extremists.Hafiz Saeed’s Jammat-ud-Dawah had warned the government against naming the Chowk after Bhagat Singh.Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh of the Lahore High Court would take up the petition on Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pak-ngo-moves-court-seeking-security-cover-for-bhagat-singh-death-anniversary-event-378985

19-03-2022||Chandigarh||After 2 years of subdued festivities, Holi celebrated with fervour across Punjab, Haryana||After two years of muted festivities, Holi was celebrated across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on Friday with much gaiety as revellers stepped out of their homes with 'pichkaris' and 'gulal' amid a decline in Covid cases.Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann greeted people on Holi and hoped that the festival of colours, unity and harmony would bring happiness and peace in everyone's life.Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar also extended greetings to people.Revellers exchanged greetings, visited friends and relatives, gifted 'gujia' (a traditional sweet) and smeared 'gulal' (colour powder) on each other's faces.For the last two years, Holi festivities had remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic as people exercised caution and avoided mass gatherings.However, as the Covid cases have considerably declined in the two states and Chandigarh, celebrations were almost back to pre-Covid days."I had been missing the festivities like meeting friends and relatives. Earlier, in the housing society where I live, we used to have a big function where residents smeared 'gulal', but for the last two years it was stopped."Now, with the considerably improved Covid situation, I enjoyed the festivities like I used to do earlier," said Jhanvi, a Class X student from Chandigarh. Colours of all hues and smell of 'gulal' pervaded streets as people of all ages celebrated the festival.'Holi Hai' rent the air as groups of revellers zoomed past on motorbikes while youngsters danced to popular numbers and children armed with 'pichkaris' (water guns) chased one another and hurled water-filled balloons on people from rooftops. The police in the two states and Chandigarh had made elaborate arrangements to ensure a safe Holi.Earlier on Thursday, Mann had participated in a Holi Milan Samaroh at the Haryana Raj Bhawan here, where he and other dignitaries, including Punjab Governor BL Purohit, Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya and Khattar were seen in a joyous mood, showering rose petals and splashing 'gulal' on each other to mark Holi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-2-years-of-subdued-festivities-holi-celebrated-with-fervour-across-punjab-haryana-378872
