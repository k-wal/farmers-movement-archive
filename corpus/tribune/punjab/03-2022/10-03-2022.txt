His father is a driver and mother works as a sweeper. He earlier ran a mobile repair shop.Ugoke joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a volunteer in 2013.The Bhadaur Assembly segment in Barnala district shot into limelight when the Congress announced that Channi will be contesting from the seat besides Chamkaur Sahib.By fielding Channi from Bhadaur, the Congress was eyeing electoral gains in Punjab’s politically significant Malwa region, which has a good presence of the Dalits.A Class 12 pass and first-timer, Ugoke was confident of his victory from day one and had accused Channi of wearing a “mask of common man”.“There are 74 villages in my constituency and I know the problems of every village. For me, Bhadaur is not a ‘halqa’ (constituency) but my family. Channi sahab does not know the names of even 10 villages of Bhadaur seat,” Ugoke had told PTI last month.“Channi sahab is not an ‘aam aadmi’. Even though he is from a Dalit family, he is living the life of a king,” he had said.In 2017, AAP’s Pirmal Singh Dhaula won from the Bhadaur seat. However, Dhaula joined the Congress last year.The Congress had won Bhadaur in 2012.The Shiromani Akali Dal won this seat in 1997, 2002 and 2007.CM Channi had to taste defeat from his home constituency Chamkaur Sahib in Rupnagar district.Dr Charanjit Singh, an eye surgeon, trounced Channi by a margin of 7,942 votes.In 2017, Dr Charanjit Singh, who runs a hospital in Morinda, was defeated by Channi by a margin of over 12,000 votes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/meet-aap-greenhorn-eye-surgeon-who-made-punjab-cm-channi-bite-the-dust-376748

Sensing an imminent threat and to stop further misadventure, the BSF troops fired upon the intruder in self-defence, killing the Pakistani intruder on the spot,” a BSF spokesperson said.The border force, in a different action undertaken on Wednesday morning, also shot down a drone near Havelian village in the same sector.The white quadcopter drone (DJI Phantom 4 model) was neutralised while it was coming from “Pakistan to India”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bsf-kills-pak-intruder-shoots-down-drone-along-india-pakistan-border-in-amritsar-376721
10-03-2022||Chandigarh||Sukhbir Badal: Finally out of his father’s shadow, but long way to go yet||This year’s Punjab Assembly polls came as a litmus test for Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal as he shouldered the responsibility of steering his 100-year-old party without the active participation of his father and party patriarch Parkash Singh Badal.Often credited with his party’s victory in the 2012 Assembly polls, now 59, he became the youngest chief of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) when he was elevated to the post in 2008.His political innings started over two decades ago when he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Faridkot twice in a span of two years and served as the Union minister of state for industry in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Later, he became Punjab’s deputy chief minister.This was his first election when he came out of the shadow of his father, who had restricted his public appearances because of his age and the Covid pandemic.The stakes were high for the Shiromani Akali Dal and Sukhbir Badal was hoping for the revival of his party, which was relegated to the third position in the last Assembly elections, bagging just 15 of the 117 Assembly seats.  This time, the party touched a new low, winning just two seats and leading in one till now. Meanwhile, Sukhbir Badal lost the contest from Jalalabad.But the going was tough from the start.Months back, the party had snapped its 24-year-old electoral ties with the BJP due to differences over the Centre’s farm laws. Instead his party forged an alliance with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party.He travelled across the state, reminding people of the development work done during his party’s 10-year term from 2007 to 2017.In a multi-cornered contest, the SAD made a head start by announcing candidates early on. There was also quibbling over who was the party’s CM face, with Badal himself being seen as the only contender for it.He projected the SAD as Punjab’s “own party”.Badal, an MP from Ferozepur, converted the contest for the Amritsar East constituency into the mother of all electoral battles in the state by pitting his brother-in-law and senior party leader Bikram Singh Majithia against state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu.He had done his schooling from the Lawrence School, Sanawar, and completed MA (Hons) from Panjab University in 1985 and MBA from California State University, USA in 1991.Sukhbir Badal’s wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal was a Union minister and had resigned over the issue of farm laws.Both have two daughters and a son.Sukhbir Badal was elected from the Faridkot Lok Sabha constituency in 1996 and again in 1998 and 2004.He became the deputy chief minister in 2009 and was elected as MLA from Jalalabad constituency in a by-election.He was again elected from Jalalabad in 2012 and 2017. Sukhbir Badal fought the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and became MP from Ferozepur seat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sukhbir-badal-finally-out-of-his-fathers-shadow-but-long-way-to-go-yet-376720
10-03-2022||New Delhi||AAP’s victory in Punjab extraordinary, but indictment of political establishment: Yogendra Yadav||Swaraj India president and former AAP leader Yogendra Yadav on Thursday termed the Arvind Kejriwal-led party’s performance in Punjab “spectacular and extraordinary”, but said it’s more “an indictment” of the “entire political establishment” rather than the success of a party in the electoral battle.Speaking to PTI, he said people of the state have given their mandate to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as it managed to present itself as the “only visible political alternative”.He also listed five key challenges that the AAP may have to face after coming to power in the state, saying the party will have to understand “federalism and respect regional sentiments” as Punjab has always “detested” Central control and rejected the control of “Dilli Darbar”.The AAP is ‘Dilli Darbar’ and it is controlled by Delhi, he said.“Needles to say their success in Punjab is spectacular, extraordinary. The real question is whether it is the success of Aam Aadmi Party or the failure of the entire political establishment,” Yadav said.For the last five years in Punjab, the AAP was a divided house with leaders deserting it and the party did not start any movement or any agitation or any protest, he claimed.“It did not play the opposition for last five years. Yet, it has been voted to power. To my mind it shows, this is more an indictment on the political establishment which has taken the form of endorsement of the Aam Aadmi party,” he told PTI.It’s a “vote of hope” for the AAP as people felt that “at least this newcomer” will be better than anyone else, he added.When asked if the credit for the party’s performance in Punjab goes to its national convenor Arvind Kejriwal, Yadav said he has shown “tenacity and political wisdom”, and also held his party together to give an alternative in the state.“To my mind it is primarily an indictment of the entire political establishment and AAP managed to present itself as the only visible political alternative and the people went for that.“Kejriwal has shown tenacity, he has shown political wisdom and has held the party together to give an alternative,” he said.Yadav, who have been one of the ardent critics of Kejriwal since his exit from the AAP in 2015, added, “I am not particularly sure of their (AAP’s) model of governance, I am not sure if there is.“I mean as I always thought that Gujarat model of governance was not much of a reality, similarly I have doubts about Delhi model of governance,” He said the AAP’s success in Punjab comes with “huge responsibility and challenge” “Punjab has always detested central control. Dilli Darbar has been the nemesis of Punjab politics. For the last 500 years, they have never accepted the control of Dilli Darbar.“The AAP is Dilli Darbar, it’s controlled by Delhi. So that should be the first challenge for them to understand federalism and respect regional sentiments, which they have so far not quite understood,” he said.Yadav said the farmers’ movement against three farm laws created the ground on which the AAP has taken its march to victory but “their own understanding of agriculture and farming has been non-existent so far.” “It’s an urban party, they don’t understand agriculture. So, understanding agriculture, farmers, their needs and their temperament is going to be the second challenge,” he said.He said the AAP has been voted “more by Sikhs than Hindus” in Punjab which is one of the few minority states and the party will have to ensure that justice is done to the “sentiments and aspirations” of the minorities in the country.“The AAP’s all politics has been a cloning of the BJP. They have peddled self soft Hindutva so far. So, would they be able to do justice to the sentiments and expectation aspirations of the minorities in the country. That is the third challenge,” he said.Another challenge that the AAP would face will be on the front of finances after coming at the helm of affairs in Punjab as the party has made big promises during its poll campaign, he said.“The party (AAP) has promised everything to everyone but Punjab is a state with huge deficit. In Delhi, they have more money than they know how to spend. They have dealt with the situations so far. In Punjab, they face exactly the opposite situation. So how would they handle that situation is the fourth challenge,” he said.The fifth challenge before the AAP is to deal with the menace of “drugs and liquor” in Punjab.“Punjab is sick and tired of that. But in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has actually promoted liquor, far from controlling. And Bhagwant Mann is somewhat an odd ambassador for anti-liquor politics,” he said.  The AAP can emerge as the “next alternative” only if it surmounts these challenges, and if they don’t, the only role that the party will play in national politics in the long run is helping the BJP, he said.“Punjabis are known to put their complete faith, so they reward you very handsomely and punish you very heavily,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aaps-victory-in-punjab-extraordinary-but-indictment-of-political-establishment-yogendra-yadav-376711

CM Charanjit Singh Channi and PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, who were also involved in dethroning of Capt Amarinder Singh, seems to have been pushed to the margins as per the counting trends.Interestingly, Congress Minister Rana Gurjeet Singh and his son Rana Inder Partap Singh have won their seats. #majha||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/majha-brigade-leaders-sukhjinder-randhawa-tript-bajwa-and-sukhbinder-sarkaria-survive-aap-tsunami-376692

10-03-2022||GS PaulAmritsar||Punjab Election Results 2022: AAP wave sweeps Majha; party leads in 17 of 25 seats||Majha has spoken. Initial trends show it has given a decisive mandate to the Aam Aami Party.Majha—a region that Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, and Pathankot districts constitute— sends 25 MLAs to the Vidhan Sabha. AAP could not win a single seat in 2017. This time around though it seems Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s frequent rounds in the region has paid off—the party’s leading in 9 of Amritsar’s 11 segments: five urban and four rural.AAP appears to have eaten into rival Congress’s votes too—the latter had won 22 of Majha’s 25 seats in 2017 but was leading only in four this time around.The real surprise however came from a seat where poll analysts had written off AAP: Amritsar East. AAP’s Jeevanjyot Kaur emerged as a dark horse in a race that was primarily seen as a two-cornered contest between two political behemoths—Shiromani Akali Dal’s Bikram Majithia and Congress party’s Navjot Sidhu.  Jeevanjyot Kaur led the race by 5,000 votes, and Sidhu and Majithia followed, in that order.In Amritsar North, debutant Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, the former Inspector General of Punjab who made his political debut as an AAP candidate, got 47,987 votes at the end of eight rounds: 21,710 votes more than his nearest rival, SAD candidate Anil Joshi, a former minister, who got 26,277 votes.In the Amritsar central constituency, Deputy Chief Minister Om Parkash Soni, a Congress candidate, was trailing behind AAP’s Ajay Gupta by 6,000 votes at the end of the sixth round of counting.In Majitha, SAD’s Ganieve Kaur was ahead of her nearest rival, AAP’s Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lali Majithia, by 17,657 votes.In Baba Bakala, Congress Santokh Singh Bhalaipur trailed behind AAP’s Dalbir Singh Tong by 4,011 votes at the end of the fourth round of counting.Reports said AAP was also leading in South, Central, and West Amritsar segments, all of which are urban seats, and Jandiala, Attari, Baba Bakala, and Ajnala—rural seats—at the end of the seventh round.In Rajasansi, Congress sitting MLA Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria is leading by a margin of 1,105 votes, followed by SAD’s Vir Singh Lopoke.In Attari, AAP’s Jaswinder Singh was ahead of his nearest rival SAD’s Gulzar Singh Ranike by 12,327 votes at the end of the fourth round of counting.GurdaspurAAP candidates were leading in four of Gurdaspur’s seven seats. AAP’s Shamsher Singh led in Dinanagar, Amarpal Singh in Hargobindpur, and Sher Singh (Sherry Kalsi) in Batala.Of the Congress heavyweights, Punjab’s Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa was leading the race in Dera Baba Nanak, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa in Fatehgarh Churian, and former Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Partap Singh Bajwa in Kadian.BJP’s state president Ashwani Kumar is leading in the Pathankot seat.Tarn TaranAAP’s candidates were also leading in all four of Tarn Taran's seats —Tarn Taran, Khemkaran, Khadoor Sahib, and Patti.AAP's Kashmir Singh Sohal was ahead of her nearest rival, SAD's Harmeet Singh Sandhu, by 7,675 votes in Tarn Taran. Sohal got 30,582 votes against Sandhu's 22,917 at the end of the initial rounds of voting.In Khadoor Sahib constituency, AAP's Manjinder Singh Lalpura got 16,910 votes against SAD's Ranjit Singh Brahampura's 12,210 votes—a margin of 4,700 votes.In Khemkaran, AAP's Sarwan Singh Dhunn was leading with a margin of 8,157 votes against his nearest rival, SAD's Virsa Singh Valtoha. Dhunn got 30,937 against SAD's 22,780 votes.In Patti, AAP's Laljit Singh Bhullar got 17,213 votes, a 3,288-vote lead against his nearest rival, SAD's Adesh Partap Singh Kairon (13,925 votes). #majha #punjab assembly election 2022 #punjab assembly election result 2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-wave-sweeps-majha-party-leads-in-17-of-25-seats-376682
10-03-2022||---||BJP heads towards crushing defeat in Punjab||Chandigarh, March 10Though the BJP was expecting the role of a kingmaker in the Punjab assembly elections but going by the current trends of counting the party is heading towards a crushing defeat. At present, the party is leading on just two seats.Party’s state president Ashwani Sharma is leading from Pathankot by 7,628 votes andJangi Lal Mahajan is leading by 1,213 votes from Mukerian.Four days back, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda had claimed that the party would do better in Punjab and was hoping for an important role for the BJP in government formation in Punjab.Since 2014, election after election, it has been a trend that the people in Punjab were not swayed by the Modi wave. This was visible in the current elections as well as the magic seems to have failed to sway the Punjabis.The saffron party was banking upon the polarisation of Hindu votes in the urban areas but that does not look like the scenario. At present, the party’s vote share is around 6.61 per cent, which is not much increase than 2017. Five years back, when the party had contested just 23 seats as an alliance partner with SAD it had got 5.43 per cent votes and had won three seatsThis was the first time when the saffronparty was contesting 73 seatsout of 117 and rest were contested by alliance partners Punjab Lok Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt).The party left no stone unturned to make its presence felt in the assembly elections.Apart from three rallies of the Prime Minister and 12 union cabinet ministers, two chief ministers Jai Ram Thakur of Himachal Pradesh and Manohar Lal Khattar of Haryana several ministers and leaders from the neighbouring states were pushed into the election campaign. #bjp punjab||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-heads-towards-crushing-defeat-in-punjab-376680

Capt Amarinder was trailing to former Mayor Ajit Pal Kohli who was riding high in the AAP wave. “It was writing on the wall as the Amarinder regime backed corrupt men to run the police and the Municipal Corporation in Patiala”, said AAP supporters.Even six time MLA Sadhu Singh Dharamsot was trailing behind AAP debutant Dev Mann, whom he had defeated in 2017 polls. In Rajpura, Congress MLA Hardyal Kamboj faced tight contest as he stood third with AAPs Neena Mittal who was in lead by 14,000 votes from BJPs Jagdish Singh Jagga.“It is the victory of the people and their unheard voice against the regime of Congress and SAD misrule of over 70 years”, said AAP candidate from Patiala rural Balbir Singh, who was leading by 13,000 votes till filing of the copy.Earlier in July 2021, after almost over two decades, the power centre in the Congress citadel of Patiala held firmly by Capt Amarinder Singh and wife MP Preneet Kaur, suddenly seemed to have shifted from their official residence of New Moti Bagh to the Yadavindra Colony based Navjot Sidhu’s parental house, after he was removed as CM mid-term. In the past three days, over 36 MLAs and senior leaders from Punjab Congress have visited Sidhu personally in Patiala.In a clear signal that the corridors of power have shifted from the palace to the colony named after the ancestors of Capt Amarinder in Nihal Bagh area in Baradari gardens, senior officials rushed to greet Kohli.“This is enough to show that political shift is not inevitable”, said a second generation congressman from old city who sided with AAP months before polls. #ajit pal singh kohli #capt amarinder singh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/from-moti-bagh-to-nihal-bagh-patiala-power-centre-shifts-to-house-of-former-akali-turned-aap-leader-ajit-pal-kohli-376678

In the tweet, he also posted a picture of him standing with the AAP's chief ministerial candidate and MP Bhagwant Mann, with both leaders flashing victory sign.The trends indicated that the ruling Congress has been decimated in Punjab while the SAD, which contested the polls in alliance with the BSP, has failed to make much impact.  #navjot sidhu||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-among-first-congress-leader-to-congratulate-aap-says-voice-of-punjab-people-is-voice-of-god-376674

Khanna||AAP landslide buries Congress, Bhagwant Mann set to become Punjab CM||Chandigarh, March 10As Aam Aadmi Party heads for a landslide victory, with almost all political stalwarts across the political spectrum trailing behind hitherto relatively lesser known AAP candidates, the big win in Punjab has catapulted the party to national prominence.Also read: It’s victory of the people, says AAP’s Bhagwant MannYou will see the change in Punjab in a month: Bhagwant MannThis is because the big win in Punjab is clearly a victory of the people, who seek to have rejected both traditional parties and their leaders. The will to see ‘badlaav’ (change) in the political establishment was apparently so strong that none of the “extraneous” factors worked, and people have voted against the usual lines of religion, caste and class. The way all big stalwarts have been trailing by huge margins, clearly shows the public contempt and disgust with the traditional parties and leaders.At 11.40 am, as AAP was leading in 89 assembly segments, celebrations have broken out in the party office, with party leaders and workers dancing to dhol beats and waving the party flags and chants of ‘jhadu phir gaya’. The trends now are more or less unlikely to change. It also proves that the AAPs pro development agenda has been given a mandate by the people of Punjab.This election, though the voter was by and large silent, they clearly seemed to have voted for a party that has promised them good education, healthcare and governance, rejecting the “caste”, “religion” and “dera” agenda. Hopes are high from the party and party leaders here assure deliverance.The party’s astounding win here also gives wings to its national ambitions. It cements the party’s position as the principal opposition party to BJP nationally. #bhagwant mann||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-landslide-buries-congress-bhagwant-mann-set-to-be-punjab-cm-376666
10-03-2022||Amritsar||Experts flag agrarian crisis in Punjab||The ongoing literature and book festival at Khalsa college hosted discussion on the agrarian crisis and the environment challenges being faced by Punjab. Several expert speakers spoke on issue concerning economic growth of farmers as well as farm practices.Dr Davinder Sharma, renowned expert on agrarian economics, spoke about several issues, stressing that the environmental issues and increasing the income of the farmers must be the focus of any new policy on agriculture.It is necessary to bring an environment- based solution to increase agricultural output and for that the governments will have to shoulder the responsibility of setting up such a huge economic infrastructure. —Dr Davinder Sharma, Agri expertRajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, Honorary Secretary, Khalsa College Governing Council, called upon the governments and the society at large to address the issues concerning farming in Punjab. He sought the minimum support price (MSP) to be given the legal sanction by making it a law and to be enforced fully to save the farmers.Dr Sharma earlier, quoting statistics on India’s agrarian crisis said that the monthly income of a farmer today is not even enough to raise a cow, then how can he raise his entire family. “Average income of farmers should be at least Rs 30,000 per month. To have another round of Green revolution would not be advisable as it would create environmental issues. However, in order to revive the environment of Punjab, it is necessary to bring an environment-based solution to increase agriculture output and for that the governments would have to shoulder the responsibility of setting up such a huge economic infrastructure,” he said.He added that the farmers are well aware of the problems of burning of straw and depletion of ground water in Punjab and they too wanted a solution to these problems. But leaving the burden of all this on the farmers alone cannot solve these problems.RMS Chhina and Dr Mehal Singh, principal, Khalsa college, released ‘Qaeda-e-Noor’, a program organised by Dr. Ajaib Singh Chattha of Jagat Punjabi Sabha, Canada. The program was dedicated to mother language Punjabi. Coordinated by Principal Beant Kaur Shahi, the program had scholars like Dr. SS Gill, Ravinder Dhillon, Principal Kanwaljit Kaur Bajwa, Principal (Dr.) Rajinder Singh, Principal Baldev Singh and Satinder Kaur Kahlon.

The decision was taken during a meeting of the Full Court, comprising the Chief Justice and other Judges.This is the third time in over a year that the HC, under Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha, has tightened the reins, sending across a strong message of zero tolerance amid subordinate judiciary.In November last year, the HC compulsorily retired two Additional District and Sessions Judges from both Punjab and Haryana. In all, action was believed to have been taken or proposed to be initiated against 16 judicial officers belonging to the subordinate judiciary of both states. Action was taken or proceedings initiated against 16 judicial officers in December, 2020, also.The action against Hemant Gopal came more than four years after his services were placed under suspension. Taking up a petition on the judicial side, the HC had in September, 2021, observed:“Though no final order has been passed by the HC qua Hemant Gopal, Additional District and Sessions Judge, who is continuing under suspension for the past about four years, yet prima facie, his indictment as per the inquiry report is apparent on record.”The matter was brought to fore after former MLA Mangat Rai moved the HC seeking stay on conviction on the ground that Gopal, on a complaint against him, was “found guilty of the article of charges that he has demanded illegal gratification while passing the impugned judgment of conviction and has acquitted one of the co-accused”.The Bench had observed it was clear that the then Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, CBI, Patiala, on a complaint given by the applicant-appellant faced departmental inquiry.

It is allowed while travelling by air on Indian aircrafts within India (domestic routes of fully domestic flights operating from domestic terminals only).The issue was also raised by an NGO — Amritsar Vikas Manch. Sandeep Singh Gumtala of Amritsar Vikas Manch said: “If Sikh passengers are allowed to wear a ‘kirpan’ on domestic flights, it is hard to believe that Sikh employees pose a greater security threat after undergoing security clearances. To my knowledge, Sikh employees at airports in UK, Canada are permitted to wear a ‘kirpan’ at the airside,” he said.The SGPC president said: “The governments should refrain from adopting such policies which hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikhs.”Move unconstitutionalThe new rules bar any Sikh employee from carrying a kirpan on duty. The Constitution permits wearing a ‘kirpan’ and banning it is unconstitutional. — Tarlochan Singh, National Minorities Commission former chairman #harjinder singh dhami #SGPC #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-flays-ban-on-kirpan-for-employees-at-airports-376522

Still, we have prepared the stock for the last-minute rush,” he said.Pankaj Madaan of Madaan Sweet Shop said, “Most of the time, the party workers contact us at the last moment.

Similarly, in Ferozepur (Rural) Joginder Singh Jindu of the SAD has been facing stiff competition from Rajnish Dahiya of the AAP.Ramesh Sharma, a retired government official, said, “Throughout the campaigning, voters remained silent.

Former CM Capt Amarinder Singh will be on toes to wrest his traditional seat with a good margin and also ensure “a solid performance” by his new political outfit.Prominent candidates, including Amarinder Singh, ex-ministers Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Surjit Singh Rakhra, two-time MLAs Hardyal Kambhoj and Madan Lal Jalalpur, along with Prem Singh Chandumajra, his son Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra, ex-minister Brahm Mohindra’s son Mohit Mohindra and ex-councillor Jaspal Singh Bittu Chatha are all padded up for the contest.AAP debutants, including Balbir Singh, Gurlal Ghanaur, Dev Mann, Ajit Pal Kohli and Harmeet Pathanmajra, and BJP’s Jagdish Kumar Jagga are also hopeful of making it to the Vidhan Sabha.PLC leaders say, “Our win is certain as the villages are voting for us due to Capt Amarinder Singh and in urban areas we are garnering votes due to the BJP.” SAD, BJP candidates believe the Patiala results would throw surprises and the divided Congress would not be able to save its citadel. A political strategist says, “There is very close contest at almost seven of the eight seats, where no one knows who has the edge.”“At stake will be the political future of former AICC president Rahul Gandhi, who single-handedly led the Congress campaign here. He was instrumental in replacing Capt Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Channi and the announcing latter as the CM face for 2024,” he said.No clear edgeThere is very close contest at seven of the eight seats in the district, where no one knows who has the edge.

We will form the government,” said SAD spokesperson Dr Daljeet Singh Cheema. “The exit polls were off the mark in 2017 when most gave a sweeping majority to the AAP. This time also, these pollsters will eat a humble pie,” he said.The election is special for the leadership of Sukhbir Singh Badal who was the face of SAD campaign. This was the first election for the Akalis in three decades when the party patriarch could not lead the campaign all over the state due to old age. He remained active in the Lambi constituency mainly.Party leaders said based on feedback of their party rank and file, the vote percentage of the SAD was increasing and this would translate into bagging more seats.” The party has already pushed for post-poll alliance.

And, then, there will be some who may turn out to be the surprise packages.In the fray from Gurdapur parliamentary constituency, which comprises nine seats, are Cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Aruna Chaudhury and RS MP Partap Singh Bajwa.For the BJP, the portents were ominous from the very start. The farm laws, despite their withdrawal, had comprehensively dented the party’s prospects. To complicate matters, MP Sunny Deol showed absolutely no inclination to campaign for his party, leaving many surprised.In Sujanpur, from where BJP’s Dinesh Babbu is seeking a fourth successive term, Naresh Puri of the Congress and Amit Manto of AAP are giving him a torrid time. When campaigning started, it was seen as a two way tie between Babbu and Puri but Manto managed his campaign in a professional manner and clawed his way back into contention.The Pathankot seat is witnessing a fierce contest among sitting Congress MLA Amit Vij, Punjab BJP Chief Ashwani Sharma and Vibhuti Sharma whose differences with Vij had forced him to join AAP. When he had left his parent party, the Congress had termed itas ‘good-riddance.’ However, with support from the AAP big wigs, Vibhuti has now become a thorn in the flesh of his rivals.Die-hard observers, who have correctly predicted results in the last four polls, are refusing to forecast the results this time in Dera Baba Nanak from where Deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa is contesting.Batala remains a conundrum. Ashwani Sekhri of the Congress is looking to a fourth win while AAP’s Sherry Kalsi is threatening to play spoilsport. Old warhorse Sucha Singh Chhotepur is seeking to ride on the strong SAD cadre present in rural areas. Experts acknowledge that the only seat where the Congress seems to be in a comfortable position is Qadian from where Partap Bajwa is contesting.In the 2017 elections, AAP had failed to bag even a single seat. However, this time it has surely turned the heat on its rivals and by the end of the day it may very well turn out to be the surprise package.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tight-contest-gurdaspur-dist-may-spring-a-surprise-376500

The results will also decide the political future of many candidates in the fray in the region.While Congress leaders are banking on CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s 111-days of work, the AAP is banking on its two poll faces Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann and ‘badlav’ narrative among people. Meanwhile, the SAD is banking on its regional connect and its development projects during their 10-year term and the BJP eyeing to increase its seats and vote share in the state and be the kingmaker if anyone doesn’t get the majority.In Bathinda Urban, senior Congress leader and Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal is locked in a fiery battle against AAP’s Jagroop Singh Gill, SAD’s Sarup Chand Singla and BJP’s Raj Nambardar. All these candidates are confident of their win, whereas voters have still remained mum over their choice.In Maur, SAD leader and former MP Jagmeet Singh Brar is in the fray against Congress’s Manoj Bala, BJP’s state general secretary Dyal Dass Sodhi, gangster-turned social activist Lakha Sidhana, who is contesting as an Independent, and AAP’s Sukhvir Singh Maiserkhana.

10-03-2022||Ruchika M KhannaChandigarh||Punjab Assembly poll results: Despite projections, AAP candidates edgy||The Aam Aadmi Party continues to remain in a dilemma. While the party’s Delhi-based leadership is ecstatic at the prospect of a landslide victory, based on the exit poll projections, the state leaders are still wary of what the future holds for them. With just a few hours to go for the results to be declared, the state party leaders are still wary of putting the ring to a final tally that the party could reach on Thursday. “Hawa bani hai ya seetan vi aaniyan ne (Will the exit poll predictions actually come true?)” This is the question that most of the party candidates are asking each other.If boisterousness of the party’s Delhi leadership is reflected in the statements issued at the behest of Delhi pollsters by the local leaders and the meetings that some of them have started having with Punjab bureaucrats and police officers, nervousness of the contestants and state leaders is also as palpable.This is because most of them are aware of the vote consolidation that happened in favour of their political opponents, and most of them are wary before they declare an absolute majority for the party. Though most of the AAP contestants in Malwa say the “Dalit factor” and the “dera factor” did not work a 100 per cent to the advantage of the Congress, Akali Dal and the BJP, respectively, they admit at least 30-40 per cent of dera votes went to the latter two, while Dalit votes did consolidate in Doaba area, the region where most AAP leaders see themselves to be the weakest.Unwilling to be named, these candidates, express their reservations at the exit poll results and are unwilling to claim victory till the results are finally declared.“In urban Assembly segments also, there has been consolidation of Hindu votes in Malwa, Doaba and upper Majha… which does not bode well for our party prospects,” said a contestant from the Malwa region. Undoubtedly, the public demand for change has proved to be the wind beneath the party’s wings. It has catapulted the party from the labyrinths to soar high, especially in the Malwa region (69 seats), and gives them hope of reasonable seats in the Majha region, where the party had failed to open its account during the General Election and the 2017 Assembly elections.Dera, Dalit factors||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-assembly-poll-results-despite-projections-aap-candidates-edgy-376487

In Amritsar East segment, where sitting MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu and former SAD minister Bikram Singh Majithia are contesting against each other, the scales may tilt the either way.The outcome will also decide the fate of former IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh who is contesting on AAP ticket from Amritsar North.Sitting Congress MLAs Inderbir Bolaria (South), Danny Bandala (Jandiala Guru) and Harpartap Singh Ajnala (Ajnala) faced stiff competition.AAP’s Inderbir Singh Nijjar (runner-up in 2017) and SAD’s first-timer Talbir Singh Gill may give tough fight to Bolaria. Similarly, SAD’s former MLA Amarpal Singh Bonny poses a challenge to Congress MLA Harpartap Ajnala in Ajnala.In Tarn Taran, SAD candidates appear to have an upper hand, especially in Khadoor Sahib (Ranjit Singh Brahmpura), Tarn Taran (Harmeet Singh Sandhu) and Khemkaran (Virsa Singh Valtoha) constituencies. In Patti, AAP’s Laljit Singh Bhullar has made his presence felt against sitting Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill.AAP seems to be giving a tough fight to the SAD and Congress in Gurdaspur and Pathankot. Stakes are high for Congress candidates Deputy CM Sukhjinder Randhawa (Dera Baba Nanak), Tript Rajinder Bajwa (Fatehgarh Churian) and Partap Singh Bajwa (Qadian).

10-03-2022||Predictions set to go wrong||Punjab Assembly poll 2022: Ahead of results, leaders speak out||A day ahead of the counting of votes, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi claimed the exit poll predictions would be proven wrong. “We will comfortably form the government. Let the votes be counted tomorrow, the people’s mandate will clear the things”, he said. The results will not only be the litmus test for Congress but also for Channi, under whose face the party went to the elections in the state. The elections’ outcome will set the agenda of a future leadership in the Punjab Congress, after party leaders Rahul Gandhi replaced the Jat centric leadership with a Dalit leadership – as part of social engineering.A senior party leader said the polls results would tell whether decision of party’s top leadership to play the Dalit Sikh card with face of Channi paid back or it. With serious differences among the top state leaders, the poll results would also decide Channi’s future political stature. “We are keeping our fingers crossed. We are hoping that Dalit factor has played beyond Doaba region”, said an AICC leader. — TNSWill get absolute majority: Bhagwant  Mann Claiming the Aadmi Party (AAP) will win over 80 seats, chief ministerial candidate and MP Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday said “the mandate of the people is clear in the exit polls and our party will form the next government which will free Punjab from the clutches of various mafias.”Mann visited the strong room located at Mahindra College, Patiala, and inquired about the arrangements made for the security of EVMs and counting of votes.He said Punjab residents were fed up of the past 70 years of misrule, which has left a debt of over Rs 3 lakh crore on the state. “With a thought that every penny should be accounted for, the people of the state have voted for AAP this time, said the AAP CM candidate. He appealed to AAP workers keeping a vigil outside the college to remain alert for the next 24 hours. Addressing the workers, He said the years of hard work was finally going to be paid off tomorrow as AAP would form the next government with absolute majority. — TNSSAD-BSP to form next govt: Sukhbir Singh BadalPredicting that the Congress will face a crushing defeat in the results to be declared on Thursday, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday claimed the SAD-BSP would cross the magic number and form the next government in the state.“The Congress will not even win 20 seats this time. The SAD-BSP will get atleast 16-17 seats in the Majha region only”, he said, after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple in Amritsar along with his family. When asked if the SAD-BSP can get in to an alliance with any other party post polls, if need be, he confidently said: 'The SAD-BSP will form the government on its own without needing anyone’s help.”He said the SAD was a Panth Punjab's organisation and the voice of Punjabi people. “As Punjab progressed during our earlier terms, we will again bring it back on the path of development with more intensity,” he said.Questioning the credibility of the exit polls, he said these should be banned as these were paid promotions by parties. — TNSPeople will give us chance: Capt Amarinder SinghFormer Chief Minister and Punjab Lok Congress (PLC) president Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said he expected a verdict in the favour of his party and the alliance partners BJP and SAD (Sanyukt). In his statement on the eve of the counting of votes, Capt Amarinder said, “The counting of votes marks the conclusion of the electoral festival of democracy and we are confident of an outstanding result.“We trust people’s judgement to deliver a positive verdict in our favour and provide us with a chance to serve them for next five years,” he said, while adding, the feedback from the candidates and workers was very positive and encouraging.The former Chief Minister said the people of Punjab understood the importance of a “double-engine” driven government in the snesitive border state, which will watch and safeguard the national interest and help in reviving the economy. “Promising days are ahead for Punjab,” he remarked. — #bhagwant mann #capt amarinder singh #charanjit channi #sukhbir badal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-assembly-poll-2022-ahead-of-results-leaders-speak-out-376481

She returned to Abohar today. Her group had landed in Amritsar on Tuesday. She was welcomed here by her father Rakesh Vij and mother Sapna.Sharing her experience, Diksha said while she was in Kharkiv, an alert was sounded to leave the city. She, along with other girls, reached a metro station by walking for 6 km but could not board a train. Amid shelling, they walked for 15 km more to reach a bunker in Pesochin. On their way, they saw bodies of Ukrainians, who died due to bombing, lying on the road. But they continued with their journey.She said they faced difficulty in making arrangements for food and water during their three-day stay at the bunker. “We were being assured of support but the Indian Embassy was expressing its inability to deliver food due to dire circumstances. It was also difficult to maintain contact with our families due to poor connectivity. Guidance and cooperation of Dr Karanpal Singh Sandhu, a facilitator of Ludhiana, was helpful in maintaining our morale. After four days of uncertain atmosphere, buses were arranged and the students reached Poland and Romania via various routes,” she said.After reaching Romania, we saw excellent arrangements were made by the Indian Embassy. The Government of India arranged for free air travel from Romania to Delhi. State government representatives were also present at the airport. But the returnees felt dismayed when traders outside the Delhi airport tried to fleece them and taunted them as they moved out for shopping, said Diksha. #indians in ukraine #ukraine crisis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ukraine-crisis-drew-tricolour-on-handkerchief-to-escape-376474

The stage is set for counting of votes for 117 Assembly seats with AAP emerging as a major contender. The Punjab Chief Electoral Officer said Section 144, CrPC, had been imposed in all districts to prevent crowds at counting centres and victory processions banned.Also read: Punjab Assembly poll 2022: Ahead of results, leaders speak outEC bans victory processions after Punjab poll resultsThe poll outcome will decide the fate of several political bigwigs in Punjab, including that of SAD patriarch and five-time Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal (Lambi). He is fighting against Gurmeet Singh Khudian (AAP), who quit the Congress for being “ignored.”Will retain powerWe will form the government again. Let the ballot boxes be opened. All will become clear. CS Channi, CongressExit polls a shamExit polls should be banned. These are not credible. People have again reposed their failth in us . Sukhbir Badal, SADAAP Govt for sureWe will form government, winning more than 80 seats. The SAD president is in denial. Bhagwant Mann, AAPWe trust the voterWe are sure of outstanding results. We trust people. They will give us a chance to serve them. Capt Amarinder, PLCFormer CM Capt Amarinder Singh (PLC), who won with an impressive margin of 52,000 votes in 2017, may not have it easy this time. He is pitted against his one-time confidant and former Patiala Mayor Vishnu Sharma of the Congress, Ajit Pal Kohli of AAP and Harpal Juneja of the SAD in Patiala. The clash between Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and senior Akali leader Bikram Majithia (Amritsar-East) generated a lot of interest. The stakes are high for both leaders. Majithia chose to shift from his ‘safe’ constituency Majitha to take on Sidhu.Both Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal are locked in a fierce fight with AAP candidates in Bhadaur and Bathinda-Urban, respectively. Denied the party ticket, CM’s brother Dr Manohar Singh is in the fray from Bassi Pathana as an Independent. Congress minister Rana Gurjeet Singh’s son Rana Inder Partap Singh is fighting as an Independent from Sultanpur Lodhi. While senior Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa is contesting from Qadian, his brother Fateh Jung Bajwa, who quit over ticket denial, is the BJP candidate from Batala.The SAD continues to provide a platform for family politics. The list includes president Sukhbir Badal (Jalalabad), his father Parkash Singh Badal, his brother-in-law Bikram Singh Majithia and Majithia’s wife Ganieve Kaur (Majitha). Former Akali minister Jathedar Tota Singh (Dharamkot) and his son Makhan Singh (Moga) both are in the fray and so are former minister PS Chandumajra (Ghanaur) and his son Harinder Chandumajra (Sanaur). The SAD, fighting in alliance with the BSP, hopes to do well in Doaba.As per exit poll surveys, the BJP-PLC-SAD (Sanyukt) coalition is unlikely to reach the double-digit mark. #assembly poll 2022 #charanjit channi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/poll-verdict-in-five-states-today-section-144-in-punjab-to-prevent-crowds-at-counting-centres-376452
