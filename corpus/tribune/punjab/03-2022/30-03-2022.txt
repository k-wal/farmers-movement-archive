The government should immediately clear the payment,” he said.The SGPC passed several resolutions on the occasion.It demanded from the Centre to start direct flights to countries like the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand from Sri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport in Amritsar.This resolution said about 50 lakh Sikhs reside in different countries and they face inconvenience in the absence of direct flights from Punjab.“An appeal has been made to the Government of India to adopt a serious approach on this issue,” an SGPC statement said.In another resolution, it urged the Punjab government to widen and beautify the passages leading to the Golden Temple.It said earlier a similar resolution was passed and sent to the Punjab government but it government did not act on it.Another resolution demanded that the Union government scrap the condition of having a passport to go to Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib at Narowal in Pakistan through the Kartarpur Sahib corridor.The SGPC also condemned the Union government’s decision to apply central service rules to employees of the UT of Chandigarh.The body termed it a “discriminatory” decision against Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-passes-over-rs-988-crore-budget-for-next-fiscal-382157

Khanna||Private schools can't hike fee in Punjab this year, Bhagwant Mann's big decision on education||Chandigarh, March 30Ahead of the commencement of the next school academic year, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday ordered Punjab schools against imposing any hike in school admission or tution fee.This will bring relief to hundreds of thousands of children and their parents in the state, many of who are forced to either change schools because of high fees, or withdraw their wards from schools and force the children to work in the unorganised sector.The CM also ordered that no school can force parents to buy books, stationery and uniform from a particular shop. The move is aimed at breaking the monopoly in the “education business”, which often led to these businesses dictating prices of the products, and parents have been forced to comply.The CM said that all private schools would have to ensure that all shops offer books, stationery and uniforms of their schools, so parents can chose where they want to buy these from.Mann, in a video message, said that education was like a third eye, which widened the perspective of an individual. “But it saddens me that education is out of reach of the common man. People want to give their children a basic education, but the high cost is an impediment,” he said.This is amongst a series of people friendly decisions that the newly elected Aam Aadmi Party government in Punjab has taken.Ever since he assumed office on March 16, Mann has launched an anti corruption helpline, announced the decision to regularise jobs of 35,000 contractual employees, announced doorstep delivery of rations and also slashed the multiple pensions given to lawmakers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/big-announcement-on-the-way-from-cm-bhagwant-mann-382116

He said that Chandigarh was made joint capital of Punjab and Haryana in 1966 and under the provision of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966, the state of Punjab is providing 60 per cent staff to the UT administration whereas Haryana is providing 40 per cent."Recently, the central government intended to implement central laws on the Chandigarh Administration. Newly elected Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has decided to regularise all contractual employees of Punjab. If the central laws will be applied to the Chandigarh UT then many of the contractual employees working in the UT office will be barred from these facilities," Singh said.He urged the government not to encroach upon the rights of the Punjab government.Union Home Minister Amit Shah on March 27 had announced that Central Civil Service Rules would be implemented for all employees under the Chandigarh Administration.The decision has evoked a sharp criticism from Punjab leaders who, cutting across party lines, termed it "an encroachment on Punjab's rights".If the Central Civil Service Rules are implemented, all employees will get the payscale under the Central service rules but also this will enhance the retirement age from 58 to 60 and the maternity leave for women employees will be extended to two years from the existing one.

30-03-2022||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana High Court: Custody claims should be examined by court of guardian||Chandigarh, March 29The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that claims between a minor’s natural guardians should preferably be examined by the Court of Guardian and Wards. The ruling came as the HC dismissed a case, where a mother filed a habeas corpus petition as “an additional simultaneous remedy” against the father after accusing him of illegally and unlawfully removing the child from her custody.Justice Vinod S Bhardwaj said: “I am of the opinion that custody of a father as a natural guardian cannot be held illegal or unlawful unless the same is in breach of some authority or order of law. Availability of an alternative efficacious remedy (under the Guardian and Wards Act) may not be a bar to the issuance of habeas corpus. However, competing claims between natural guardians should preferably be examined by the Court of Guardian and Wards, which is more equipped to determine the welfare of the child and offers complete opportunity to the contesting parties to establish their claims.”Justice Bhardwaj observed the question for consideration was whether a writ of habeas corpus should be issued when the proceedings for a minor’s custody were pending between the parents before the Court of Guardian and Wards — a family court — and an order vesting the minor’s interim custody in the father’s favour had already been passed.Justice Bhardwaj asserted the issue was not regarding the maintainability of a writ in the nature of habeas corpus “since the issue as to whether availability of an alternative efficacious remedy (under the Guardian and Wards Act) would prohibit the exercise of a writ jurisdiction well settled to the effect that it is not a bar”.Justice Bhardwaj asserted the situation would be entirely different where the petitioner had already taken recourse to a statutory remedy (under the Act) and had also filed a writ of habeas as an additional simultaneous remedy, which happened to be the position in the instant case.Referring to judgments on the issue, Justice Bhardwaj observed the law conferred a minor child’s custody with father. As such, it could not be held to be illegal or unlawful. It was evident that the child’s interim custody had also been vested with the father. As such, he could not be accused of keeping the child in violation of an order passed by a competent court or in violation of a procedure known to law.Justice Bhardwaj concluded the availing of simultaneous remedy would itself be a reason for writ court to be slow in intervention as disputed questions of facts should preferably be resolved after affording the parties effective opportunity to lead their evidence.‘Additional remedy’The ruling came as the HC dismissed a case, where a mother filed a habeas corpus petition as “an additional simultaneous remedy” against the father after accusing him of illegally and unlawfully removing the child from her custody.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-custody-claims-should-be-examined-by-court-of-guardian-381909

The changes will benefit UT employees in terms of increase in retirement age, pay and leave rules, etc. This new notification will not violate any provisions of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966.”He added: “UT Administration employees’ service conditions since formation of Chandigarh as UT (November 1, 1966) had been governed on Centre’s pattern till 1991. The pay and allowances were based on either Punjab or central scales depending on whichever were beneficial. Hence, while Punjab pay scales were given to UT employees from November 1, 1966, to December 31, 1985, they received central government pay scale from January 1, 1986, to March 31, 1991. In 1992, a notification issued by the Government of India gave both service conditions and pay conditions as per the Punjab Civil Services Rules.”SAD’s Harcharan Singh Bains said: “The issue Punjabis are agitated over does not concern employees. It concerns Centre’s motives against Punjab’s legitimate right over Chandigarh. If the Centre sets a deadline for the transfer of Chandigarh to Punjab, these technical details become irrelevant.”“The Centre and some other vested interests want to distract the attention from the right of Punjab over Chandigarh as it’s capital, a right recognised by the elected and serving PMs and endorsed by both Houses of Parliament in July 1985. Is there any sanctity attached to the commitments made by Parliament or not?

30-03-2022||Ruchika M Khanna||Russia-Ukraine War impact: At Rs 2,300 per quintal, wheat sells above MSP in Punjab||Chandigarh, March 29In spite of a production target of 132 lakh metric tonnes — similar to last year — the Punjab Government is expecting to procure at least 10 lakh metric tonnes of wheat less than what it procured last year.This is because the government anticipates that farmers will hold back some wheat in the hope of getting higher prices from private traders later. The increase is expected because of a global shortage of wheat due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and subsequent resultant demand for Indian wheat. Today, commission agents in different mandis of the state said the market price of wheat (old stocks) was between Rs 2,250 and Rs 2,300 per quintal. This year, the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat is Rs 2,015 per quintal.Globally, as wheat from the two war-torn countries — which are amongst the largest producers — becomes unavailable, prices are expected to zoom much beyond the MSP. It is believed based on the holding/storage capacity of each farmer, they will hold back stocks to be sold in open market at higher rates.“For now, only flour mill owners are buying wheat from mandis, wherever the stocks are available. Once the arrivals begin next week, we expect several foreign players to come and start buying wheat,” said Vijay Kalra, a prominent commission agent.Officials in the Food Corporation of India told The Tribune though the government is preparing for market arrivals of wheat to the tune of 130 lakh metric tonne, in the procurement season that begins on Friday, it is estimated only 122 lakh metric tonne will be procured by the government agencies, including the FCI.

Mann’s predecessor Charanjit Singh Channi had announced waiver of the university’s outstanding bank loan, but the CM did not speak about it during his visit.Utter chaos prevailed at the university during the unscheduled visit by Mann. Many outsiders attended the event, while students and faculty were left outside the Guru Tegh Bahadur Hall.Police personnel manned the entry and exit points of the hall where the CM accompanied by Education Minister Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer and others discussed university-related matters with the administration and later participated in the event. A number of union representatives also made a beeline outside the hall, wishing to submit memorandums to the CM, who entered the hall from a side door.“The university will not be left under financial burden. All pending issues of teachers would be resolved. No schoolteacher would be left to protest atop water tanks. They will exclusively concentrate on teaching work,” the CM said.He also honoured noted film director Manmohan Singh, renowned Punjabi actors Yograj Singh, Guggu Gill and Vijay Tandon, singers Mohammad Sadiq and Surinder Shinda and film producer-cum-director Smeep Kang.Interestingly, mediapersons were barred from the event. Expressing regret, university Vice-Chancellor Prof Arvind said it was the CM’s call not to allow the media inside the venue. — TNSDon’t take credit for ration scheme: BJPChandigarh: BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Tuesday asked the AAP government to tell the people of the state that the provision for the supply of ration was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while it distributes ration on the doorsteps of people.

30-03-2022||---||Day after revenue employees held captive in Lambi, staff go on strike across Punjab||Lambi/Muktsar, March 29A day after a large number of farmers under the banner of Bharti Kisan Union Ekta Ugrahan held naib tehsildar, a few patwaris and other officials captive inside the Lambi sub-tehsil office for nearly eight hours, officers and clerical staff of the Revenue Department today started an indefinite strike across the state.Revenue Department officers and officials even lodged a protest at the District Administrative Complex (DAC) here today, blaming Muktsar Deputy Commissioner Harpreet Singh Sudan and the SSP for the delay in freeing the staff.Notably, farmers were staging a protest outside the sub-tehsil on Monday but barged into the office in the evening. The protesters refused to allow the officials to move out and raised slogans against the DC and other revenue officials. The police pushed away the protesting farmers at night and reportedly used mild cane charge too.Acting on the complaint of naib tehildar Arjinder Singh, the Lambi police in the wee hours on Tuesday booked nearly 150 unidentified persons under various Sections of the IPC. They are, however, yet to be arrested.Further, on Tuesday morning, BKU Ekta Ugrahan activists again started a protest outside the sub-tehsil office. The DC said: “Of the total 6,400 affected farmers, just 2,600 have given their bank account numbers.” On the call of the Punjab Revenue Officer Association, Fatehgarh Sahib unit of the Revenue Officers’ Association also went on an indefinite strike.BKU condemns police actionMany not coveredA number of villages haven’t been covered while assessing the damage of the cotton crop. We were hopeful that the new government would do justice. — Gurpash Singh, farmer leader||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/day-after-revenue-employees-held-captive-in-lambi-staff-go-on-strike-across-punjab-381885
30-03-2022||Chandigarh||Drugs case: Give status of SIT reports, rules Punjab and Haryana High Court||More than seven years after the drugs case came under the judicial scanner, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today called for a status report on an application seeking directions to the state of Punjab to act upon three reports submitted between February and May 2018 by the then special investigation team head Siddharth Chattopadhyaya.The application placed before the Bench of Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Sandeep Moudgil added the reports contained the outcome of an inquiry conducted by the SIT against “the erring police officials, who are allegedly acting in connivance with the drug traffickers”. Taking up the matter, the Bench also fixed the case for further hearing on May 10.In the application, intervener in the case Navkiran Singh contended the sealed reports dated February 1, March 15 and May 8, 2018, were lying in a sealed cover. “It is pertinent to act upon reports so that further action may be taken in order to break the nexus between law enforcement agency and drug traffickers,” he added.Navkiran further added Punjab’s then Advocate-General had expressed the state’s willingness to take action on the reports lying in the sealed cover, on a previous date of hearing. The assurance to act came after the court questioned the state of Punjab on not acting on the reports lying in the sealed covers with the High Court.An FIR was registered on December 20, 2021, against former minister Bikram Singh Majithia under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act on the STF’s report. But action was not taken on the three reports submitted by the SIT.“It is the feeling of the applicant that the state of Punjab is going soft on the police officials. Hence, the present application,” Navkiran added.Appearing before the Bench, Navkiran submitted young people were dying because of the drugs, while the police officials, conniving with the drug mafia, were getting away with it as action was yet to be initiated on the reports. He added the opening of the reports was also essential as the general impression among the people of the state was that the police officials were hand in glove with those involved.Plea before Bench #bikram majithia #drug menace #navkiran singh #siddharth chattopadhyaya||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/give-status-of-sit-reports-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-381882
30-03-2022||Aman SoodPatiala||Toll hike from April 1, farmers threaten stir in Punjab||After a steep hike in fuel prices by the government, toll tax is set to go up at plazas across Punjab and Haryana. Farm bodies in Punjab have threatened to hold a statewide agitation, calling it another ploy on part of the Centre to trouble people of the state.According to orders issued by the National Highways Authority of India, toll plazas in Punjab, including those in Patiala and Sangrur, and even in Haryana will start charging 10 to 18 per cent extra toll from April 1.This means, the Dhareri Jattan toll plaza on the Chandigarh-Patiala highway is set to charge Rs 45 for single journey and Rs 65 for a two-way trip from cars, vans or jeeps, against Rs 40 and Rs 55, respectively. Similarly, mini buses will now pay Rs 70 and Rs 105 as compared to Rs 60 to Rs 90, respectively.“This is nothing but another ploy to punish Punjab and Haryana for the farm struggle and their agitation at toll plazas in the state for over a year. We will protest the move,” said Devinder Poonia, vice-president, Kirti Kisan Union.“On one hand, the Centre claims to be farmer-friendly, on the other it quietly takes anti-people decisions. After the farmers ended their agitation, the rates at toll plazas have been hiked to make up for the losses incurred over a year, without bothering about the common man. With this hike, prices of essential commodities are set to go up,” he added.The government and toll plazas should immediately reduce the hiked rates, failing which they would start an agitation, the leaders said.In December 2021, farm unions across the state had staged sit-ins at various toll plazas and refused to vacate these to protest an “unreasonable” hike in toll.“The move will push inflation further, as a hike in fuel and LPG prices has already hit the common man’s budget. The state government must oppose such moves by the Centre,” said a senior leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha.Meanwhile, NHAI officials said the hike had been cleared by the Centre and would come into effect from April 1. “We will revise the prices on the display boards as the hike comes into effect,” he said. #farmers protest #NHAI #toll tax||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/toll-hike-from-april-1-farmers-threaten-stir-in-punjab-381880
