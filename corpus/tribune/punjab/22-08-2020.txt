The dismissal was necessary to send a strong message that the state government would not tolerate such criminal practice, especially from those in uniform,” the press release said quoting Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.

But this time a glum year has given way to a yet more sombre Ganesh Chaturthi for the artisans who have been sculpting Ganesha statues for decades in Jalandhar.Leela’s (35) husband has been missing since February this year, leaving her to take care of two children on her own. She incurred a huge debt to sustain living during the lockdown and to prepare for the 200 Ganesha idols she had to sell during Ganesh Chaturthi. The entire year is past and now Leela anticipates a glum Ganesh Chaturthi amidst the just-imposed lockdown after 7 pm restrictions imposed today.For artisans who were banking on the festival to make up for the reduced dividends this year, the new restriction have also made the usually lucrative Ganesh Chaturthi festival for them a glum occasion where sales are unpredictable.Leela says, “I had complained to thana number 6 for my husband, Shankar. He left in February and still hasn’t returned. I alone take care of my children. We have debts from sabziwala (veggie vendor) and karyana wala (grocery vendor). With money yet to be paid to them, the 7 pm deadline and weekend lockdown has hit us hard during Ganesh Chaturthi also. Until last year we earned hefty sums during Ganesh Chaturthi. But it’s glum this year. Of the 200 statues I made, only three are big Ganeshas. Rest is all small because no one will buy. We don’t know how we shall sustain this year.”There is a little silver lining on the cloud – 30 of her Ganesha statues have already been booked by customers on call – but she worries whether all the statues shall sell.While Leela along with several kin belongs to Rajasthan, she came to Jalandhar 12 years ago from Jodhpur in pursuit of a better livelihood. Her hopes are pinned on finding her husband and bringing up her kids aged 15 (girl) and 12 (boy).Naraini, who also sells statues for a living, says, “Maang maang ke khaya pure saal. Ab fir lockdown lag gaya. (We begged for subsistence all year and now lockdown has been implemented again). The 7 pm deadline shall massively affect customers. While sales were brisk during the day, we were banking heavily on the Ganesh Chaturthi festival for a better livelihood for the rest of the year. While we sell clay pots and vases the year round, the big statues we sell on Ganesh Chaturthi pay rich dividends every year. Today and tomorrow were pivotal for sales. Today is wrapped up and tomorrow is lockdown.”Leela said, “Last year all my statues barring 15-16 were sold. This year we made 200, most of them small. If only we get decent sales, we can at least pay off the debt on various vendors.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/artisans-in-a-dilemma-covid-19-restrictions-weekend-lockdown-hit-ganesh-chaturthi-sales-129746

After all, Daya Singh was not a political person. Chaudhary Devi Lal was known for keeping political differences aside from personal relations. Old-timers know it well that he and Kairon enjoyed good relations at a personal level,” maintains Abhay Singh, whose father Om Prakash Chautala, too, has served as CM of the state.Terming this as a political conspiracy to malign Devi Lal’s family, Abhay Chautala adds that Gurinder Singh Kairon must have been fed by his (Chautala) family’s political opponents.Ranjit Singh, a Cabinet Minister in Manohar Lal Khattar’s government, who is third of Devi Lal’s four sons, said, “I was studying in Government College, Chandigarh, in 1962, when my father, as a recognised Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, submitted a memorandum to the President against Kairon’s corruption. On his complaint, an SR Das Commission of Inquiry under a retired Supreme Court judge was constituted. Kairon had to resign after the commission submitted its report. But this was all political enmity. To suggest that my father had any personal enmity with Kairon is completely absurd,” says Ranjit Singh.Ravi Chautala, son of Devi Lal’s second son Partap Singh, however said Daya Singh came in touch only when his grandfather was jailed during Emergency in Rohtak where Kairon’s killer was also lodged.Daya Singh is from Manaksar village of Rajasthan and was a frequently visited Chaudhary Devi Lal because he served my grandfather inside the jail during Emergency.“Daya Singh, now in his 80s, is still in touch with me,” Ravi Chautala adds.Devi Lal, who was the CM of Haryana twice from 1977 to 1979 and then again from 1987 to 89, served as Deputy PM of the country from 1989 to 1991 under VP Singh and Chandra Shekhar. Devi Lal died on April 6, 2001.The book records that Gurinder Singh, the younger son of Kairon, made a plea before the government for a fresh probe into the murder of his father.He also stated in his plea that Daya Singh’s death sentence had been commuted at the intervention of Devi Lal and noted that the closeness of the two indicated an underlying conspiracy.The government, however, refused to pay any attention to this plea for a CBI probe, the book further records.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/linking-devi-lal-to-partap-singh-kairon-killing-absurd-says-patriarchs-family-129472

The SGPC has its publication wing in Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib in Amritsar while the DSGMC has set up a printing press in Gurdwara Rakabganj Sahib in Delhi.The SGPC and DSGMC are also the authorised suppliers of ‘birs’ to Sikhs outside of India, through sea or air route, under strict norms of ‘rahat maryada’.However, reports have surfaced that two NRIs have set up a printing press in British Columbia and as of today, they have supposedly printed over a dozen copies to test their venture. It was alleged that when they were questioned by the local religious organisations and devotees, they were told that it was all done after procuring permission from the SGPC.Outrightly rejecting it, SGPC’s general secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami said no individual or organisation or trust was given the permission to publish ‘birs’ in any part of the world. Only the ones that figured in the Akal Takht’s verdict were authorised.“There were reports that a representative of Satnam Education Trust in Canada claimed to have got written permission from the SGPC to publish ‘birs’, but it is factually incorrect. All these claims are a ‘white lie’ and they have been misguiding the devotees and defying the Akal Takht edict in this regard,” he said. Though, in 2015, a proposal was mooted by the SGPC, under the leadership of Avtar Singh Makkar, to allow printing facility at British Columbia so as to cater to the increasing demand among the Sikh diaspora, it never fructified.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unauthorised-printing-of-birs-of-guru-granth-sahib-in-canada-sparks-row-129553

A number of officers of the state Excise and Taxation Department were allegedly taking monthly cuts from businessmen and transporters to allow transport of goods in and out of Punjab without paying the goods and services tax (GST).For Rs2-lakh monthly bribeADGP-cum-Chief Director of the Vigilance Bureau BK Uppal and Director LK Yadav said six persons, including four Excise and Taxation Officers (Varun Nagpal, Satpal Multani, Kalicharan and Japsimran Singh) and Excise Inspector Ram Kumar were arrested in this regard. The sixth person was identified as Shiv Kumar, an employee of a transport company.Two FIRs have been lodged against the accused at the Vigilance Bureau police station, Mohali, under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The bureau conducted raids all over the state to nab accused.“We suspect it to be a multi-crore scandal. The accused were causing a huge loss to the exchequer after pocketing a monthly bribe of Rs 2 lakh for ensuring safe passage of goods,” Uppal said.As per the FIRs, the racketeers used a system of codes where the accused coded a truck of goods as “passer” and let it cross checkpoints without paying taxes. In some cases, tax of a lower slab of the GST was levied on goods.The accused provided accurate information about “safe escape routes” to the transporters so that they didn’t have to pay tax at designated counters.Uppal said the Excise and Taxation Department was fully cooperating with the investigation and had helped the Vigilance Bureau in tracing the scandal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gst-racket-worth-crores-busted-6-held-in-punjab-129554

Shera had filed a special leave petition challenging the July 6 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court rejecting his bail plea.He had sought bail on health grounds and challenged an order of NIA Special Court, Mohali, which had turned down his bail plea in June.However, the High Court had rejected his bail plea saying the trial court’s order clearly established that he was in constant touch with co-accused and an active member of pro-Khalistan terrorist gang. He was associated with other members of the gang with intention to further its activities and after hatching a conspiracy, planned to carry out terrorist attack by causing explosion, the High Court had said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/supreme-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-tarn-taran-blast-accused-129555

The Local Government Department has already notified the Punjab Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Rules, 2015, under the Act.After being issued licences, the street vendors would be rehabilitated in demarcated vending zones in the respective civic bodies. As the department is relying on surveys carried out by the respective ULBs in 2016 and 2017, the total tally of the beneficiaries is expected to go up as the civic bodies have to conduct a survey every five years.Officials said 21,725 mobile and stationary vendors were identified by the Ludhiana MC, whereas the actual figure was nearly 30,000. In case of the Mohali MC, the survey had identified 990 vendors, whereas the figure stood around 1,300.The registered vendors were being given smart cards containing biometric data, licences and certificates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/data-on-street-vendors-to-be-digitised-soon-129574
22-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court: Ensure expeditious probe in cases of crime against women||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the police were expected to adopt a “sensitive approach” and take prompt action for expeditious investigation of cases involving intrusion into a woman’s privacy by sending vulgar and obscene messages.Sensitive approachTells police to adopt a “sensitive approach” and take prompt action for expeditious investigation of cases involving intrusion into a woman’s privacyJustice Arun Kumar Tyagi asserted women were now victims of heinous crimes, and subjected to domestic violence, cruelty, maltreatment and sexual harassment in “this land of ancient civilization and rich culture governed by the fundamental principle that no society can prosper without respect for women”.The Bench was hearing bail pleas in two cases of stalking and other offences registered at the Daresi police station in Ludhiana district police commissionerate. Justice Tyagi added that the necessity of respecting woman was expressed by a quote in Sanskrit — “Yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra Devata” — meaning: where women are honoured, divinity blossoms. As a result of the evils of domestic violence, cruelty, maltreatment, et cetera, women needed effective protection of law, administered by all agencies of the state with an iron hand.Justice Tyagi indicated that a law was in place for dealing with such situations. Unwanted intrusion into the privacy of a woman by sending her vulgar, objectionable and obscene messages and photographs, and making unwanted voice and video calls, subjecting her to harassment and defamation, had prompted the legislature to enact provisions for punishment for voyeurism and stalking under Sections 354-C and 354-D of the IPC. Provisions for punishment were also made for publishing or transmitting obscene material, and material containing sexually explicit acts et cetera under Sections 67 and 67A of the IT Act.Justice Tyagi made it clear that the deadline for probe completion was not specified, but need for expeditious probe was explicit from the provisions governing the grant of default bail. Although there was no specific provision in the CrPC, which specified time limits for completion of the investigation, but Section 173 (1) of the CrPC mandated that every investigation was required to be completed without unnecessary delay.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-ensure-expeditious-probe-in-cases-of-crime-against-women-129602

22-08-2020||Patiala||Amid pandemic, doctors assigned clerical work at Director, Research and Medical Education, Mohali||Amid shortage of Covid staff, 12 doctors from three government medical colleges have been assigned clerical work at the office of the Director, Research and Medical Education (DRME), Mohali.These doctors have already been relieved from their respective workplaces to scrutinise applications for the post of paramedical staff that Baba Farid University of Health Sciences had advertised for three government medical colleges in the state. Of the 12 doctors who have been posted this month, nine are from the GMC, Patiala, two from Amritsar and one from the Ambedkar Institute of Medical Science, Mohali.Ironically, 10 doctors have already been doing the same job at the DRME office. The authorities had faced flak for putting the doctors on office duties earlier also.The doctors, who were getting around Rs 1.5 lakh per month and were supposed to fight the pandemic, were doing the job other than what they had been recruited for, an expert said. It has been learnt that the doctors who have been assigned clerical work were adjusted at the DRME office just to make them avoid Covid duties. A senior faculty member at the GMC, Patiala, said, “At a time when doctors were needed the most, they have been shifted to clerical jobs.” Meanwhile, Dr Avnish Kumar, DRME, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-pandemic-doctors-assigned-clerical-work-at-director-research-and-medical-education-mohali-129547

Similarly, IMTECH, functioning under the CSIR, should be encouraged to test at least 3,000 samples a day.“While Punjab is home to institutions of eminence, such as NIPER, IISER, NABI, etc, it has not been able to get their support in testing because these institutions have not received Central Government’s support in ramping up their capacity,” the MP said. The Chief Minister had even requested the Prime Minister to set up an Advanced Centre of Virology at New Chandigarh in Punjab, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/central-institutes-not-helping-in-testing-ravneet-bittu-129549
