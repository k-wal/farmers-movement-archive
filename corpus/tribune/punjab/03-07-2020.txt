We also want to confirm the type of weapon used at Ladda Kothi shooting-range,” said Sangrur Senior Superintendent of Police Dr Sandeep Garg, who has been heading Sangrur and Barnala Special Investigation Teams (SITs).The police claimed they had recovered a toy pistol from the accused during the investigation.On June 30, a local court had granted interim bail to Moosewala in the Arms Act case which was registered at Dhuri Sadar Police Station on May 5.The next date of hearing is fixed for July 15.On May 27, the court had granted interim bail to constables Harwinder Singh and Jasveer Singh, Head Constables Gurjinder Singh and Gagandeep Singh and ASI Balkar Singh and shooting player Jungsher Singh and Inderveer Singh Grewal.On May 30, the court also granted interim bail to Karam Sukhbir Singh.“In an FIR registered in Sangrur, all nine accused have got interim bail. We are probing the matter further,” said Garg.A video surfaced online on May 4, showing Moosewala firing at a shooting-range in Badbar of Barnala district.On directions of Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta, the Dhanauala Police have registered a case, under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of Disaster Management Act against Moosewala and eight others.Another FIR was registered on May 5 against all the accused, under similar Sections at Dhuri (Sadar) Police Station, after a new clip surfaced, showing Moosewala firing from a private pistol at Laddai Kothi shooting-range.The police added Section 25 and Sector 30 of the Arms Act, 1959, in both the FIRs on May 17.In the case registered at Barnala, the court dismissed bail applications of the eight accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-await-forensic-report-on-sidhu-moosewalas-gun-video-108114
03-07-2020||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder accuses Sukhbir Badal, Harsimrat Badal of misleading people||Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday accused SAD’s Sukhbir Badal and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal of “misleading” people to promote their political agenda in the midst of the COVID crisis.The concerted manner in which the Badal couple are running a campaign of “deceit and lies” has exposed their “shameless double standards”, the chief minister claimed.The people of Punjab will not be taken in by the “political antics and crocodile tears” of the Akali leaders, who “looted” Punjab for a decade without sparing any thought for the problems of the masses, he further said.The chief minister’s remarks came a day after the SAD chief alleged embezzlement of central rations by several Congressmen and favouritism in distribution of food grains and pulses to Congress supporters in the state.Attacking Badal for his allegations, the CM asserted that the MLAs were supporting his government’s efforts to ensure that nobody goes hungry.The MLAs are close to the people and are well-placed to help out those in immediate or urgent need, which is what they have been doing, Singh said in a statement here.Pointing out that every Congressman in every part of the country was currently out helping people as part of the party’s concerted efforts to reach out to the needy in this hour of crisis, the CM said the Akalis could not relate to this as they had never seen beyond their own “personal interests”.Singh ridiculed Badal’s allegations that the food grains received by the state government had not been distributed among the people, pointing out that even the figures cited by the SAD chief were totally incorrect, showing how pathetically removed he was from the reality.Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, the wheat allocated to the state was 2,12,164 metric tonne, of which 1,99,091 MT had been distributed, while of the 10,800 MT ‘dal’ allocated, 10,305 MT had been distributed, a state government statement said.Under the Atmanirbhar scheme of the Centre, wheat (per person) and dal (per family) was provided for 14.14 lakh people and the state, after grounding the wheat to flour, added dal to make it one kg per person and put in one kg sugar on its own, it added.In fact, the state government had distributed 17 lakh packets to migrant labourers at a cost of Rs 69 crore from its own funds, with 10 kg ‘atta’, two kg dal and two kg sugar, the government said.This data was sufficient to show that Badal’s claims and allegations on food grain distribution were “totally unsubstantiated and baseless”.Taking on Harsimrat Kaur Badal on the issue of fuel VAT, the CM said if she was so concerned about the impact of the escalating fuel prices on the common man, why she was not pressuring the Union government to put a stop on the “uncontrolled” hike in prices of diesel and petrol.

After it is successfully completed, such tests will be done on migrants returning to the state in the wake of reopening of industries and for work in paddy fields.The state government will procure rapid antigen testing kits to scale up its COVID testing capacity, currently higher than the Centre's mandate of 140 tests per million per day in regions with positivity factor of less than 10 per cent, the official statement said.With COVID positivity rate of two per cent, Punjab is already conducting 242 tests per million per day as part of its comprehensive strategy to check further spread of the pandemic, it added.

Around 60 per cent of the samples didn’t comprise constituents as written on the wrapper. A majority contained lesser ethanol than mentioned. Several were found adulterated with water or other substances. Any hand sanitiser should contain 80 per cent ethanol or 75 per cent isopropyl alcohol, as per the WHO standards.After the outbreak of Covid-19 in March, the state government had allowed distilleries to produce sanitisers.Kahan Singh Pannu, FDA Commissioner, said most of the violations were of colour or lesser content. “Four samples contained methanol instead of ethanol. This falls in the category of adulteration and we have launched action against the violators,” said Pannu.Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol, is a chemical with the formula CH3OH. It is a light, volatile, colourless, flammable liquid with a distinctive alcoholic odour similar to that of ethanol. It is a toxic alcohol used industrially as a solvent, pesticide and alternative fuel source.The WHO has established that methanol is irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract. Acute oral and inhalation exposures and, to a lesser extent, percutaneous (through skin) absorption of high concentrations of methanol have resulted in central nervous system depression, blindness, coma and death.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sanitisers-may-contain-lethal-methanol-107841

The complaint was dismissed as “the Railways had failed to file a complaint in stipulated time”.Balbir Singh Sidhu, along with 200 to 300 supporters, was accused of stopping trains at Lalru during a state-wide agitation in May 2015 for over two hours, causing loss to the Railways. The incident took place on May 2, 2015, but the complaint was filed in the court on May 24, 2019.After hearing the arguments of the defence and prosecution counsels, the court opined: “Accordingly, the present application seeking dismissal of the case is allowed and proceedings in the present case are ordered to be dropped against the accused.”It was observed by the court that the complaint filed on May 24, 2019, after more than four years of the alleged crime, is liable to be dismissed as the court was not competent to take cognizance of the offence in view of the restrictions under Section 468 of the CrPC.The court further observed: “Moreover, the present complaint is filed under Section 174 of Railways Act and prescribed limitation period for filing such complaints is three years and the prosecution has not sought any extension of time during the investigation or before filing of the complaint under Section 473 of the CrPC. So, there was no occasion for the court to extend the period of limitation as the prosecution has not properly explained or specified facts and circumstances due to which the filing of the complaint was delayed.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/court-junks-plaint-by-railways-against-punjab-minister-balbir-singh-sidhu-107719

He is working at a scooter repair shop so that he realises how hard it is to earn money. I am hopeless now as the money was saved for my son’s future.”According to his parents, the teenager told them that he was using mobile excessively for online study. The 17-year-old (name withheld) had access to three bank accounts that were used by him to upgrade his PUBG profile, for in-app purchases and for other users (his teammates) also.His parents came to learn about this from their bank statements. His father, who did not wish to be named, is a government employee and has a medical history. He said his son used his life’s savings kept for medical expenses. The teenager has also allegedly exhausted his mother’s Provident Fund (PF) amount and some from his own account.“I had saved the money for my medical needs and my son’s future. During the lockdown, I was staying at the place of my posting, while my son was staying with my wife here. He used her mobile phone to make all transactions and would delete the message regarding amount debited from account,” said his father.He further alleged that his son had all account details as he used to make online payments for his mother’s kitty party. “We never knew that he was using our accounts for playing a game. Even the police didn’t help us as my son had deliberately spent it,” added the aggrieved father. “He spent around Rs2 lakh of her mother’s PF amount which she transferred to the bank account recently. I had kept some amount in his personal account and a majority of the amount was in my non-salaried savings account. All of it was gone in no time.”His son also played smart by shuffling the amount from one account to another to avoid any doubts. “After we received details from the bank, I found that on several occasions, he shuffled amount from one bank to another to avoid nil balance. He was using his mother’s phone for quite sometime and she was not much vigilant to notice this.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-teenager-spends-rs-16-lakh-on-pubg-107717

The Bill proposes to substitute free electricity to farmers with subsidy through direct benefit transfer (DBT).Officials said the proposed amendments were an attempt to take away powers from the states, especially with regard to appointment of power regulators. The Centre wants to table the proposed Bill in the next session of Parliament.According to sources, if the power regulator is appointed by the Centre, the state government will lose the “influence” over deciding electricity tariff. Moreover, free electricity to the farm sector is a politically sensitive issue in Punjab.Though the Central Government has clarified that it would not take away the power to appoint members or chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC), the state government feels that it would have little say in the appointments.The Bill proposes to have a common selection committee (instead of multiple panels), having equal representation from the Centre and the states concerned, to be headed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court.It is pertinent to mention that in May, the electricity subsidy bill of the Punjab Government stood at Rs 8,275 crore this year. The Central Government had asked the state to do away with free power and replace it with the DBT in order to avail additional market borrowings, but Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had refused to do so.Instead, the state government has been exploring ways to reduce the subsidy burden by solarising its agricultural power feeders.Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has clarified that they were examining the proposal of the Punjab State Farmers’ Commission to do away with power subsidy for farmers having over 10 acres of land. However, he reiterated that free power would not be replaced by the DBT.Fresh face-off with centre||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-to-oppose-bill-aiming-to-replace-subsidy-with-dbt-107766

Interacting with industrialists of Mandi Gobindgarh, Sirhind and Bassi Pathana, the minister said the Rs 20-lakh crore package announced by the Union Government was “a joke, as it encourages the industrialists to take loans from banks even as they are already availing the facility of bank limits”.  “This will lead them into a debt trap,” he said. The minister said there were 2.55 lakh industrial units in the state and of these, 2.32 lakh had been made operational. “We have written to UP, Bihar and other states that if they want to send labour back to Punjab, the state will arrange transportation to further smoothen the industrial operations,” Arora said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/minister-will-waive-fixed-power-charges-107769
03-07-2020||Saurabh Malik||HC: Keep college principals’ promotion list in sealed cover||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 2Directing the state of Punjab to finalise the tentative seniority list of government college teachers, Justice Deepak Sibal of the Punjab and Haryana High Court today directed that promotion to the posts of principals, if any, would not be declared.The direction by Justice Sibal came on a petition filed against the state of Punjab and another respondent by Manju Middha through counsel Harpal Singh Sirohi and Abhiraj Singh Baweja.‘Compile chart of aspirants’ merit’The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday directed the Union Public Service Commission to compile a chart showing the comparative merit of all officers considered for the post of the Punjab police chief. It was asked to keep the chart ready in a sealed cover for the court’s consideration.Issuing a notice of motion for July 22, Justice Sibal asserted: “In the meanwhile, final decision taken in pursuance of the departmental promotion committee, if any, for promotion to the posts of principals shall be kept in a sealed cover. The respondent-state shall also finalise the tentative seniority list of the government college teachers circulated on May 15.”The direction by Justice Sibal came after the petitioner sought directions for restraining the respondents from holding a departmental promotion committee meeting for promotions of professors and associate professors as principals based on the tentative seniority list issued on May 15 without finalising it.Sirohi had also prayed for the issuance of directions to the respondent authorities to count the petitioner’s ad hoc service towards seniority and to grant her all the consequential benefits. “The petitioner should also be considered by the DPC for promotion as principal since the petitioner is of 1986 batch, while people who are actually way junior to her are being considered for promotions,” Sirohi had added.Justice Sibal’s Bench was told that the action of the respondents of making promotions on the basis of tentative seniority list without finalising or amending it was illegal. The petitioner submitted her objections to seniority list within stipulated time. As per law, a decision regarding this was required to be taken before holding the DPC meeting. “In fact, the government is just buying time to delay the decision and waiting for the petitioner to retire. The petitioner in her 35-year-long career is entitled to only one promotion that as a principal... The government, through its inaction, is doing its best to deny that opportunity to the petitioner,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-keep-college-principals-promotion-list-in-sealed-cover-107770

In a letter to the Prime Minister, Sukhbir also requested that ration being sent under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) be monitored stringently through Central observers to ensure that ration received under the scheme was not pilfered and sold in the open market or distributed among Congress supporters only. He also urged the PM to ensure necessary measures were taken to ensure that the poor were not discriminated against during the distribution of the relief material. Sukhbir said even though the Centre had sent 70,725 metric tonnes of grain and 10,000 metric tonnes of pulses to Punjab, the same were not distributed among the people. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/probe-ration-scam-sukhbir-urges-pm-107772

On the other hand, Verka desi ghee was quoted at Rs 446 per kg and dry milk at Rs 352 per kg, including the GST.Daljeet Singh Gill, president of Progressive Dairy Farmers’ Association, Punjab, contested that negotiations could have been made with Verka. Thousands of dairy farmers have been associated with Milkfed and losing SGPC’s order that rolls in several crores would directly hit their income.SGPC vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said the tenders were finalised by a sub-committee and the firm with the lowest rates grabbed the order. “We have been using Verka products for decades, but this time, their rates were high in comparison to the Pune firm. There was a difference of around Rs 4 crore in desi ghee and Rs 1.30 crore in dry milk. How was it justified to ignore it?” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-hires-pune-firm-for-dairy-items-farmers-fume-107773

03-07-2020||Chandigarh||HC says Single Judge exceeded jurisdiction||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that its Single Judge exceeded his jurisdiction in issuing directions purely related to the High Court administration in a “criminal” matter. “Judicial powers cannot be invoked to run the administration of the High Court, which task vests in the Chief Justice or in the Full Court of the High Court and is regulated by rules and instructions issued in that regard,” a Division Bench ruled.The Single Judge had, among other things, directed the HC to ensure that technical persons were available at the time of hearing of cases through video-conferencing and that such technical persons should ensure that every case was available online.The Bench of Chief Justice Rajiv Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli asserted that it was impelled to observe that two matters, one for regular bail and the other for cancellation of bail, were before the Single Judge. In both issues regarding problems arising during video-conferencing were neither involved nor raised. In such circumstances, if any inconvenience was faced by the Single Judge owing to lack of any technical/secretarial assistance, the proper course was to bring the problem to the Registrar-General’s notice.The Bench said the issue in respect of which the impugned directions were given was neither a subject matter of challenge, nor within the roster assigned to the Single Judge. As such, the latter exceeded the jurisdiction vested in him. The Bench set aside the impugned directions.The matter was brought to the Division Bench’s notice after the HC through its Registrar (Computerisation) filed an appeal. One of the matters related to senior IPS officer from Himachal Pradesh Zahur Haider Zaidi. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-says-single-judge-exceeded-jurisdiction-107782
