08-07-2020||Chandigarh||Will contest SGPC, assembly polls: Sukhdev Dhindsa||A day after being “elected” as the president of the SAD by a faction of dissident Akali leaders, Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa on Wednesday said his group will contest the SGPC and 2022 Punjab Assembly elections.                    A faction of dissident Akali leaders on Tuesday had “elected” Dhindsa as the SAD president at a gurdwara in Ludhiana, a move dubbed as “illegal and fraud” by the party.Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, along with his son and former state finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa, was expelled from the SAD in February this year allegedly for “anti-party” activities.Presently, Sukhbir Singh Badal is the president of the Shiromani Akali Dal.             Dhindsa on Wednesday reiterated that the Sangrur convention held in February had “removed” Sukhbir Singh Badal from the post of the party president.               “We will fight the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elections,” he added. Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal’s senior leader Balwinder Singh Bhunder asked Dhindsa to respect democratic norms and abstain from making “false claims”, which will only “lower” his stature. In a statement here, Bhunder said Dhindsa was a senior politician and he understood how political parties worked and should not try to mislead the people with false claims. “Forget taking over any party, least of all the SAD,” he said, adding that Dhindsa was himself not a member of his parent party from which he was expelled. He said Dhindsa had not even participated in the party membership drive last year. Giving details, the SAD leader said as per the party constitution, subsequent to the membership drive and formation of circle and district units, as many as 540 delegates are chosen covering Punjab, Haryana and other states. He said these delegates attended the general ‘ijlas’ (convention) of the party which led to the election of Sukhbir Badal as the president of the party. “Both Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son Parminder Singh Dhindsa did not attend the ‘ijlas’, what to speak of challenging the party leadership at the appropriate forum,” said Bhunder. Dhindsa had rebelled against the party leadership, especially its chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, in a bid to “liberate” the SAD from the Badal family and “revive its lost glory”. Dhindsa later joined hands with SAD splinter groups, including the SAD (Taksali). His son Parminder Singh Dhindsa, an MLA from Lehra, had also resigned from the post of the party leader in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, questioning the “lack of internal democracy” within the Akali Dal. The SAD had earlier alleged that Dhindsa and his son Parminder Dhindsa were being used as “pawns” by the Congress in a bid to weaken the “panthic” party.

08-07-2020||London||New guidance launched to help people from Punjabi community in UK with alcohol problems||New guidance on setting up a specialist project for people from the Punjabi community in the UK with alcohol problems has been published for the first time.The guide, developed by alcohol, drugs and gambling charity Aquarius, and researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Birmingham, is based on the evaluation of an alcohol service initiative for a Punjabi community in the West Midlands.Offering advice on setting up a project, developing a project model, project management, project delivery, as well as useful resources, the guidance has been developed from work led by substance use researcher Professor Sarah Galvani from Manchester Metropolitan. The guidance is the first of its kind in the UK, according to a press release.The research team, according to a release, has drafted new guidance for managers and commissioners considering setting up a project of this kind, providing best practice on how to work productively with local communities when providing services addressing alcohol use within South Asian communities in general, and the Punjabi community in particular.Professor Galvani, Professor of Social Research and Substance Use at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “There is dearth of research into the specific needs of people in minority ethnic communities who may be using alcohol and other drugs problematically.“Far more attention is needed to support our diverse communities and to determine the most effective ways of supporting people, and their families. As one community member told me, there is a habit of “parachuting in ‘white’ services” and expecting that to work.”  Report co-author, Dr Surinder Guru, Senior Lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said: “Drinking within the Punjabi community is very gendered. Heavy drinking by men is common practice but women’s drinking is frowned upon.“This creates tensions in families and women can suffer rejection and shame within the community and family,” Guru said.The authors’ recommendations also provide a framework for supporting people from other communities with alcohol problems who are not engaging with existing services.   Aquarius ran the alcohol service initiative, called The Shanti Project within the Punjabi community from 2016-19.The project was developed out of the organisation’s concern for the number of middle-aged Punjabi men presenting to Accident and Emergency departments with serious alcohol-related liver conditions that needed earlier detection.

But its history also mentions the love story between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Mooran Sarkar, a Muslim courtesan. It is believed that Pul Kanjri, that was known as Pul Mooran before, got its popular name from her since dancers were addressed as kanjris back in the day.Pul Kanjri now stands in isolation, right between the twin cultural cities of Lahore and Amritsar as an example of fine architectural heritage of that period and a symbol of love. Highlighting the significance of this historical site of Punjab, Harpreet Sandhu, a photographer and an advocate by profession, shot a documentary titled ‘Pul Kanjri’ during the lockdown. He shot the film solo and got it edited by his team in Mumbai. It was telecast on a TV channel on Tuesday.“My sole aim to shoot the documentary was to highlight the story and history behind one of the beautiful architectural marvels of Punjab — Pul Kanjri. Despite its historical significance, Pul Kanjri has not been given its due in contemporary India, especially Punjab. Even in Amritsar, a lot of people are not aware of its existence, which is tragic as Pul Kanjri was a hub of cultural activities during the period of Maharaja Ranjit Singh,” said Sandhu. The Punjab Tourism Department includes Pul Kanjri in its heritage tours, but Sandhu says that mere footfall is not enough to reconnect with this hidden gem of history.The documentary was released worldwide by MP Gurjeet Aujla in the presence of DC Shivdular Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/film-unravels-history-behind-punjabs-architectural-marvel-%E2%80%94-pul-kanjri-110064

However, there was no mention of the students living in other states.The HRD Ministry, however, stated the students unable to appear in final-year exams in September would get another chance. However, if all students opt to take exams later, it may become a dicey situation for the PU.Though officials concerned did not wish to comment on this issue, the Public Relations Department issued a statement: “The PU authorities have gone through the guidelines issued by the UGC regarding conducting of exams. The university is preparing a detailed plan for its working and implementation keeping in mind the interest and convenience of students.”An official said: “Expecting any such decision, we had prepared two plans. We have already completed the ground work. However, Covid cases reported on the campus have put us in a doubt. The process of setting up question papers, exam centres, finding the number of students and others will be completed before this month.”Last month, the PU announced some standard operative procedures (SOPs) expecting semester examinations in July. The guidelines allowed a maximum of 150 candidates at each centre in one session; two-hour duration for an exam; wearing a face mask compulsory for teachers; staff and students, one assistant superintendent deputed for every 15 students; downloading Aarogya Setu app; bringing own water bottle; sanitisation of building/ benches; thermal screening of candidates; social distancing; no candidate or examination staff from the red zone/containment zone; summary note of safety measures for all; and no person above 65 years of age expectant mothers or specially abled persons on duty.Students’ takeMeanwhile, students are of a view that the ministry should take back the decision. “Any kind of situation which involves presence of several individual at one place should be avoided during the pandemic.

Dhindsa has the right to form a new party, but our objection is to the fraud committed by him by claiming the SAD as his party. Dhindsa had been a part of the SAD for long. He knows that there is a constitution and a party structure that elects the office-bearers as well as the president.”Cheema alleged that Dhindsa had also wronged SAD (Taksali) president Ranjit Singh Brahmpura. He said Dhindsa did not wait for the veteran leader to come out of the hospital and even refused his overture to become the president of the SAD (Taksali), if he wanted to head a party to take on the SAD.Cheema said apparently, it was the Congress that advised him not to have any truck with the Taksalis on the assumption that doing so would drive away the Hindu community from the outfit.“We respect the Taksali leaders. They have made a huge contribution to the SAD. Dhindsa should not have run away from using the name Taksali at the instance of the Congress,” he said.Cheema alleged that AAP leaders and Dhindsa were working at the behest of the Congress to form a grand alliance against the SAD, but the people would see through this conspiracy and reject both of them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-behind-illegal-move-alleges-sad-109997

The memorial’s doors are likely to be thrown open to public on August 15.Since it is located in close proximity to the Golden Temple, which witnesses millions of visitors, the visiting hours will be extended to ensure that people have ample time to visit the memorial after sunset. It is learnt that a high-profile team of the Union Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has scheduled a visit to the historic site on July 13 to review the developments before making an official announcement.The memorial has been lying closed since February 15. The Union Ministry of Culture had announced to open it by April 12, but the renovation work was disrupted owing to the Covid-19-induced lockdown. The next deadline was set at June 15, but it was further extended to July 31.MP Shwait Malik, who is also a member of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, said he had proposed to extend the visiting hours till 9 pm at least. “The proposal to extend the visiting hours has received positive response from the trust members. We have improved facilities, introduced modern digital lights and sound show, documentaries and special light arrangements for late evening programmes,” he said.The restoration work and allied services worth Rs 19.36 crore was being carried out by the Ministry of Culture under the supervision of the ASI. As part of the project, entry and exit points have been repositioned, the narrow passage and the green belt have been redesigned with new lightings.

Over 2,700 kg of virus-laden waste was generated every day in June.The Covid biomedical waste (PPE kits, gloves, masks, goggles, face shields, dressings, beddings contaminated with body fluids or blood, blood bags, needles, syringes and cotton swabs) is other than the normal waste generated in hospitals and nursing homes across Punjab.With Covid-19 cases on the rise, the authorities expect further increase in biomedical waste Data given by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB)points out that against an average of 2,710 kg of Covid biomedical waste generated in June, the waste generated per day between May 18 and 31 (when curfew was lifted) was 1,930 kg per day. Against 27,083-kg Covid waste collected from isolation wards, institutional quarantine centre, sample collection centres and laboratories conducting the tests between May 18 and 31, 81,400-kg waste had been collected in June, which is more than the waste collected between March 25 and May 17 (a total of 72,194 kg).Though the board is yet to collate the data for the first week of June, a private agency hired by the authority for the disposal of waste in five districts of the state, said there was a 15 per cent jump in daily Covid biomedical waste generated since the beginning of July. Sarabjit Singh, proprietor of Rainbow Environment Private Limited, which collects waste from Jalandhar, Mohali, Ropar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Nawanshahr, said 500 kg of waste was being collected from just five districts now. With Ludhiana, Amritsar and Sangrur among the worst-hit districts having maximum active cases, the waste collection there would have increased manifold.Krunesh Garg, member secretary of the board, said to meet any exceptional increase in the volume, the board was identifying more industrial incinerators, where this waste could be disposed of.“Special teams monitor the handling, transportation and disposal of waste at five common biomedical waste treatment facilities. While the yellow category Covid waste is immediately incinerated, the red, blue and white category waste is first disinfected through autoclaving and then incinerated,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/spike-in-biomedical-waste-amid-pandemic-disposal-a-challenge-110003

The high-level committee will expose the wrongdoings of this panel.The decision came three days after Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh formed a three-member high-level committee to probe utilisation of funds by the management committee.In a letter, the Education Department claimed that the management committee neither submitted the required information nor followed the directions of the department.“To ensure a proper inquiry by the high-level committee, the department is of the view that the management committee should be suspended immediately and the ADC (G) appointed as the administrator,” said the order issued by Indu Malhotra, DPI (Colleges).Last month, through another letter, the authorities had directed the management committee to continue the enrolment of students in BA-I. Apart from it, the department had also sought details of income, property, grants received from the government and non-government sources and information on loans taken to run the college.However, the college management remained adamant on scrapping the course from the current academic session, claiming that the number of students was declining.Cabinet minister and local MLA Vijay Inder Singla said since the controversy erupted, he had been giving feedback to the CM and Higher Education Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa to save the institute.“The management committee would not be allowed to stop admissions to BA-I for the 2020-21 academic session at any cost.

08-07-2020||Saurabh Malik---||HC: Contents of FIR cannot be amended||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 7 The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the contents of an FIR could not be amended. The ruling came in a case where the Punjab Police added new facts to the FIR, compelling the High Court to observe that such a course of action was alien to criminal law.  Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan asserted certain new facts on the basis of complaints were added to the FIR by registering two daily diary reports, even though the procedure was “unknown to the criminal law”.  “There is no such provision in CrPC for amending the contents of the FIR, where new allegations are with regard to different transactions...,” Justice Sangwan added. The High Court was hearing a petition filed against the state of Punjab for grant of anticipatory bail in an FIR registered on June 18 for cheating and other offences under Sections 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the IPC at the Batala City Police Station. The court on the previous date of hearing was told by the counsel for the petitioners that there was a total mismatch between the contents of the FIR and the investigation being carried out on its basis.  It was further contended that the FIR talked about the purchase of jewellery by the petitioners on behalf of a third person and giving a cheque to the complainant on his behalf. But the investigation talked of an entirely different issue regarding the issuance of power of attorney in favour of the petitioners by the complainant. Appearing on the complainant’s behalf, another counsel has submitted an amendment was carried out in the FIR by way of two “rapats” or DDRs. These “rapats” were physically handed over to the Reader of the court while the matter was being heard through video-conferencing. However, the same was inadvertently not noticed as the documents were not brought to the notice of the court at the time of deciding an application. Referring to the facts of the case, Justice Sangwan added that the court was of the opinion that the entire case was based upon the documentary evidence for which the custodial interrogation of the petitioners was not required. Allowing the petition, Justice Sangwan directed the petitioners to be released on interim bail to join the investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-contents-of-fir-cannot-be-amended-110014

Not just Rahul, but the entire country wanted to know what went wrong in Galwan valley on June 15, he added.In fact, said Capt Amarinder, Rahul had been discussing the China issue with him for a long time, and had been concerned about the matter even while the Central Government was vehemently denying any stand-off in Galwan.Pointing to the latest statements from the Prime Minister on no intrusion having taken place in the region, he asked how the Chinese were now backing off without having entered Indian territory in the first place. These were the kind of questions being raised by Rahul, he noted, adding that instead of answering them, the Centre continued to be in denial even now. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/attack-on-rahul-bid-to-hide-failings-capt-amarinder-singh-110016

Uprooting of one such tree on the Palampur bypass recently resulted in damage to public and private property, as well as to the occupants of a car passing by the road.Residents of the town and adjoining areas have lodged protests over the issue, but the authorities concerned have not removed the trees. Residents near Kapila Nursing Home, Tiny Tots School, Mission Compound, Maranda town and Karan Hospital complex are a worried lot as nearly one dozen such trees there are on the verge of collapse. They have moved petitions before the SDM, Palampur, Division Forest Officer, Palampur, and other authorities for removal of tress, but no action has been taken.The SDM, along with the DSP, Palampur, officials of the NHAI, local Municipal Council, PWD and Revenue Department had identified over 100 dangerous trees two years ago. Though the authorities concerned had been directed to start removing these immediately, the letter issued by the SDM office remained confined to files.The hanging trees with branches spread all over have resulted in many accidents on the highway and internal roads of Palampur. Last year, two occupants of a car on their way to Palampur had a narrow escape near the old bus stand, when a tree fell on the car. In another accident, a youth riding a bike lost his life when a tree hit him on the highway, near the HP Agriculture University.Dharmesh Ramotra, SDM, said the matter had come to his notice after an accident that took place on the Palampur bypass. He said directions were being issued to the department concerned to remove dangerous trees at the earliest.
