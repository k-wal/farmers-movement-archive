Earlier, two Congress-sponsored rallies were stopped from entering the state. Likewise, we will stop his rally and won’t allow him to enter Haryana,” Vij had told reporters.Rahul Gandhi will hold tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana from October 4-6 to protest against the contentious farm laws.“Rahul will start his Kisan Mazdoor Yatra on October 4 from Punjab’s Moga. On October 6, this yatra will enter Haryana from the Pehowa border,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in Kaithal on Friday.He said if the BJP-JJP government tried to stop him from entering Haryana, Congress workers will court arrest.Meanwhile, Amarinder Singh flayed the “obnoxious manner” in which the BJP had been trying to “browbeat the opposition and muffle its voice, first in Parliament over the farm Bills and then on Thursday in UP where the Gandhis were forcibly stopped from meeting the distressed family of the victim of the shocking Hathras incident”.“Vij’s statement showed that these acts were not arbitrary but a part of a grand design by the BJP to destroy all Opposition,” the CM said.“But the BJP will not succeed. The people of India will not let them get away with this. They will once again be reduced to the two-odd seats in Parliament from where they had started their political journey,” Amarinder Singh warned. PTI
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||COVID-19: At 3%, Punjab’s case fatality rate is twice India’s||Punjab’s case fatality rate (CFR) is now twice that of the country, the state’s bulletin showed on Friday.The COVID bulletin showed that Punjab’s CFR on Friday peaked to 3, as against the country’s CFR of 1.6 per cent---a development that came even as the number of new positive cases dropped to 1,071 on Friday.As many as 50 people have succumbed to the contagion in the past 24 hours and 3,501 persons have died in Punjab since the state reported its first COVID death in March.The high CFR in the state is giving jitters to the health authorities, especially considering that CFR is falling across India and globally.  Districts like Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar are reporting a CFR of almost 4 per cent. Eight deaths were reported in Amritsar on Friday, and six in Ludhiana and Gurdaspur---a place that emerging as a new hotspot.Dr Rajiv Bhaskar, state nodal Officer for COVID-19, told The Tribune that the main reasons for the continuous increase in CFR was the high incidence of comorbidities in the state population, and the late testing of positive cases.“There is high incidence of diabetes, coronary ailments and obesity in Punjab’s population. Also, people are arriving for testing late, after the infection has reached a late stage. We are actively encouraging home isolation to ensure that people have no fear of being isolated in institutional treatment and get themselves tested as soon as they show symptoms. We are hopeful of the CFR falling fast,” he said.Punjab has also been criticised for low testing. The number of tests done per day is just 30,000, and the state's positivity rate is 6.2 per cent. The positivity rate is higher in the state, as compared to other states like Bihar (2.5 per cent) and Jharkhand (3.7 per cent), where similar levels of testing are being undertaken.District                 Cases               DeathsLudhiana             18203                  750Jalandhar            13219                   396Amritsar              10278                   371Patiala                 11725                   328Sangrur                 3599                   150Mohali                 10648                   192Hoshiarpur            4647                   164Gurdaspur             6073                   154Ferozepur              3815                  103Pathankot               3765                  80Tarn Taran              1676                  68Bathinda                 5976                 117Fatehgarh Sahib     1938                  86Moga                      2270                  72Nawanshahr           1660                  50Faridkot                  2782                  45Fazilka                    2460                  37Kapurthala             3347                  143Ropar                    2142                    78Muktsar                 2547                   44Barnala                  1850                  43Mansa                   1594                   30Total.                 1,16,213                3,501
02-10-2020||Phagwara||Men armed with swords attack sarpanch in Punjab's Phagwara||Armed assailants attacked a village sarpanch here with sharp-edged weapons on Friday and severely injured him, police said.Harjit Singh (60) was initially hospitalised in Panchhat and then taken to the civil hospital in Phagwara. He was later referred to the DMC hospital in Ludhiana, they said, adding that his condition is critical.Tarlochan Singh, son of the sarpanch, told reporters that his father was going on his motorcycle to fetch milk like he did every day when he was attacked by six-seven men.He said the assailants were hiding in a roadside field to pounce on the sarpanch."When my father reached near them, they virtually waylaid him, attacking him with swords and 'datturs' while he was still on his bike. After the attack, my father fell down and the assailants pounced upon him, inflicting multiple serious injuries to him," Tarlochan Singh said.Police did not rule out old enmity as a motive behind the murderous assault.

02-10-2020||Amritsar||'Sidhu is an important asset for the party's future': Rawat||Navjot Singh Sidhu would play a vital role to make former AICC president Rahul Gandhi's tractor rally a success.This rally has been rescheduled for October 4 from Moga, before entering Haryana on October 6, in support of farming community's contest against the farm acts enacted by the NDA-led Centre government.This was disclosed by AICC's general secretary, and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, who commemorated Gandhi Jayanti programme along with cabinet minister OP Sonia, and MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla at Company Bagh on Friday.Earlier, Rawat held a closed-door meeting with Sidhu at his residence on Thursday evening.Insiders said, that Rahul's tractor rally was also being utilised as a "relaunching pad" for Sidhu in the mainstream political programmes of Congress, and show a united face.Sidhu had maintained a distance from party affairs, since June 2019, when he quit Captain Amarinder's cabinet.Rawat told, that Sidhu would certainly participate in Rahul Gandhi's tractor rally."I, myself, would take Sidhu to attend the programme that was to commence from Moga. Sidhu’s participation is vital for the party on all fronts. He is our most important asset for the future. The party would certainly utilise his services and capacity. You may see his frequent participation in party programmes”, he said.On CM-Sidhu feud, he said: “Leave some work for me to do. If there are differences, I will work as a conduit between them”.About SAD and BJP, he said: “ In Punjab, we have two ‘tops’ (cannons)-Capt. Amarinder is ‘anubhavi top’ and Sidhu has ‘Janta ki pyar ki top’ (crowd puller). Both are enough to counter them. SAD has lost ground due to their ‘sins’ of the past and BJP has been cornered due to the controversial farm Acts. So both have no future”.SAD’s move to take out ‘Kisan rally’ from three Takhts-Akal Takht, Takht Damdama Sahib and Takht Kesgarh Sahib to have to be countered by the Congress in this ‘credit war’ on agrarian crisis and the star campaigner Sidhu could bring dividends for the party.
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder launches signature campaign in Punjab against farm laws||Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday launched the Congress’ signature campaign in the state against the new farm laws and slammed the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for its “political theatrics” over Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Union Cabinet.Singh said the SAD is projecting Badal’s resignation from the Narendra Modi Cabinet against the farm bills “as a big sacrifice instead of a duty towards Punjab”.Recalling that he himself had “resigned from Parliament twice to uphold the interests of the state and its people”, the chief minister said he had done it out of a sense of duty and never as a sham sacrifice, “as had been done by Badal”.He trashed the recent SAD protests over the new farm laws as a “complete failure”, and termed it as an “attempt to vitiate” the atmosphere of Punjab.“Where were they when the state government moved a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha on August 28 seeking withdrawal of the anti-farmer ordinances and demanding that the Centre make MSP a statutory right?” he asked.“Their gimmicks now would not help the Akalis woo the farmers, whose lives they themselves were party to destroying as former allies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),” he said, reiterating that his government will challenge the new laws constitutionally.“This is not a political fight about the BJP or the Congress, but a fight about our Kisani, about Punjab, our vajood (existence),” a statement quoted the chief minister as saying.The chief minister was addressing the state’s sarpanches virtually, on the sidelines of virtual inauguration of three projects to mark the birth anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi and former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri from the Punjab Civil Secretariat.Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar and Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) president Brinder Singh Dhillon were present at the launch of the signature campaign against the farm laws.Pointing out that despite being just 2 per cent of the country’s population, “Punjab has fed the entire nation for over six decades”, the chief minister said.            Soon after the promulgation of the three farm ordinances by the central government on June 5, he had written to the prime minister to convey his government’s strong reservations and concern.“However, the Centre did not address the state’s concerns but went ahead to enact the anti-farmer agricultural laws through brute majority,” he added.Noting that agriculture is a state subject, the chief minister said the Centre had encroached on the states’ powers with these laws, which would “devastate the farm sector”.He reiterated his commitment to the Kisan Unions of full support of the state government in their fight against the “draconian laws”.

02-10-2020||Bathinda||Farmers stage protest bare-chested in Mansa; raise slogans against Union govt, Modi||Farmers from various unions on Friday staged a protest against farm-related bills at the railway tracks in Mansa district.The farmers protested bare-chested. They removed their kurtas and shirts rallied against the three ordinances.During the protest, farmers shouted slogans against the union government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They demanded to destroy the bills, and to be "taken back immediately".Kul Hind Kisan Sabha leader, Hardev Arshi, called the farmers to do 'gherao' of blind Modi supporters. He termed these black bills as the "death warrant" of farmers, and alleged, that these have been brought to give agriculture in the hands of the corporate houses.He claimed, that farmers, farm labourers are ready to fight the long battle, and even ready for any sacrifice.The farmers also announced from the stage, that they are staging protests on all the railway tracks at various points across the state, and they would continue their protest till the union government revoked these three farm-related bills.They claimed, that the farmers are reeling under the financial crunch and these new agricultural bills would further aggravate their misery.Punjab has always played a pivotal role as the food bowl of the nation.The farmers of the state would be the worst hit by these bills. Farmers stated that they were receiving support from several sections, including government employees and labourers. They urged people from all sections of society to come forward and support the farmers' cause.Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension, that the bills would pave the way for dismantling the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Farmers Ruldu Singh, Maluk Singh, Gora Singh Bhainibagha, Manjit Singh, Nirmal Singh, Major Singh, Bhajan Singh, Kuldeep Singh and others were present at the protest in Budladha.A total of 31 farmers’ bodies have come together to intensify the agitation and are blocking rail tracks from October 1 for an indefinite period across the state.
02-10-2020||Vijay Mohan||As filling season of dams ends, water level in region's reservoirs remains below normal||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 2Dams in the region have commenced the depletion period on a deficient note, with significant deviation from normal being recorded in all major reservoirs this year. The lower water levels in dams comes in the wake of the monsoon in the region being less than normal.There are three reservoirs in Himachal Pradesh--Bhakra and Kol dam on the Sutlej and Pong dam on the Beas-- where the combined storage is 17 per cent below normal.The storage at the single reservoir in Punjab at Thein dam that lies on the Ravi is 24 per cent below normal.The five-month filing season for the dams, which depends on snow melt and rains, lasts from May 1 to September 30. With the monsoon retreating thereafter and dropping of temperatures in the mountains reducing snow melt, inflows into the reservoirs also subside. The dams are critical for irrigation, flood control as well as hydro-power generation.The combined storage available in Himachal Pradesh is 12.48 billion cubic metres (BCM) whereas the current storage is 9.06 BCM, according to data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on October 1. The availability was 11.06 BCM at this time last year and was an average of 10.96 BCM over the past 10 years.While the maximum water level at Bhakra has been 512.06 metres, the present level is 504.18 metres, translating to the available storage being 71 per cent of its total capacity. It was 86 per cent for the corresponding period last year and an average of 88 per cent over the last 10 years.The present water level at Pong  is 418.27 metres against the maximum of 423.67 metres, with the available storage being 74 per cent compared to 91 per cent last year and 88 per cent over the last 10 years.The total capacity of Thein dam is 2.34 BCM, with the current storage being 1.39 BCM, which is just 59 per cent. It was 85 per cent last year with the past 10-year average being 78 per cent for this time of the year. The water level presently is 13.67 metres below the permissible limit of 527.91 meters.From autum to spring, there is very little inflow into the reservoirs and the stored water is released as per the requirements of the states for domestic and irrigation purpose, thereby depleting the levels.

02-10-2020||Kulwinder Sandhu||Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rallies in Punjab rescheduled to Oct 4-6||Tribune News ServiceMoga, October 2Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s proposed tour in Punjab has been rescheduled from October 4 to October 6. Earlier, he was supposed to arrive on October 3 in the Moga district.He, along with Chief Minister of Punjab Captain Amarinder Singh and PPPC President Sunil Jakhar, will begin the three-day tractor rallies in protest against the controversial farm legislations on October 4 from Badhni Kalan in the Moga district.Confirming this to The Tribune, AICC General Secretary and in-charge of the political affairs of Punjab Harish Rawat said these protest rallies had been proposed by the Congress party to voice its anger against the controversial farm legislations brought in by the NDA government arbitrarily without looking at the plight of the farming community, also disturbing the age-old traditional system of the marketing of crops.Rawat said the new farm legislations were not in the interest of the farming community. “They have been brought by the NDA government to benefit the big corporate houses. The fears are looming large that the small and marginal farmers will lose their lands to the big corporate houses through contract farming,” he said.Joined by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will lead tractor rallies across Punjab from October 4 to October 6, in protest against the Centre’s “brutal, unconstitutional and anti-farmer agriculture laws”.Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rallies will give voice to the anger and pain of the farmers, whose livelihood and future has been put at stake by the central legislations, the Congress leader claimed while adding that Congress government in Punjab was looking into legislative and legal options to nullify these legislations.Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Punjab Congress claimed that the tractor rallies expected to be supported by farmers’ organisations would cover more than 50 km spread over three days in various districts and constituencies. The tractor rallies are scheduled at around 11 am on each of the three days and will be conducted amid strict COVID-19 protocols.The protest rally on October 4, will cover a total distance of 22 km starting with a public meeting at Badni Kalan in Nihal Singh Wala sub-division of Moga district before moving through Lopon village in the district. The rally will then move into Jagraon area in Ludhiana district where it will pass through Chakar, Lakha and Manoke villages culminating at Jattpura village near Raikot in Ludhiana district.On October 5, a total of 20 km will be covered, beginning with a reception at Barnala Chowk, Sangrur, from where Rahul and his team will travel by car to Bhawanigarh for a public meeting before embarking on tractors to Samana in Patiala district.

Farmers will be at the mercy of private firms. The minimum support price and mandi pattern will be totally collapse. The farm laws should be repealed at the earliest,” he said.Kanwalpreet Pannu of the Kisan Sangharsh Committee said the farm laws will curtail employment, be it arhtiyas or labourers. “The farm laws will have adverse impact on economy, traders and shopkeepers as they are all interlinked. These laws should be revoked.”
02-10-2020||The Indian freedom struggle was a long-drawn movement that claimed thousands of lives and countless sacrifices. Scores of events||Jang-e-Azadi Memorial: A repository of freedom struggle||The memorial is a tribute to the contribution and sacrifices of Punjabis in India’s Independence movement. The memorial has been built in three phases. The first phase was opened to the public in November 2016; the second phase was built in March 2018, while the third phase, which is dedicated to the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the unsung heroes who were incarcerated in Andaman Cellular Jail during freedom struggle, was opened on August 14, 2019.The other components include a 45-metre high tower known as ‘Shaheed-e-Minar’, an open-air theatre, movie hall, an auditorium, library besides research and seminar halls.British brutality at Kala Pani Known as Kala Pani or ‘black water’, the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was constructed in 1896 and opened by the British in 1906 to exile political prisoners in remote isolation. The place is a living witness to the brutal treatment of freedom fighters behind the bars.The Cellular Jail reminds generations of the solitary confinement that the National Freedom Movement heroes were sentenced to suffer for years during the colonial rule. Food at the Cellular Jail was rice, which was more dust, rainwater, and wild grass and there were no beds. It is said life at the Cellular Jail was filled with torture, hunger and loneliness. The prisoners were treated like slaves and were whipped if they spoke to each other.Jallianwala Bagh massacreIt was supposed to be a joyous festival on April 13, 1919, and pilgrims, along with peaceful protesters, had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar to celebrate Baisakhi — the Sikh festival. Little did they know that their celebrations would soon turn into one of the deadliest moments in the Indian history.There are various illustrations of Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, where one can see pilgrims along with protesters running helter-skelter to save themselves, after the British Indian Army soldiers, on the orders of Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, opened fire at the crowd, and when General Dyer ordered his troops to kneel and fire at the unarmed crowd of men, women and children. Bombing the AssemblyOn April 8, 1929, Bhagat Singh, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, hurled two bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi to protest against an unfavourable Bill. Interestingly, their intention behind this defiant act was to get arrested and to use the subsequent court appearances to further the cause of their organisation — Hindustan Socialist Republican Association — for India’s Independence.Along with bombs, Singh also threw in copies of a leaflet in the Assembly that quoted a French anarchist as saying: ‘It takes a loud noise to make the deaf hear’, and signs off with the now epochal statement, ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Long live the Revolution’. Martyrs’ executionIndian revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivaram Rajguru were hanged on March 23, 1931, in the Lahore Jail against the scheduled execution on March 24.They were sentenced to death in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, wherein they were found guilty of murdering senior British police officer John Saunders. This day is marked as Shaheed Diwas (Martyrs’ Day) in India.Quit India Movement: Gandhi’s call for ‘Do or Die’The Quit India Movement was a turning point in India’s freedom struggle. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, people across India came together to uproot the British imperialism. In 1942, in a fiery speech in Mumbai, Gandhi made a ‘do or die’ call to the people in a final push to make the British quit.Following the start of the movement, many Congress leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Abul Kalam Azad and others, along with Gandhi, were jailed for sedition.Kirti Kisan MovementPunjab is known for its resistance against Colonial rule. The Kirti Kisan Lehar (movement) came into Punjab in 1928. It was based upon Gadar movement, which revived the party by encouraging militant nationalism in Punjab. The Kirti Kisan Party was a mirror of deliberative condition of peasants, landless and suppressed classes of Punjab. By the beginning of the 20th Century, peasants in Punjab came into the forefront of public reactions against the British administration because they were under debt.Repressive policies of the government towards people in general were also the main reason for their protest. The objective of the party was to free the nation from the British imperialism by using every possible method.Anglo-Sikh WarsThe kingdom established by Ranjit Singh met its doom within 10 years after his death in 1839. The British occupied it after winning two successive wars — the first (1845-46) and second Anglo-Sikh war (1848-49).The primary cause of these wars was the policy of imperialism pursued by the English. They became interested in the conquest of Punjab after the death of Ranjit Singh because that was necessary for extending their empire to its natural frontiers towards the north-west. The immediate causes of the wars were provided by growing internal weakness of the Sikhs themselves.Hanging of KukasIn 1871, when the then DC of Amritsar sanctioned the opening of a slaughterhouse, the Kukas, who are staunch vegetarians, rallied against this decision. In an action that resulted in five Namdharis being sentenced to death, a group of followers raided the slaughterhouse, killed the butchers and set the cows free. For this, four Namdharis were hanged on trees in 1871.Komagata Maru shipOn May 23, 1914, the Komagata Maru, a Japanese ship, sailed from Hong Kong to Canada carrying 376 passengers, mostly immigrants from Punjab. On arrival in Canada, the exclusionist laws of Canada were quoted to bar their entry. Following a two-month stalemate, only 24 passengers were given permission to disembark.On July 22, 1914, the ship was escorted out of the harbour by the Canadian military and forced to sail back to Budge Budge (near Calcutta), where 19 of the passengers were killed by gunfire upon disembarking and many others imprisoned.Kukas being blown apart by cannon fireNot many people know that the Namdhari Sikhs (also known as Kukas) led by their founder Satguru Ram Singh, laid down their lives for the freedom of the country on January 17, 1872 much before the emergence of a national movement. He had also launched the non-cooperation and Swadeshi Movement against the mighty British Raj. Namdharis had made supreme sacrifices for the freedom struggle way back in January 1872. On display is the scene when 66 Kukas who protested against the butchering of an ox, were made to stand before the mouths of seven cannons and blown up in seven rounds.

02-10-2020||Amritsar||Kept in dark by Centre, says Sukhbir Badal||SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal led the ‘kisan march’ from Amritsar on Thursday contesting the farm Acts enacted by the NDA-led Union Government.The march commenced after Badal paid obeisance at the Golden Temple and the Akal Takht. Sukhbir said as per “panthic tradition”, the march had been started after taking Guru’s blessings.Accompanied by senior SAD leadership, including Bikram Singh Majithia, Virsa Singh Valtoha, Gulzar Singh Ranike and other local SAD leaders, the cavalcade proceeded towards Governor’s House in Chandigarh from Bhandari Bridge.“A memorandum would be submitted to the Punjab Governor urging the Centre and the President of India to repeal the farm Acts. For the purpose, a special session of both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha be convened to roll back ‘kaale kanoon’ (black laws) that have been designed to ruin the farming community,” he said.Snubbing Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik over his claims that the SAD leadership was taken into confidence when the three Bills were tabled in Parliament and that Sukhbir and Union minister Harsimrat Badal had endorsed these with signatures before they snapped ties for “self-interest”, he said: “If it were true, then show our signatures. We were kept in the dark. We were never consulted and no Cabinet meeting was held before passing the black laws. Rather, we had submitted in writing certain clauses for inclusion in the Bills. We were falsely assured these would be incorporated. That’s why we decided to part ways,” he said.The SAD started the march from three Takhts — Akal Takht (Amritsar); Takht Damdama Sahib (Bathinda), led by Harsimrat Badal; and Takht Kesgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib, led by former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra.Terming it a ‘political drama’, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee state general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said the SAD had attempted to play the ‘panthic card’ in a bid to streamline its dwindling political graph.In Anandpur Sahib, thousands of SAD workers and farmers led by former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra and former Cabinet minister Daljit Singh Cheema took out a kisan march from Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib here today.

02-10-2020||Sangrur||Sangrur village vows not to burn stubble||At a time when state farmers are threatening to burn paddy stubble to quickly sow wheat to ensure their participation in protests against the farm Acts, farmers of Bhamabadi village have decided not to put their fields on fire. It’s the only village in the district where 90 per cent sowing of paddy was done through the direct sowing of rice (DSR) method without burning wheat stubble.“In our village, farmers had sown paddy on 90 per cent area through the DSR technique as they wanted to to save water and environment. We are proud that our village has sown paddy through this method in the largest area. We are educating farmers not to burn paddy stubble and almost all of them are supporting us,” said Bhamabadi village sarpanch Jagtar Singh.Some farmers said in 2019, few had adopted the DSR technique, but after the Agriculture Department teams made them aware about the benefits of it, many decided to use it this year.“As per a rough estimate, we have saved around Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per acre because the DSR method is more cost-effective than the traditional method. We will also participate in protests, but do not want to burn the stubble as it will create problems for Covid patients,” said Balwinder Singh, another village farmer.

Almost 30 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrain procured earlier for the FCI has been moved from Punjab to other states.Since the movement of grains is linked to the release of cash credit limit (CCL) needed to buy paddy that is now arriving in mandis, farmers inspite of their rail roko stir at 30 places in the state, are allowing the transport of existing stocks of foodgrain from the state.On an average 1.16 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrain are being moved out of Punjab in special trains daily. According to official sources in the FCI, the movement of grains has been the highest in the past one week ever since the rail roko campaign began.“Our field staff is creating awareness among farmers about the importance of shifting grains, which will help the state get the CCL for the ongoing paddy season. Thus farmers are allowing these special trains,” a senior official of the FCI, Punjab region, told The Tribune.According to information, 60 lakh metric tonnes of rice and 143 lakh metric tonnes of wheat stocks are currently lying in Punjab. These have to be liquidated immediately for the FCI to release the dues.“We have received almost Rs 700 crore till today, while the remaining dues will be cleared soon,” Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said.

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||High Court: Sexual offences against minors on rise||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that sexual offences against minors were in the ascendant and such cases could not be compromised. The assertion came as Justice Sanjay Kumar refused to accept a “so-called” compromise between the fathers of an accused and the victim-girl.The matter was placed before the Bench after the sole accused sought regular bail in an FIR registered on July 2, 2019, at Dinanagar police station in Gurdaspur district for kidnapping and another offence under Sections 363 and 366A of the IPC. The Bench was told that rape under Section 376 of the IPC and other offences under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act were added later.Appearing before the Bench, the petitioner’s counsel claimed that an amicable settlement had been arrived at by his father and the victim-girl’s father. In the light of the compromise recorded on November 27, 2019, he should be shown indulgence and granted bail.Justice Kumar asserted the victim-girl was stated to be about 13-14 years. She was found in the petitioner’s custody on July 6, 2019, after she went missing on June 30, 2019. According to the petitioner, he had friendly relations with the victim-girl, but her family did not like it.Justice Kumar observed there was no question of the petitioner claiming consensual relationship with the girl, given her tender age. “Sexual offences against minors and more particularly girls of very young age such as the victim-girl in this case, are on the rise and cannot be condoned even if the families of such unfortunate children seek to settle the matter, be it for whatever reason,” Justice Kumar ruled.Dismissing the bail plea, Justice Kumar further observed such offences constituted serious aberrations in society with devastating consequences for the gullible, tender-aged victims and the state was bound to prosecute these cases so as to send out a strong signal to such wrong-doers. “This court is, therefore, not inclined to accept the so-called compromise,” he said.
