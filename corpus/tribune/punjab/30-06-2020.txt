30-06-2020||Thane||103-year-old Sikh man from Thane is country’s oldest ICU survivor of Covid-19||In a huge relief to his anxious family comprising many great-grandchildren, a sprightly 103-year-old Sikh man here vanquished Covid-19 and has returned home to savour the victory, his close relatives said.Sukha Singh Chhabra was wheeled out of Kaushalya Medical Foundation Trust Hospital here on Monday. He is ranked as India's oldest ICU survivor of Covid-19.Chhabra's 86-year old younger brother, Tara Singh, who was also infected, spent days in the ICU, and has now been shifted to the ward, awaiting discharge from the hospital in a couple of days.But for nearly a month, the senior Lahore-born Chhabra's entire family was practically on tenterhooks though Chhabra remained largely unaware of the potentially deadly infection afflicting him."On May 31, he tested positive. We downplayed it and requested him to get admitted to a hospital for proper care. He agreed without any fuss, so we didn't see any point in unnecessarily alarming him at his advanced age," his 39-year grandson Gurdeep K Chhabra told IANS.After his swabs tested positive, he was wheeled into the KMFT Hospital on June 2 as his sons and grandchildren prayed, while his young great-grandchildren waited for the great grandpa to return home to play with them.Tara Singh had come to visit the family briefly and lived with his elder brother, and hence both got infected and were admitted to the same hospital.Chhabra's month-long stay in hospital was mostly lonely and without the hustle-bustle of his large family, due to the Covid-19 protocols, but he braved it through remarkably well."He had a very tricky course, going uphill and coming downhill. He was twice in and out of the intensive care unit, required non-invasive ventilation, inotropic supports to maintain his heart and lung functions for moderate Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, along with Covid pneumonia," said KMFT's Head of Critical Care Medicine Amit Lala Khomane.A special team of doctors, comprising Khomane, Jayprakash Pednekar and Santosh Dwivedi, was assigned to treat Chhabra on the long road to recovery.However, they generously acknowledged that "it was the patient's own determination to fight out Covid-19 at this advanced age," which was very important."We as doctors left no stone unturned to make him and our other patients win the battle," said another doctor.Marvelling at Chhabra's "miraculous recovery", KMFT Trustees Amol Bhanushali and Sameep Sohoni decided to waive the treatment costs for Chhabra, said Shiv Sena Municipal Corporator Gurmukh Singh.After he was accorded a warm send-off with a resounding round of applause, the weary Chhabra returned to the comfort and safety of his home."Before lockdown, he was very active as usual. He even visited Gurdwara Shri Dashmesh Darbar, climbed the stairs independently, prayed, took 'prasad' at the langar and returned home," said Gurmukh Singh, also the president of the gurdwara.Gurdeep Singh Chhabra said his grandfather is quite weak and is on an intravenous semi-liquid diet for the next few days at his bungalow in Khopat locality of Thane."We are confident that he will soon bounce back to his active self after he starts savouring his favourite Punjabi vegetarian dishes that he has missed for weeks now," he laughed.Besides his younger brother Tara Singh, elder Chhabra has two sons, Kesar Singh, 68, Niranjan Singh, 58, several grandchildren and many great-grandchildren living nearby.

"I had nobody other than Mahajan who could carry on till 2022," said Capt Amarinder.Terming the allegation that National Security Adviser Ajit Doval played a role in the appointment of the new Chief Secretary, the CM said: “Who is Doval to play a role in the matter? I have selected the best and competent officer.”On her husband and Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta, who has already been empanelled in the Centre as Director General of Police, the Chief Minister said Gupta would also stay in Punjab as he had done a commendable work by neutralising nearly 2,500 gangsters, besides busting several terror modules.Meanwhile, Capt Amarinder dismissed reports on a Cabinet reshuffle amid rumours that party MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu is rejoining the Council of Ministers.The Chief Minister said the state had more pressing issues to deal with, mainly the Covid pandemic, and all his Cabinet colleagues were doing a good job in their respective departments.On being asked about Sidhu being assigned a bigger role in the party as he spoke to Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) leaders under the “Speakup India NRI series”, the Chief Minister tried to downplay the issue, stating that Sidhu was the 220th speaker, but added that he was a good orator.He said though Sidhu had always been part of the party, assigning any role to him in the party at the central or state level was in hand of the high command.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-defends-vini-mahajans-posting-as-chief-secretary-106285

As Unlock 1.0 takes pace, the Punjab Government has started registering the unemployed and is struggling to get the workforce back on jobs.Though the government admits that it was in no position yet to conduct a survey of the rate of unemployment, a data was sought from all District Bureaus of Employment Generation to assess which all sectors were hit the most by the lockdown.In numbersOf the total 65,934 workers who have registered themselves between May 23 and June 15, the highest number of those seeking employment is in Mohali, followed by Pathankot, Amritsar, Fazilka and NawanshahrRahul Tiwari, Secretary, Employment Generation and Training, said, “The problem is the mismatch in the skill sets of those registering themselves and the skill sets required by the industry for the vacancies on offer. Thus, we are able to help only a small percentage of those who register themselves”.According to the information gathered by the Department of Employment Generation and Training, of the total 65,934 labourers who have registered themselves between May 23 to June 15, the highest number of those seeking employment was in Mohali, followed by Pathankot, Amritsar, Fazilka and Nawanshahr. In Ludhiana, the state’s industrial capital, just 2,685 labour registrations have been reported against 2,400 vacancy registrations. In Jalandhar, the number of vacancies registered with the government (3,152), are more than the number of labourers who have registered themselves for seeking employment. However, only 14,602 labourers could be placed, with Hoshiarpur accounting for the highest placements at 1,652 persons.The mismatch in skill sets is forcing several industrialists to hire private cabs and other small passenger vehicles to go to the Hindi heartland and get the required labour back.The highest number of skilled and semi- skilled youth seeking jobs have registered in Mohali, followed by Ludhiana, Amritsar and Pathankot. A total of 55,914 such people have registered themselves against 31,037 vacancies registered by the department. The data collected by the department also shows that 637 youth have registered for high-end jobs, against 403 vacancies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unemployment-up-punjab-starts-listing-jobs-workforce-106288
30-06-2020||Amritsar||No plan to quit Cong: Navjot Sidhu||Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu, who remained incommunicado after relinquishing his ministerial berth following differences with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, today endorsed the “ideology” of the Congress during an online interaction with Indian overseas leaders.Sidhu was chosen by the AICC to strengthen the link with Punjabi diaspora based in the US, Canada and Australia and join the live session, which was initiated by Indian overseas Congress chairperson Sam Pitroda, a confidant of Rahul Gandhi.The NRI Congress leaders said they wanted to see him (Sidhu) as the Punjab CM, but they were upset over the MLA keeping a low profile for long. In response, Sidhu made it clear that he wanted to handle things his own way without any compromise.“Silence sometimes proves beneficial. During Kartarpur corridor opening, my Guru chose me as a messenger to execute the task. During the Covid crisis, I stood by the people who voted for me. I have been raising the state’s issues through my YouTube channel without any distortion. But sometimes you need to pause too. It gives you time to introspect,” he said.He also tried to clear the air over the speculation of his joining some other party, saying that he was an ardent admirer of the Congress ideology.“Unlike other parties, the Congress ideology was solely based on the values of the Constitution and vision of Mahatma Gandhi that defeated the British by jolting their consciousness through non-violence. Such an ideology could achieve triumph in any situation,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-plan-to-quit-cong-navjot-sidhu-106289
30-06-2020||Muktsar||4,000 turn up for job at Muktsar Covid centre||Social distancing norms went for a toss on Monday during a walk-in-interview called to hire staff for a Covid care centre. The district administration had advertised the posts for allopathic doctor, dentist, ayurvedic medical officer, para-medical staff and ward attendant and made arrangements for 400 candidates.However, nearly 4,000 candidates showed up for the interview. As a result, the administration had to change the venue at the last minute. It made two centres at two government schools — on Bathinda road and Kotkapura road — where again social distancing norms were thrown to the wind and a number of people were not even wearing face masks.A candidate said, “It is becoming hard for the common man to survive in present times, thus I had come to give interview for the post of ward attendant. Everyone is waiting for his/her turn standing in the crowd.” Sandeep Kumar, ADC (General), Muktsar, said, “We had expected 400 candidates and made arrangements accordingly, but nearly 4,000 turned up. So, we had to change the venue. The social distancing norms could not be followed due to the high number of candidates. However, we had provided hand sanitisers at the venue.”“The walk-in-interview was called to make a merit list of candidates, so that if staff is required at any stage in the future, they can be called immediately,” he added.Meanwhile, some people spread rumours on social media that a doctor at the civil hospital in Gidderbaha had tested positive for Covid and his condition was critical. Later, the doctor had to circulate a video message clarifying that he was absolutely fine.In another incident, a local resident, who had recently undergone a surgery at the Muktsar civil hospital, later tested Covid positive. This created panic among the Health Department officials. The patient is presently admitted to the local civil hospital.An official of the Health Department said, “This development had created panic among the health staff as a number of people had come in contact with him. Luckily, all possible contacts of the patient have tested negative. We have now advised the doctors to make it mandatory for all patients to undergo Covid testing before getting admitted for treatment of any ailment.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/4-000-turn-up-for-job-at-muktsar-covid-centre-106290

The Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO), headed by Justice Ajit Singh Bains (retd), has already sought intervention of the Chief Secretary in this matter.Kanwaljit had retired from the post of assistant supervisor (publication wing) in May.“I complained to the police as I am being mentally harassed by the SGPC’s officials. All the records are in possession of the SGPC. I fear that they may tamper with the records,” he said.Kanwaljit said he was forced to give in writing that he was solely responsible for the missing “saroops” and pay the damages.“I am ready to pay Rs 5.6 lakh ‘bheta’ against the missing ‘saroops’, but those responsible for it should be taken to task.

As per the instructions issued by the Department of Health and Family Welfare to ensure proper and transparent accounting and dispensing of this medicine, centres distributing this medicine must be linked to government’s online registry system and every single tablet issued to a patient must be accounted for.“However, a mismatch in the record was found when the data for the period between January 1, 2019, and November 19, 2019, was examined. Subsequently, show-cause notices were issued to private de-addiction centres,” the order read.It further said since proper dispensing of medicines was an integral part of the overall strategy of the de-addiction programme in the state, the committee was being constituted on the Chief Minister’s orders to probe the matter.Besides submitting its report to the Health Department within three weeks, the committee will also suggest measures to institutionalise a transparent procedure for dispensing the medicines, both in government and private de-addiction centres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-forms-panel-to-probe-missing-de-addiction-pills-106294

30-06-2020||Mohali||Order on plea seeking case transfer on July 2||In an application seeking transfer of case regarding the disappearance of CITCO employee Balwant Singh Multani, in which former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini is the main accused, the special public prosecutor submitted points for consideration before the court of the District and Sessions Judge on Monday. Sessions Judge Rajinder Singh Rai after hearing the arguments reserved the orders in the case to be pronounced on July 2.Special Public Prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula prayed that while deciding for the bail, the statement of eyewitness Gursharan Kaur Mann, pertaining to the illegal detention and inhuman torture of Multani at the hands of the former DGP had also been overlooked.Narula said the court of the Additional District and Sessions Judge had ignored the fact that the investigations were being conducted against an influential police officer who had been at the helm of affairs for a long tenure. His being out on bail would definitely hamper and stall the investigation. He said this apprehension was further enhanced from the manner in which interim bail had been granted in a blanket manner under Section 302 of the IPC.Defence counsels APS Deol and HS Dhanoa while countering the allegations of the prosecution termed the transfer application as a self-created story to scandalise the court.Deol, supported by Dhanoa, submitted that transferring a case merely on the asking of an apprehensive litigant would not only lead to scandalising the court but browbeating the presiding officer, thereby causing direct interference in the independent and fair administration of justice.Victim’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani had filed the application for transfer of case after ADJ Monika Goyal’s court allowed interim bail to former DGP Saini in anticipation of SIT adding Section 302 of the IPC to the earlier FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/order-on-plea-seeking-case-transfer-on-july-2-106298

30-06-2020||Patiala||3 years later, cops yet to arrest Nabha jail escapee||The infamous Nabha jailbreak case is turning out to be a curious case of cat and mouse chase, highlighting the failure of the state intelligence agencies and the Police Department. Even after 3.5 years, there is no clue about the whereabouts of Khalistan ideologue Kashmir Singh Galwandi — the only escapee yet to be arrested.A senior police officer, involved in the investigation of the case, told The Tribune that Kashmir was initially with Mintoo when they escaped and reached New Delhi. “The Delhi Police arrested Mintoo, but Kashmir fled. Thereafter, there is no clue about him,” the officer maintained.The infamous jailbreak caseunderground and is not using any gadgetThe jailbreak took place in November 2016 and was later transferred to the Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU), which was specifically drafted to “arrest and take action against gangsters active in the state”. However, later, the counter intelligence sleuths took over the case and started tracking the movement of Kashmir.“It looks like he is not using any technology and is underground. He might be in India only as he has limited means to escape the country. However, very little is known about him,” a senior IPS officer said.Security agencies say Kashmir could play a key role in the upcoming London rally on Referendum 2020. “He probably has links with sleeper cells. He is well-trained and can train other men and plan similar attacks. Our priority is to catch him at the earliest,” another senior cop stated.Kashmir, who hails from Galwandi village in Khanna, was one of the four accused in the attack on Harvinder Soni, general secretary of the Punjab unit of Shiv Sena. He was arrested in April 2015, along with three others, and booked for attempt to murder.Kashmir, Khalistan Liberation Force chief Harminder Singh Mintoo and four gangsters, had fled from the high-security Nabha jail on November 27, 2016.
