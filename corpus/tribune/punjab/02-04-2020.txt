02-04-2020||---||Coronavirus: Punjab CM prohibits all gatherings in state||Chandigarh, April 2Taking a tough stand on the issue in the light of the Nizamuddin incident, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday completely prohibited all gatherings, including religious,  in the state, and said the state government will impose a total ban on all congregations, irrespective of the religion involved.He would personally talk to the Acting Jathedar of the Akal Takht, said the Chief Minister, while directing the Chief Secretary to discuss the matter with the SGPC, in view of the upcoming Baisakhi festival.The Chief Minister also ordered 21 days of quarantine for all those who had returned to the state from Nizamuddin (Delhi) since January this year, and asked the police and administrative officials to move aggressively to track, trace and isolate all such people. He directed the police and health department to constitute special teams to track and follow up on those who had returned to Punjab from Nizamuddin.Amarinder was discussing and reviewing the current situation through a video conference with DCs and other senior officials of the civil administration and police department.According to DGP Dinkar Gupta, some 200 persons from Punjab had visited Nizamuddin and returned here, at different times, with 12 districts believed to be affected. They were being tracked, along with some from others states who had arrived in Punjab for Tabligh Jamaat work. The Health Department was debriefing and contact tracing them, though, so far, no Corona confirmed cases had come to light.Health Secretary Anurag Thakur informed the Chief Minister that the department had so far received a list of 125 of these persons, of whom 73 had been tracked and samples collected in 25 cases some of whom had come to Mansa as late as March 19. As a precautionary measure, all of them had been placed in quarantine, he added.Kapurthala DC told the Chief Minister that 31 people who had returned from Nizamuddin had been quarantined though they had been found to be asymptomatic so far.  In Patiala, too, 29 of them had been quarantined but there were no symptoms shown by them. Sangrur SSP said they had tracked and collected samples of all the attendees whose names they had received, and the incubation period had ended in most cases already.On a suggestion from DGP Dinkar Gupta, the CM ordered quarantining of the Pakistani nationals who were in Amritsar, saying the state could not afford to take any chances at this critical juncture. Amritsar DC said Pakistan had given permission to allow entry of four of its citizens who had come from Delhi, of whom three had tested positive. The BSF and immigration staff who handled them had been quarantined, he said, but added that there were a few more Pakistanis still stuck in Amritsar.The DGP informed the Chief Minister that the law and order situation was in control across the state but suggested continuation of the curfew restrictions for some more time. He further disclosed that the Thikri Pheras (volunteers in villagers) were contributing significantly to the enforcement and relief operations. At present, around 2,000 such volunteers had been appointed to assist the police and civil administration.To prevent rush at the banks, they were being asked to give appointments on phone, and to ensure that ATMs have distance markers for queue, Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh told the meeting.The Chief Minister inquired about the steps being taken to protect and provide for the migrants who are stranded in Punjab due to the sealing of the borders and other restrictions.The Amritsar DC informed the meeting that the migrant labourer issue in the district was not significant as most of them had been engaged to work in Transport, Railways and other departments. Those who had no jobs were being fed, he said.  Pathankot DC said some 111 migrant labourers from J&K were stuck and had been accommodated in marriage palaces and other places, with strict social distancing norms being maintained. Three had been quarantined as they had fever and cough.Ludhiana, with 5.25 lakh migrant labourers, had built 60 camps though only two were occupied, said the DC, adding that food was being supplied there regularly.Gurdaspur DC said while Radha Saomi bhawans were available, the migrant labourers were currently being housed by the owners of the brick kilns where they were working. In Tarn Taran, four centres had been opened to house the migrants. Gurdaspur SSP said flag marches were being conducted in urban areas to keep the morale high among the people, who had been cooperating fully with the police.In the worst affected Mohali (SAS Nagar) district, the Jagatpura area had been totally sealed off after confirmation of Covid outbreak, with mass sampling being done in this and Nayagaon area, according to the Civil Surgeon.In Kapurthala, two quarantine centres had been set up with a total of 150 beds, and the district administration had taken university hostels to set up isolation ward, according to the DC.The Ludhiana DC said the administration was in the process of acquiring the wings of some private hospitals for Covid patients. Sampling had been increased in Ludhiana after three positive cases came up in the urban areas.In response to a concern expressed by the Civil Surgeon Pathankot regarding availability of PPE kits, Health Minister Balbir Sidhu assured of a stock of 100 kits to be supplied by tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coronavirus-punjab-cm-prohibits-all-gatherings-in-state-64631

If the people and the country will survive, they will again donate enough money to these religious institutions. This kind of money is always donated for the wellbeing of humanity. This is the most critical time.”Another suggestion is that the unclaimed fund with the EPFO Department can be used during this unprecedented situation. “The Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) Department has approx. Rs 40,000 crore lying unclaimed with them. This is the most critical time when the employees and employers should be helped through this fund. The government should waive off the collection of PF contribution of all the employees and employers for three months and compensate the employees with this unclaimed fund. This will not make any major dent on Social Security. In any case. the Security is for rainy days and that's just what the present times are. Moreover, what is the point of putting so much burden on employers that they themselves collapse and insecurity of jobs arises,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/religious-institutions-should-donate-funds-to-govt-ficos-textile-head-64584

02-04-2020||Aditi Tandon||Taken up with FM non-release of Rs 500 cr to Punjab that is hampering Covid fight: Capt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 2Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said though the lockdown was essential to combat Covid-19, its unplanned implementation had caused tremendous chaos.Addressing a virtual meeting of the Congress Working Committee, Gandhi said there was no alternative to constant testing.The CWC was joined online by former PM Manmohan Singh, who said the Congress stood by the country at this time of crisis.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was also live and apprised the committee of the steps he was taking against the pandemic in the state.He said the non-release of Rs 5,000 crore state share by the Centre was harming Punjab’s fight against COVID and that he had taken up the issue with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi urged states to issue advisories warning the elderly who were more vulnerable to the disease and claimed that the government had not understood the enormity of the crisis.Sonia Gandhi in her opening remarks said the most vulnerable to the consequences of this pandemic are the poor and disadvantaged.“We must come together for their sake and do all we can to support them through the difficult days that lie ahead,” she noted.She said the 21-day national lockdown might have been necessary but the unplanned manner in which it had been implemented had caused chaos and pain in the lives of millions of migrant workers all over India.“It has been heart-breaking to see lakhs of people walking for hundreds of kilometres towards their villages without food or shelter,” the  Congress chief added.She said there is no alternative to constant and reliable testing and sought protective gear for doctors and nurses.“Hazmat suits, N-95 masks must be provided to them on a war footing. Equally important are ventilators and breathing equipment, isolation beds and designated hospitals to treat Covid-19,” she said asking the Government to publish details of designated hospitals, number of beds, quarantine and testing facilities, as well as information regarding the availability of medical supplies to the general public.She demanded help for farmers saying they’ve faced the wrath of inclement weather this season and now have to cope with the harvesting season.Noting that 90 per cent of Indians are in the unorganised sector, Sonia demanded relief for the segment as also for middle class people.She said the Central Government should prepare and publish a Common Minimum Relief Programme for all the affected sections of society.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/taken-up-with-fm-non-release-of-rs-500-cr-to-punjab-that-is-hampering-covid-fight-capt-64580

With the support of all, we would restart our protest", said Dhilwan.Punjab Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla said that Punjab Congress government had always supported unemployed youngsters of the state.“We are fighting a big battle against COVID-19.

Consequently, resident doctors had to undergo self-isolation for precautionary measures.In fact, 42-year-old corona suspected patient from Ludhiana, who died at the hospital later, was brought to the Emergency first before taking her to the isolation ward — breaching the COVID-19 protocol.The staff at emergency, who were not supposed to wear protective gear, examined the patient clinically without proper kit, thereby exposed themselves to the virus.As per the ICMR guidelines, all COVID-19 suspected patients have to be taken directly to the isolation ward — a special dedicated room for the positive patients. Due to the missing link in the chain of communication, resident doctors at the emergency ward at the hospital had already been exposed to the virus, said the experts.Worryingly, the resident doctors, thereafter, treated many other patients at the emergency ward, therefore, those (patients) are also at risk of infection and should be traced, say the experts. Though, hospital authorities claim that resident doctors on duty were wearing masks and gloves, experts said personal protective equipment (PPE) kit is necessary for treating suspected patients.Until now, the emergency ward has not been sanitized. Though, as many as four resident doctors who were exposed to the COVID-19 patient have already self-isolated themselves.Meanwhile, senior doctors at the hospital said they were scared to work under these circumstances where protocols were not strictly followed.A doctor of the medicine department, said, “The entire ward and medical devices used on that day should have been sanitized. The negligence creates a sense of fear among doctors.”Dr Paras Pandove, Medical Superintendent, said it was not negligence but lack of communication. He said that first it was a referred case, therefore, the authorities who referred the patients had to inform in advance; second, kin of the patient could have informed about the same.He added, “We have already deployed a special doctor at the emergency ward, who will be equipped with the PPE kit, to check the patients so as to avoid such incidents. We are trying our best so that our doctors are not exposed to COVID-19.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/doctors-at-patialas-rajindra-hospital-forced-to-go-into-self-isolation-following-breach-in-protocol-64561

The administration had avoided cremating the deceased at cremation grounds in the city as cremation of normal deaths was under way there and usually family members attend the ceremony. Verka residents, led by a Congress councillor, stated that corona-infected person should not be cremated near a residential area.Former SGPC member Sawinder Singh Doblia offered his agricultural land for cremation of Nirmal Singh.

Notably, liquor is not covered in the list of essential goods and vends, too, are closed. However, the illegal practice is going on unabated.For instance, some alert residents of Hakkuwala village in the Lambi Assembly segment on Saturday caught a man who was posing as a milkman and kept the liquor bottles in a container to supply it door to door. A video of the incident has gone viral on the social media.Similarly, a resident of Lakkarwala village was recently caught selling liquor. Nearly 40 quarter bottles of country liquor were seized from him.Not just this, it is learnt that some affluent people had even started preparing hooch. “The police are busy in curfew duties. Thus, a number of people belonging to affluent farming families have started brewing liquor at their palatial houses. The police, too, don’t go to raid their house due to their political clout,” sources said.Further, a video of some people selling liquor from their house and a vend has gone viral on the social media.Notably, during the initial two-three days of the curfew, some liquor vends were found open. “Some vends are still selling liquor through hidden doors. When one knocks the shutter, the vend employee opens a small window and gives the stock,” said Ranjit Singh, member of an anti-drug committee.Sources in the police said that they were unable to act against the bootleggers at this moment as the state government had already ordered to release people from jails on parole.“We are busy in enforcing curfew and distribution of grocery among needy people.

A Padma Shri recipient for his services in the field of arts, Nirmal Singh has been active in religious circles which included holding kirtan darbars and attending prominent events.

The health officials stated that his travel history was being checked. Six family members of Bhai Nirmal Singh have been placed under quarantine. Members of his family – residents of the Lohian Khas village in Jalandhar have been taken to the isolation ward in Jalandhar.

They said the civil and police administrations, along with NGOs, were doing their best to undertake door-to-door delivery of dry food packets, but people had started stocking up ration in anticipation of further restrictions.  Reports from Ludhiana, Sangrur, Ferozepur, Gurdaspur, and Fatehgarh Sahib suggest that despite distribution of wheat a few weeks ago and distribution of additional allocation of wheat and dal for three months starting on April 1, people were resorting to hoarding. As the result, migrant labour and poor could suffer in the long run, said Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra. An experiment in Zira to run “Zira 47” helpline by NGOs and MLA Kulbir Singh Zira to provide delivery of cooked food has helped the district administration and volunteers segregate the needy from hoarders.  In Fatehgarh Sahib, the experiment of cooking food in community kitchens is proving to be successful, especially in villages.  Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said some complaints had been received. “With the help of police and civil administration, we have streamlined the process so that only migrants and poor get dry food packets,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mlas-people-hoarding-dry-ration-deliver-cooked-food-64194
02-04-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Labour shortage likely to take toll on wheat procurement in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 1Sitharaman urged to release CCLChief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking her intervention to direct the RBI for expeditious authorisation of Cash Credit Limit (CCL) of Rs26,064.31 crore for rabi season 2020.As the state government prepares for its biggest annual exercise of procuring wheat amid the curfew, it faces a serious challenge of shortage of the migrant labour.The state is expecting to produce 180-185 lakh metric tonnes (lmt) of wheat this year. Of this, 135 lmt is expected to reach mandis after the harvesting of the crop begins in a fortnight.Though the harvesting of crop is largely mechanised, there are farmers who harvest the crop manually. For this, labour from other states starts arriving in Punjab around this time. Also, labour is required for the handling of foodgrain in the mandis.Sutantar Kumar Airi, Director, Agriculture, said he hoped that the local labour in Punjab would be able to help in the harvesting of crop. Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, general secretary, BKU, however, is sceptical. “We have been repeatedly appealing to the government to get proactive in the matter. Barely 10 per cent of the farmers have employed permanent labour, while the remaining hire daily wagers for harvesting. There are also reports on combine harvesters not being able to reach Punjab after these machines were taken to central and southern states for harvesting earlier,” he said.The real challenge arising out of the shortage of labour will be in the mandis. “Foodgrain handling operations require specialised labour. We can only hope that the lockdown period would end and the labour would be available,” said Secretary, Agriculture, Kahan Singh Pannu.Additional Chief Secretary, Development, Vishwajit Khanna, today announced a slew of measures to allow free movement of men and machines for the purpose. In an advisory issued to all Deputy Commissioners, he said free movement of farmers, labourers, farm operation machinery (both individual and that of custom hiring centres) would be allowed. He has also asked all districts to ensure that sale of seed and fertilisers is not affected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/labour-shortage-likely-to-take-toll-on-wheat-procurement-in-punjab-64192

Border Farmers Sangharsh Committee president Jagdev Singh said the fence gates in the DT Mall Enclave had been closed due to the lockdown. The farmers have not been permitted to go to their fields due to which their crops are suffering, he said.  He said farmers were ready to remove their clothes during checking as BSF sleuths were apprehensive about frisking them.  Another farmer, Mohinder Singh of Bhambha Hazi village, said they only wanted to spray insecticide to protect their crops from yellow rust and aphids, besides irrigating their fields.  Sources said after much pleading, the BSF agreed to allow 10 persons each day to go to their fields. However, farmers said this arrangement didn’t suit them. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-allowed-to-go-to-fields-farmers-protest-64191

The families are logging onto news portals or making frantic calls to their children, siblings or cousins settled in the US, asking about their well-being.The toll has touched the 1,100 mark in New York, while 42,000 people have tested positive so far.Village sarpanch Gurdeep Singh, whose two sons and daughter are in New York, said: “About 2,000 to 2,500 persons from Gilzian village are settled in New York. By the grace of God, all of them are safe. But they are facing difficulty on the work front. They are not going to work because of the lockdown there. As long as they are safe, we have nothing to worry about.”A few days ago, a group of villagers visited Congress MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian’s residence in the village to know about the situation in New York.Gilzian, who hails from the village, and his brother Joginder Singh went to New York to attend the wedding of their niece. Gilzian returned on March 19, while his brother was back a day later. But the airport authorities put him under quarantine in Delhi because by then restrictions on the movement were imposed. He will return to the village after April 3.“Since everyone was curious to know about the scenario in New York, all went to Sangat Singh’s residence. We asked him several questions while standing four ft away. None of us had tea at his place,” the sarpanch said.Former sarpanch Ranjit Kaur said, “At least 80 of my relatives are settled in the US.
