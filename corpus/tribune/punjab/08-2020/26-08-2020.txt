26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM directs AG to file review petition in SC on NEET/JEE exams||With just days to go for the NEET/JEE exams being conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday directed state Advocate General Atul Nanda to coordinate with his counterparts in other opposition ruled states for filing a collective review petition in the Supreme Court seeking deferment of the examinations.The directive followed a video conference of the meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with the chief ministers of seven opposition-ruled states to discuss this and other issues of common concern, including delay in GST compensation release and the farm ordinances by the Government of India, as well as the New Education Policy, which Capt Amarinder said was thrust on the states without consultation.“Let us all get together to move the Supreme Court for postponement of the exams, which are threatening the lives of lakhs of students,” he said.Pointing out that world over, exams were being held online, he suggested that the JEE/NEET and other professional exams like medical and law could also be held online and there was no need to put the students at risk.Noting that what the states were seeking was not the moon but their own dues, the chief minister also suggested that a delegation of all the opposition chief ministers should meet the prime minister to press for release of GST compensation and financial assistance to fight Covid.“We have given all the powers of taxation to him through the GST, and now they say they may not be able to pay. So how do we run our states?” he said, calling upon the opposition-ruled states to work together and fight together for their rights.The chief minister also disclosed that his government would be setting up a committee soon to assess the impact of the New Education Policy on the state’s education system and finances.Every state has its own system, which the Government of India failed to take into account before announcing the policy, he said.Pointing out that as of today, two days before the scheduled Punjab Vidhan Sabha session, 23 ministers/MLAs were Covid positive, Capt Amarinder said if this was the state of the legislators and ministers, one can only image how grave the situation on the ground was. The scenario was not conducive to holding physical examinations, he said.The Punjab chief minister told the meeting that even on the issue of the mandatory final term exams for colleges/universities, despite repeated pleas and reminders, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had failed to take cognisance of his government’s concerns.Citing the importance laid by his government on education, he said that while in schools his government had already decided to promote the students based on their earlier performance, the final term college exams issue remained a matter of concern.“How can we have exams with Covid projected to peak in the state in September?” he asked, adding that “I also want students to take exams and pass too, but how can I do this in the midst of the crisis?”Capt Amarinder also raised the issue of the Centre’s decision to suspend the post-matric scholarship scheme for SC students, whose number in the state is a whopping 3.17 lakh.The Centre had no business cutting down on these scholarships for the poor SC students, he said, adding that he wanted all students in his state, including the poor, to be educated.Given the acute fiscal crisis in the state, with no money even to pay salaries and fulfil other existing commitments, how do they expect us to pay for these scholarships too, he asked.Elaborating on the financial crisis faced by the state, the chief minister said the Centre’s failure to release GST compensation after March 31, 2020, which is to the tune of nearly Rs 7,000 crore, had put Punjab in a difficult situation amid the spiralling Covid cases, which had crossed 44,000, with 1,178 deaths.“If the Government of India does not give us our GST compensation how do they expect us to function,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that states cannot manage on their own and the Centre needs to support.Punjab had received Rs 102 crore in two instalments from Health Ministry for Covid and Rs 31 crore third instalment was due, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-directs-ag-to-file-review-petition-in-sc-on-neet-jee-exams-131736

Punjab's revenue is down by 38 per cent. All tax collections are in the minus and the financial year will end with Rs 25,000-crore deficit,” said Singh after Mamata Banerjee, Thackeray and Soren and other chief ministers decided to collectively petition the president and the prime minister on the depleting finances.Punjab, Singh said, has spent Rs 500 crore on COVID so far.The state had received Rs 102 crore in two instalments from Health Ministry for Covid and Rs 31 crore third instalment was due, he said.Amarinder Singh said the opposition chief ministers should collectively see the prime minister and ask him to ensure states are financially compensated.“We have given powers of taxation to the PM through GST. But he’s not giving money. How do states run?” he said, adding that Punjab will reach 30,000 COVID tests a day by end month.As of today, there are 499 patients on oxygen and 55 on ventilator in Punjab, and this number is rising.The Punjab chief minister said the state needed resources and attacked the Centre saying they’ve stopped Rs 720 crore annual post-matric scholarship grant for SC students.Singh also said he expected the COVID situation to worsen with 8,000 vehicles moving into Punjab daily.“GOI is least interested and transmission is rising,” said Amarinder Singh.[Live]: Meet of CMs with @INCIndia President Sonia Gandhi Ji.https://t.co/0X7dCPmCds||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-covid-graph-to-peak-by-mid-september-to-over-1-lakh-cases-and-3-000-deaths-amarinder-tells%C2%A0oppn-party-cms-131726

The family members of the deceased alleged that valuables were stolen by the hospital staff only.Last week, family members of the deceased had to hold a protest outside the hospital after they failed to get the valuables after several requests.A relative of 52-year-old Hakam Singh, who died of coronavirus at the Rajindra hospital, said: "Even days after his death, we have not received valuables -- including his mobile phone. This is an inhuman and obnoxious act."As per the Standard Operating Procedure, a consultant or senior Resident has to make the list of the valuables and sanitise them -- after the death of the deceased.Meanwhile, the officials at the hospital mortuary claimed that they didn't receive any valuables when dead bodies reached there.Lakhdeep Singh, son of the deceased Ravinder Kaur, alleged that the hospital administration was not cooperating when they approached them for the belongings. He said, "Things are not being run well. The grief-stricken families are being harassed by the staff. We couldn't receive any belongings from our mother."It has been learnt that many valuables of the deceased are stripped off by the staff while wrapping the dead bodies -- at the isolation ward itself.Meanwhile, Surbhi Malik, in-charge, COVID-19 ward, Government Rajindra Hospital, said, "In some cases, there was a delay in handing over valuables to the family members, but there was no report of stealing of valuables. Anyway, I will look into the matter and help the family members."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-deaths-of-covid-patients-grief-stricken-relatives-fail-to-get-valuables-in-patiala-131651

Ranjit Kaur said, “With nowhere to go she has been taking shelter in Golden Temple, other gurudwaras and sometimes at relatives’ places”.She sought the intervention of Akal Takht officiating jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh as the SGPC officials failed to bring her justice. Today, she submitted an application with the city Police Commissioner.“It’s been over six months that I have been living the life of a vagabond. Sometimes I slept in the varandah of the Golden Temple, then moved to one gurudwara or the other or to relatives’ place”, she said. Her only son, Jarmanjit Singh, who is manager with a gurudwara in Verka run under the SGPC, denied all allegations.“She is into habitual altercation with my wife and has been forcing me to divorce her. When I didn’t agree, she locked her portion and left the home on her own. No relative came in her support as they all knew her temperament. I appeal her to come back home. I realise the hardships she faced to raise me and my sister,” he said.Ranjit Kaur had submitted a petition under the Senior Citizen Act with the Sub-Divisional Magistrate here. On February 3, the SDM had ordered the concerned police team to assist her in gaining entry to her son’s house and regularly monitor her well-being. “Rather, I went to the police station to receive her on my bike. She could not adjust with us as she carried on with her adamant attitude,” he said. On the other hand, Ranjit Kaur maintained that her son’s behaviour changed after his marriage. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-woman-mistreated-by-son-takes-shelter-in-gurdwaras-131551

He said Jathedar Sri Akal Takht should register FIR in case of 328 saroops missing from the publishing house of SGPC so that investigation from the concerned employees can be started which would further throw light on the people having bigger role in this incidence.“It is an open secret that Badals control the SGPC and there could be a deep conspiracy behind this episode. Instead of SGPC officials, action should be taken against the Badals and they should be excommunicated from the Sikh Path.Expressing his concern over missing saroops, Kultar Singh said it was quite possible that these saroops might have been misused for political gains. It is quite shocking that a party during whose tenure most of the incidents of sacrilege took place was protesting against the missing historical saroop from village Kalyan in Patiala.Others present included Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, Manjinder Singh Lalpura, Ashok Talwar, Manish Agarwal, Dalbir Singh, Ranjit Singh Cheema.Dal Khalsa blames SGPCAmritsar: Reacting on the missing of 328 ‘saroops’of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Dal Khalsa on Tuesday lashed out at the SGPC blaming the institution for committing sacrilege. The Dal Khalsa asserted that the need of the hour was to overhaul and rescue it from the wrong hands.Party head HS Cheema said once known as a premier institution of the Sikhs, the SGPC had been reduced to the level of a municipal committee infamous for corruption, nepotism and favouritism, courtesy Badals’ dictatorial attitude.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/case-of-missing-saroops-of-guru-granth-sahib-needs-thorough-probe-says-aap-131552

The group has performed the last rites of at least 227 persons, whose family members were unable to participate in the rituals.An eight-member team of volunteers, led by Mandeep Keshav Guddu, who is in charge of over 100 traffic marshals, has been engaged in the cremation of the bodies of the infected.“On an average, we daily cremate eight to 10 Covid patients. While bodies of most victims are consigned to the flames, we have also buried the bodies of some Muslims,” said Keshav.The first case that came to the group was of 69-year-old Surinder Kaur in April. Her family members had refused to accept her body. Another group member, Charanjit Singh, said: “The cremation is mostly done in the gas chamber at Model Town extension, costing Rs 4,500. Sometimes poor families can’t afford to make any payment, then we all contribute.” The team members include Prateek Verma (a doctor), Gopal Singh Purva (an advocate), Prince Kapur, Harvinder Singh, Amarjit Singh and Gurpreet Singh — all city residents.“Initially, our families were against our initiative, but we allayed their fears, explaining that we wear PPE gear while performing the last rites,” said Charanjit Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/they-selflessly-step-forward-to-cremate-covid-victims-131497
26-08-2020||Patiala||To manage stubble, Punjab to rely on 75,000 machines||Despite over 75,000 machines being made operational this post-paddy season to efficiently manage stubble, the state is expected to see starw burning cases as early as mid-September.Read also: Pollution as pandemicThe early sown paddy and failure of the government in collecting a majority of environmental penalties imposed on farmers in 2019 has further aggravated matters.AAP demands aid for farmersAAP MLAs Prof Baljinder Kaur, Rupinder Kaur Ruby and Master Baldev Singh on Tuesday alleged the state government was not serious about finding a permanent solution to stubble burning. The MLAs said the government had promised farmers compensation if they did not burn stubble, but it had not fulfilled its commitment yet.Experts suggest that this year, stubble burning can start as early as mid-September, given the early sowing in parts of the state, and these are not good signs amid the Covid pandemic, which affects patients with weak lungs.The state Agriculture Department is banking on 75,000 machines, which will take care of the 20 lakh hectares of agricultural fields with stubble. “This year, we expect 40 per cent less cases of stubble burning as compared to previous years,” said a senior agriculture official.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, stubble burning contributed significantly to air pollution in Delhi last year with the share of farm fire smoke in particulate matter peaking to 44 per cent in November.“We have already received 23,500 applications to buy modern farm equipment for in situ management of the paddy straw. The state has 51,000 machines in the field and we are hopeful that fire incidents will see a significant dip. Moreover, the area under paddy has also decreased by 2.5 lakh hectares due to crop diversification,” said Kahan Singh Pannu, Secretary, Agriculture.As per the data of the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC), Punjab Agriculture University (PAU), Ludhiana, (provided to the Punjab Pollution Control Board), till November 2019, total 53,000 stubble burning cases were recorded, while these were 51,751 and 50,841 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.Sources said an environmental penalty of Rs 6 crore imposed on errant farmers was largely pending due to poor implementation of norms. An official said erring farmers, backed by politically inclined unions, refused to deposit fine and even took officials hostage when they were approached. As many as 1,700 FIRs were also filed against erring farmers for burning stubble.Last year, the government announced paying Rs 2,500 per acre for not burning stubble, but later stopped doling out the compensation after some village panchayats reported that farmers who had set their fields on fire had claimed the money.Karunesh Garg, member secretary, PPCB, said they were working on an action plan to ensure strict imposition of the Supreme Court guidelines against stubble burning. “Wehave been told to revise them. We are already working on it,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/to-manage-stubble-punjab-to-rely-on-75-000-machines-131368

26-08-2020||Chandigarh||Violations galore, monitoring up in Punjab||When Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh recently said the Punjabis’ attitude of koi gal nahin was making people delay testing for Covid-19, he was not off the mark. It is perhaps this attitude which is behind the breach of quarantine norms.In places like Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar, there have been numerous cases of either patients breaching the home quarantine once their symptoms wane, or their family members/direct contacts not following the guidelines. It is perhaps one of the major reasons that the disease is spreading fast in the state, with 10,585 cases reported in just a week.Presently, over 6,000 patients in the state are under home isolation. However, with economic interests overtaking the concern for public safety, people have now started breaching the norms. Dr Rajiv Bhaskar, Punjab’s nodal Officer for Covid-19, said this was one of the main reasons for the increase in cases in urban areas.The authorities have found 464 violations of home isolation till last evening. “The number is far lower than actual violations because people leave their phones behind,” said a senior officer.Health officials say they are looking at ways to stop violations by imposing fines.Amit Kumar, Special Secretary, Health, said rapid action teams were visiting those under quarantine to counsel them. “Three visits in 10 days are being made, besides regular tele-monitoring of patients,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/violations-galore-monitoring-up-in-punjab-131374

Some villages have been making announcements from public address systems in this regard while others have passed resolutions against testing.In their resolution, Fatehgarh Chhana residents have alleged that since the Health Department did not have the required system to conduct testing properly and incorrect reports are being given, showing negative patients as positive, there was panic in all villages. They have also alleged that isolation centres lacked the mandatory facilities and to top it all, “as per social media reports, organ trade was flourishing under the garb of Covid deaths”.“We have passed a resolution and requested the Health Department not to conduct a test of any asymptomatic patient. If there is any symptomatic patient, we will get his testing done. However, the patients will not be sent outside the village as we will make arrangements at the village government school,” said Rajvir Singh, a resident of Fatehgarh Chhana.Similarly, residents of Deh Kalan village also refused to get themselves tested and the Health Department authorities had to return empty handed.Ravinder Singh, Sarpanch of Deh Kalan village, said: “Some area residents are spreading false information and discouraging others to keep them away from testing. We are trying to convince the residents to get tested.”Residents of Chatha Nanhera village have also made announcements from the village address system that only symptomatic patients will give samples and positive patients will undergo isolation at the village school.Sangrur Civil Surgeon Dr Raj Kumar confirmed that their teams were facing problems in many villages. “Villagers are unwilling to give samples but our officials have been trying their best to convince residents to get tested as we can prevent the spread of the virus only after testing and isolating positive patients,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-sangrur-villagers-pass-resolution-against-testing-131377
