05-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM directs DGP to book those directly involved in hooch tragedy||Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said he will not tolerate any political interference in the hooch tragedy case, and directed the DGP to book those directly involved for murder under Section 302 of the IPC.Promising justice for the victims of the case, the chief minister also mooted enhancement of punishment for spurious/illicit liquor manufacturing and smuggling under the Excise Act, to ensure that repeat offenders remain behind the bars and are not able to come out easily to indulge again in the crime.As several ministers agreed, during a Cabinet meet, to the suggestion of Advocate General Atul Nanda that a strict law like PCOCA was needed to combat organised crime like illicit liquor smuggling, the chief minister asked the Sub-Committee, that was set up under Brahm Mohindra to examine the provisions of the proposed law, to finalise and submit its report at the earliest.He agreed with Sukhjinder Randhawa and other ministers that PCOCA (Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act) could help control hardcore criminals and act as deterrent to gangsters, who continue to deal in organised crime even from prison, and had close connections with terrorists too, said the minister.The chief minister’s directives on the hooch tragedy came during two separate video conferences – one of the Cabinet meeting and the other a review meeting of the case with top police and administrative officials.Capt Amarinder also led his council of ministers in observing a 2-minute silence as a mark of homage to the victims of the tragedy.“Finish off this business, clean up the border areas,” was Capt Amarinder’s strict directive to police and district officials during the review VC earlier, which was attended by DGP Dinkar Gupta and Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, along with SSPs and DCs of the affected districts of Tarn Taran, Amritsar Rural and Gurdaspur, along with officials of the Excise & Taxation Department.“This has to stop,” he said, adding that the illicit liquor business had been going on in border areas for a long time, with use of Lahan, but now it had assumed even more dangerous proportions with the new trend of smuggling from neighbouring states.The chief minister directed the concerned officials to be strict in dealing with the criminals, whether men or women.Reiterating his government’s zero tolerance policy to illicit/spurious liquor and drugs, he asked the police to co-ordinate closely with the Excise and other concerned departments to wipe this menace out of Punjab.Pointing out that the victims were the poorest of the poor, Capt Amarinder set a 10-day deadline for the concerned DCs and police officers to identify and process cases to provide targeted additional relief for their families.The chief minister has already announced Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia compensation to the families of each of the victims of the tragedy, in which the death toll currently stands at 113, with several more under treatment, which is being provided free in hospitals.DC Tarn Taran, Kulwant Singh, said his district had reported 84 deaths, with 13 people under treatment. Of these 13, six had been referred to Amritsar for eye treatment, while one was critical, he said.On the relief measures, the DC said disbursement of the Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia compensation announced by the chief minister for the families of the deceased would be disbursed tomorrow as verification had been completed and processing would be done in the next 24 hours.The Child Welfare Committee, along with NGOs, had been roped in to counsel the children of the affected families, including two siblings who had lost both their parents, said the DC.Children of employable age will be assisted for self-employment while widows will be given stitching machines and other assistance to earn their livelihood.DC Amritsar, Gurpreet Khaira, said 15 deaths had been reported in his district, where all efforts were being made to provide immediate relief to the families.DC Gurdaspur, Mohd Ishfaq, said ration kits had been provided to the affected people and a drive had been launched to create awareness about consumption of liquor, with instructions to destroy any illicit liquor lying with them.IG Border Range, SPS Parmar, in a brief presentation, said cases had been registered under Section 304 IPC and the Excise Act, and a coordinated crackdown had been launched in all the border areas to identify and nab the criminals and initiate strict action against them under the law.He revealed that initially, the families of the victims in Tarn Taran, which had suffered the maximum loss of lives, hid the deaths and cremated the bodies without post-mortem.He suggested introduction of colour coding for ethanol and other spirits to check illegal sale/distribution of such products.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-directs-dgp-to-book-those-directly-involved-in-hooch-tragedy-122518

However, during the process of procurement and delivery of smart phones, the country was hit by COVID-19 pandemic and resultantly, the delivery and distribution of the smart phones could not take place in the academic year 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-paves-way-for-distribution-of-1-73-lakh-smart-phones-for-class-xii-govt-school-students-122516

The pendency creates problems for both health department and patients.”Dr Harjinder Singh, principal, Government Medical College, said: “We have been assured by the lab staff that the pendency will be cleared very soon.

Both are exploiting a tragedy to further their own political ambitions and interests. I will write to AICC chief for action against them. — Sunil Jakhar, PPCC chiefCM ignorant We have been raising the issue with the Chief Minister for long. If Jakhar had the courage to question the CM on his constant ignorance of these issues, precious lives could have been saved. — Partap Bajwa, MPJakhar said he would be writing to party president Sonia Gandhi to seek action against the two leaders for their “brazen indiscipline”.The PPCC chief described the attack of the two MPs on their own government as a “copy-paste job” of what happened in Rajasthan in January in the wake of 107 infant deaths when Sachin Pilot had flayed his own government. “Had action been taken against Pilot at that time, the present situation in Rajasthan would have been avoided,” he said.Though the Chief Minister chose not to reply to the targeted accusation, the PPCC chief said, “The two leaders have crossed their limit. It is time to stem the rot and save the Congress from the petty machinations of the likes of Bajwa and Dullo. Both are disgracefully exploiting a tragedy to further their own political ambitions and interests.” Jakhar said their attacks had increased after Capt Amarinder announced his decision to contest the 2022 elections.Meanwhile reacting to Jakhar’s statement, Bajwa and Dullo “advised” him to visit the families of the deceased rather than being so critical of their demand for a probe by the CBI and the ED into the spurious liquor tragedy.Bajwa said: “We (Bajwa and Dullo) have been raising the issue of the thriving liquor mafia with the Chief Minister for long. If Jakhar had the courage to question the Chief Minister on his constant ignorance of these issues, precious lives could have been saved.”“I have not backstabbed the party and do not have any political design,” he said. The MPs said they were Congress loyalists, but not of leaders “who are looting the state under the garb of welfare and good governance”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jakhar-slams-bajwa-dullo-for-anti-party-rant-mps-hit-back-122197

They supplied heroin, illicit liquor and other intoxicants besides indulging in abduction and theft cases.Their father Buta Singh had been a member of the local panchayat.

They were charged with violating the Akal Takht’s ‘hukumnama’ against Langah by having association with him and facilitating his ‘pardon’ from ‘panj pyaras’ of Nihang organiation Tarna Dal at Gurdwara Garhi Baba Banda Singh Bahadur in Dhariwal, Gurdaspur, on  Monday.  Giani Harpreet Singh, who awarded the ‘tankhah’ from the Akal Takht’s podium, said the two would be instantly removed from all positions and panels of the apex body.  Langah was excommunicated on October 5, 2017, by the Akal Takht after his objectionable video had gone viral.  On Monday, Langah had formally submitted an apology before the ‘panj pyaras’ of the Tarna Dal, upon which he was given religious punishment of sweeping the gurdwara floor, washing dishes and cleaning shoes daily for one hour for the next 21 days.  After accepting it, Langah took part in ‘amrit sanchar’ (ceremony of baptism), reportedly to be accepted back to the community.  Acting swiftly on Akal Takht’s order, the SGPC has expelled Gurinderpal Singh Gora from all sub-committees. SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said “We will form a sub-committee to find out if other member or officials were associated with Langah”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/takht-awards-tankhah-to-langahs-associates-122206

With the flies being sighted in large numbers, they are threatening a good cotton yield and thus the economic prospects of the growers.  Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that whitefly has been sighted in villages of Mansa — Kot Dharmu, Jhunir, Bhame Kalan, Bhame Khurd, Bhagu Bhagsar, Khairpur, Rajpura, Patti Sadia, Jhorar Kheda and Wajidpur Bhuma— besides a few villages in their vicinity in Fazilka. Against a threshold level of six per leaf, cotton growers say the fly population settled per leaf this year is almost 24-25. Whitefly is a sucking insect and their feeding removes nutrients from the plant, besides leading to stunted growth, defoliation and reduced yield.   Anirudh Tewari, Additional Chief Secretary, Development, said he had received complaints about whitefly attack and had asked Sutantar Kumar Airi, Director of Agriculture, to oversee control measures. “We have enough insecticides at our disposal to control the whitefly. The chief agriculture officers in all districts have been asked to stay alert,” he said.  In 2015, whitefly attack had damaged two-thirds of the cotton crop, with experts then estimating a loss of thousands of crores as farmers were supplied with spurious insecticides. A number of growers, unable to bear the loss, had committed suicide. Vinod Kumar, a cotton grower in Bhagsar, said they had noticed whitefly on the crop last week and immediately informed the Agriculture Department.  Another cotton grower in Rajpura village, Gurmail Singh, said he had already sprayed the recommended insecticide once, but it had not shown the desired results.  Dr Vijay Kumar, Principal Entomologist (Cotton) at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, said the climatic condition now was favourable for the growth of whitefly. So far, the situation was manageable with the use of insecticides. “We have issued an advisory to the cotton growers to regularly visit the fields and use only the recommended pesticides,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/whitefly-attack-worries-malwa-cotton-growers-122207

Some farmers have also lost their debt waiver relief.Farmer Nirmal Singh from Daska alleged that his deceased father Gurnam Singh had a Kisan Credit Card (KCC) account and also a savings account at the aforesaid branch.“Bank officials transferred a debt waiver amount of Rs 1,38,011 from the KCC account of my father after his death to his savings account without our consent. Later, they created a bogus account in my name and transferred the money to it before withdrawing the same,” said Nirmal Singh, while showing his complaint that he had sent to senior officials of the PGB and the Sangrur SSP.Another farmer, Harbhajan Singh, from Ratta Khera village accused the bank officials of withdrawing Rs 3.95 lakh from his KCC account and depositing it in his savings account without his consent on May 28 this year. “Later, it was transferred electronically to another account without my consent. Officials didn’t give satisfactory reply,” he said.Another Daska resident, Amarjit Kaur, who had a joint account with one of her kin at the PGB’s Daska branch, alleged that the account had been closed in November 2018. “A few days ago, we learnt that bank officials did not close our account and used it for illegal transactions. They also misappropriated our debt waiver relief worth Rs 95,059,” she alleged.There are many farmers who have come up with similar complaints. “We have suspended the manager of the Daska branch after receiving multiple complaints. A thorough inquiry is on,” said Harpal Singh, PGB regional manager, Sangrur.Sangrur SSP Sandeep Garg said, “I have directed the DSP-D to conduct a through investigation into the cases.
