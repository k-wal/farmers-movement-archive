But we took the ICMR team to another village where people gave samples for the survey."Dr Davinderjit further said she had already written to the SDM and also informed the Civil Surgeon about the incident.Health teams have been reportedly facing strong opposition in various parts of the district, especially in rural areas.Sources in the Health Department informed that similar incidents were witnessed in Samana, Patran and Nabha blocks.Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said, "We are facing tough time as far sample collection is concerned. I request people not to pay any heed to rumours. Tests are being conducted to stem the spread by isolating the positive cases if any."He said a lot of energy and time were wasted in convincing people to undergo tests. "We can only win the battle against coronavirus with community participation. I urge people to cooperate with Health teams," said Dr Malhotra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/icmr-team-faces-tough-time-as-patiala-village-refuses-to-give-samples-for-covid-testing-132743

28-08-2020||Chandigarh||SAD urges Governor to reconvene Vidhan Sabha next month||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) legislative party on Friday urged Governor VP Singh Badnore to direct the Congress-led Punjab Government to reconvene the Vidhan Sabha next month to discuss the burning issues faced by the state, saying the ruling dispensation is using the pretext of COVID-19 to run away from facing the ire of the people.In a letter to the Governor, the legislative group led by Sharanjit Singh Dhillon stated that this intervention was necessary as there was a complete breakdown in parliamentary procedures in the state and corrective steps needed to be taken to prevent the Congress government from making a mockery of democracy.The SAD legislators also brought to the notice of the Governor the “oppressive tactics” of the Vidhan Sabha Speaker and the Congress government which had asked the Chandigarh Police to barricade residences of opposition legislators to prevent them from stepping out of their houses.Never before in the history of the state had the movement of elected representatives, who had already announced that they would act responsibly, been restricted in this manner, they said.They also urged Badnore to order an inquiry into this “forced house arrest” of SAD legislators.The legislative group in its missive to the Governor said the Vidhan Sabha was the temple of democracy and no government should be allowed to indulge in any act which destroyed the sanctity of this august institution.The one-hour session called by the Congress government today to fulfil its constitutional duty was against the spirit of democracy as well as parliamentary procedures, read the letter.The legislators said other state assemblies as well as Parliament were being convened for duration of up to two weeks and the Punjab Vidhan Sabha should be reconvened next month and due directions should be given to the state government at the earliest.Speaking about the “pick and choose policy” of Speaker Rana KP Singh, the SAD legislators said the Speaker had deliberately made legislators ineligible to attend the lone one-hour session.“If contact with COVID-19 positive MLAs is the sole criterion for admission as has been related by the Speaker then the latter is also ineligible to attend the session under the same rules. So are most Congress legislators who were in close contact with their colleagues who have tested COVID-19 positive,” they said.The legislators further said it was clear that the COVID-19 pandemic was being used as a pretext by the government to run away from facing the House.“Doing so the Congress government has also misused the august office of the Governor,” they claimed.The letter further mentioned that the SAD legislative party wing approached the Vidhan Sabha Speaker on Thursday and informed him that its members had held a meeting of the wing after taking all due precautions.“We informed that MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala’s COVID-19 positive test report was received after the meeting and all other SAD MLAs who had attended the meeting were found to be COVID negative. We had even offered the Speaker to test us through rapid testing kits. Seeing the situation, we expected that the Speaker would take a rational decision and annul today’s Assembly session if the opposition was not able to attend the same as per the protocols set by him,” read the letter.“We are however shocked that the Speaker decided to continue with the session knowing fully well that the opposition would not attend the same. This smacks of a conspiracy to deny the opposition a chance to question the government in the Vidhan Sabha. It also makes it clear that the Congress government is running away from discussing the problems of the people of the State and is oblivious to their suffering,” said the SAD legislators.They also apprised the Governor that it was of utmost importance for the future of Punjab to hold a full-fledged two week or even three week session to discuss issues like taking action against the politician-police nexus which caused a loss of Rs 5,600 crore to the State exchequer besides leading to the loss of precious 150 lives in the hooch tragedy.“Similarly, Congress legislators are also accused of running the sand mafia in the state which has also been taken notice of by the High Court which has ordered a CBI inquiry into the same.”The SAD MLAs said they also wanted to raise the issue of frontline workers, including doctors and health workers, not getting salaries. The plight of COVID-19 patients being fleeced in some private hospitals and the complete failure of the Mission Fateh programme under the leadership of Chief Minister Captain Aamarinder Singh.We also wanted to discuss the open loot of Rs 69 crore centrals funds meant for SC scholarship by SC/BC Welfare Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, besides opposing government’s decision to abolish 50,000 jobs and not giving Dearness Allowance dues to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore to government employees.“We also wanted to draw attention to the plight of schoolchildren who are unable to pay fee in private schools due to loss of livelihood of their parents besides embezzlement of MGNREGA funds,” read the letter.The MLAs said the SAD had also moved motions which were not taken up, including demanding a resolution be moved to declare that the Punjab Government would not agree to any decision or solution that violates the nationally and internationally accepted Riparian Principle besides resolutions seeking justice for the victim families in the hooch tragedy by ordering a CBI inquiry or that by the High Court into the entire illicit liquor trade.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-urges-governor-to-reconvene-vidhan-sabha-next-month-132704
28-08-2020||Chandigarh||Cong, its youth wing stage protests in Haryana and Punjab against holding of JEE, NEET||The Congress and its youth wing on Friday staged protests at many places in Haryana, Punjab and their joint capital Chandigarh against the holding of JEE and NEET amid the COVID-pandemic.Various opposition parties, including the Congress, have demanded that the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) be deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and floods in parts of the country, even as the Union government has made it clear that they will be held as per schedule with due precautions.In Haryana, Congress leaders and workers held protests at many places, including Karnal, Kaithal, Bhiwani and Sirsa.Congress workers in Bhiwani burnt an effigy of the Union education minister and demanded that the exams be deferred keeping in view the present COVID-19 situation.In Sirsa, Congress workers, during a protest, demanded that the exams be deferred for now."What is the urgency of holding these exams when cases are increasing. Why are lives of thousands of students and their families being put at risk," a Congress leader said.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja said that during the past few weeks, there has been a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. "In this situation the government is bent upon holding JEE and NEE exams which has raised worries of lakhs of students and their parents. Given the situation as it is now due to COVID, how will the government make stay and transport arrangements of so many students," the Congress leader said."Moreover, in some parts of the country the flood situation has aggravated. Should the government be stubborn about holding these exams or take decisions keeping interests of people in mind?" Selja asked.While NEET is scheduled to be held on September 13, engineering entrance exam JEE-Main has been planned from September 1-6. Around 8.58 lakh candidates have registered for the JEE-Main and 15.97 lakh have registered for the NEET.The exams have been deferred twice in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Members of the Chandigarh Territorial Congress, led by its president Pradeep Chhabra, staged a protest against holding of these exams, with him saying this is not the time to "endanger the lives of students"."Don't play with the lives of students," read a placard at the protest in Chandigarh.      At many places in Punjab, the Youth Congress submitted memorandums addressed to the Centre through the district administrations on the issue. It demanded that these exams be put off for the time being.Punjab Youth Congress president Barinder Dhillon said that these exams should be put off as holding them at this stage would put lives of thousands of students at risk.Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar had on Thursday hit out at the BJP-led government at the Centre, accusing it of "playing with the lives" of millions of youth by being "adamant" on conducting JEE and NEET exams, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Jakhar's reaction came a day after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh asked his state advocate general to coordinate with his counterparts in other opposition-ruled states for filing a collective review petition in the Supreme Court, to seek deferment of  NEET and JEE.On Friday, ministers of six opposition-ruled states moved the Supreme Court on seeking review of its order permitting the Centre to conduct NEET and JEE entrance exams this year amid the persisting COVID-19 pandemic.The top court on August 17 had refused to interfere with the conduct of medical and engineering entrance exams -- NEET and JEE --scheduled to take place in September saying that life must go on and students can't lose a precious year due to the pandemic.

Life has to move ahead. A precious year of students cannot be wasted,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had said, adding that students' careers “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.As per the public notices issued by National Testing Agency (NTA) -- which conducts the tests, JEE (Main) April 2020 is scheduled to be held from September 1 to 6, while NEET-UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.The order paved the way for conducting these much-awaited examinations next month.Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta had assured the Bench that due precautions and safeguards would be taken while conducting these examinations.A group of 11 students from 11 states had moved the top court seeking quashing of the July 3 notices issued by NTA for conducting JEE (Main) April 2020 and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-Undergraduate examinations in September. They wanted the examinations to be rescheduled due to COVID.Referring to the pandemic, petitioners' advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava had urged the court to direct the authorities to conduct the tests after normalcy was restored.“Conducting the aforesaid examinations across India at such perilous time is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death. The best recourse at this stage can be to wait for some more time, let COVID-19 crisis subside and then only conduct these exams, in order to save lives of the students and their parents,” the plea had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cabinet-ministers-from-6-non-bjp-ruled-states-move-sc-want-jee-neet-postponed-132666

He, along with Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, a convict in a Delhi bomb blast case, and two others, was booked but the police later claimed Balwant escaped from the custody of Qadian (Gurdaspur) police.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had ordered a CBI inquiry into the case after the Multani family pursued the matter. However, the Supreme Court had quashed the High Court order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-raid-former-dgp-sumedh-singh-sainis-house-132625

During the investigation, it was found that the fraudster has transferred the money to five different bank accounts. These accounts were opened on fake identity and later, cash was withdrawn by ATM and self cheques.Revealing the modus operandi, Shukla said the fraudsters changed the email IDs and mobile numbers registered with the bank account of the victim with identical mobile numbers and email IDs owned by them, hence becoming the virtual controllers of that account.In this case, Amit impersonated Akash Arun Bhatia (victim) and gained internet access of his bank account. Thereafter, the accused transferred the money to five different accounts opened in the name of Vikram Singh by submitting forged documents.Three persons were nominated in this case as accused and two out of them — Rajiv Kumar and Deepak Kumar — were arrested on January 28 from Shimlapuri, Ludhiana. However, Amit managed to escape that day.A special team, headed by Inspector Bhagwant Singh, was formed to nab Amit, a resident of Deol Enclave, Ludhiana. He was wanted in six more cases, registered at various police stations in the states of Punjab and Haryana. The accused was nabbed from Shimlapuri, Ludhiana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rs-2-crore-bank-fraud-racket-busted-1-held-132490

The new module had been designed to ensure that the MBBS students acquired competence in handling not only the illness but also the social, legal and other issues arising from the outbreak of such disease. It was expected that the new longitudinal module, extending from foundation course to the final year of MBBS, would help in ensuring the creation of a doctor who would serve humanity as a leader and healer in bleak times such as the occurrence of a pandemic, he added.The module has been created by a team of 12 experts. In the 80-hour module, to be taught during the entire course of MBBS, the students will be taught about the history of outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, infection control and practices, like hand washing, decontamination, use of PPEs, infection control, air-borne precautions, contact precautions, emerging and re-emerging infections, early identification and control of new infections, sample collection, microbial diagnosis, serologic tests and their performance parameters, vaccination strategies, including vaccine development and implementation, therapeutic strategies, including new drug development, outbreak management, including quarantine, isolation, contact tracing, care of patients during pandemics, emergency procedures, death-related management, communications and media management, intensive care management and palliative care during pandemics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/new-module-for-mbbs-to-prepare-doctors-for-covid-like-pandemics-132479

The issue has raised hackles in Punjab, with the Congress-led government sending a delegation to Shillong last year to take up the matter with the authorities.The Punjab Government’s step was preceded by a visit to Shillong by an SGPC team which had urged Meghalaya Home Minister James Sangma to stop the attempts to “relocate” the Sikh residents of the Harijan Colony.Dohling-led sub-committee was set up by Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong, chief of the high-level committee, to take up the matter with the Hima Mylliem, a traditional Khasi tribal institution.Gurjit Singh, chief of Harijan Panchayat Committee, said the land in question was granted to the ancestors of the current residents by the then tribal chief of the area more than 150 years ago.

28-08-2020||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana High Court imposes Rs1 lakh costs on Amritsar passport officer||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 27Rapping Amritsar Regional Passport Officer (RPO) for malice and complete neglect of the statutory provisions, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has imposed costs of Rs 1 lakh on it. The amount is to be paid to a woman, whose passport was impounded on the ground that she was declared a proclaimed offender even though the order had ceased to operate upon her being granted bail by the court concerned.Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill asserted the act of respondent-RPO in impounding the passport had a clear impact on the petitioner’s fundamental rights. She was granted bail upon appearing before Ludhiana Judicial Magistrate. As such, the proclamation order ceased to be operative. The fact was well within the knowledge of the respondent-Amritsar RPO.“The conduct of the proceedings at the end of respondent leading to the passing of the impugned orders stems from malice, giving a complete neglect to the statutory provisions and the settled law on the issue. The instant case is a clear example of the administrative overreach, thereby breaching the very fundamental rights of the petitioner. Hence, the impugned action is highly deprecated,” Justice Gill asserted.The petitioner had earlier told the court that she had shifted to her parental home at New Delhi in March 2013 following serious differences with her husband. She was not aware of his business activities. She was shown as one of the partners in a business firm run by her husband, whereas she had virtually no role to play. To her surprise, she received a letter from a bank at her New Delhi address that she had been declared a proclaimed offender in a cheque bounce matter.Her counsel added the bank had filed two complaints under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the Ludhiana Court mentioning her husband’s Amritsar address. But the bank informed the petitioner about proclamation order/proceedings at her Delhi address.Justice Gill asserted the RPO did not make efforts to enquire about the status of proclamation proceedings. Even otherwise the complaints were under the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was a bailable offence and condition to surrender the passport could not be imposed even by the court. As such, the principle of “audi alteram partem” stood violated as the petitioner was not granted notice or opportunity of hearing.Describing the RPO’s action as void, illegal and violative of the principles of natural justice, Justice Gill added the order stood vitiated in the absence of a prior notice. Quashing the impugned order dated April 23, 2019, Justice Gill directed the respondent to release the passport. For the purpose, he set a 15-day deadline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-imposes-rs1-lakh-costs-on-amritsar-passport-officer-132476

Takht panel report The Akal Takht-appointed panel, in its investigation, had held SGPC officials and employees responsible for misappropriation of records of not 267 but 328 ‘saroops’The Akal Takht-appointed panel had held SGPC officials and employees responsible for misappropriation of records of not 267 but 328 ‘saroops’. The panel had found embezzlement in additional 61 ‘saroops’ after scrutinising the ledgers of 2013-14 and 2014-15.In a surprise development, it was revealed during the meeting that Chief Secretary Dr Roop Singh had submitted his resignation, which had been accepted by the SGPC executive body. “Since the incident happened during my tenure, I have submitted my resignation on moral and ethical grounds,” Dr Roop Singh said.Longowal opened the sealed envelope containing the panel’s report during the meeting. After holding a discussion, the executive body unanimously decided the next course of action.The retirement dues of Kamaljit Singh were revoked. He was the assistant superviser of the publication department who retired on May 31 and had spilled the beans in the case.Besides, deputy secretary Gurbachan Singh, clerk Baaj Singh, assistant accountant Jujhar Singh and helper Dalbir Singh, have been dismissed from service with immediate effect.Longowal said a police complaint would be registered against them for allegedly tampering with the records in a fraudulent way to misappropriate the ‘saroops’.Secretary, Dharam Parchar Committee, Manjit Singh, superviser Gurmukh Singh, incharge Paramdeep Singh (publication department), and deputy secretaries Satinder Singh (finance) and Nishan Singh, have also been put under suspension. The SGPC will take disciplinary action against them.Former chief secretary Harcharan Singh was also held to be negligent in performing his duties. Longowal said in the probe report, it had come to the fore that he deliberately overlooked the tampering of records by lower-rank staffers. “Hence, it pointed towards his involvement. He will be liable to face legal action,” he said.The SGPC has terminated the services of SS Kohli and Associates as the audit was not being done on a regular basis. Similarly, the contract with binder Kulwant Singh and Jaspreet Singh has been annulled and they have been blacklisted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/missing-saroops-sgpc-chief-secy-quits-3-sacked-132474

This was done after 30 lawmakers tested positive in recent days.AAP: will ignore speaker’s adviceAAP MLAs decided to defy the advice of the Speaker and said except those who had tested positive, other MLAs would be attending the session. Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema said it was decided in a meeting of all MLAs that since none of them had any symptoms and they had maintained social distancing in the meeting where an infected MLA was present, they would attend the House proceedings.While all Shiromani Akali Dal MLAs were present in a meeting of their legislative party, along with Gurpartap Singh Wadala, who later tested positive, the AAP MLAs were contacts of MLAs Manjit Singh Bilaspur and Budh Ram, who have tested positive. Some of the Congress MLAs who have tested positive had also met their party colleagues in the past two days.Speaker Rana KP Singh told The Tribune that he had asked Akali Dal MLAs not to attend the House after they wrote to him saying that they were direct contacts of Wadala. “The Leader of Opposition, Harpal Cheema, and AAP MLA Kultar Sandhwan, too, met me this evening, and I advised them to follow the protocol issued by the health authorities. MLAs should not be seen as lawbreakers, rather we should lead by example and go in for self-quarantine,” he said.However, AAP MLAs decided to defy the advice of the Speaker and said except those who had tested positive, other MLAs would be attending the session. Harpal Cheema said it was decided in a meeting of all MLAs that since none of them had any symptoms and they had maintained social distancing in the meeting where Bilaspur was present, they would attend the House proceedings.As 30 MLAs, including four ministers (Brahm Mohindra, Sukhjinder Randhawa, Gurpreet Kangar and Sunder Sham Arora) and Deputy Speaker Ajaib Singh Bhatti have tested positive, the state government went into a huddle to decide what was to be done. It was then that Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu sent a list of all primary contacts of the MLAs who tested positive recently, along with the protocol. “The protocol is clear. Those who come in direct contact of a Covid-positive person are at high risk for two to five days and should isolate themselves. A test is conducted after five days, and if positive, they will have to isolate themselves for 14 days,” said Sidhu. SAD MLA Bikram Majithia said though as law-abiding citizens, they would not attend the session, others from the ruling party, including the Speaker, who too had met infected MLAs and ministers, should also abide by the health protocol.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akali-aap-mlas-told-to-stay-away-session-to-be-low-key-132392

This has led to a rise in the death rate in the state which is a new worry among health officials.In the first 27 days of August, 870 people lost their lives due to the virus. The number was almost three times than the total deaths reported in five months between March and July.At present, the death rate in the state is 2.64 per cent. It is much higher than the national average and the fatality rate of neighbouring states.The national casualty rate after total cases is 1.86 per hundred cases as the country has reported 32.49 lakh cases and over 60,000 deaths. Haryana has also done better in terms of death rate as compared to Punjab. Haryana has reported 58,000 confirmed cases and of them, 634 people lost lives to the disease. Haryana’s death rate is 1.09 per hundred cases. Similarly, in Himachal Pradesh, the death rate is even lower than Haryana, with 30 deaths after 5,231 confirmed cases. Hence, it comes down to 0.57 per 100 cases.According to experts, it was expected that with an increase in the testing capacity, the death rate in the state may come down. But despite the fact that the state is conducting over 20,000 tests per day, the death rate is increasing. The sudden spike in the cases in August has changed the situation. Meanwhile, with 1,746 new cases, the state count has reached 47,836. With 37 more deaths, the total number of casualties has reached 1,256. At present, there are 15,608 active cases while 30,972 people have recovered so far.Among the worst-affected districts, Ludhiana topped the list with 350 cases, followed by Gurdaspur (210), Patiala (188), Jalandhar (186), SAS Nagar (178), Bathinda (127) and Hoshiarpur (94). At present, 425 patients are on oxygen support and 49 are on ventilator support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/spike-in-covid-fatality-rate-in-punjab-has-health-officials-worried-132394

After attending the meeting of the GST Council, he said, “A hungry stomach knows no law and I shall hate to see the day when any state feels pressurised by its citizens to breach the spirit of the GST only because it failed to meet substantially all commitments and expectations.”  The Centre owes Punjab Rs 6,500 crore as GST compensation for the period from April to July. With the state’s own tax and non-tax revenue being severely impacted because of the Covid-induced economic crisis, the revenue receipts for the first quarter have shown a decline of 21 per cent. Punjab has not been able to clear the salary bill for July, with even frontline health workers not getting their pay. Talking to The Tribune, Manpreet said the Centre had backed out from its commitment of giving the GST compensation to the states. “Former Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley went on record in several GST meetings, saying if there was a shortfall in GST collections, the Centre will borrow money and compensate the states. There is no benevolence in giving the 14 per cent hike in the GST, as it was a commitment made by the Centre, after the latter calculated that they would plug the loopholes in tax collections after the GST rollout. Now, the states are being asked to borrow an additional amount. Being an Opposition-ruled state, we have no choice,” he said. Lamenting that the Centre had seen a surge in tax collections through the cess imposed on the sale of retail fuel, Manpreet said the Centre had collected Rs 6 lakh crore as fuel prices in the past three years. “Under a VAT regime, I could have increased tax rates to keep the cash coming in, but under the GST regime, the states have no power of taxation,” he said. The minister said he had been making fervent appeals for activating the constitutional mechanism for dispute resolution under the GST, as laid down in Section 279 (A) (ii) of the GST Act. “My opposition to the Centre should not be misunderstood, but as the Finance Minister, I am answerable to my Cabinet colleagues in Punjab, as well as the people of my state,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-not-keeping-promise-on-gst-compensation-punjab-fm-132397

Citing the plans to change the seating arrangements of the MPs for the first time in the history of Parliament, he said, “Will it be appropriate to put the health of millions of students at risk as they will have to sit together in the examination centres?”The state Congress chief said in fact, the Modi government was “adamant” on conducting the examinations only because Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was the first to demand that these should not be held at this critical stage.Meanwhile, Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla, too, said the Centre was imposing examinations on students, ignoring the threat to their lives. “But we will not compromise on this matter and will soon file a collective review petition in the Supreme Court,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jee-row-centre-putting-lives-of-students-at-risk-says-jakhar-132398

They say the compensation of Rs 12,000 per acre that came their way was too little to recover the actual damage.Tarsem Singh, a resident of Janian Chahal village, said, “Though I got Rs 12,000 compensation for the crop loss on my 1-acre land, nothing came our way for the damaged verandah. There are cracks all over my house and I need Rs 1.5 lakh to repair it. I sought help from various sources, but to no avail. My biggest support was my younger brother Nirmal Singh in Dubai, who was to return this year and help me, but he passed away in May this year because of Covid.”Like Tarsem, Manjit Kaur of the same village says she is badly hit after the floods damaged her crops. “I got a compensation for my 1-acre land. Last year, my 17-year-old son started helping me in the fields. I had taken 2 acres on contract. I had paid Rs 45,000 in advance to the land owner but got nothing in return as the entire crop got damaged,” she said.Major Singh, whose house faced the maximum impact as it was located right in front of the breach point in the river, says the horrifying scenes still send jitters up his spine. “My house had developed cracks all over and I had to spend nearly Rs 2 lakh for its repair. The compensation came only for the crop loss, but that was miniscule as compared to the actual input cost,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/year-after-floods-lohian-residents-struggle-to-stay-afloat-132400
28-08-2020||Rajmeet Singh||Probe report questions role of minister in scholarship scam||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 27In the Rs 55.71-crore scholarship scam, the role of Social Justice, Empowerment and Minorities Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot in shielding those involved has been questioned in a report submitted to the office of Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan.The scam was exposed last year. It involved alleged irregular disbursal of funds under the Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme for the Scheduled Castes and other backward classes. Of the Rs 55 crore, the Social Welfare Department disbursed Rs 39 crore to “ghost” institutions as the records of the distribution of the amount are missing. Another Rs 16.71 crore was wrongly disbursed to private educational institutions despite the Finance Department during its audit pointing out recovery of Rs 8 crore from the institutions which had been illegally given the scholarship amount.In figuresRs55.71cr scholarship scamRs39 cr disbursed to “ghost” institutionsRs16.71 cr given to pvt institutionsA copy of the report, submitted by Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) Kirpa Shankar Saroj, has also been sent to the Chief Minister’s office.After the scam was highlighted in December last year, a departmental probe was conducted. The final report, submitted to the government on August 24, states that instead of the Director of the department sanctioning the payment, the minister had started calling the files for his approval.Terming the findings as grossly absurd and unfounded, Dharamsot on Thursday categorically said he was willing to face any inquiry and action even if an iota of truth was found in the allegations. Terming the report as politically motivated, Dharamsot, in a statement given to a private channel, targeted his ACS Kirpa Shankar Saroj while denying having signed any file. The ACS was not available for comments.The report submitted to the government gives details on how a Deputy Director in the department, who had alleged patronage of the minister, spearheaded the nexus along with other officials to disburse the funds in an illegal manner.Dismiss minister: AAPThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has sought immediate dismissal and arrest of the minister and a time-bound probe into the scam, under the watch of a sitting High Court judge. Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema alleged that the Amarinder Singh government was trying to save the minister. Congress Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Dullo demanded a CBI probe into misutilisation of the scholarship funds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/probe-report-questions-role-of-minister-in-scholarship-scam-132401
28-08-2020||Mohali||Court reserves order on ex-DGP’s bail plea||The Court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Rajnish Garg today reserved the order on the anticipatory bail application filed by former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in the alleged kidnapping and murder of Balwant Singh Multani for August 29. Saini’s counsel APS Deol and Harneet Singh Oberoi had filed an anticipatory bail application in the court on Monday to avoid his arrest after a local court allowed the Punjab Police to add murder charge against him to the FIR on August 21. After hearing the arguments in the case today, the judge ordered: “Now for remaining arguments, if any, and orders to come up on August 29.” However, no order on interim stay on the arrest of Saini has been passed by the court. While hearing the anticipatory bail application on August 25, Duty Magistrate had stayed the arrest of the DGP Saini for two days, and adjourned the matter for August 27 to be heard on merits in the designated court of Additional District and Sessions judge (ADJ) Rajnish Garg.  Saini is apprehending arrest in the alleged kidnapping and murder case of Balwant Singh Multani after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) added Section 302 of the IPC to the FIR registered against Saini when two co-accused turned approvers and deposed against Saini of being eyewitness to the alleged inhumane torture given to Multani at Sector 17 police station. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/court-reserves-order-on-ex-dgps-bail-plea-132402
