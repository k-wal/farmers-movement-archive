Similarly, freight traffic across Punjab has been severely impacted since October 1.“As on date, more than 200 loaded rakes for Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir are stabled across various railway zones due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Regular messages are being received from industries and companies, whose rakes have got stuck due to the rail roko agitation. Even the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has reported that some power plants may have to be shut down due to a coal shortage,” an official said.Officials said while the Goindwal Sahib Power Plant has already shut down, the Talwandi and Nabha thermal power plants have coal stocks for only three and six days, respectively.Rail movement of wheat and rice by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from Punjab to other states has also been stopped, leading to loss of loading of more than 25 foodgrain rakes daily, they added.The oil marketing companies (OMCs) have also expressed serious concerns regarding the supply of petroleum products for the Jammu depot, as the POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) stocks are depleting fast.“They have requested for an immediate movement of rakes for meeting the demands for the Jammu area and further supplying to the Srinagar, Leh and Kargil areas. The general manager of the Northern Railway has taken up the issue with Punjab’s chief secretary, requesting for an immediate resumption of rail movement,” an official said.The “rail roko” agitation against the farm laws is likely to continue in Punjab as no decision could be taken at a meeting of 30 farmer organisations in Barnala on Saturday after most of their leaders failed to attend it. The protests have led to severe power outages in the state due to a reduced power generation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-rail-roko-effect-over-200-rakes-of-freight-stranded-power-plants-on-verge-of-being-shut-down-155721

After the incident of October 12, Ashwani Sharma’s security had been beefed up and a total of 16 Punjab Police security personnel, including Commandoes, are deployed with him currently, he added. Meanwhile, Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta gave details of the confrontation between Sharma’s cavalcade and some protesting farmers on October 12.The DGP said that at around 7 pm, Sharma’s motorcade was confronted by around 25 protestors belonging to different farmers’ unions. “They suddenly came in front of his pilot security escort vehicle and Innova vehicle, carrying black/yellow flags etc. and shouting slogans. These protestors had been picketing the Toll Plaza at Cholang on NH-1 for almost 2 weeks from Jalandhar to Jammu,” the press release said.The press release quoted the DGP as saying that after 15-18 seconds of protest, both the vehicles in the motorcade, which kept moving all the time, were allowed to go but a protestor hit and broke the rear windscreen of the Innova with a wooden flag stick.“A side glass window of the Innova also got damaged in the process.  More than seven Personal Security officers, including Security In-charge ASI Hari Ram and 3 Punjab Police Commandoes, who were accompanying Sharma at the time of incident, immediately got off their vehicles and took the BJP Punjab chief safely away,” the press release said. He was escorted to Dasuya (Hoshiarpur) Police station where DSP Tanda and SSP Hoshiarpur joined him, the release said.A criminal case under relevant sections of law has been registered against the protestors for rioting armed with deadly weapon (Section 148), criminal conspiracy (120-B), wrongful restraint (341) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of The National Highways Act, 1956.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-amarinder-accuses-bjp-of-spreading-false-propaganda-over-attack-on-state-unit-chief-155687

In future also we would not allow BJP leaders to organise any meeting till they rollback the black farm Acts,” said Chhaju Singh, a protesting farmer.“BJP leaders have passed black Acts and now they want to fool farmers by giving various excuses,” he added.After getting information about a virtual meeting being held at Sarvhitkari School, hundreds of members from farmer organisations, like Kirti Kisan Union (KKU), Punjab Kisan Union, Kul Hind Kisan Sabha (Ajay Bhawan), Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, BKU Sidhupur, BKU Rajewal and Kul Hind Kisan Federation, gathered outside the venue after breaking a couple police barricades set up between the bus stand and the school.“Since various farmer organisations have already announced to oppose meetings of BJP leaders, they should not test our patience by organising any meetings,” said Bhupinder Singh, state convener of the youth wing of Kirti Kisan Union.“During meetings, they have been trying to project some BJP leaders as farmers, which is unacceptable. All farmers are against farm Acts and protesting, and we would not allow any meeting in future also,” said Bhupinder Singh.BJP district president Randeep Deol alleged that police did not stop protesters from reaching the spot.“We remained confined in school till 3 pm as police did not stop farmers from reaching the venue of our meeting. It shows they are helping farmers,” he alleged.Tarun Chugh, BJP national general secretary, alleged that some persons wanted to turn farmers’ agitation violent to defame farmers.“Congress leaders under the garb of farmers are trying to terrorise our workers, but we will not bow and will go to farmers and clarify each and everything to them,” said Chugh.When contacted Sangrur DSP (Rural) Satpal Sharma said that they had deputed adequate number of personnel and situation remained under control.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/agriculture-laws-protesting-farmers-hold-bjp-leaders-captive-in-a-sangrur-school-for-three-hours-155686

The Punjab and Haryana High Court had on September 7 dismissed his anticipatory bail plea.“This case is of 1991. After 30 years what is the hurry to arrest him... We will grant you time to file a reply,” the Bench had said, adding he will not be arrested till further orders.However, the top court had asked Saini to co-operate with the Punjab Police in the investigation of the case.Multani—a junior engineer with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation—was allegedly picked up by the police in December 1991 after a terror attack on Saini that left three policemen killed. Saini was injured in the attack.Saini’s troubles started in May when he was booked at a police station in Mohali along with six others for the alleged kidnapping of Multani in 1991. Murder charge was added in August after two of the accused policemen spilled the beans.Rohatgi had contended before the top court that Punjab government was after Saini because he had filed two chargesheets in which current Chief Minister Capt Amarinder was an accused. “This is why they are after me,” he had submitted.Saini is also facing trial in a Special CBI Court in Delhi along with three others for alleged abduction and disappearance of automobile businessman Vinod Kumar, his brother-in-law Ashok Kumar and their driver Mukhtiyar Singh in 1994.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/multani-murder-case-sc-asks-punjab-to-respond-to-sumedh-sainis-plea-for-quashing-of-fir-155656

The protesters stated that they were "fighting for their rights, respect and freedom".A demonstration was also held at Calgary in Canada where protesters shouted slogans against the union government over the passing of the bills. In solidarity with farmers, they demanded that the bills be revoked at the earliest.In France, NRIs raised ‘Kisan Bachao-Punjab Bachao’ slogans and raised questions on the working of the NDA government over the passing of farm laws.

NRIs in London, UK announced widespread protests against Modi, if the farm laws were not rolled back.Rajwinder Singh from Vancouver in Canada said: "I came to Canada around five years back and have agriculture land in Punjab. I feel that these reform bills have been passed to crush the small farmers, so there is a need for everyone to come out and support our Punjabi farmers."Bhajan Singh of Calgary said the laws were a direct attack on small and marginal farmers, who owned plots of fewer than 5 acres. They will be employees at their own land and landlords and corporates will rule, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-nris-in-canada-italy-usa-uk-france-protest-farm-laws-155651

He died in 1991The painting was one of the masterpieces of eminent artist Jaswant Singh and was selected by civil servant Dr MS Randhawa from various entries.Going by the posts on his Facebook account and web page, Atul Mehra, an artist from Amritsar, who presently heads one of the oldest schools of painting — the Indian Academy of Fine Arts in Amritsar — claimed “noteworthy paintings can be found at the Jallianwala Bagh Memorial in Amritsar. The 17.5-foot-long canvas depicts the stark reality of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.The vivid portrayal of General Dyer’s men shooting every Indian at sight wrenches the heart of every visitor to the memorial even today”.‘Moral offence’It is a moral and legal offence to copy a dead painter’s work, present it as your own and put it at the same public place where the original has been placed. — Harinder Singh, Jaswant Singh’s sonThe claims made by Mehra have left Jaswant Singh’s Delhi-based son Harinder Singh and daughter-in-law Aparna Caur in shock.“The painting was commissioned to my father by Dr MS Randhawa. Atul Mehra is blatantly bragging on Facebook that it is his painting. This is shameful on his part and also for the Punjab and the Central Government to allow such a malicious campaign. This is my father’s copyright because he is the creator of the painting,” Harinder said.He said the plaque displayed at the entrance for many years was written by Dr Randhawa in which one could see the creator’s name. “It is a moral and legal offence to copy a dead painter’s work, present it as your own and put it at the same public place where the original has been placed,” he said. Mehra said the painting was damaged by termites. Decades back, on the request of Sukumar Mukherjee, he had repaired the damaged painting. But when questioned how he could claim it was his creation, Mehra said since he had restored the painting, he had the right to call himself as its creator.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/copyright-row-over-jallianwala-painting-155423

On Puri’s insistence, senior BJP leader Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, who was physically present here, said the whole text of farm laws was being translated and printed in Punjabi language for a better understanding among the farmers.‘Query on corporates not heard’There were fewer farmers and more BJP workers in today’s interaction. My question on contract-farming and invasion of corporate sector was not heard. — Amrit Singh, Pathania village farmer‘Farmers’ land can’t be acquired’Some people are spreading ‘lies’ that the corporates will take over farmers’ land. The laws clearly say that farmers’ land will not be acquired. — Hardeep Singh Puri, Union ministerWhile answering the farmers’ queries, Puri promised them that the MSP and old mandi pattern would remain intact in addition to private players’ participation to procure the crop. “The sale, lease or mortgage of farmers’ land is nowhere in the law and the land will be protected against any recovery,” Puri said.Promising an increased MSP for wheat by the Centre in the future, he said the purchase centres, which were 30,349 in 2018-2019, would be increased to 36,130 by 2021, an increase of 30 per cent. He said the Opposition was spreading misinformation among the farmers.BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said it was a wrong notion that farmers could not knock the door of the courts in case of a dispute. He said the first redressal forum would be at the SDM level. “If the farmers are not satisfied, they may go to the High Court or Supreme Court,” he said.Nonetheless, Harbhajan Singh, a farmer from Chak Mukand, said the meeting had reached no logical conclusion as most of their queries remained unanswered.“We are not at all satisfied with the NDA’s ‘self-reliant’ farm Acts. The SDMs seldom respond to a common man’s grievance, until and unless the victim has some political connection. How can we expect justice under such an administrative set-up? If SDMs or DCs are so concerned, why don’t they bother to check the procurement which is being done at a lesser price in mandis?” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/at-virtual-meet-farmers-reject-hardeep-singh-puris-assurance-on-farm-laws-155407

14-10-2020||---||No pact with BJP in future: SAD||Bathinda, October 13Former state minister and SAD kisan wing head Sikander Singh Maluka today said the SAD would never ally with the BJP even if they did a U-turn on the farm Acts. He said the BJP violated the coalition dharma by ignoring its oldest ally on the three Acts.“The SAD is trying to bring all pro-farmer parties on one platform. The party has held talks with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and TMC head and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to bring them on board for the fight against the farm Acts,” he said.He also stated that he was meeting farmers and listening to their grievances and soon the SAD would stage a protest in Delhi.Maluka said since the Acts would have maximum impact on Punjab and Haryana, a genuine discussion should be held with all stakeholders. He said the laws could be framed afresh with proper safeguards for farmers, including making MSP a statutory right to ensure private players did not exploit them.Maluka said the SAD would chalk out a programme for another round of protests to ensure justice for farmers, farm labourers and arhtiyas.When asked about former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal showering praises on the NDA government, Maluka said: “We ensured AIIMS and other development projects in the state from the NDA government. However, we have issues with them on the controversial agriculture legislations”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-pact-with-bjp-in-future-sad-155409

The demonstrators were led by Sujanpur MLA Dinesh Babbu and former Cabinet minister Master Mohan Lal.Babbu said if the assailants were not identified and nabbed soon he would be forced to stage another protest in Sujanpur. The BJP state chief claimed he had concrete evidence that state agencies had planned and executed the assault.“They wanted to make it appear as if farmers had instigated the attack. The site was chosen carefully as a farmer union was holding a protest nearby. Farmers have nothing to do with whatever happened,” Ashwani claimed.“Once my cavalcade crossed the toll plaza, my security personnel told me that a couple of cars were following us. Soon, they intercepted my vehicle and some youths started stoning it. Fortunately, I escaped unhurt. Even though SSP Navjot Singh Mahal had assured me that the offenders would be nabbed soon, nothing tangible has been done. The complicity of the state government is clear,” he added.To lend credence to his claim, the BJP leader said his request for additional security was turned down even when protesters had twice laid siege to his house in Pathankot a fortnight ago. He added that on his way back to Pathankot after the incident, his men spotted another group of youths at the Manser toll plaza on the Mukerian-Pathankot highway, which was probably there to attack him again. — TNS‘Farmers are not behind such acts’We condemn the attack on the BJP state chief. It is the work of anti-social forces which want to sabotage the ongoing farmers’ protest. We are very clear that farmers cannot indulge in any such actions. — Sukhbir Singh Badal, SAD president||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/state-agencies-planned-attack-bjp-punjab-president-ashwani-sharma-155410

14-10-2020||PK Jaiswar||Coop bank fraud: Vigilance yet to get orders of full probe||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, October 13The Punjab Government move to shift investigation into the multi-crore cooperative bank fraud to the Vigilance Department has turned out to be a mere eyewash as the department is yet to get the orders of full investigation into the case.As per Vigilance officials, they have only received orders for holding an ‘enquiry’, implying they will not have the authority for search, arrest or preparing the final report in the alleged scam. It only allows them to ascertain the facts given in the FIR registered in the fraud in February.Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had shifted the probe to the Vigilance for detailed investigations into the fraud, involving bungling of government funds worth several crores by several cooperative societies.In February, the police had registered an FIR under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC into Rs 3 crore fraud at Tarsikka branch of the bank.In the case, four persons, including branch manager Rakesh Kumar and cashier Ram Kishore, were arrested. Two of their accomplices, Sukhdev Singh of Sarai village and Sukhbir Singh of Bhatti village (both secretaries of the cooperative societies), were booked.The police filed a challan in the local court on May 16. The police investigations found that the senior manager, district manager, bank officials, deputy registrars, assistant registrars, inspectors of cooperative societies and officials of the Audit Department colluded and misappropriated funds running into crores.The investigation was extended to other branches of the cooperative bank, thereby unearthing a major scam. It was found that the fraud was committed at five branches, including Tarsikka, Saidoke Lehal, Bhattike, Chogwan Sadhpur and Kohala, falling under the jurisdiction of the Tarsikka branch of the bank.The case was shifted to the Vigilance after the Amritsar rural police failed to make any further progress. Besides the two, the police did not arrest any other suspect or nominated new suspects in the FIR. The police were apparently acting under pressure as the accused were considered close to a prominent leader of the region, it was learnt.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coop-bank-fraud-vigilance-yet-to-get-orders-of-full-probe-155413

Posing as the manager of SBI, Palamaner branch, Andhra Pradesh, a person claiming to be Rana Pratap Singh has been calling up people on WhatsApp saying they have won a ‘Rs 25 lakh lottery’ in the ‘KBC All India SIM Card Lucky Draw Competition’. However, the IDs sent by him as proof to his potential victims bear Sandhu’s photos. VC’s personal assistant Gurinder Singh said Sandhu was aware of the scam and he had already lodged a complaint with the cyber cell. However, the cell is yet to trace the suspects. Neetu, a domestic helper from Pholriwal, told The Tribune that she got a call from number 70975783333 and the person introduced himself as bank manager Rana Pratap Singh and claimed she had won a lottery. He sent a copy of his bank ID, Aadhaar card, an audio message and an APK file with details of the ‘lottery’ to gain her trust. The scammer told her he would transfer the amount to her account within a week once she completed the formalities. “He asked me to deposit Rs 5,000 as transaction money to avail Rs 25 lakh. He also sought my bank details, PAN card and Aadhaar card to verify my identity,” she said. “I was taken in by his claims, but as an afterthought decided to consult someone trustworthy,” said Neetu, adding she discussed this matter with the owner of one of the households where she works. “Sensing fraud, they warned me against sharing my details with them,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/scammers-use-gndu-vcs-photo-on-fake-identity-cards-155414
