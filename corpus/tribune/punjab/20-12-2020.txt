20-12-2020||Ruchika M. Khanna||Social media accounts of farmers' forum blocked, restored after uproar||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 20The social media accounts of the joint forum of farmers were blocked on Sunday evening, within a few hours of a live press conference broadcast through their Facebook page. As the issue snowballed into an embarrassing controversy, the pages were unblocked.Farmer union leaders alleged that their Facebook and Instagram handles -- started last week -- were blocked this evening, within a few minutes of their press conference. Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who has been at the forefront of the farmers’ agitation, was reportedly doing a live session on Facebook when the social media handle -- Kisan Ekta Morcha -- was blocked.“This once again raises serious questions about the online censorship that this BJP government is indulging in. On one hand, we have the entire hi-tech team of the BJP spreading “misinformation” about the farmers' protest, and on the other, our social media handles have been blocked,” alleged Dr Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union.The farmer unions had launched their social media accounts last week, with a team led by Baljit Singh handling the operation. The idea, say farm leaders, was to counter the "negative narrative" spread by the government and to give their side of the story to the masses, explaining why they were protesting.Read also: Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer unionDelhi cold intensifies but protesting farmers undeterredTomar may meet protesting farmers in a day or two: Amit ShahFarmers at Ghazipur border set up ‘Neki ki divar’ for protestersIncome tax raids on Punjab arhtiyasA number of young farmers, and their friends had launched the official social media account for the farmer unions four days back. Together, the two social media platforms have close to seven lakh followers and these are being used by the agitating farmers to broadcast their opinions and announce the next course of action in the ongoing protest.Baljit Singh, who was heading this IT operation, said it was strange that the pages were blocked without any notification being given by the platforms. “Obviously, the government is behind it. They are scared that our narrative telecast on social media will clear all misconceptions the government is trying to create in the minds of public,” he alleged.The move to block the social media handles comes closely after the Income Tax raids on the commission agents of Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/social-media-accounts-of-farmers-forum-blocked-restored-after-uproar-187134

20-12-2020||Chandigarh||Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer union||Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of Punjab’s largest farmer organisations protesting against the recent farm laws, on Sunday said it has been asked by a central agency to submit its registration details which allow it to receive foreign funds.The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Ugrahan and its general secretary Sukhdev Singh revealed about the Union government’s demand alleging that the “Centre is using all tactics as their sole purpose is to defeat the ongoing agitation”.The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) stipulates mandatory registration of any outfit receiving foreign fund.“A department under the Centre has sent an email which we received through our bank’s branch in Punjab. In the e-mail, it was stated that we should give registration details in respect of these donations from abroad otherwise they will be sent back,” Sukhdev Singh said.“The bank manager showed me the email which has been sent by the Forex Department,” he said.Questioning the timing of the Centre’s demand, Singh said, “It is quite clear that the agitation against the farm laws is against the Centre and they will try to create all hurdles they can in that. They are using all tactics as their sole purpose is to defeat the agitation.”Asked how much foreign fund they have received recently, Singh said, “We are yet to calculate the exact amount.”He said his outfit will be consulting a chartered accountant or an advocate to submit their reply.“The IT Department first conducted raids on ‘arhtiyas’ (commission agents) because they are supporting the farmers’ agitation. Now, as our outfit is a big one, the Centre is targeting us,” said Ugrahan.“They are asking details about NRI funds. The NRIs from Punjab help us with donations from their hard-earned money. They are supporting our agitation, what is the problem in that? Back home too, people support us,” the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief asserted.“But the Centre is targeting us because their sole purpose is to defeat the stir,” he alleged.

Satisfied with the work of Chadha after being given charge of Vice Chairman of Delhi Jal Board, Kejriwal gave him the new responsibility.MLA from Rajinder Nagar, Chadha has been with the party before its inception, and has been instrumental in drafting the Lokpal Bill as well. He is the youngest national spokesperson for the AAP and among the youngest spokesperson across parties.On being appointed as the co-incharge of the party's Punjab unit, Chadha thanked Kejriwal for instilling such confidence in him and ensured to give best in strengthening the party's position in Punjab.Noting that India is an agrarian country and Punjab stands at the forefront whenever it comes to agriculture, Chadha said, "Our focus will be to make Punjab a truly prosperous and golden state". Our focus in the state will be on education and prosperity."The AAP leader said it is painful to see how the youth of Punjab is spoiling its future by getting stucked into the vicious cycle of drugs and unemployment."Farmers have been facing severe problems as well. I take it as my personal responsibility to change these circumstances, and I am certain that AAP will succeed in making the state green, happy and prosperous." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aaps-raghav-chadha-made-punjab-units-co-incharge-187096

20-12-2020||Chandigarh||'Issues of Khalistan movement should have been dealt with politically'||Elucidating upon the events in the 1970s and1980s that led up Operation Bluestar in Punjab, former senior police officers opined that all the issues in those days, should have must have been addressed politically not forcefully as there are no military answers to a political problem. Speaking out his recently published book, 'The Khalistan Conspiracy: A Former R&AW Officer Unravels the Path to 1984', at the Military Literature Festival here on Sunday, the author GBS Sidhu, said that in the late seventies when he was sent to Canada to look into the Khalistani problem, he found no evidence of any large scale movement except for a couple of persons peddling the cause.Sidhu, a former Special Secretary in the Research and Analysis Wing, delved upon a series of interconnected events that led to the subsequent rise of the Khalistan movement and its aftermath. He spoke of the functioning of RAW on this issue, the developments and changes that took place within the agency such as creating new divisions and setting up new overseas stations and the political dimension to the whole episode.He said that his book revolved around a two-phased, top-secret operation, initiated and managed by some senior Congress leaders operating from then prime minister Indira Gandhi's residential office at 1 Akbar Road, New Delhi.Labelling it as Operation Bhindranwale-Khalistan, he said that the first phase involved destabilising the then Badal-led government in Punjab by propping up Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale and creating a fear psychosis, which met little success, while the second phase was aimed at winning the state elections. Sidhu also recalled various aspects related to rising of militancy in Punjab and abroad, especially Canada and other European countries, where Sikhs had migrated to during the 1970s. He also highlighted about the efforts of the union government at that time to settle the issues revolving around militancy. Former Director General of Police, Punjab, GS Aujla, said that the issue was not addressed at the political level at that time and history has given a great lesson that political will was lacking to solve the issue during the period.MPS Aulakh, a former Director General of Police, Punjab who has held prominent positions in the Intelligence Bureau, traced the series of events of that period that began with some incidents of violence in the early 1970s and the role of the establishment in dealing with the emerging situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/issues-of-khalistan-movement-should-have-been-dealt-with-politically-187069
20-12-2020||New Delhi||Doctors from Punjab set up two-day eye-examination camp for protesting farmers at Singhu border||A team of nine doctors from Punjab's Garhshankar set up a two-day medical camp at the Singhu border here on Sunday to attend to the protesting farmers who are suffering from eye-related problems.On their fourth visit to the protest site, a group of doctors, including ophthalmologists, physiotherapists and general physicians, arrived at the Singhu border on Saturday evening after attending to their duties at their respective workplaces in Garhshankar.Due to the excessive cold, dust and pollution, many protesting farmers, who have been staying put at the Singhu border for nearly a month now, have been complaining of the dry-eye syndrome, watery eyes and other eye-related problems.The makeshift camp has medicines and equipment worth over Rs 70,000, including eye-examination devices, lubricants, antibodies and anti-allergic eye drops, said the doctors, adding that these medicines could give a temporary relief to the protesters complaining of eye-related problems in this chilling weather.As several protesters, including women, elderly people and youngsters, visited the camp complaining of a burning sensation due to dry eyes or weakness in the eyesight, Dr Rajdeep Singh (27), one of the ophthalmologists in the team, said during their third visit to the Singhu border, they realised that there was a need for a separate eye camp at the protest site."This is not our first visit here. Earlier, we had set up general medical camps on weekends. During our last visit, many people came to us with eye-related problems. While some complained of dry eyes, others complained of a burning sensation or irritations in the eye. So we realised that no such facility was available and decided to set up an exclusive eye-checkup camp here to address the problems of such people," he said while attending to 50-year-old Mehrunisa, who have been complaining of pain and weakness in her eyes for the last few days.She was advised to take anti-allergic eye drops twice a day. Hailing from Delhi's Wazirabad, Mehrunisa has been camping at the Singhu border for the last one week.Asked if she was a farmer, Mehrunisa said: "I am not a farmer, but we get our food because of our farmer brothers. If we do not stand with them today, we should be ashamed of ourselves."Another ophthalmologist in the doctors' team, Deepak Pandey (35), said: "Most of them complained of eye-related allergies, which are largely caused by dust and pollution. This also causes irritation and swelling in the eyes. Due to the excessive cold, they have also developed the dry-eye syndrome. Excessive use of phones also causes irritation and pain."He pointed out that since most of the protesting farmers undertook long journeys on their tractor-trolleys to arrive at the protest site amid this cold spell, they ended up developing eye-related problems due to dust and pollution.An 18-year-old protester, who has come to the Singhu border from Haryana's Ambala along with his family, also complained of irritation in his eyes.Dr Amandeep Singh, a physiotherapist, said, "We are here only to serve the farmers. It is our duty. All medicines are free of cost. Our only intention is to give them our best medical facilities." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/doctors-from-punjab-set-up-two-day-eye-examination-camp-for-protesting-farmers-at-singhu-border-187065
20-12-2020||Chandigarh||Voices of Punjabi diaspora getting shriller for farmers||Voices of Punjabi diaspora across the globe, standing for the dignity and rights of the protesting farmers in India, have been going louder and shriller.Hundreds of Sikhs are adding volume to the protests in the US, Britain, Canada and Australia, to draw the attention and express solidarity with their Sikh brethren back home.The latest protest was during the Australia-India day and night test match outside the Adelaide Oval where the protesters, holding placards displaying "We stand with farmers", demanded the Indian government to listen to the concerns of the farmers.Australian parliamentarians Rob Mitchell and Russell Wortley are among those who have expressed concerns over the protesting farmers.Back home, arguably the largest protests in the recent history, tens of thousands of farmers, largely from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh spending nights in bone-chilling cold, demanding three laws passed by Modi's government to be revoked, fearing affecting their livelihoods.Among the most vocal Punjabi parliamentarian diaspora is British Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who has slammed the media for spreading 'misinformation' in a bid to label protesting farmers as 'separatists or terrorists'.The outspoken Sikh MP for Slough, who earlier wrote to British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab along with 35 other cross-party MPs asking to raise the issue of farmers' agitation with New Delhi, said last week, "Your abuse and intimidation won't deter me from speaking the truth".In a series of tweets, Dhesi said, "Some in the media have begun misinformation of labelling peaceful farmers, or those speaking up for them, as separatists or terrorists. You do a disservice to your nation and profession." "Hater troll factory: your abuse and intimidation won't deter me from speaking the truth," he said.Earlier, Dhesi asked Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Parliament to comment on the farmers' protests and asked to convey concerns about the force being used against them and a speedy resolution to the current deadlock to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Expressing solidarity with the farmers, Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said the reports of peaceful protesters being brutalized were very troubling."Many of my constituents have family there and are worried about the safety of their loved ones. Healthy democracies allow peaceful protest. I urge those involved to uphold this fundamental right," he tweeted.Canada's New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh has tweeted: "The violence perpetrated by the Indian government against farmers peacefully protesting is appalling. I substitute solidarity with the farmers from Punjab and across India -- and, I expect the Indian government to interact in peaceful dialogue instead of violence." He thanked Jack Harris, MP for St. John's East, for his advocacy."We are shocked to see the Indian government's suppression of farmers protesting new laws which will endanger their livelihood. Instead of using water cannons and tear gas, the Indian government needs to engage in open dialogue with farmers," said Harris.Standing with the protesting farmers of Punjab and Haryana, Conservative MP for Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon, Brad Vis, presented a petition in the House of Commons, saying he's concerned about the peaceful protests."Legislative independence of sovereign nations must be respected but Canada will always stand for the protection of fundamental freedoms both at home and around the world."I stand with the farmers in India who are peacefully protesting.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau too extended his support to the farmers, prompting a sharp reaction from the Indian government."Shocking scenes from Delhi," remarked MP from Britain, Preet Kaur Gill.Over 170,000 UK Sikh organisations, gurdwaras and human rights groups in a joint statement last week urged the government of India to consider the human impact of the agrarian crisis and act compassionately towards the protesters, many of whom are elderly.The farmers are protesting against the farm laws as they feel that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporate entities. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/voices-of-punjabi-diaspora-getting-shriller-for-farmers-187060

Please ask them," she concluded. The video comes days after Kangana engaged in a Twitter feud with Diljit, and alleged that the two Bollywood stars were "misleading and encouraging" the agitation.Mika Singh also reacted to Kangana's video. Asking her to ‘be humble’, he said in his post: “Dear Rab ne husn ditta maan nai kari da aakkdan di aag vich ainwey nai sadee da .

20-12-2020||Renu Sud Sinha||Yours, Gulzar||At 86, Gulzar has achieved almost everything in the field of words, but is still not ready to rest on his innumerable laurels. Driven by his love and passion for poetry, Gulzar was 76 when he started off on yet another uncharted path — to gather contemporary poetry in Indian languages in one volume. A decade later, what emerged was a labour of love and passion — 365 poems, a poem for every day of the year — reflecting the ethos of a nation born some 70 years ago.The book starts with verses of hope tinged with the rosy glow of freedom, but soon turns into disappointment of expectations not met. The feminist movement, emergence of Naxalites and their struggle, the trials and tribulations that Punjab went through — in short, it is the poetic journey of a nation and its testing times.‘A Poem A Day’ is a massive 968-page book ostensibly “for anyone who likes poetry and is interested in the use of words and language”, as the author’s note says in the beginning. However, as this child of Partition, growing up on classical poetry of undivided Punjab, experienced the turning and tossing of his era in the poetry of his times, he wanted the Indian youth of today to experience the joys of contemporary poetry so as to relate it to their times and not the verses of Tagore or Ghalib of bygone eras they read in their textbooks.So, the grand old man of letters waded through Indian regional poetry, literally from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, starting from 1947 to 2017, to sift through the works of contemporary poets rooted in their soil, (apni zameen se judey, as he says in his inimitable style), and translated most of them into Hindustani and English.Because language has no borders, there were also poets from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, all foreign lands now, as well as languages and dialects without scripts of their own, written in scripts of better-known languages.Poets from the land of his birthBorn in Jhelum district of undivided Punjab, Sampooran Singh Kalra may have been particularly fascinated by the poets and poetry of North-East, but was always connected with those from his own land despite moving to Bombay.Amrita Pritam and her Partition-based “Ajj Aakhan Waris Shah Nu” was an obvious choice, as were Shiv Kumar Batalvi, Paash, Sukhbir, alias Balbir Singh, Lal Singh Dil, Mohan Singh, Surjit Patar and Ustad Daman (Pakistan) among the contemporary names from Punjabi poetry.Many poets and writers, who could not find a place in the book due to space constraints, remain etched in his consciousness and he talks about them with much admiration — Navtej Singh, Harnam Singh Naz, Gurmel Pannu and S. Swarn.Timeline of a nationPoems written in all 34 languages since Independence have been included in a chronological order, capturing and reflecting the journey of a nascent nation through its evolution. It starts with verses of hope tinged with the rosy glow of freedom, but soon turns into disappointment of expectations not met. The feminist movement, emergence of Naxalites and their struggle, the trials and tribulations that Punjab went through — in short, it is the poetic journey of a nation and its testing times, through the eyes of the poets who spoke in the voice of masses, yet had a limited reach.The journeyThe hurdles were countless — lack of proper scripts, non-availability of translations and sometimes translators, even the English translations of Punjab’s most popular poet Shiv Kumar Batalvi were hard to come by. So what kept Gulzar going? A simple yet burning desire to bring to the young their poetic heritage.And who were the people who helped him traverse the path? He makes particular mention of Ananth Padmanabhan and Udayan Mitra from the publishing house for their support but at home, it was daughter Meghna who kept her “Papi”, as she fondly calls him, from burning the candle at both ends at the “young” age of 86.The indulgent father speaks of her and the women poets included in the book with much admiration. Shefali Debbarma, Mamang Dai, Mamta Kalia have found a special mention at various foras where he has talked about the book. And he refuses to bind their words within their gender, as he feels women, in their poetry, have achieved the equality they may not have found in reality.He also refuses to burden Meghna with the task of carrying forward his legacy, as he feels she has the capability to forge her own legacy and imprint. He fondly talks of her capacity for detailed research and hard work, her feminism — reflected in her works like ‘Filhaal’ and ‘Talvar’.A peek into the futureAfter this mammoth project of capturing the past, what’s on his mind? The confining months of lockdown may have provided a requisite pause but have also brought home the problems of the common man whom he lovingly calls “Murari Lal”. His troubles and struggles will feature in “Murari Lal ki Nazmein” in the coming months.The living legend is also mulling over publishing the leftover verses that could not be accommodated in this book — poems on universal emotions such as death or poems on the poem itself. His legions of fans await.The plight of migrant labourers plodding home during lockdown, hoping to escape the pandemic, hunger and misery, is reflected in this unpublished, untitled poem that Gulzar, who still writes in longhand Urdu, has shared with the readers of The Tribune:Mahamaari lagi theeGharon ko bhaag liye the sabhi mazdoor-karigarMachinein band hone lag gayin thee sareeUnhi se to haath-paaon chalte rehte theWarna zindagi to gaon mein hee bo ke aaye theArre, sagaayi, shaadiyaan, khalihaan, sookha, baadhHarr baar aasmaan barsenaa barseMarenge to wahin jaakar jahaan par zindagi haiYahaan to jism laakar plug lagaaye thePlug nikaale sabhi neChalo ab ghar chalein sabSab chal diyeMarenge to wahin jaakarJahaan par zindagi hai.I Have Seen This Scene Beforeby gulzarI have seen this scene beforeA whole army standing entrenchedWith guns on shoulders, ready to fireAnd, in front, a crowd of peopleWaving hands;Perhaps it is 1919, and AmritsarSomewhat like Jallianwala Bagh.Or maybe it is the scene of Lahore in 1936:The day of the freedom struggle’s annual assembly.So much in this scene seems to be familiarThe faces appear to be knownThe despondency and anger on their facesTheir ages, their emotionsAll of this, I am acquainted with.Maybe, it is 1942 in Allahabad:In a railed – off islandIn the centre of the town squareAn entire army in readinessLines drawn, their guns ready to fireAnd in front a mob of peopleWaving hands;Their fists clenchedThe same flag in their handsThe same slogans on their lipsThe bullets fired in the same waySome people dying as they died beforeBlood flowing the same way on this very street.My Mother and My Poemby surjit patarMy mother could not understandmy poemalthough it was written in mymother-tongue.She only gathered thatthere was some grief in her son’s mind.But wherefrom his grief camewhile I am here.My illiterate mother scanned my poem with great careand said to herself: look, people, lookthe sons whom we gave birth fromour wombstell their grief to the papers not to us.She took the page to her breast hopingperhaps it is the only wayof getting close to her son.Will Be Killedby rajesh joshiThose who not participate in thismadnessWill be killedThose who oppose, will be made to stand in the witness boxThose who speak the truthWill be killedIt will not be tolerated that someone else’s shirtBe whiter than ‘Their’ shirtThose wearing spotless shirtsWill be killedPushed away from the world of ArtWill be those who are not bardsThose who do not plodWill be killedFlying the flag of religionThose who do not participate in the rallyWill be shot brutallyWill be named atheistBiggest crime this time isTo be unarmed and to be innocentThose who are not criminalsWill be killed.Alibiby ranjit hoskoteWipe your fingerprints from the air,rinse out the mug from which you dranklast night’s coffee.Clear the view in the windowwith a sweep of plush curtainthat takes cloud, sky and mountain with it.Cut the photograph from the frame,grab the red hair-band from the onyx jar,the spectacles from the desk.Cover your tracks.Walk through water.You were never here.(Written originally in English)Rainby ramakanta rathAs I was about to go outto meet youit rained.How could I,dripping with water,meet you?

Even the local police were not informed or taken into confidence, as is the normal procedure, and instead, the CRPF was used to provide security during the I-T raids, he pointed out.“What is this if not a clear case of vendetta politics by the Centre, which is hell-bent on demolishing the farmers’ protest by hook or by crook?” asked the Chief Minister.The night-long raids were conducted in the presence of two bus-loads of CRPF personnel at the premises of Vijay Kalra (president, Punjab Arhtiya Association), Pawan Kumar Goyal (president, Samana Mandi), Jaswinder Singh Rana, Manjinder Singh Walia, Hardeep Singh Ladda and Kartar Singh & Amrik Singh (arhtiyas, Rajpura). A total of 14 arhtiyas across Punjab have received notices from the I-T Department.Captain Amarinder observed that this was not the first instance of misuse of an agency by the Central Government to browbeat dissidents into succumbing to its writ and diktats. “These bullying actions of the government do not augur well for the world’s largest democracy,” he added.Pointing out that even the Supreme Court had upheld the people’s right to protest peacefully, the Chief Minister said the Centre’s actions amounted to gross violation of the apex court’s directions and the spirit of the Constitution, which granted every citizen the right to raise his voice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-intimidating-arhtiyas-capt-186792

However, the move won’t succeed this time around, he maintained.Mann said corrupt and weak leaders, the likes of Narendra Modi, Capt Amarinder Singh and Prakash Singh Badal, could be cowed down or intimidated by the central agencies, like the ED and CBI, but this manipulation of the Central Government would not scare away the labourers, ‘arhtiyas’, traders and others who stood rock solid behind the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/traders-targeted-for-backing-protest-aap-186794

I wish the protesting farmers had seen the Acts for themselves, instead of getting misled by the Opposition.Are Punjab politicians also not responsible for the escalation of the crisis?The Congress government fanned and supported the initial voices of resentment and gave it the shape of a state-wide campaign. SAD, whose leaders were all along part of the process of making the Bills, ran away from the alliance and added fuel to the fire.What about the BJP?We have been making all efforts to make farmers understand the true spirit of the Acts, which was to empower them and help double their income.The amendments being offered by the Centre virtually rewrite the Acts. Why doesn’t it simply repeal them and end the stir?The proposed amendments are meant to reassure farmers that the Centre will always protect their interests. There is nothing wrong in the agriculture Acts.Do you think the current situation will affect the BJP’s position in the state?The BJP has been contesting elections in Punjab since 1952. In 1992, when it contested alone, it polled 16.7 per cent votes and won six seats. It is a firmly rooted party in the state and our base is expanding.

The members of Cycling Group, Mansa, have pooled in money to purchase these items and also bore transportation cost on their own. According to the group members, water heaters would keep the protesting farmers “alive and kicking” amid biting cold. Talking to The Tribune, group president Balwinder Singh Kaka said: “It is indeed a brave decision by our farmer brothers to continue their agitation against the new farm laws. So, to provide them some relief from the biting cold, we decided to provide them water heaters and washing machines — the two basic requirements. Hot water would keep them warm and going. We have sent 50 wood-fired water heaters, five washing machines and two trucks loaded with around one quintal wood each to the Tikri border.” Singh added: “Over 200 members contributed to the cause with a major share of contribution coming from Gagandeep Singh. Now at Tikri border, we are busy distributing these items as per requirement. Anybody who requires these items at the protest site can contact on 62800-55146.” Meanwhile, a leader of Samvidhan Bachao Manch, Gurlabh Singh Mahal, exhorted more support from NRIs and those within the country to the protest site at Tikri border where concentration of protesting farmers (Malwa districts) is comparatively more. Mahal said: “A large number of farmers from Malwa districts have reached the Tikri border to take part in the ongoing agitation and hundreds of them are moving to the protest site on a daily basis so it is important that resources, philanthropic activities or any help coming both from NRIs from Doaba and Majha region and other parts of the country are diverted to the Tikri border.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/water-heaters-firewood-for-tikri-protesters-to-fight-chill-186800

Though not many police officers are interested in assignments like this, Koshy Koshy headed the Haryana Police Academy (HPA) and also worked as IG (Training) for long. He believed that police training was very important for inculcating the right kind of behavioural practices among police personnel,” said Manoj Yadava, Director General of Police, Haryana, who has worked with Koshy Koshy for long.Yadava remembers how immaculately Koshy Koshy managed the mega AICC session at Surajkund as DIG of Gurugram range when the then PM PV Narasimha Rao and a plethora of dignitaries were to camp there for three days.He loved watching birds and taking their pictures.Koshy Koshy will also be remembered for authoring Punjab Police Rules 1934 with explanations and annotations.The book is referred to by all police officers in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Dr Hanif Qureshi, a senior IPS officer of Haryana who is now posted as Director General of New and Renewable Energy Department, Haryana, remembers that when happened to visit Lahore (Pakistan) as an advance party for then Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala’s visit, he was surprised to find Koshy Koshy’s book on Punjab Police Rules 1934 lying on the table of DIG, Lahore.“When I asked him that do you refer to Koshy Koshy’s book, the officer asked me with pleasant surprise whether I knew the author personally. He told me that all police officers in Pakistan’s Punjab referred to this book only for clarity on police rules,” said Qureshi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/his-rule-book-guided-cops-across-british-punjab-186727

Terming the raids as a pressure tactic to curb arhtiyas’ democratic rights and freedom, he said such oppressive actions would backfire against the BJP.Arhtiyas claimed the premises of their five union leaders were raided in Patiala, Nawanshahr and Ferozepur districts. In Patiala district, raids were conducted at Bhunerheri, Samana and Rajpura.Premises belonging to Punjab Arhtiyas Association president Vijay Kalra, Samana Mandi unit chief Pawan Kumar Goyal, Patiala unit chief Jaswinder Singh Rana, Nawanshahr unit chief Manjinder Singh Walia, Rajpura unit chief Hardeep Singh Ladda and Rajpura arhtiyas Kartar Singh and Amrik Singh were raided by Income Tax Department officials. Fourteen arhtiyas have received income tax notices across the state so far. The arhtiyas have announced to shut grain markets across the state for an indefinite period.Ravinder Singh Cheema, president of the Arhtiyas Association, Punjab, said the raids were aimed at silencing arhtiyas’ voice against farm laws and to create fear.“The Centre is targeting arhtiyas who support protesting farmers.

Similarly, the dismissal of a government employee cannot be automatic merely on the registration of an FIR against him/her,” the affidavit adds.

They broke the barricades and reached the dharna site.The farmers raised anti-government slogans and tried to gherao the BJP workers, including district party president Baldev Groha. The police, however, managed to rescue the party workers. They were whisked away in a vehicle and dropped at the party office, where they continued their fast.Praveen Jorha, OBC Morcha’s executive member of the BJP, said those who disrupted the dharna were activists of the Congress and the Left.A police spokesperson said that on a complaint from a BJP worker, a case of assault and misbehaviour had been registered.In Jagadhri, BKU activists protested against the BJP, which, they claimed, was dividing farmers by sitting on a fast demanding state’s share of the SYL waters.BJP leaders and workers staged a dharna and sat on fast at the gate of the new grain market, Jagadhri, demanding Haryana’s share of the SYL waters.Farmer leader Arjun Sudhail said, “The BJP is playing divisive politics. If the Haryana Government is concerned about farmers, we have one question for it: why did the government close the Dadupur-Nalvi canal by de-notifying the Dadupur-Nalvi Irrigation Scheme, which was useful for farmers of Yamunanagar, Ambala and Kurukshetra districts?”In Jind district, a group of about 15 women who were part of the BJP’s dharna said they knew nothing about the SYL issue and came to the dharna to demand the release of pending grants under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.In Charkhi Dadri, farmers disrupted the BJP’s dharna and termed it a “joke”.The dharna, however, passed off peacefully in Hisar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-disrupt-bjps-dharna-on-sutlej-yamuna-link-canal-186707
