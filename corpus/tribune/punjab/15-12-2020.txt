The convention makes it clear that a Judge being transferred to another High Court has to be senior to the ones there.Known for his proficiency in bringing justice closer to people through computerisation, Justice Bindal only about a week back was instrumental in launching of a unique project, in which the post offices in Jammu and Kashmir help in delivering justice.

Farmers say they will not climb down from that demand.   “Government is saying they won't repeal these laws, we are saying we will make you do it,” a union leader Jagjeet Dallewal said. “We are not running away from negotiation, but government has to pay heed to our demands and come forward with concrete proposals,” another union leader said.They are determined to go on until their demands are met, the leaders said.“The fight has reached a stage where we are determined to win it no matter what,” they said.The unions have also decided to hold ‘shradhanjali’ (dedication) to the 20 protesters who have died since their protests began. This shrandhanjali will be given in every village across the country on December 20, some leaders said.“Around 20 farmers become 'shaheed' during protest so far. On an average, one farmer has died every day since protest started,” leaders said.“People across villages and blocks to pay tribute on December 20 to farmers who lost their lives during agitation,” a leader, Inderjeet, told the press. --- With PTI

15-12-2020||Vishav Bharti||No Maoist connection, strictly a farmers’ agitation: Ugrahan||Tribune News ServiceTikri, December 14Seated inside a cowshed in Tikri, the epicentre of farmers’ protest against the central agri laws, Joginder Singh Ugrahan points towards a pile of green-yellow flex boards lying at a corner as he rebuts the allegations labelling him an “anti-national”.The flex boards carry the pictures of poets, writers and scholars jailed for alleged Maoist links. “We don’t have any Maoist link. Our fight is against the black central legislations. If raising voice for the farmers is anti-national, I won’t mind being called one,” says the 75-year-old soldier-turned-farmer and the president of BKU (Ugrahan), Punjab’s biggest farmer union.Edit: Stop the name-callingUgrahan and thousands of his supporters were labelled “Maoists” in social media posts after hoardings supporting the jailed activists surfaced at a protest recently.“It’s not the first time we have raised voice for these jailed activists. Posters seeking their release were installed at toll plazas too over the past two months. All the 32 farmer unions are supporting this demand… Punjab has a rich tradition of speaking against injustice. We protested against the NRC as well,” he maintains.Busy charting future course with other leaders at the ‘gaushala’, three rooms of which have been turned into his union’s headquarters, Ugrahan says, “We run our office from a ‘gaushala’. They may find some Maoist link in this (cowshed) too.”Pointing towards another union leader, Shingara Singh Maan, he claims all their actions in the past over three decades have been for the betterment of farmers.“It’s the easiest way to get rid of the protesters. Call them anti-national to change public discourse! How can ‘annadata’, who feeds the nation, go against the nation? The ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ slogan seems to have been long forgotten,” he says. Ugrahan says though their struggle is solely against the three laws, the government fears that the “struggle that started with the farmers may definitely not end only with the farmers”. The BKU (Ugrahan), meanwhile, has expressed willingness to join the ‘Sanjha Kisan Morcha’ that represents 32 farm outfits. “We are ready to join them unconditionally. We (various unions) may have differences on some issues, but these cannot be bigger than the common cause of farmers,” says Joginder Singh Ugrahan.

In the coming days, he will also meet everyone physically. Naxals and Leftists are running the present agitation by misguiding our farmers.

Is Harsimrat Kaur Badal who resigned from the Union Ministry in protest against the three agricultural laws a desh drohi? Can anyone term Parkash Singh Badal, who returned his Padma Vibhushan in solidarity with farmers, a desh drohi?” he asked.Referring to the ongoing “democratic movement” of farmers, Sukhbir said the SAD fully backed the farmers’ demand for the repeal of the farm Acts. “The government must not stand on prestige and must understand that these Acts are a threat to their survival,” he said. Harsimrat said she had forewarned that no laws should be finalised without taking into account the concerns of farmers. “It was shocking that the suffering of farmers and their families in biting cold had not moved the heart of the Centre,” she said.SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia took a dig at BJP’s leaders who were claiming China and Pakistan’s hand in the farmer protest. “Ironically, when it comes to sacrifices and contributions for the country, we are deemed the best, but when we challenge their decision, they paint us anti-national, hooligan and even terrorists,” he said. — TNS

Farmers say they will not climb down from that demand.   “Government is saying they won't repeal these laws, we are saying we will make you do it,” a union leader Jagjeet Dallewal said. “We are not running away from negotiation, but government has to pay heed to our demands and come forward with concrete proposals,” another union leader said.They are determined to go on until their demands are met, the leaders said.“The fight has reached a stage where we are determined to win it no matter what,” they said.The unions have also decided to hold ‘shradhanjali’ (dedication) to the 20 protesters who have died since their protests began. This shrandhanjali will be given in every village across the country on December 20, some leaders said.“Around 20 farmers become 'shaheed' during protest so far. On an average, one farmer has died every day since protest started,” leaders said.“People across villages and blocks to pay tribute on December 20 to farmers who lost their lives during agitation,” a leader, Inderjeet, told the press. --- With PTI

15-12-2020||Vishav Bharti||No Maoist connection, strictly a farmers’ agitation: Ugrahan||Tribune News ServiceTikri, December 14Seated inside a cowshed in Tikri, the epicentre of farmers’ protest against the central agri laws, Joginder Singh Ugrahan points towards a pile of green-yellow flex boards lying at a corner as he rebuts the allegations labelling him an “anti-national”.The flex boards carry the pictures of poets, writers and scholars jailed for alleged Maoist links. “We don’t have any Maoist link. Our fight is against the black central legislations. If raising voice for the farmers is anti-national, I won’t mind being called one,” says the 75-year-old soldier-turned-farmer and the president of BKU (Ugrahan), Punjab’s biggest farmer union.Edit: Stop the name-callingUgrahan and thousands of his supporters were labelled “Maoists” in social media posts after hoardings supporting the jailed activists surfaced at a protest recently.“It’s not the first time we have raised voice for these jailed activists. Posters seeking their release were installed at toll plazas too over the past two months. All the 32 farmer unions are supporting this demand… Punjab has a rich tradition of speaking against injustice. We protested against the NRC as well,” he maintains.Busy charting future course with other leaders at the ‘gaushala’, three rooms of which have been turned into his union’s headquarters, Ugrahan says, “We run our office from a ‘gaushala’. They may find some Maoist link in this (cowshed) too.”Pointing towards another union leader, Shingara Singh Maan, he claims all their actions in the past over three decades have been for the betterment of farmers.“It’s the easiest way to get rid of the protesters. Call them anti-national to change public discourse! How can ‘annadata’, who feeds the nation, go against the nation? The ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ slogan seems to have been long forgotten,” he says. Ugrahan says though their struggle is solely against the three laws, the government fears that the “struggle that started with the farmers may definitely not end only with the farmers”. The BKU (Ugrahan), meanwhile, has expressed willingness to join the ‘Sanjha Kisan Morcha’ that represents 32 farm outfits. “We are ready to join them unconditionally. We (various unions) may have differences on some issues, but these cannot be bigger than the common cause of farmers,” says Joginder Singh Ugrahan.

It is calling farmers by different names, but we won’t let that happen. We have always fought for farmers and will do it in future as well.”Sunil Jakhar, president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, said there was a sinister attempt by Union Ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Hardeep Puri to defame the protesting farmers. “They shouldn’t forget that we come from the land of revolutions. It was disheartening to see Hardeep Puri saying that hooliganism was happening in name of protest,” he said.Amrinder Raj Warring, Congress MLA from Gidderbaha, said the state government should make some amendments in the laws to provide a government job and financial assistance of at least Rs 10 lakh to the family members of farmers who died during the protest.

Dr Rinwa said Jyani should quit the BJP and join the farmers’ protest as he being a head of the BJP coordination committee, Punjab, has failed to get the issue resolved. OCReacting sharply to the meeting, Punjab farmers said that the BJP was still blind to the plight of lakhs of farmers and their families who are sitting on New Delhi borders for the rollback of the “black” laws.During the meeting, discussions also took place to prepare for the forthcoming municipal elections as many BJP leaders are apprehensive that their social boycott, being demanded by their political opponents, will create serious problems for them.“Today, our Punjab in charge took the first virtual meeting. In the coming days, he will also meet everyone physically. Naxals and Leftists are running the present agitation by misguiding our farmers. We have accepted all demands like MSP, but anti-national forces are not allowing farmers to end their agitation. Our workers will intensify their efforts to share the details of laws to convince the farmers,” said Jiwan Gupta, BJP state general secretary.Apart from 15-20 top leaders of the BJP from each district, state party president Ashwani Sharma; Dinesh Kumar, sanghthan mantra, Punjab; and Subhash Sharma, general secretary of Punjab, also attended the virtual meeting.

Is Harsimrat Kaur Badal who resigned from the Union Ministry in protest against the three agricultural laws a desh drohi? Can anyone term Parkash Singh Badal, who returned his Padma Vibhushan in solidarity with farmers, a desh drohi?” he asked.Referring to the ongoing “democratic movement” of farmers, Sukhbir said the SAD fully backed the farmers’ demand for the repeal of the farm Acts. “The government must not stand on prestige and must understand that these Acts are a threat to their survival,” he said. Harsimrat said she had forewarned that no laws should be finalised without taking into account the concerns of farmers. “It was shocking that the suffering of farmers and their families in biting cold had not moved the heart of the Centre,” she said.SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia took a dig at BJP’s leaders who were claiming China and Pakistan’s hand in the farmer protest. “Ironically, when it comes to sacrifices and contributions for the country, we are deemed the best, but when we challenge their decision, they paint us anti-national, hooligan and even terrorists,” he said. — TNS

Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU, Dakaunda, said students, traders, litterateur and government employees across the state had joined their protest.“People raised their voice in unison, demanding that the government immediately repeal the three farm laws.

Unmindful of the purpose and outcome of the farmers’ agitation, he is busy collecting 35-40 kg of empty water bottles daily against 5 kg to 6 kg till recently at the Singhu border. His daily earnings have also more than doubled in the last fortnight. Picking up an empty bottle at one of the protest sites, he asks a protesting farmer: “Sardarji aap kitne din rahoge”.With more and more farmers from Punjab joining the protest by the day, locals are calling Singhu border the ‘Singh border’. The prolonged farmers’ agitation is only strengthening the relation of dependency and trust between the guest (read farmers) and the locals.A few kilometres away near TDI Mall, Sonepat, a gurdwara committee from Doaba has hired local women to cook chapattis. “We are paying each cook Rs 300 per day. As the number of farmers arriving daily swells, we might have to hire more cooks”, says Shingara Singh, who is instrumental in organising ration for the community kitchen.The selfless service of offering blankets, mattresses and a wide range of eatables is attracting a lot of locals, especially children, from nearby areas in large numbers. Sahib Singh of Baje Chak village in Gurdaspur says: “For the first few days, locals were wary of us. Dark memories of Jatt Andolan fresh in their mind, shopkeepers downed their shutter. But soon, the perception changed.”Locals are now allowing the farmers to use their facilities. A cellphone shop owner here is offering WiFi facility for free as jammers installed by the Haryana Police prevent free access to mobile data. Amused by “dharna and celebrations” going together, locals are asking farmers “Sardarji agle sal kab aayoge.”

The group has already distributed over 2,000 turbans. Tejinder Singh (36), founder of the bank said, “For Sikhs, turban is an identity, a symbol of spirituality, pride and honour. A Sikh can give up his life for his turban. It is a symbol of unity and integrity for the community. Hence, we are receiving an overwhelming response.”Harwinder Singh and Satwant Singh, Jalandhar-based turban bank members, are also in demand at the borders for their turban-tying skills. Harwinder said: “Besides easy methods, we teach how to tie Patiala Sahi, Amritsar Sahi, Morni and Parna turbans.” Interestingly, farmers from Haryana, UP and Rajasthan at the protest sites are equally taking interest in proudly flaunting a turban around their head.

According to the police, he is currently in Australia and allegedly running a high-profile drug racket from there.

Party national general secretary Kushalpal Singh Mann said the SAD, led by the Badal family, had no right to celebrate 100 years of the Akali Dal as it had caused much damage to the soul and spirit of the party. It also criticised the Badals for supporting the farm laws initially. TNSGiving a push for federal structure in the country, Sukhbir declared that the SAD intended to work in tandem with the like-minded regional and national parties in this direction.Pointing out the alarming crisis following the ‘anti-farm laws’, he said the BJP-led Centre had not followed a federal approach through consultation and consensus and the agrarian crisis was the outcome of ill-advised and dictatorial tendencies. “The genuine federal structure was an ultimate and durable quotient against the social, political and economic crisis and the SAD will coordinate with like-minded parties to ensure establishment of a welfare state, a vision handed down to us by our Gurus,” he said.Releasing the mission statement of theSAD, Sukhbir emphasisedthe commitment toPanthic ideals and values as the top priority.In its centenary year, the SAD finds itself in disarray, desperately trying to regain a foothold in its home turf of Punjab following a series of sacrilege, flip-flops over exonerating the Dera Sirsa chief and lately, misappropriation of 328 ‘saroops’ from the possession of the SGPC.The SAD was founded on December 14, 1920, by the Sikhs. The party was at the forefront of securing federal rights for the states and standing up for the minorities. Considering itself as the principal representative of Sikh Panth, the aim was to free gurdwaras from ‘mahants’ and establish supremacy of the SGPC. That goal was achieved which led to the constitution of the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925.In 1966, the present Punjab was formed. The party came to power in the new Punjab in March 1967. It allied with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, BJP’s predecessor, for the first time during the Punjab Assembly elections in 1969. It formed a coalition with the BJP again in 1997 during the state elections. At the Centre, however, the SAD joined the BJP-led coalition in 1998.With the BJP at the Centre, tension and pressure brewed up with SAD’s stand on the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register. Recently, the SAD walked out of the alliance over the three farm laws.

15-12-2020||Sangrur||100-yr-old Sangrur hospital building picture of neglect||The old building of the Sangrur Civil Hospital completed 100 years on Sunday, but there is nothing to celebrate as it is in a shambles. Locals alleged the authorities wanted to dismantle the building to handover the hospital land to the Homi Bhaba Cancer Hospital (HBCH) authorities. The foundation stone of the building was laid on February 21, 1914.“Some influential leaders of the ruling party are deliberately helping in the expansion of HBCH, Sangrur, which is a unit of the Tata Memorial Centre being run under the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India. The cancer hospital receives very few patients from the city. Locals need the Civil Hospital. Recently, there was an attempt to demolish the old building, but after we opposed, the authorities stopped it,” said advocate Dasvir Singh Dalee.He has written to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and sought a high-level inquiry into the “systematic destruction of the Civil Hospital”. On February 24, the Health and Family Welfare Department had notified the building as a 200-bed hospital with immediate effect, but it still functions with 100 beds. However, Senior Medical Officer (SMO) of Sangrur Civil Hospital Dr Baljeet Singh said Covid management had delayed the work on increasing the beds.“After the notification, we had sent a detailed report about requirements like staff, building and other infrastructure. Our seniors are trying their level best, but Covid has delayed everything,” he said.Sangrur Civil Surgeon Dr Raj Kumar said the expansion of the HBCH was allowed as per the decision of the authorities. “The renovation of the old building, which has completed its 100 years, will start soon. We are following the directions about the expansion of the HBCH,” he said.
