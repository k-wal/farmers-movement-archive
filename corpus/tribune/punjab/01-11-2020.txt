01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab reports 3,560 stubble burning incidents on Sunday, highest in Sangrur||Punjab on Sunday reported 3,560 incidents of stubble burning, with the highest number of farm fires recorded in Sangrur district at 593, despite the state government banning the practice to curb air pollution.The overall count of incidents of stubble burning in the state during this paddy season so far—from September 21 till November 1 -- has reached 33,165, which is about 34 per cent more than the farm fire incidents witnessed in the corresponding period of last year, according to data of the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre.The state had recorded 24,722 stubble or crop residue burning incidents in the corresponding period of last year.Sangrur, Ferozepur and Bathinda districts reported 593, 375 and 373 incidents of farm fire in a single day, the data stated, adding that among other districts, Muktsar, Ludhiana, Patiala and Mansa reported 276, 267, 254 and 247 straw burning incidents respectively.Small farmers are of the view that it is economically unviable for them to buy farm machinery like happy seeders, rotavators, super straw management systems on combine harvesters to manage crop residue.Farmers are demanding Rs 200 per quintal of bonus on paddy and Rs 6,000 per acre for stubble management.The Punjab government has been seeking from the Centre Rs 100 per quintal as compensation to enable farmers to manage paddy straw without burning it.Every year, Punjab and Haryana are blamed for rising air pollution and smog due to crop residue burning by farmers. Punjab alone generates 20 million tonnes of paddy stubble annually.The Punjab government on Sunday claimed that the state’s air quality index (AQI) fared a lot better than that of neighbouring Haryana and Delhi.The pollution in Delhi, especially in the months of October till December, has been increasingly blamed on the fires put to the paddy residues in the fields of north Indian states, specifically Punjab, said a government release here.However, comparison of data collected by the air quality monitoring stations revealed that in months of August and September (2018-2020), the average AQI of Punjab remained within 50 to 87 whereas in Delhi, the average AQI during the same period remained from 63 to 118, the release claimed.In Haryana, stations near Delhi (2019-2020) and Faridabad for the same period in 2020, the average AQI ranged from 67 to 115, it said.With the start of harvesting and stubble burning season in the month of October (2018-2020), the AQI in the cities of Punjab ranges from 116 to 153, the release said.At the same time, locations in Haryana near Delhi (2019-2020) and Faridabad (2020) for the same period, the average AQI ranged from 203 to 245 and the AQI of Delhi during this period ranges from 234 to 269, it said.An AQI between 0-50 is considered “good”, 51-100 “satisfactory”, 101-200 “moderate”, 201-300 “poor”, 301-400 “very poor”, and 401-500 “severe”. Above 500 is “severe-plus or emergency” category. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-reports-3-560-stubble-burning-incidents-on-sunday-highest-in-sangrur-164460

Kejriwal has always adopted double standards on this issue and is known to speak one thing in Delhi and another in Punjab,” he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1984-riots-delay-in-prosecution-of-tytler-kamal-nath-unfortunate-says-sukhbir-badal-164437

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM writes to Nadda over suspension of goods trains||Expressing concern over the continued suspension of goods trains even after easing of the blockade by farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday wrote an open letter to BJP national president J.P. Nadda, calling for “collective will and statesmanship to resolve the festering imbroglio that could have dangerous consequences not just for the state but the entire nation”.Responding with pain and anguish to several recent statements and comments of various BJP national and Punjab leaders on the farmers’ protests, particularly the continued suspension of goods trains by the railways, the Chief Minister stressed that “this was neither the time nor the occasion to indulge in political confrontation or allegations or counter allegations”.“What is needed at this critical moment is for all of us to put aside any temptations we may be harbouring to promote our political interests,” he said, adding that it is, on the contrary, “time for all of us to rise above political considerations and to respond as statesmen, to a situation that threatens to spiral irrevocable out of control, if immediate steps are not taken to stem the tide”.Citing the repercussions of the continued suspension of goods trains services would have for national security, in addition to the critical shortages faced not just by Punjab but also Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh, the Chief Minister warned that the armed forces were likely to be badly affected with the onset of winter, as they could run out of supplies and other requisites once the snowfall blocks the roads to Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley.“These are dangers that neither the Central government nor any political party, including the BJP, can choose to ignore,” he said, adding “the onus lies on all of us. We need to all liaise together, with the common goal of solving  the contentious issue, in the interest of the country”.Referring to the losses caused in Punjab due to the prolonged blockade, Amarinder Singh said every day of the continued suspension of goods trains meant critical losses to the industry, agriculture and overall economy, in view  of critical shortages of power, urea and DAP stocks.As for the consequences for the national security, he noted that if the armed forces are deprived of critical supplies, amid the increasingly aggressive overtures from both China and Pakistan, the situation could become extremely dangerous for the country.Even Punjab could become more vulnerable to security threats from Pakistan, if the current crisis around the farmers is not resolved at the earliest, he warned, noting that ISI-backed terror groups were perpetually looking at exploiting any unrest in Punjab.The Chief Minister termed as distressing recent remarks of various BJP leaders to the prevailing crisis situation, taking specific note of the statements of BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh and Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma.The Chief Minister expressed surprise over the reason of “uncertainty and safety of train operations’ cited by the Railways to not allow goods trains’ movement through Punjab despite the easing of blockade by farmers. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-writes-to-nadda-over-suspension-of-goods-trains-164410

01-11-2020||---||Punjab farmers might face shortage of fertilisers in coming days||Sukhmeet BhasinTribune News ServiceBathinda, November 1Farmers in Punjab might face shortage of fertilisers in coming days, as after the “rail roko” agitation by the farmers against the three farm laws the Union government has stopped the movement of good trains to the state.In the state, there is shortage of 10 lakh tonne urea fertiliser and there is requirement of 4 lakh tonne DAP more as well. Three good trains filled with fertiliser for the Malwa region in Punjab are lying stuck in other states.After the harvesting of paddy, the sowing of wheat would pick up pace in the region and farmers would require DAP as well urea fertiliser.Sensing shortage of fertilisers, farmers in villages in the region have started purchasing it from cooperative societies and traders in large quantities.It is learnt from the sources that three good trains with fertilisers which are stuck in other states were to reach and deliver fertilisers at Rampura railway station in Bathinda, Mansa and Kotkapura in Faridkot district in the region, but  now it is not clear that when these trains would reach their respective destinations.However, agriculture department officials claim that the department has fertilisers kept in their stock, with which farmers would be able to start the sowing of wheat in the region.They also claim that this year it is expected that wheat would be sown in 15 lakh hectare area in the state, so 5.50 lakh tonne DAP and 15 lakh tonne urea would be required.Good trains are not running in Punjab and still it is not clear when these trains would start, due to which it seems that not only in the Malwa region, but farmers in the entire state would face shortage of fertilisers in coming days.Agricultural department has urged farmers to sow wheat from November 1 to 15, due to which in the next few days the sowing of wheat would pick up pace. Agriculture experts claim that if fertiliser rakes did not reach within a week, farmers would face shortage of fertilisers.BKU Ekta Urgahan state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said: “It’s arm twisting tactic of the Union government to affect the farmers by stopping the good trains carrying fertilisers and coal and it is a bid to suppress their protest as all tracks are free in the state, but Union government has deliberately stopped the movement of good trains in Punjab, which is wrong. We are ready to give befitting reply to them.”Lashing out at the state government, Mann said they are working on the Union government directions as they should strongly write to the Prime Minister or Centre to start movement of fertilisers and coal in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-might-face-shortage-of-fertilisers-in-coming-days-164400
01-11-2020||Raipur||New farms laws will weaken nation's foundation: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the three new farm laws enacted by the Centre will "weaken" the foundation of the nation, and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider the laws in the interest of farmers.Virtually addressing the Chhattisgarh statehood day celebrations, Gandhi hailed a scheme launched by the state government to set English medium schools in all districts, saying the language provides a global opportunity to youth.The function to celebrate the statehood of Chhattisgarh, which came into existence on November 1, 2000 after being carved out of Madhya Pradesh, was held at Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghels official residence here. Gandhi said the country has been witnessing a tough phase due to COVID-19 outbreak. In such a situation, the weakest sections like farmers, labourers, small businessmen, mothers, sisters and youth are the worst-affected."The condition of farmers in the country is known to everyone. We read news of farmer suicides every day. In a way, it is happening on such a scale that the country has accepted it," he said."But we should not accept it. We should protect farmers, labourers and small businessmen and stand with them," the former Congress president said.Farmers and labourers are the foundation of the country. Villages are the foundation of cities while farmers and labourers are the foundation of villages, he said."If we weaken the foundation - the farmers and the labourers - then the entire structure will weaken. When we protect farmers and labourers, we are not only protecting them but also safeguarding our nation and its future," Gandhi said."Similarly, youth and children are the foundation of our future. If we do not give opportunity to them, then we will be weakening the future of the nation," he added.Referring to the farm laws enacted by the central government, Gandhi said, "I am pained that farmers in the country are being attacked."He noted that recently during an election rally in Bihar, he said mandi (farm produce markets) and minimum support price (MSP) hold a great significance and these ensure protection to the interests of farmers and labourers."I accept that there can be lacunae in mandi, MSP and procurement systems, but if we destroy the entire system, like it was done in Bihar in 2006, then the countrys foundation will be destroyed. Therefore, we have been fighting against the three new central farm laws, he said.Gandhi also said he had asked the prime minister to reconsider these laws and strengthen the mandi system."If there are less number of Mandis, then increase it, and if there are flaws in the MSP, then rectify it, but dont destroy the entire system."I am confident that the PM will reconsider the three laws in view of the sentiments of farmers as these laws will weaken the countrys foundation," Gandhi said.On the occasion, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel released the third installment of cash benefit under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna to 18.38 lakh farmers in the state.Baghel also launched the Swami Atmanand Government English Medium School scheme, aimed at providing education in the English language to students across the state.The CM also dedicated mobile hospital-cum-laboratories in 30 urban slum areas under the Chief Minister Urban Slum Health Scheme.Hailing the schemes, Gandhi said, "Many people will think what will happen if English medium schools are started.But the English language provides a global opportunity to youth. Hindi and our local languages have their own place. But English language gives global opportunities." "The poor people should get this opportunity. We believe the sons of farmers and labourers should getbig opportunities," he said.Lauding the initiatives taken up by the Baghel government, he said, "Chhattisgarh has set an example for the entire nation in terms of welfare initiatives for farmers, labourers and youths. The state government has been working with a new vision." PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/new-farms-laws-will-weaken-nations-foundation-rahul-gandhi-164382

In order to avoid harassment in the matters involving civil disputes, it is the need of the hour that the police department at the appropriate level looks into the process of registering FIRs, especially in matters having tone of a civil dispute,” Justice Avneesh Jhingan asserted.The direction by Justice Jhingan came after the Bench took cognisance of the prevailing tendency to paint civil disputes as criminal acts. As of now, 6,21,162 cases are pending before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Of the total, the number of pending criminal cases is 2,53,808. Though the exact number of cases with criminal complexion having civil overtone is hard to compute, it is believed that the figure is substantive.Justice Jhingan asserted the endeavour was to somehow wriggle the other party in the criminal proceedings for applying pressure to settle the issue. The alternative route adopted was considered to be a shortcut to civil litigation.Justice Jhingan said such tendencies had been deprecated by the apex court. The distinction between the civil dispute and criminal proceeding was no longer res integra or a case or a question that had not been examined. In fact, various apex court judgments had dealt with the issue. “Without making any further comments, it is expected that the matter would be looked into and necessary steps would be taken,” Justice Jhingan asserted. The matter was brought to the HC’s notice after an accused filed an anticipatory bail plea in a cheating and criminal breach of trust case registered on February 21 under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC.The Bench was told that an agreement to sell was entered for a property, which was subjudice and the complainant was been deprived of his money. Allowing the plea, Justice Jhingan asserted the matter had traits of a civil dispute.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-lodge-firs-in-civil-disputes-high-court-164112

They are saying that the state government must pay them the previous balance of Rs 1,850 crore due for the last three academic sessions before proceeding with the new scheme.Congress leader and chairperson of the Confederation of Colleges and Schools of Punjab Ashwani Sekhri said, “All colleges want their pending dues to be cleared first before getting any new scheme started. We may call a meeting on the issue tomorrow and day after and will take a final call after getting opinion from all members. A final call will be taken after the meeting.”There is confusion whether the scheme will be extended from the ongoing admission session 2020-21 or 2021-22. College principals are saying that they have been hearing varied versions on the issue and there was no clarity on the matter even till its launch today.“If it gets implemented from the next session, we will not be in a position to accommodate Dalit students whom we have given free, provisional admission this year,” said a principal of a college in Jalandhar.Ironically, the scheme got launched on the day when most universities, including Guru Nanak Dev University, have officially closed their admission for most UG courses. The colleges have been demanding that if the scheme is for the current year, universities should extend the date of admission and allow more SC students to avail the benefit. An extension in the date of admission will be in line with the UGC guidelines to keep admissions going till November 18.College principals are also seeking clarity on the 60:40 fee sharing clause. They are saying if this sharing is to be done on government standardised fee, it might not be workable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unpaid-dues-colleges-may-not-implement-scholarship-scheme-164098
