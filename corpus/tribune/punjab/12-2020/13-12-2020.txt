13-12-2020||New Delhi||Homemaker, farmworker and now protester, hundreds of women join farmers' agitation||They have long juggled the demands of field and family, making sure both are tended to, and now hundreds of women from Haryana and Punjab have added another dimension to their busy lives ‚Äì the protest grounds at the various gateways into Delhi.As their husbands, sons and brothers leave home to demand a rollback of the Centre's new agri laws, many women are joining them too, making the trip from the village towards the national capital even if for only a few days at a time.¬†For these women, who describe themselves as homemakers, farmworkers and protesters all rolled into one, any suggestion that farmers are about being alpha males because it requires physical labour is met with scorn. ¬†"The profession of farming is not defined by gender. Our fields don't produce crops differently if tended by women and men. Many male farmers are here protesting. Why should we sit at home?" asked 53-year-old Mandeep Kaur, a farmer from Ludhiana who refuses to be stereotyped into any one role.Mandeep took a bus to the Singhu border, a major protest site of the farmers' agitation that has been going for more than two weeks, spent a night and returned home.¬†‚ÄúBut I will be back,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe have to look after both our homes as well as our fight. I watered the fields before I came here. It will sustain the land until I return home.‚Äù While the men have been camping at the Tikri and Singhu border, the main access point into the city from Punjab, many of the women have been travelling back and forth, balancing the jobs of taking care of their homes and fields and also participating in the agitation.Mandeep's companion on the five-hour bus ride from Ludhiana to Singhu was her neighbour Sukhwinder Kaur. ¬†The 68-year-old widow said she was tired of sitting at home while the men in her family were out protesting, and decided she needed to come down, even if it was for a short visit."I wasn't being able to sleep at night properly. I couldn't sit back at home while my brother and nephew, and all our farmer brothers, are fighting here. I had my first good night of sleep after I came here,‚Äù Sukhwinder added.¬†It wasn't the epitome of comfort and toilets were a problem but that didn't matter, said the feisty women. Sukhwinder and Mandeep, with several other women protestors, slept in a waterproof tent provided by Khalsa Aid, an international NGO. ¬†Sukhwinder said she was aware of the fight the farming community had undertaken but didn't realise what it actually took to keep the fight going until she came here.¬†"We are 'gharelu' women, don't know much about the world, but after coming here I have realised how big this fight is. We are prepared for it, however long it takes. The kind of help we are getting for the protest shows the entire country is with us. I have heard that people from Australia, Canada and America are also with us,‚Äù she said. ¬†The farmers, with help from various organisations and generous donors, have pulled out all the stops to sustain their agitation.¬†The site is seeing a constant supply of cooked meals, fruits, dry fruits, and even ‚Äòchaat'. There's also chai-pakora, cold drinks, kheer and other sweet treats. ¬† Arrangements for laundry service, and medical facilities, including regular health check-ups and a dental camp, have also been taken care of.Sukhwinder only had one complaint. ‚ÄúThe toilet is a little too far,‚Äù she said.Staying on the Haryana side of the border, she said she had to take a bit of a stroll to find a toilet, which was on the Delhi side.Inadequate sanitation facilities are one reason why many women have to go back and forth, managing to stay at the protest sight only for a few days at a time.¬†But 75-year-old Daljinder Kaur takes it all in her stride, like many others.¬†She is Mandeep's aunt and insisted on accompanying her to Singhu despite her age. Daljinder said she is positive her farmer brothers and sisters will convince the government.‚Äú‚ÄòModi ko mana ke jaenge. Apne haq lene aaye hain, peeche nahi hatenge' (We will convince Modi. We won't go back until we get our rights),‚Äù she said. ‚Äú'And if needed, we will die here too, she said.¬†The farmers have called for a hunger strike on December 14, when they have called for a nationwide protest.¬†Refusing the government's requests to make amendments to the new farm laws, the farmers are insisting that they should be repealed. On Saturday, farmers picketed highway toll plazas in Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan.They are apprehensive the new legislation will eventually do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of the corporates.

The magazine has contributors spread across the globe. We did have financial and creative challenges earlier, but we are glad that the magazine is being revived to its former gloryThe 42-pages Akhar's circulation included 600 to 800 copies, 15 per cent of which were circulated outside India. Parminderjit has once shared that the publishing cost of the magazine came to be anything between Rs22,000-Rs40,000 depending on the content and number of pages. Japan-based writer Parminder Sodhi is the current international editor of the magazine and its distribution is across Canada, US, UK, Australia. The magazine has been publishing 500 copies on an average in each edition.Started by noted Punjabi poet late Parminderjit, in 1975, the 42-page magazine was counted among the few Punjabi literary magazines to survive the digital age. It was published and edited by Parminderjit until 2015, when the untimely demise of the writer suspended the magazine‚Äôs publication for almost a year. It was republished in 2016, with a special dedication to its founder editor, but soon it was a challenge to support publication cost and find readers.The bi-monthly magazine featured poetry, short stories and social commentary by prominent writers and literary figures. Akhar has charted its own literary history being part of significant movements in Punjab. It was discontinued for publication during the Emergency and struggled through some financial constraints during the late ‚Äô80s and was restarted in 1992. The magazine has contributors spread across the globe. Over 30 Punjabi literary personalities, including Punjabi poet Karnail Singh from the UK, Paramjit Singh, Surjit Patar, Swarajbir and many others were regularly featured in Akhar.But after the demise of Parminderjit, the magazine struggled for revival. Its literary legacy being passed on to Parminderjit‚Äôs family, his wife Surinderjit and son Ravjit Singh. The magazine has now been revived by Akhar Sahit Manch, the creative team of Akhar, that includes local as well international editorial and publishing partners.‚ÄúAkhar has a history of four decades behind it and so, we wanted to maintain the creative standards. We ensured that the hiatus was the end of it. So, we revived with limited edition release in 2016 and our editions for 2020 resumed the earlier status of Akhar now being published as a quarterly magazine,‚Äù said Dr Vikram, a writer and member of Akhar‚Äôs editorial team.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akhar-back-on-path-of-revival-183712

Their movement is being portrayed as a Sikh movement.‚ÄùRahul Gandhi, Cong leaderHow many sacrifices will farmers make?Eleven protesting farmers have lost their lives in the last 17 days due to various reasons. How many more sacrifices will the farmers have to make to get the agri laws repealed?‚ÄúProtests in favour of Indian farmers in the UK were called Pakistan-sponsored. This shows that efforts are being made to target the community and create the fearful atmosphere of 1980s again,‚Äù he alleged.Sirsa said the government was acting as a mute spectator and no action was taken against purveyors of fake news. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president said this was a movement of farmers of the entire nation and not only of Punjab.Besides Punjab, farmers and their family members have converged on the outskirts of the national Capital from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bid-to-portray-farmers-as-anti-national-manjinder-singh-sirsa-183411
13-12-2020||IN 1927||Why ‚ÄòThe Protester‚Äô deserves to be person of the year||It is also worth bearing in mind that many, if not most, of the Punjab farmers came from Pakistan, after the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947. They arrived from across the border, often on foot, traumatised and usually penniless, having lost their land and worldly belongings, amidst horrific bloodletting. A majority of them were Sikhs. Yet, leaving the bitter past behind, they rose phoenix-like, and made Punjab the most prosperous and thriving state in a remarkably short time. They also ushered in the Green Revolution, turning a famine-prone land into a food self-sufficient one. And they freed us from the humiliating PL-480 Act, whereby we were importing American foodgrains for our survival. The nation has much to thank them for. It is another matter that the indiscriminate use of water, pesticides and fertilisers degraded the soil, and that the gains from the Green Revolution are now being widely questioned by environmentalists. The state has also suffered from maladministration in recent years. That, along with the twin menace of militancy and the ruinous use of narcotics, blighted Punjab, bringing it several notches down from its earlier primacy. Nevertheless, the resilience and enterprise of the Punjabi farmers remains embedded in the national consciousness.The voice of dissent also made itself heard in the beginning of the year. On December 11, 2019, Parliament passed the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA). Three days later, a movement began that soon snowballed into thousands of protesting women ‚Äî mostly Muslim ‚Äî in a Delhi locality called Shaheen Bagh. The protesters claimed that the CAA unfairly targeted Muslims, as did the National Population Register (NPR), which is due to be implemented. As proof, they held up the relevant passages of the Constitution. The protest movement lasted from mid-December up to March 24, after the lockdown announcement. It captured the imagination of the nation, with many thoughtful Indians, not just Muslims, wondering why one particular community was being singled out for citizenship. Shaheen Bagh became a symbol of protest against an Act that reeked of sectarianism.The lockdown became the occasion for more protests. Somehow, the Prime Minister and his government had overlooked the plight of millions of migrant labourers, left stranded far away from their homes, with no work and hence no food or roof over their heads. It was a monumental mistake and a little like the PM‚Äôs disastrous demonetisation, another measure the consequences of which had not been thought through. Yet, with his legendary communication skills, he was able to put a spin on it and make both measures sound positive. We now know that they caused immense suffering. Yet, the protesters and the dissenters were labelled ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù.Let us now turn not to individuals but to institutions that have become a focus of dissent ‚Äî our law courts. Though he has been mentioned before, the example of Justice Siddharth of the Allahabad High Court needs re-telling. He highlighted the misuse by the UP government of the law banning cow slaughter. He questioned the credibility of the state police in making arrests under this law ‚Äî mostly of Muslims, needless to say. After the same state government had passed an ordinance against inter-faith marriages ‚Äî targeting Muslims, yet again ‚Äî that very High Court rendered another stinging judgment. Its strong wording bears repetition: ‚ÄúThe right to choose a partner, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, is inherent under the right to life and personal liberty.‚Äù Yet, other BJP-ruled states intend to pass a similar law. The huge irony is that soon after the infamous ordinance, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had the gall to visit Mumbai to try and persuade Bollywood to set up a ‚Äòfilm city‚Äô in his state. Somebody there should have told him that, contrary to his sentiments, Bollywood shines in inter-faith unions. One also wonders whether once the Yogi‚Äôs ‚Äòfilm city‚Äô comes up, it will have a prominent sign at the entry: ‚ÄúInter-faith couples not permitted‚Äù.Very few governments, even the most democratic ones, are comfortable with dissenters and protesters. Like Indira Gandhi, especially during her Emergency rule, the present government is behaving no differently, except for its marked anti-Muslim leaning. Hence, it takes guts to dissent, or to protest, thereby taking on the powers-that-be. You risk being called unpatriotic, or an ‚Äúurban naxal‚Äù, especially when there is a majoritarian government in power, with a leader who is charismatic and still hugely popular. But dissent is the very essence of democracy, its lifeblood. And the Constitution should be one‚Äôs guiding spirit. The Bhagvad Gita put it another way: ‚ÄúDo your duty, no matter the consequences.‚Äù‚Äî The writer is a veteran journalist||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-the-protester-deserves-to-be-person-of-the-year-183503
