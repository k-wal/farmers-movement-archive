Khanna||10 economists write to Tomar, seek repeal of farm laws||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 17As the stand-off between the agitating farmers and the BJP-led central government continued for the third week, top economists from some of the most reputed research institutions in the country, have raised serious concerns about the farm laws, and demanded their repeal.Putting their weight firmly behind the agitating farmers, the economists -- D Narsimha Reddy, Kamal Nayan Kabra, K N Harilal, Ranjit Singh Ghuman, Surinder Kumar, Arun Kumar, Rajinder Chaudhary, R Ramakumar, Vikas Rawal and Himanshu, have said these laws are not in best interests of small and marginal farmers, and demanded their revocation.In a letter to the Agriculture Minister N S Tomar, these 10 economists have said while they believe that improvements and changes are required in the agricultural marketing system for the benefit of millions of small farmers, but the reforms brought by these Acts do not serve that purpose. “They are based on wrong assumptions and claims about why farmers are unable to get remunerative prices, about farmers not having freedom to sell wherever they like under the previously existing laws, and about regulated markets not being in the farmers’ interests,” the economists said.They have come up five reasons on why these three Acts, brought in as a package by the government, are fundamentally harmful in their implications for the small farmers of India. “These undermine the role of the state government in regulating agriculture markets, when more than 20 states have already amended their APMC Acts to allow private mandis, e trading, e NAM etc. Secondly, two different markets -- existing mandis and the private (unregulated) mandis that are proposed under the new laws -- will have two different sets of rules. If collusion and market manipulation are concerns inside the APMC markets, the same collusion and market manipulation are likely to continue in the unregulated market space. Within the regulated APMC markets, there exist mechanisms to address and prevent such market manipulation, whereas in the unregulated ‘trade areas’, the central Act contemplates no such mechanisms,” they have said.They have warned that even before these Acts came, a large percentage of the sale of agricultural commodities happened outside the APMC regulated market yards. However, the APMC market yards still set the benchmark prices through the daily auctions and offered some reliable price signals to the farmers. Without these price signals, the fragmented markets could pave the way for local monopsonies. The experience in Bihar since the removal of its APMC Act in 2006 shows that farmers have less choice of buyers and less bargaining power, resulting in significantly lower prices compared to other states.The 10 economists have also raised the issue of the huge asymmetry between the two parties, small farmers and companies, in the Contract Farming law, which is not addressed to provide adequate protection to the interests of the farmers. Besides, concern about domination by big agri-businesses is also worrisome, they have said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/10-economists-write-to-tomar-seek-repeal-of-farm-laws-185683

Allof you sit together. Prepare a tentative list of committee members,” the CJI said, posting the matter for further hearing on Thursday.The farmers’ outfits that have been added as parties to the case are BKU (Rakesh Tikait), BKU (Sidhupur), BKU (Rajewal), BKU (Lakhowal), Jamhoori Kisan Sabha (Kulwant Singh Sandhu), BKU-Dakaunda (Buta Singh Burjgill), BKU–Doaba (Manjit Singh Rai) and Kul Hind Kisan Federation (Prem Singh Bhangu).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-hints-at-panel-for-talks-notice-to-govt-185323

The services of two sub-judges have also been placed under suspension. Besides this, the functioning of two district and sessions judges has come under the HC scanner with the ordering of regular inquiries against them.This is the first time in recallable past that the HC has taken action at such a large scale against its judicial officers, sending across a strong message of zero tolerance against indiscipline, complacency and other factors in the subordinate judiciary.The Full Court meeting, first since the HC went into restrictive functioning mode in March due to Covid outbreak, is believed to have been held on December 14 under Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha.Available information suggests the officers compulsorily retired are Additional District and Sessions Judge Ved Pal Gupta and Rajinder Goel. The Punjab-cadre officers discharged during probation are Abhinav Sekhon and Nazmeen Singh.The sub-judges whose services have been placed under suspension are Tanvir Singh and Pradeep Singhal.

But these meetings were informal. I believe there is enough space for a non-Congress, non-Akali Dal political front in Punjab,” he told The Tribune.Jarnail Singh, when contacted, said he had recently met Dhindsa in Delhi. “It’s too early to say at this juncture whether there will be any such alliance. Not just the SAD (Democratic), we too are looking for like-minded allies, who want to work for Punjab’s betterment,” he said.Jarnail Singh ruled out any alliance with the BSP, saying the two parties had the same vote base. Dhindsa was believed to be inclined towards the BJP when he left the SAD (Badal) in February last.

The church could have easily avoided glorifying the Bishop at a time when cross-examination in the case is set to start after both the Kerala High Court and Supreme Court rejected his petition for discharge in the rape case. Mulakkal is in Kerala since November owing to the case,” said a priest from a diocesan church.Another priest supporting the nun said, “Thankfully, there is no practice to print such calendars here. We expect Mulakkal not to come here during Christmas as he is in Kerala and cannot commute here often due to Covid-19.”Mulakkal’s photograph along with his birthday date had appeared on the March page of the calendar.Mulakkal is facing charges under Sections 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 377 (unnatural sex), 376 (c)(a) (sexual intercourse by person in authority) 376(2)(k) (indulging in sexual intercourse by exhorting authority) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.Meanwhile, the church defended the move to include the Bishop’s birthday in the calendar saying Mulakkal remains a Bishop and that the charges against him have not been proven yet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kerala-church-shouldnt-glorify-rape-accused-bishop-priests-185249

Addressing mediapersons, Fatehgarh Sahib SSP Amneet Kondal said the police cracked the blind murder case within 48 hours. She said after the murder, an SIT led by Jagjit Singh Jallah, SP (Investigation), and Sukhminder Singh Chauhan, DSP, Bassi Pathana, was formed, which successfully solved the case.“During investigation, it was found that Angrej Kumar, one of the close friends of Sahil, was missing from his home. We focused on him and succeeded in tracing him. During interrogation, he confessed to killing Sahil,” Kondal said.She said later, the police recovered two SIM cards, a mobile phone used to make calls to Sahil’s parents, Sahil’s slippers, which Angrej had thrown on the roadside in another sugarcane field of Ghel village, and the hammer used to carry out the crime.On why he killed Sahil, Angrej said he suspected that the former was keeping a close eye on his sister, which was not acceptable to him.Kondal said the police would seek his police remand and probe if any other person was also involved in the crime.Two sim cards, mobile phone recoveredSSP Amneet Kondal said the police recovered two SIM cards, a mobile phone used to make calls to Sahil’s parents, the victim’s slippers, which the accused had thrown on the roadside in a sugarcane field of Ghel village, and the hammer used to carry out the crime||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/15-year-olds-murder-case-cracked-friend-arrested-in-fatehgarh-sahib-185245

Besides promoting VIP culture — as these vehicle owners preferred to retain old registration numbers as a status symbol — the use of old numbers had become a security hazard in the border state of Punjab, an official spokesperson pointed out. Vehicles with these so-called VIP numbers were often misused by anti-social elements to carry out subversive activities as these vehicles were not stopped/checked by the police. Further, with such registration numbers used on multiple vehicles over the years, identification of original owners was difficult since old records were either untraceable or destroyed to accommodate VIPs.Meanwhile, the Transport Department has extended the last date for digital driving licence upgradation till January 15, 2021.Giving details, Transport Minister Razia Sultana said in order to empower people to upgrade their manual driving licences into digital ones, a special campaign had been launched by the department in November 2020. The objective of the campaign is to allow manual driving licence holders to get their driving licence reflected in Sarathi application by submitting online application at www.punjabtransport.org or www.sarathi.parivahan.gov.in. After approval, the applicant can get his digital driving licence in mParivahan mobile application or Digilocker. “With the launch of the campaign on the Sarathi web application, more than 25,000 people applied for this service. In order to facilitate the public, the last date for availing the service has been extended to January 15, 2021,” she added. The minister said the drive would ensure elimination of fake driving licences and help in enforcement of traffic rules leading to safe driving and improved road safety.Upgrade to digital licence by Jan 15The Transport Department has extended the last date for digital driving licence upgradation till January 15, 2021.

The dialogue between the ministers and farm unions is underway and a viable solution can be found. The Centre is ready to give a written assurance regarding the procurement system and the MSP. Similarly, the option of going to a civil court can also be offered,” he said.On the other hand, launching a scathing attack on party’s estranged partner — SAD — and the Congress, he alleged that opposition parties had been misguiding the farming community to gain political mileage.Questioning SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s “double standards”, Malik said, “Was he and his wife, the then Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, not part of the panel when the farm laws were being formulated? Didn’t they issue statements in favour of farm laws initially and what prompted them to take a total U-turn could be anybody’s guess? They did it for their political convenience,” he said.Malik said the farm laws enacted recently were not ‘new’ but an ‘amended version’ of what was proposed during the Congress regime at the Centre. “The difference was that the Congress did not implement them whereas PM Narendra Modi took the initiative of introducing the amendments and implemented them keeping in view the betterment of farmers,” he said.BJP to contest all 117 seats: Tarun Chugh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/opposition-misguiding-farmers-says-shwait-malik-185239

He said instead the government could have arrived at a solution in Parliament by discussing the issue and repealing the farm laws.Cheema also castigated the Centre for citing Covid-19 as an excuse to scrap the winter session.

With the start of intense fog and dip in temperature, the protesting farmers are likely to face more problems as there are many elderly in the protest who are already facing various health problems. The intense cold will make things tougher for them.

Even if their leaders are having second thoughts, people are not ready to accept anything less than “repeal”.It scares to imagine what if the government does not bend? “Then this is enough to wrap our bodies back home,” Gurmail Kaur, an old woman from Sangrur district says, spreading her dupatta.The clock here seems to have stopped ticking; calender is just another piece of trash hanging on the wall. There is no restlessness, no eagerness to get quick results. People seem to be ready for a long ‘protracted war’. Surinder Kaur of Mehal Khurd says they have ration for six months. And when it comes to ration, they don’t count in kilograms or quintals but the area of land is the weighing scale. “Back home, wheat from 15 acres is lying harvested. It is enough to feed us for months,” she says.Same is the resolve of Yadwinder Singh from Vadda Chuga village in Muktsar. He says they have asked their families back home to cook food only after they return. They proudly narrate the heroic tales of how they changed the flow of water cannon and removed the barricades. The tractor seems to have become a new metaphor of resistance which can scale any terrain.This uprising has created a new monument of resistance, where the young and the old come for pilgrimage. Sandeep Kaur, a school teacher from Kila Raipur in Ludhiana, says she wanted her seven-year-old daughter to see this historic struggle. “Rise against every act of injustice. That has been our tradition and I want her to understand,” she says.Farm activists who organised this struggle say once again history is repeating itself. Land remains the central question. Paramjit Kaur, from village Nagthe Chathe in Sangrur, says we are here for our lands. What is land for you? We ask. After a brief pause, she answers, “Mother”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/on-nh-9-repeal-chants-all-the-way-185233
17-12-2020||---||1971 war veterans oppose agri laws||Singhu, December 16A number of 1971 war veterans, while commemorating Vijay Divas at the Singhu border, on Wednesday opposed the three contentious Central agriculture laws and showed solidarity with the protesting farmers.The war veterans said the new agiculture laws would prove detrimental to the farming community. Seeking repeal of the contentious farm Acts, the veterans said they were ready to fight the farmers’ battle.Subedar Major Tarsem Singh (retd) from Moga said: “We are here because most of us belong to families of farmers. It is our moral duty to support their cause”.Captain Bikar Singh (retd) said: “Farmers across the country are protesting against these laws, but the Union Government is not ready to budge. It is shameful for the government that both jawan and kisan are unhappy in the country.”While their sons were keeping the borders secure, the farmers were forced to protest on the roads for their genuine rights, said Bikar Jogendra Singh, president of the Indian Veteran Organisation.“The Central Government made a mistake by not consulting the farmers before introducing the agriculture Bills in Parilament. We thus appeal to the government to immediately consider the farmer unions’ just demands and repeal the controversial laws,” he said. The farmers’ stir is growing stronger and stronger with each passing day, with support pouring in from various organisations.‘Uniformed’ man in stir raises concernChandigarh: The government is closely watching the impact of the farmers’ protest on the uniformed community as a large chunk of their manpower come from rural areas and agrarian background. Concern has been raised in official circles after the photograph of a turbaned person wearing the Army field dress bearing a name tag at a protest site in Bathinda cropped up on the social media, prompting a probe by intelligence agencies to ascertain his identity and antecedents.

Ik acre wich vi bahut khush. Mainu bahut yaad ayu oh (He was always true to farming. Even happy with just one acre. I will miss him).Pal Singh died at the Singhu border following a suspected heart attack after he went back to his makeshift night shelter in a tractor-trolley late on Tuesday evening. An active member of the Bharti Kisan Union (Rajewal), he was into farming since his childhood. He is survived by his son Mandeep Singh.“Last week, Pal Singh was adamant to go on a bicycle and we had to literally forcibly plead to him to leave with other farmers, going two days later. Only when we told him that he won’t be able to take ration items so far to Delhi border, he agreed,” Mandeep said, adding: “My father had spent his savings of around Rs 4,500 to buy ration and took another Rs 2,500 to contribute to the agitation.”In another corner of his two-room kutcha house, nearby his one acre fields, Pal Singh’s 100-year-old mother Amarjit Kaur is shocked to hear the death of her fifth of the six sons. “Only a mother can understand the pain of losing her sons while she is alive. Pal’s death is heartbreaking. Kissani layi sacha si oh. Ik acre wich vi bahut khush. Mainu bahut yaad ayu oh (He was always true to farming. Even happy with just one acre of land and barely able to make both ends meet. I will miss him,” Amarjit said.“Pal Singh was worried that he would not be able to even till his own land if the new Acts are implemented. If the Centre has better plans, it should explain it to the farmers rather than allowing them to die,” a family member said. Meanwhile, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee has announced Rs 1 lakh for the family. This is the fourth death of a farmer from Patiala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/100-year-old-mother-in-shock-after-sons-death-185236

17-12-2020||Patiala||Strengthen agriculture to support economy: Study||As per a research paper published in the Indian Journal of Economics and Development, the Centre needs to strengthen the agriculture sector to support the country’s falling GDP.Dr Gian Singh, former professor, Punjabi University, Patiala, and assistant professors Dharampal and Jyoti in their research paper ‘Exploring the economic slowdown of India’ stated that three new farm laws would affect employment, farmers’ livelihood and ultimately, the country’s growth rate, due to entry of the corporates in the farming sector. The research also pointed out the most job-oriented farming sector remained only a promising sector during the April-June lockdown period.The trio said, “Except agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors, all other industries recorded a negative growth in this period. The agriculture sector registered a growth rate of 3.37 per cent, as procurement of wheat remained a record high, which benefited over 42 lakh farmers with Rs 73,500 crore, thanks to the minimum support price.Dr Gian Singh said: “The agriculture sector must be strengthened as the majority of the population depends on it.”— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/strengthen-agriculture-to-support-economy-study-185238
