29-12-2020||Mathura (UP)||Hema Malini pitches for farm laws||Actor-politician Hema Malini on Tuesday pitched for the three new agri-marketing laws, saying the Narendra Modi government has now given farmers more options to sell their crops.“Ever since the BJP-led government came to power, it is making every effort to increase the farmer's income,” Mathura's BJP MP told reporters through a video link. Earlier, she also talked to officials here through video conferencing.Chanting the “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” slogan, Hema Malini praised both soldiers and farmers.She appealed to farmers and their unions to give up their protest over the new farm laws and sit across the table with the government to remove their apprehensions.She asked them to have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him their well-wisher.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are camping at Delhi's borders over the agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre.Farmer unions claim the laws will end up eroding the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the government says the MSP will stay and the laws give farmer more options to sell their produce.“I am proud of the farmers of Brijbhumi for joining hands with the farmers of the country who are lauding reforms by the Union government,” she said, implying that the farmers in her constituency were not against the controversial laws.She condemned the “politics” played over the new laws by the opposition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hema-malini-pitches-for-farm-laws-191075
29-12-2020||New Delhi||Green jalebi, marriage procession: Farmers look at unique ways to grab eyeballs||Serving 'green jalebis' to taking out a 'baraat' (wedding procession), farmers protesting at Singhu border here are using innovative ways to communicate their grievances and demands to the central government.A group of farmers from Mohali in Punjab have been serving special green jalebis (sweet), saying it symbolised the colour of their crops and the prosperity associated with it."We have been distributing green jalebis from the last few days. Nearly five quintals of the sweet are distributed everyday," Jasvir Chand, a protesting farmer, said."The green colour of the sweet symbolises Green Revolution as well as peace and tranquillity," Chand's companion Baldev Singh (65) said at the protest site."We have been peacefully protesting against the three new farm laws of the central government for over a month. Although the government has not accepted our demand, we are determined to continue the protest peacefully," he said.Notably, many curious people queued up to taste the 'green jalebi' which is usually available in golden colour.Meanwhile, some youths from Karnal in Haryana took out a marriage procession at the protest venue to draw attention towards their agitation."We thought a marriage procession will be an interesting way to communicate to the people and the government our demands and issues with the farm laws," said 22-year-old Jagdip Singh from Dabri village in Karnal.The procession with a protester wearing the full attire of a groom and sitting on a tractor passed through the crowded highway attracting lot of merriment from the protesting farmers camping there for over a month.Farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at different border points of Delhi for over a month to demand repeal of the three agriculture laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties."We are requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government to give legal status to minimum support price (MSP) to empower the farmers. The government should also address our genuine concerns over the three farm laws," Chand said."If anyone is employed by the government, his salary is regularly revised, similarly there should be legally guaranteed purchase of crops since farmers invest not only their hard work, but also whatever scarce resources are there at their disposal," he said.The new farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.--- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/green-jalebi-marriage-procession-farmers-look-at-unique-ways-to-grab-eyeballs-191074

Five vaccination officers and one supervisor were deployed and duties were assigned to them at each site. Vaccination officer-1 verified the name of the beneficiary from the site, got his hands sanitised and made him sit in the waiting room.Vaccination Officer 2 checked his registration on CoWIN portal and sent him to dummy immunisation vaccinator, who also told him about the second vaccination.Vaccination Officers 4 and 5 observed him in the observation room keeping emergency Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) kits, stretchers, wheelchairs etc handy.Dr Dhanda said that some healthcare workers did not bring along same IDs registered with their names on Monday in the portal and there was little difficulty in matching, for which necessary suggestions had been forwarded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/125-healthcare-workers-take-dummy-covid-19-vaccination-in-dry-run-191070
29-12-2020||New Delhi||Faced unprecedented vilification campaign for helping protesting farmers: Khalsa Aid India director||Khalsa Aid India, an NGO known for providing aid to people in distress, said the "vilification" faced by the organisation for helping their "own people" during the ongoing farmers protest was "unprecedented".Registered separately as a charitable trust in 2013, Khalsa Aid India has been camping from day one of the farmers protest at the two major protest sites of Singhu and Tikri. Initially serving only langars, they shifted attention to the other important needs of the protesting farmers when others too started free community kitchens.The NGO is currently running a 600-bed full-to-capacity night shelter along with the two 'Kisan Malls' which provide various items of daily use, such as inner wears, thermals, toothbrush and sanitary pads to those in need.Amarpreet Singh, the director of Khalsa Aid Project (Asia Chapter), told PTI that a team of six full-time employees and over 150 volunteers from across the country were working tirelessly at different protest sites.He fears that "bad-publicity and false propaganda would demoralise them"."They (a section of news media and some people) are asking 'Who is funding you?', 'Are you here supporting them just because they are Sikhs?' or 'What is our agenda?'."They never asked us these kinds of questions when we were helping people during the Kerala flood, COVID-19 pandemic or in the Amarnath Yatra's clean-up drive. Then why today?," posed a visibly disappointed Singh.He asserted that Khalsa Aid India has "nothing to hide" and maintains record of "every single penny donated" to them."We are a registered organisation. The Government of India can always check our records whenever they want. But bad-mouthing and spreading of baseless propaganda should stop. This demoralises our volunteers who have come here leaving their jobs, businesses and families with the sole purpose of serving the farmers in these dire conditions," Singh said."The protesting farmers, mostly comprising Punjabis, are our own people who helped us in building this organisation in the first place. Of course, we will support them. The reason that some see our support as bigger than the usual is because the protest this time is the biggest that we have seen so far," he told PTI.Singh, 31, who hails from Punjab's Patiala, admitted that in the past two attempts were made to vilify the organisation like when it provided aid to Rohingya refugees or served langar to the students of Jamia Malia Islamia during their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act."Then, some people asked 'why are you supporting Muslims?'. We told them the same thing that we are saying now: Khalsa Aid works for humanity and serves people irrespective of their caste, gender or religion. However, the vilification campaign against us this time has been unprecedented," he said.To underpin his point, Singh cited reports about 'make-shift foot massager centre' and claimed that it was blown out of proportion by certain news outlets.The NGO has installed 25-foot massagers for the elderly protestors."A journalist asked 'Where did we get Rs 25 lakh for these machines?'. I was stunned by his question and the way he put it across. The actual cost of the machines is Rs 2 lakh."In Punjab, we have the culture of pressing the feet of our elders. We initially did the same here also. But there were only a limited number of volunteers and the number of protestors was always increasing. That is when we took the help of technology. Later, we saw stories calling it a 'luxury'," he said.Farmers from various parts of the country have been camping at different border points of Delhi for over a month now to demand repeal of the three agri laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties.The three laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/faced-unprecedented-vilification-campaign-for-helping-protesting-farmers-khalsa-aid-india-director-191065

We never back such things where some people damage mobile towers or cause damage to public or private property,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh told PTI.He reiterated that his outfit and others have made a strong appeal to people not to do any such act which may damage public property.On Monday, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had said that 1,561 mobile towers have been "impacted" in the state during the farmers' stir, and directed the police to take strict action against vandalisation and disruption of telecom services.Asserting that he will not let Punjab plunge into anarchy at any cost and nobody can be allowed to take the law into their hands, the chief minister had said he has been forced to toughen his stance as his repeated appeals to perpetrators of such acts had been ignored.A total of 1,561 mobile towers have been impacted in the state, according to an official statement on Monday. The state has a total of 21,306 mobile towers spread across its 22 districts.Out of the total towers impacted, 25 had been damaged, allegedly by some farmers and their supporters in violation of the directions given by farmers' unions to keep their protests against the farm laws peaceful.Such incidents were reported from Mansa, Barnala, Ferozepur and Moga with mobile towers of a particular telecom operator being targeted during the past few days, disrupting their services.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmer-bodies-against-any-act-causing-damage-to-mobile-towers-bku-ekta-ugrahan-leader-191055

In 2013, Akal Takht’s Jathedar had issued a warning to Sidhu after he ‘flippantly’ quoted from Gurbani i in a TV show.In 2017, he was accused for distorting a verse of Gurbani.Neither Sidhu nor his office responded to calls or text messages. This story will be updated when they respond.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-kicks-up-storm-for-draping-cloth-with-sikh-religious-symbols-over-shoulders-191049
29-12-2020||Bathinda||Punjabi University's causal approach confuses students; provide old pattern exam questionnaires||Punjabi University's causal approach in conducting examinations has raised confusion among the students. The old pattern of question papers have been provided to students.Paper cuttings, and black-markers, were used to hide previous code on the papers.For some courses, handwritten questionnaires were given instead of a computerised copy with a fresh set of instructions.Several students faced trouble in understanding a few words in the questionnaires as well. As per new guidelines, the total time for the exam is two hours, but the old exam paper reads three hours.Similarly, as per the new guidelines, students need to attempt 50 per cent of the questions, but the old pattern has been divided into three sections with instructions to attempt 3-4 questions in each section.This negligence is despite the fact, that university has collected around Rs 2,000 examination fee from more than 2 lakh students of 17 courses appearing for exams in various colleges of the university.In the MA history paper, the years of history were incorrectly written as 1707-1952 instead of 1707 to 1772.The university announced that they would not make any payment to staff for evaluating the answer books. Since 2017, the university has not given the fees to its evaluating staff.“The question papers should have been properly typed with new, and specific instructions so as to avoid any confusion amongst the students. It is a sorry state of affairs on academic, financial and administrative front of the university,” said Educationalist Prof NK Gosian.However, Dr Jasvirinder Singh Khattar, Professor In-charge (Examination), Punjabi University, Patiala said: “The examination fees vary for classes. It is for the complete process including paper setting and paper checking. Some exam papers seem to be previously devised as the exam papers were set earlier than per syllabus and instructions for online conduction of examination was released after, as per requirement", adding, that the examination department has streamlined the process and all papers are typed and being released as per new pattern.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-universitys-causal-approach-confuses-students-provide-old-pattern-exam-questionnaires-191048

Now, the onus is on us to prove ourselves and retain the faith reposed by investors in us. I have told my entire staff to work with utmost dedication and turn work into worship,” Bector told The Tribune here on Monday. The success story of this octogenarian woman from Ludhiana is inspiring. Bector rose from her backyard business with a paltry investment of Rs 300.She began her in-house baking and ice-cream shop after pursuing a baking course from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) here in the early 1980s. But till the time her businessman husband bought her a professional ice-cream churner by investing Rs 20,000 in the mid-80s, this tall and rather impressive woman was yet to earn any profit.The Rs 20,000 investment made her business grow by leaps and bounds. In five years, her brand Cremica, the name derived from the lavish use of cream as a key ingredient in Bector’s delicacies, grew to a remarkable Rs 5-crore turnover. She soon became a household name and her firm clocked a turnover of Rs 20 crore in 1995. Ludhiana became a permanent abode for Bector after she married Dharam Vir at an early age of 17 in 1957. It was in the mid-70s when all three sons of the Bectors – Ajay, Akshay and Anoop – left them for a boarding school in Mussoorie that Bector moved out of her house and took up baking classes at PAU.Her company’s IPO posted the best listing gain this year after Burger King and Happiest Minds, which gained 130 per cent and 123 per cent, respectively.

The PIL seeks adequate compensation for putting affected children’s life at risk by transfusing HIV-positive blood.In a press conference, Mittal said the primary goal was to highlight the serious deficiencies and shortcomings in the matter of donation, collection, storage and supply of blood, especially keeping in mind an unfortunate incident whereby the blood of an HIV-positive patient had been transfused to a thalassaemia patient.“The PSLSA gives legal aid to all children under the NALSA (Child Friendly Legal Services to Children and their Protection) scheme, 2015, and under Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, and thus contacted their guardians and collected particulars to provide them relief. Further, there is also a need to issue appropriate guidelines for ensuring transfusion of safe blood to all donees by the blood banks,” said Mittal.The authority has further sought framing and implementation of appropriate guidelines under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and under relevant laws so that such kind of incidents do not occur in future. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hiv-blood-transfusion-pil-in-hc-for-relief-to-affected-families-190805
