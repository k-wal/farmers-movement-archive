19-06-2021||Patiala||Navjot Kaur Sidhu, Kuljit Nagra criticise Punjab govt for giving jobs to sons of 2 Congress MLAs||Former legislator Navjot Kaur Sidhu and Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra criticised the Punjab government’s decision of giving government jobs to sons of two ruling party legislators.After five ministers opposed the move by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to appoint sons of MLAs in government jobs, Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra opposed the appointments. He sought rollback of the decisions by the Cabinet.Sidhu’s statement came a day after the Punjab government decided to appoint sons of two Congress MLAs as a police inspector and a naib tehsildar as a “special case”.The decision to appoint sons of two Congress MLAs Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey on the “compassionate” ground was taken in a Cabinet meeting.Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa was appointed as an inspector in the Punjab Police and Bhisham Pandey as a naib tehsildar in the state’s Revenue Department.Talking to reporters at Chaura village in Sanour constituency in Patiala, Navjot Kaur Sidhu said no post should be given to anyone without merit, especially those who were already financially well off.Rather jobs could have been given to a sportsperson or ward of a freedom fighter, said the wife of Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu.“I do not think that without passing any test you can join as a tehsildar or join the police,” she said.To a question on Navjot Singh Sidhu, she said the party has asked him to wait.“After their (party high command) decision comes, then he will take a decision that is in the interest of Punjab,” Navjot Kaur Sidhu said.He had even refused to join Kapil Sharma’s show and rejected a Rs 10 crore contract for a cricket tournament, she said.To a question on contesting from Patiala in the upcoming state assembly polls, she said she would fight from wherever the party decides.MLA Gidderbaha Amarinder Singh Raja Warring too has appealed to Fateh Jung Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey not to accept the government jobs offered to their sons.Jobs to sons of Congress MLAs a recognition of their families’ sacrifices, declares Punjab CMMeanwhile, defending his government’s decision to give jobs to sons of two MLAs, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday termed it a recognition of the sacrifices made by their grandfathers, who laid down their lives for the country.Interacting informally with mediapersons outside the residence of Late Milkha Singh, where he had gone to pay his last respects to the legendary athlete, the chief minister said those who make a sacrifice for the nation can, and should, never be forgotten. Their families deserve to be compensated for the loss, he added.Taking a dig at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which have criticised the government’s move, the chief minister said if these parties provide names of any youth whose father/grandfathers have made similar sacrifices for the nation, they will also be provided jobs in the state government. In fact, remarked Capt Amarinder, he had tried to find such persons in these parties but could find none.The chief minister was responding to a question on the decision to give government jobs to Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa, son of Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, as inspector (Group B) in Punjab Police, and Bhisham Pandey, son of Ludhiana MLA Rakesh Pandey, as Naib Tehsildar. The names of Arjun Bajwa and Bhishan Pandey were cleared by the state Cabinet yesterday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-kaur-sidhu-kuljit-nagra-criticise-punjab-govt-for-giving-jobs-to-sons-of-2-congress-mlas-270970

19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Cabinet nod to 2.59-time raise over last pay panel for govt employees||The Punjab Cabinet today approved the recommendations made by the Sixth Pay Commission for its 6.60 lakh employees and pensioners, paving the way for the implementation of the new pay scales from July 1.Pension up 40%Salaries of 2.84 lakh employees and 3.76 lakh pensioners in the state will increase by a multiple of 2.59 over the pay scales recommended by the 2006 Fifth Pay Commission. The annual rate of increment will be three per cent.Burden on exchequerAs a result, the minimum salary that a government employee will get is Rs 18,000 per month, while the minimum monthly pension will be Rs 9,000. As of now, the minimum salary in the government is Rs 6,950 and the minimum pension is Rs 3,500.The new pay scales will be effected from January 1, 2016, and employees will get the arrears of the previous five years in four-and-a-half years with two instalments being released each year. The first instalment of arrears will be released in October.With the new Pay Commission, salaries of various categories of employees in the Punjab Government remain the highest in the region, with peon’s wages being revised to Rs 31,300, clerk’s to Rs 52,490, and a constable’s and patwari’s salary to Rs 52,490.A government schoolteacher will now draw Rs 68,350 and a nurse Rs 70,820. Other than Delhi, which gives higher pay to some of these categories of employees, the salaries of employees in Punjab remain higher than those of theircounterparts in Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi.Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal told The Tribune the annual financial implication of the new scales in salary bill of the government would be Rs 4,717 crore, in the pension bill Rs 2,924 crore and in the emoluments Rs 900 crore. “Since the Pay Commission comes into force from January 1, 2016, we will have to pay arrears of Rs 13,759 crore. Each year, we will release arrears of Rs 3,000 crore in two instalments. We had made provisions for the implementation of the Pay Commission in this year’s Budget, with Rs 9,000 crore being set aside for the purpose this year,” he said.Interestingly, taking a cue from the Seventh Pay Commission of Government of India, the state’s Pay Commission, headed by former Chief Secretary Jai Singh Gill, has recommended that categorisation of employees for calculating salaries be done on the basis of pay bands.As a result, as against the 130-odd pay scales (where categorisation was based on “grade pay” of employees) that are in force presently, employees will be categorised into 31 “pay bands”. It is these pay bands that will determine the emoluments and dearness allowance due to the employees.Officials in the state Finance Department said certain anomalies in pay scales that had arisen following the implementation of the Tikshan Sood Cabinet Committee in 2011 have been removed in this new Pay Commission.In several departments, the cabinet sub-committee had given higher pay scales to clerical and secretariat staff, over and above the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. Their salaries thus had become higher than those of class 2 and 1 officers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-nod-to-2-59-time-raise-over-last-pay-panel-for-govt-employees-270464
19-06-2021||Chandigarh||Five ministers question CM over Punjab govt jobs to MLAs’ sons||Amid the ongoing crisis in the Punjab Congress, five Cabinet ministers — Sukhjinder Randhawa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria, Charanjit Channi, Tript Rajinder Bajwa and Razia Sultana — today had a showdown with CM Capt Amarinder Singh at the Cabinet meeting over the issue of giving government jobs to the sons of party MLAs.Want FIR on death in terror attack tabledBarring Sultana, the four ministers have been questioning the CM on unfulfilled poll promises. The case pertains to the appointment of sons of legislators Fateh Jung Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey as Inspector and Naib Tehsildar, respectively, on compassionate grounds by tweaking rules.Fateh Bajwa, younger brother of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, yesterday spoke in favour of the CM. In political circles, the appointments are being seen as a move by the CM’s camp to woo the MLAs. Overruling the objections, the CM got the appointments passed and said anyone against it could move the court. Justifying the move, the CM is learnt to have further pointed out that jobs had been offered to deserving sportsmen and ex-servicemen too.Flagging the Congress poll manifesto of shunning VIP culture, the ministers vehemently opposed the appointment of Bajwa’s son Arjun Partap Bajwa. They demanded tabling of the FIR regarding the killing of MLA Bajwa’s father in a terrorist attack in 1987 and consent from other family members, besides pointing out that the beneficiary did not fit into the criteria of being offered job on compassionate grounds.It is learnt that Sukhjinder Randhawa and Tript Bajwa pointed out that appointing son of an affluent MLA was setting a wrong precedent when there were more deserving persons, including genuinely poor families of former party MLAs and the kin of party workers who had been killed by terrorists.Sultana pointed out that her family deserved the same as her husband, former DGP Mohammed Mustafa, had served during terrorism days.The standoff between the dissident ministers and the CM today happened a day after ministers Sukhbinder Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Randhawa ensured the absence of Chief Principal Secretary to CM Suresh Kumar from yesterday’s pre-Cabinet meeting. Kumar was absent in today’s meeting also. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/five-ministers-question-cm-over-punjab-govt-jobs-to-mlas-sons-270465

They will also return awards conferred on them by the state.Sanjeev Kumar of Telupura village, a Maharaja Ranjeet Singh Sports Award recipient, will lead the protest.PPCC president Sunil Jakhar had arranged his meeting with CM Capt Amarinder Singh on January 17, 2019, and recommended a job. Sanjeev even met Minister of Sports Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi four times, but nothing was done by the authorities.Sanjeev, a para badminton player, has to his credit five gold, a silver and seven bronze medals in international events. Retaining his No. 1 position in the country since 2012, he has won 17 gold, five silver and three bronze medals in national para badminton competitions.After his father retired from a government school in Khuyiansarwer village, making ends meet became difficult for the family.Sanjeev said along with him, other differently abled sportspersons would also return the state’s most prestigious Maharaja Ranjit Singh Sports Award to the Chief Minister. In January 2019, when a protest was held by sportspersons outside CM’s residence, OSD Sandeep Singh Sandhu had assured that their grievances would be resolved, but to no avail.Expressing anger, he said the state government made tall claims on the “Ghar-Ghar Rozgar” project, but could not arrange a few jobs for disabled sportspersons. He said: “By winning medals at the international level, we made Punjab proud, but the government has failed to come up with a policy that would ensure us jobs.”Other para players and Maharaja Ranjeet Singh Award recipients who are expected to join the dharna are Shripal, Baljinder, Ajay, Ranjit, Hardeep, Gurvinder, Mahavir, Suman and Arjuna Awardee Raj Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unemployed-para-players-to-return-awards-to-punjab-cm-270472

The reason of burdening the state exchequer, could not prima facie, be a ground to grant bail to an accused, the High Court ruled.The admonition and direction by Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi came on a petition filed by Nanak Singh against the state of Punjab for anticipatory bail. While arguing for the petitioner, his counsel brought to the court’s notice the order granting regular bail to co-accused, Krishan Singh, by Sardulgarh Judicial Magistrate vide order dated June 1.Justice Sethi observed the reasons given by the judicial magistrate, while extending the bail to the co-accused, were prima facie without application of mind. Prima facie, the sensitivity of the allegation was not taken into account by the judicial magistrate while passing the order, he observed.Justice Sethi added the custody period of seven days was being treated as enough for granting bail and that too while ignoring the fact that the investigation was still in progress and the co-accused was yet to be arrested, which could hamper the investigation.“Order dated June 1, prima facie, shows casualness of the officer concerned in passing the judicial order, by completely ignoring the objection raised by the state,” Justice Sethi added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/burden-on-exchequer-no-ground-to-grant-bail-high-court-270513

He said he sold nearly 12,000 fake injections during the second Covid wave and earned Rs 5 crore.How case unravelledThe accused, identified as Mohammad Shahwar, was presented before media at a press conference held by Ropar SSP Akhil Chaudhary here today.

He said Centre’s experience with pandemic had shown the importance of ensuring availability of oxygen in hospitals.He said installation of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants in various healthcare facilities would help avoid disruption of oxygen supplies, reduce dependence on storage and supply of cylinders or tanks. The Centre said on request from states, 162 PSA plants were sanctioned in October 2020. Another 75, 52 and 200 plants were cleared under the PM Cares Fund in May.Considering the need to make available these facilities in each district, all requests received had been reviewed in close consultation with stakeholders. Based on the exercise, 1,215 PSA plants (including those already conveyed earlier) had been sanctioned under PM Cares Fund. The Centre also asked the state to nominate a nodal officer and two technical experts trained to operate and troubleshoot PSA plants in each medical facility. Further, a state-level nodal officer would be needed to coordinate with central agencies. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/prioritise-sites-for-oxygen-plants-centre-270531
19-06-2021||New Delhi||Punjab got more remdesivir than Uttar Pradesh: Hardeep Singh Puri||The BJP today highlighted several decisions taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Punjab in the “true spirit of cooperative federalism” to attack Opposition parties, which often accuse the central government of “overriding powers of states”.Citing the example of Punjab and Assam, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the population of both states was roughly similar while Uttar Pradesh had a population of around 20 crore.“My team did an analysis and found out that the number of remdesivir supplied by the Centre per hundred thousand people in Assam was 323 and UP 264. Punjab, on the other hand, was given 632 doses per hundred thousand people, which is almost double as compared to Assam and Uttar Pradesh,” he said, adding that this might not be an indicator as many states also procured it themselves “but for anyone to suggest that they have been short-changed or denied the legitimate share is a falsification”.The Centre recently sanctioned medical oxygen plants for 41 locations in Punjab under the PM Cares Fund, Puri said, taking a swipe at the Capt Amarinder Singh government in the state over its alleged profiteering by selling Covid vaccines to private hospitals.“Congress leaders are not on the same page. Some of them think profiteering on centrally supplied medicines is legitimate. The health minister of Punjab claimed he had nothing to do with this scam,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-got-more-remdesivir-than-uttar-pradesh-hardeep-singh-puri-270548

Moreover, the CM, of late, has been more accessible than usual and has been taking leaders along.He has also been visibly more active on the government front.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aicc-panel-to-meet-capt-amarinder-singh-navjot-singh-sidhu-on-june-22-270754

An open critic of the chief minister, Bajwa has mended his differences with Sukhjinder Randhawa and even joined hands with Navjot Sidhu.A statement issued by Bajwa’s MLA brother Fateh Bajwa, coming in support of the chief minister, while playing down the differences between his brother and the CM, gave indications of the things soothing out between the two leaders.In the wake of the party high command brainstorming to end the crisis in the Punjab Congress, the move has enabled the chief minister to blunt the attack by the dissident ministers and MLAs against him.At the same time, it would enable the chief minister to counter the Majha brigade that has been the moving force in the dissent against him.The Majha brigade, comprising Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Randhawa, has been the epicentre of the power dynamics.But things changed after it joined leaders questioning the CM on sacrilege and police firing cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-gets-into-damage-control-mode-holds-secret-meeting-with-dissenter-partap-bajwa-setback-for-navjot-sidhu-270329
