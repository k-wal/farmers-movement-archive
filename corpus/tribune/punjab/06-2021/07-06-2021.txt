Sero-survey should also be taken up from time to time, he added.The chief minister expressed satisfaction over the progress of the 'Corona Mukt Pendu Abhiyan' in villages, where almost 1.5 crore individuals (37 lakh households) have already been screened.These efforts had resulted in identification of 5,889 infected patients who have been assisted as per protocols.Asserting that Punjab cannot afford to let its guard down despite the decline in the caseload, Singh said the virus mutations were a matter of concern even though the CFR was lower than the first wave.Referring to the spread of black fungus, the chief minister said there are currently 381 cases of mucormycosis in the state, of which 38 have already been cured and 265 are undergoing treatment.Punjab's Covid-19 expert group head Dr K K Talwar informed the meeting that almost 30 per cent of patients is showing post-Covid complications and continue to be symptomatic.Patients are taking almost three months to get back to normal, and thus, there is a need for strict monitoring, he added. ‚Äî PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-punjab-announces-specialist-group-to-frame-paediatric-treatment-protocol-264913

He asked the Punjab government to take strict action against the erring government officials.Sampla concluded by saying that it is the duty of the state governments to ensure proper implementation of post-matric scholarship scheme and ensure that SC students face no hardship. He asked government of Punjab to fulfil its duty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-roll-numbers-for-2-lakh-sc-students-national-sc-commission-seeks-immediate-reply-from-punjab-govt-264887

Doses available in March was 13.7 lakh, but only 6.5 lakh utilised( unutilised 50 %).The dossier prepared further says that the wastage of vaccine in Punjab was 2.5 %. As many as 56.84 lakh free doses were provided to the State by Centre;1.4 lakh doses wasted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/union-government-mulls-counter-offensive-against-its-opponents-punjab-among-states-in-its-crosshairs-264831
07-06-2021||Groundwater Conservation||Short-duration paddy varieties can turn the tide||Baldev Singh Dhillon and Raj KumarPUNJAB is facing an alarming situation with respect to groundwater resources. In the report, Groundwater Resources of Punjab ‚Äî as on March 31, 2017, prepared by the Central Ground Water Board and Water Resources & Environment Directorate of Punjab, it is highlighted in red, ‚ÄúIf the present rate of extraction continues, the available groundwater resources may exhaust in 20 to 25 years.‚ÄùIndia faced severe food shortage during the 1950s and 1960s. In the second half of the 1960s, high-yielding varieties of wheat and paddy and their complementary production-protection technology packages became available. The government formulated a landmark policy of fixing the MSP and procurement of the produce, and took many other initiatives for national food security. These developments gave an impetus to paddy cultivation in Punjab. From 1965-66 to 2019-20, the area under paddy increased 10.7 times (2.93 to 31.41 lakh hectares) and the production 43.1 times (4.39 to 189.12 lakh tonnes) in Punjab. During the same period, the number of tubewells increased from 26,000 to 14.76 lakh and the cropping intensity from 129% to 190% as a result of intensive agriculture. With these developments, Punjab became the food bowl of the country and helped the nation to not only become food-secure but also an exporter. This was, however, accompanied by some challenges of which depletion of groundwater resources is the most serious one.To tackle this situation, short-duration paddy varieties and water-saving technologies, notably laser land levelling and tar-wattar DSR (direct seeding of rice), have been developed. The state government also issued/passed an ordinance/Act in 2008-09 to ensure the transplanting of paddy after a notified date. These interventions, accompanied by campaigns on groundwater-saving, did slow down the rate of water depletion but did not fully check the same. Thus, there is an urgent need to create more awareness among the masses in this regard. With this objective, economic returns from the cropping system in two regions of the state having a similar cropping system but a contrasting groundwater table scenario is being presented.During 2018, the lowest groundwater table was observed in Sangrur district (32.4 metres) followed by its neighbouring Barnala district (29.7 metres). These districts also occupied the top positions for the rate of fall of groundwater table between 1998 and 2018. These districts, having paddy as the main kharif season crop accounting for about 91% of the area, were selected to represent the most threatened region as far as the annual fall of groundwater level and its depth are concerned and designated as Region-I (R-I). For comparison, two other contiguous districts identified are Amritsar and Tarn Taran, representing a region contrasting with R-I on the groundwater scenario but having a similar cropping system (92% of kharif area under paddy). These districts are designated as Region-II (R-II). The average annual rate of water table fall in R-II (1998 to 2018) was almost half (43-57 cm) than that in R-I (103-107 cm).Ten other districts having a higher groundwater table than Amritsar-Tarn Taran were excluded from the analysis (the exclusion of these districts is discussed in detail in PAU‚Äôs monthly magazine Progressive Farming, April 2020).Varietal patternPaddy and wheat are the predominant crops occupying about 90% of the cultivated area in both regions. Basmati was cultivated in about 7% and 56% of the kharif area in R-I and R-II, respectively. The varietal pattern of wheat and basmati is similar in both regions but in the case of parmal, there is a contrast. In R-I, long-duration paddy varieties (Pusa 44, Peeli Pusa) were cultivated on about 55% of the parmal area and the short-duration varieties (PR 121, PR 126 and PR 124) on only 21% of the area. In R-II, the shorter-duration varieties occupied 77% of the area and Pusa 44 merely 0.4%.Pusa 44 matures in about 160 days after seeding and Peeli Pusa takes one week more. On the other hand, PR 121 and PR 126, the most popular among short-duration varieties, mature in 140 and 123 days, respectively, and PR 124 matures in 135 days. These short-duration varieties need 15-25% lesser irrigations than Pusa 44. There is also saving in pesticides and labour.Farmers in R-I are probably attracted by the higher yield of long-duration varieties. Though the yields of PR 121, PR 124 and PR 126 are marginally lower than that of Pusa 44, the net income from shorter and longer-duration varieties is comparable. Paddy straw management of short-duration varieties is easier as they produce lesser biomass. By vacating the field earlier they also widen the window between paddy harvesting and wheat sowing. Further, farmers cultivating long-duration varieties are also incurring additional expenditure on deepening and installing submersible pumps. With the farmers not having to pay for electricity, the state bears the huge expenses. Above all, the underground water reservoir is being depleted which cannot be easily replenished.The average yield of wheat, parmal paddy and basmati is higher by 893, 406 and 451 kg per hectare, respectively, in R-I than in R-II. Thus, evidently, the net income is also higher in R-I. The annual returns are higher by more than Rs 20,000 per hectare in R-I than in R-II. One may be tempted to attribute the higher yield of parmal in R-I to long-duration varieties. The average yield of wheat and basmati is also higher in R-I, although there is no appreciable difference in the varietal pattern in both regions. So, the higher yield must be due to favourable agro-climatic conditions in R-I. Therefore, by adopting short-duration varieties, the returns will continue to be higher in R-I than those in R-II.Action planThe conservation of underground water resources is more badly needed in R-I than in R-II. Thus, there is an urgent need that the farmers in R-I should not only cultivate shorter-duration varieties but also transplant parmal after the notified date. We, the people of Punjab, particularly the opinion-makers, must realise that there is a need to resort to each and every practice of water conservation as this region is dangerously placed. For this, campaigns should be continuously organised for greater awareness; otherwise, we are inviting desertification.It is the duty of all to conserve the rich, inherited natural resource base. It is an investment for the survival of the farming system not only for the future generations but also for the present generation. With the present practices of groundwater extraction, the available groundwater resources of Punjab may exhaust in 20 to 25 years. Let us join hands to meet the challenge of conserving water resources by their judicious use.The authors are V-C and Principal Extension Scientist (agricultural economics), respectively, PAU, Ludhiana||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/short-duration-paddy-varieties-can-turn-the-tide-264670

These include a cut in the commission given to commission agents, mandi labour charges, charges for packaging and transportation charges among others. In all, over Rs 70 per quintal has been deducted from the ex-mandi delivery price.The state was to get Rs 2,333.89 per quintal , including Rs 1,975 per quintal MSP of wheat and incidental charges. But the state, after these cuts, will get Rs 2,181.64 per quintal.While the RDF of Rs 59.25 per quintal has been cut on wheat (after it was cut on the paddy procured last year), cuts have also been imposed on deliveries to be made from mandis to FCI godowns and for deliveries from agency godowns to the FCI godowns. These cuts are on account of labour charges, transportation charges, custody and maintenance charges, besides interest charges. ‚ÄúIf all these cuts are taken into account, the total cut imposed is Rs 150 per quintal,‚Äù said a senior officer in the Punjab government.The charges for incidentals, allowed under the provisional cost, which has been conveyed to the state government through a letter dated June 4, also says that to ensure the proper utilisation of subsidy, the FCI may insist on requisite certificates and its agencies before the release of incidentals on account of statutory charges. Punjab Food and Supply Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said there was little doubt that Punjab was being targeted by the BJP-led government for the ongoing farmers struggle.‚ÄúThis is like an undeclared emergency. On a government-to-government basis, there should have been some discussion before this arbitrary cut was announced,‚Äù he said, showing his displeasure. Officials in the Food and Supply Department say that since the sharp cut is not acceptable to Punjab, the state will refer the case to a committee to resolve the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-rural-development-fund-for-punjab-264707

With 321 deaths, the district has a fatality rate of 4.21 per cent, which is far higher than the national average of 1.2 per cent.Health officials blamed lack of awareness among the public and over-reliance on quacks and semi-qualified medical practitioners for the high fatality rate. However, these are not the only factors for the high death rate. The district has insufficient infrastructure and absence of qualified medical practitioners.Harbhajan Kaur (65) of Pakhoke village fell sick in April. She continued to take medicine from a quack for 10 days. Finally, she was shifted to the Civil Hospital on May 3 where she died same day.The district does not have a single ventilator. It has to refer its patients to Amritsar. It has only two anaesthetists while it needs six. The district does not have any Intensive Care Unit. Besides, 100 posts of medical officer have been lying vacant for long.Deputy Commissioner Kulwant Singh said the district administration was making every effort to contain the spread of the disease and check the fatality rate.

He was speaking during the 37th Operation Bluestar anniversary observed in the Golden Temple complex today.Despite the Covid threat and weekend lockdown, a large number of devotees throng the complex that was under tight security. Amid chanting of pro-Khalistan slogans and carrying placards of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale by separatist Sikh organisation activists, the event passed off peacefully.The ‚Äòparallel‚Äô acting jathedar of Akal Takht Dhyan Singh Mand, 2015 Sarbat Khalsa main organiser Jarnail Singh Sakhira, SAD (Amritsar) chief Simranjit Singh Mann and actor Deep Sidhu, who was charged for provoking the Red Fort violence, were also present.Justifying the pro-Khalistan slogans, Giani Harpreet Singh said the event could never be forgetton by the Sikhs. ‚ÄúIt is like an irretrievable wound and such slogans help them relieving their pain and anger against the atrocities of governments‚Äù, he said.Referring to blood-stained pages of the Sikh history, he said like the earlier massacres of the Sikhs in 1746 and 1762 by the Mughal empire that were termed ‚Äòchhota ghallughara‚Äô and ‚Äòvadda ghallughara‚Äô in which 7,000 and 35,000 Sikhs were killed, the 1984 Army attack was nothing short of ‚Äúghallughara‚Äù.Delivering his customary message from the podium of Akal Takht, Giani Harpreet Singh said words like ‚ÄòOperation Blue Star‚Äô or ‚ÄòSaka Neelataara‚Äô must be avoided to refer the event as these terms hurt the sentiments. ‚ÄúGhallughara was the appropriate terminology for it‚Äù, he said.He said many e-mails were received demanding to term it ‚ÄúAmritsar Sikh genocide‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt was never restricted to Amritsar only, but 37 other Sikh shrines across the country were targeted. The genocide had started on the streets of Delhi, Kanpur, Tata Nagar and other areas between November 1-4 in 1984‚Äù, he said. He said the Sikh organisations should unite keeping aside their differences of opinion.Later on, in the presence of Takht Kesgarh Sahib Jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh, head priest of Akal Takht Giani Gurmukh Singh and SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur, the jathedar honoured Ishar Singh, son of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, along with Bhai Manjit Singh and Satwant Kaur, brother and daughter of Shaheed Bhai Amrik Singh, former federation head, with siropa at Akal Takht.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/operation-bluestar-tagged-as-ghallughara-264712

However, the project hit a roadblock when the Union Government dithered on giving it the mandatory forest clearance. The forest clearance has now been granted following which the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) has floated a global tender. The venture will be operated on a public-private partnership (PPP) mode.The project has been rechristened as the ‚ÄòInternational Standard Tourism Theme Destination in Punjab.‚Äô The last date for submitting proposals is June 30.Sources say real-estate prices in and around the lake in the Dhar block are set to see a manifold increase. Politicians and bureaucrats, too, are keeping themselves abreast of the developments.‚ÄúConvention centers, eco villas and eco resorts will be established. Nature and water sports activities will also be held in the lake,‚Äù said Sanjeev Tiwari, Divisional Forest Officer. Officials are pegging the cost of the venture at anything between Rs 300 and Rs 400 crore.‚ÄúA lot of money is going to be invested. Land prices have already increased ever since the tender was published. A majority of the hoteliers had closed shop in the past two years following the Covid-induced inertia. Now they see a glimmer of hope. Moreover, the construction of new highways means tourists now cross over to the neighbouring states of HP and J&K without making a stopover in the area as they used to do earlier. Now, as the project comes up, the same hoteliers see some hope,‚Äù said a prominent businessman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ranjit-sagar-dam-islands-in-for-facelift-264717

The Shiromani Akali Dal has also promised the Deputy Chief Minister post to a Dalit leader.To prove mobilisation by the BJP at the grassroots level, the party leaders have pointed towards ‚Äúardas‚Äù by a preacher, Gurmel Singh Khalsa, a former Dalit sarpanch of Bir Talab Gurdwara in Bathinda, where he can be heard in a video wishing the next Punjab CM should be from Scheduled Caste and the BJP deserved appreciation for making a similar announcement.Similar ‚Äúardas‚Äù has been performed in some other gurdwaras, it has been pointed out. ‚ÄúIt is part of ‚Äòyug parivartan‚Äô programme being undertaken by the saffron party,‚Äù said a Dalit leader from Doaba.In Punjab‚Äôs poll arena, Dalits with 33 per cent vote share hold sway.

Notably, if a beneficiary is marked absent in the muster roll for a week after allotment of work, he can‚Äôt claim the unemployment allowance.It is learnt that officials of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat on purpose don‚Äôt inform MGNREGA workers so as to make them stay absent and lose their right to unemployment allowance.In one such instance, Kiranjeet Kaur of Dharoki village in Nabha town was not informed about her allotment letter of work by officials. However, the officials claimed they had issued a letter to her and had conveyed it to their leader. Ironically, the letter of work allotment, accessed by The Tribune, was issued on May 20 to Kiranjeet Kaur, but she was enrolled for the work which had already begun on May 19. The enrolment letter was handed over on Monday after The Tribune raised the issue. The officials said they would ensure that workers got 100 days of employment as guaranteed under the Act.It is learnt that the unemployment allowance has to be provided by the erring officials from their own pocket. That provision, said a source, prompts officials to use this modus operandi of first enrolling the workers without informing them and then marking them absent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-informed-of-work-allotment-mgnrega-workers-264723

Farmers raised anti-government slogans and said the agitation would continue until the three laws were withdrawn.Farmers reached Singhu in the evening.Meanwhile, traffic on the national highway moved at a snail‚Äôs pace, causing inconvenience to commuters. Along with farmers from Ambala, a large number of peasants from Punjab joined the convoy.Charuni, who reached Ambala from Tohana, said: ‚ÄúThere are 2,000 to 2,500 vehicles in the cavalcade. It is just a trailer from one district. Look out for June 10, when even a larger cavalcade will leave from Panipat.‚ÄùOn Saturday, farmers burnt the copies of farm laws in front of the residences of BJP leaders.‚ÄúThe BJP‚Äôs popularity has dipped over the past six months. The defeat in West Bengal is a proof of that. The party is in for another drubbing in the Uttar Pradesh elections,‚Äù said Charuni.He added, ‚ÄúOn November 25 last year, the Delhi Chalo movement was launched from Ambala. Farmers had reached Delhi after breaking barricades and facing water cannons. Today, thousands of farmers assembled here to start another journey towards Delhi. The enthusiasm shown by farmers has infused new energy in the movement.‚Äù||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-convoy-of-2k-vehicles-led-by-gurnam-singh-charuni-reaches-singhu-264470

07-06-2021||Amritsar||Bluestar anniversary: Akal Takht tags Army attack on Golden Temple complex as ‚Äô84 da ghallughara‚Äô||Akal Takht officiating Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh emphasised on maintaining unity among the Sikh community and tagged the event as ‚ÄúChaurasi (84) Da Ghallughara‚Äù (holocaust) , during the 37th Operation Bluestar anniversary observed in the Golden Temple complex on Sunday.Delivering his customary ‚Äòsandesh‚Äô (message) from the podium of Akal Takht, he said that words like ‚ÄòOperation Bluestar‚Äô or ‚ÄòSaka Neelataara‚Äô must be avoided to refer to the event as it hurt the sentiments.Amid chanting of mild pro-Khalistan slogans and placards of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the event went peacefully.¬†The parallel Jathedar of Akal Takht Dhyan Singh Mand, along with 2015 Sarbat Khalsa main organiser Jarnail Singh Sakhira also read out ‚Äòsandesh‚Äô.SAD (Amritsar) chief Simranjit Singh Mann, and the prime accused of the Red Fort violence out on bail Deep Sidhu with their supporters were present on the occasion. ¬†Referring to blood-stained pages of Sikh history, Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said that like the earlier massacres of Sikhs in 1746 and 1762 by the Mughal empire were termed as ‚Äòchhota ghallughara‚Äô and ‚Äòvadda ghallughara‚Äô in which 7,000 and 35,000 Sikhs were killed, respectively, the 1984 Army attack was nothing short of it.Comparing the Indian Army‚Äôs attack on Golden Temple and Akal Takht with the war between the two nations, he said, ‚ÄúLike, the earlier two ‚Äòghallugharas‚Äô, the third one occurred in 1984 when the Indian Army attacked the Golden Temple, the way China and Pakistan attacked India in 1962 and 1965. Upon attack, the Indian authorities did worse than what the winning forces did with the defeated nation‚Äôs citizens,‚Äù he said.He said that many emails were received demanding to term the event as ‚ÄúAmritsar Sikh genocide‚Äù, but the attack was not executed only on the Golden Temple complex but on 37 other Sikh shrines across the country.‚ÄúIt was not constrained to Amritsar only. In 1984, the genocide had started on the streets of Delhi, Kanpur, Tata Nagar and other areas between November 1-4. Hence, it should be termed as ‚Äô84 da ghallughara,‚Äù he said.Justifying the ‚ÄúKhalistan‚Äù slogans, he said that the event could never be forgotten and remained like an irretrievable wound and its pain is relieved with such slogans.He said that the Sikh organisations, be it SGPC, DSGMC, CKD, Takht Hazur Sahib board, Patna Sahib board and other Sikh organisations, should all unite keeping aside their differences of opinion.‚ÄúIt was fortunate that the Sikh community reacted promptly if any wrong was done to its significance. No voice was raised when masjid was demolished to pave way for raising mandir or Article 370 was abolished, yet when recently a Sikh was thrashed in UP, the Sikhs not only from India but from UK, US and Canada raised voice against it. This was an example of our live soul and our strength which has to be maintained,‚Äù he said.Later on, in the presence of Takht Kesgarh Sahib Jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh, and head priest of Akal Takht Giani Gurmukh Singh and SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur, the Jathedar honoured Ishar Singh, son of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale along with Bhai Manjit Singh and Satwant Kaur, the brother and daughter of Shaheed Bhai Amrik Singh, former federation head, with ‚Äòsiropa‚Äô at the Akal Takht.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bluestar-anniversary-akal-takht-tags-army-attack-on-golden-temple-complex-as-84-da-ghallughara-264314
