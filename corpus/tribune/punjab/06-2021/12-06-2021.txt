He was then brought to Arunachal Pradesh and an Itanagar court granted him bail on Saturday.According to police, the YouTuber was enraged after Ering wrote a letter to the PM seeking a ban on PUBG, as banning the online game would have meant a loss in income for him.

The other alternative is to charge 0.1 per cent, which is well within the powers of the GST Council, and this measure should be in place till the pandemic is over.Releasing his remarks and interventions made at the 44th meeting of the GST Council, the Punjab Finance Minister urged the ruling government to include representatives of the Indian National Congress (INC) in the Group of Ministers (GOM). “It is preposterous that the principal opposition party of India in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha has been excluded in the GoM,” Manpreet Singh Badal said.The Punjab Finance Minister also asked the chairperson to operationalise the position of Vice-Chairperson of the GST Council, the press note said. Further, the GST Council must have its own secretariat, and it should be empowered to adjudicate on a Dispute Resolution Mechanism where there are divergent views.He regretted that the GoM is not acting with compassion, and it is parroting the Union Government, perhaps out of the fear that they may not be included from a future GoM. He also called upon the look at the entire GST issue holistically so that a due, considerate and humane approach is adopted to help ameliorate the sufferings of the people of India.Manpreet Singh Badal reminded the GoM that health care services, including all recognized systems of medicine (Allopathy, Ayurveda, Unani, Homoeopathy, Yoga), are already exempt under GST. The supply of medicine that is a part of the treatment package is also exempt since the entire transaction is considered a service.He criticised the discussion for restricting GST on government hospitals versus private hospitals stating that both treat the people of India. The idea that we need GST registration and billing and later file returns are farcical. What would a consumer feel seeing GST reflected on an invoice, the Punjab Finance Minister asked?Manpreet Singh Badal also criticised the attempt to garner revenues from furnaces from crematoriums stating that this category should be even above the exemption category.“Is this how the Union Government wishes to collect revenues,” he asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gst-councils-gom-should-stop-acting-like-an-autocrat-manpreet-badal-267369

Designated senior advocate by the Punjab and Haryana High Court way back in 1976, the 93-year-old former Advocate-General of Punjab and Haryana was always youthful in his spirits and lively in body and mind. No wonder, the news about his passing away this morning was met with incredulity.Disbelief was the reaction as lawyers recalled regular meetings with meticulously dressed Chaudhary Harbhagwan Singh before the High Court shifted from physical to virtual mode of hearing following Covid outbreak in April last year.Describing him as “remarkable, unique man”, those who know him say even his body did not give way to the years. Upright as he was, Chaudhary Harbhagwan Singh was always steady on his feet and moved in an energetic and confident way. Up-to-date on law, prevailing conditions and current events, he would dig in the past only to apply his experience to the present and the future.Associated with several high-profile cases involving politicians and inter-state disputes, he practised in the Supreme Court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The important cases he was associated with include the Satluj-Yamuna link canal dispute between Haryana and Punjab and the Sahajdhari Sikhs.Available information suggests he was also associated with land reforms during the time of Punjab’s former Chief Minister Partap Singh Kairon and former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter, who recently retired as a Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Expressing grief over the demise of Harbhagwan Singh, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana and Leader of the Opposition, said: “He made his invaluable contribution to the establishment of Haryana and always fought in the interests of the state. I have today lost a close friend and an important family member”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/chaudhary-harbhagwan-singh-age-was-just-a-number-for-ex-ag-of-punjab-haryana-267216

Since day one, I have been saying that if appointing someone else as the PPCC chief strengthens the party, it should be done,” he said, while participating in a protest against the hike in diesel and petrol prices.Hindu or Dalit face?The Kharge panel has suggested that the CM should lead the party in the poll year and Navjot Sidhu must be suitably accommodatedBut the CM has opposed Sidhu being made the PPCC chief. Sources say there are little chances of Jakhar being replacedIf Jakhar is replaced, the role could be given to either a Hindu or a Dalit faceJakhar’s statement gains weight in the wake of reports suggesting that all sections of society are represented in the leadership and party positions, including restructuring of the PPCC. Though the Kharge panel has sought suitable accommodation of Sidhu, the CM has opposed him being made the PPCC chief. Sources said under the given circumstances, there were little chances of Jakhar being replaced. In the eventuality of replacing Jakhar, the role could be given to either a Hindu or a Dalit face.Meanwhile, it is learnt that Kharge held a virtual meeting with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi today. Earlier, the PPCC chief stated that PM Narendra Modi’s arrogance in power was devastating India. “Even after lakhs of people died, the Centre has not woken up from its slumber and now by hiking petrol and diesel prices, it has started to break the back of the common man economically,” he said.He said in the past 13 months the rate of petrol has gone up by Rs 25.72, while that of diesel by Rs 23.93. Taking on the Centre over the vaccine policy, he said it was the sum of unbearable errors of judgement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-quit-if-it-helps-party-punjab-congress-chief-sunil-jakhar-267073

Now, it is Rs 32.“The government should stop imposing excise duty on petrol and diesel. It should come under the purview of Goods and Services Tax. We demand a complete rollback of fuel price hike,” Venugopal, who is the Congress general secretary, said.Ajay Maken led a protest against rising fuel prices at petrol pumps in Rajinder Nagar and Janpath.Party leaders said protests are being held at petrol pumps across the county by local units in compliance with Covid-19 protocols. Besides the steep hikes in rates of diesel and petrol, prices of other commodities of daily use like cooking oil and gas have also registered a manifold increase, senior leaders of the party said.Protests were held at various places like Amritsar, Mohali, Kurali, Patiala, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Panchkula, Hisar, Gurgaon, Kaithal, Ambala, Panipat, Karnal, Fatehabad, Rohtak and Faridabad.In Amritsar, some protesters set fire to an old car, saying they wanted to send a message to the Centre that common people are unable to afford vehicles because of the high cost of fuel.Carrying posters and placards that read “Jumlon Ki Sarkar”, “Tel Ki Mar” and “Tel Ka Khel”, Congress workers raised slogans against the Centre and demanded a rollback of the price hikes.The party's workers staged a street play in Panchkula to highlight the plight of the common people as a result of the rise in prices of fuel and other essential commodities.Some even rode bullock carts and horse carts as a mark of protest.In Haryana's Kaithal, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala led the protest.

12-06-2021||Naina Mishra||High caseload attributed to Delta variant in Chandigarh, Punjab||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 9The highly transmissible Delta variant or B.1.617.2 has spread its tentacles in Chandigarh and Punjab, according to genomic characterisation study conducted by scientists from the National Centre for Disease Control and CSIR, Delhi.The study – Genomic Characterisation and Epidemiology of an Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variant in Delhi – has appeared in pre-print server and is yet to be peer-reviewed.The scientists studied the main lineages of SARS CoV-2 in north India and found prevalence of the Delta variant in Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Leh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand. The Delta variant was reported to be the massive surge in cases in these areas in April.Genomic surveillance data from Delhi and surrounding states also shows an early phase of the upsurge driven by the entry of the more transmissible B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant – first detected in the UK) into the region in January.This was followed by seeding of the B.1.617 variant of concern – which too is highly transmissible – with rapid expansion of B.1.617.2 sub-lineage outpacing all other lineages.The B.1.617.2 variant has higher transmissibility than the Alpha variant in north India, even in Punjab, where B.1.1.7 had reached close to 100 per cent prevalence, reveals the latest study.According to the scientists, the April outbreak in Delhi was preceded by outbreaks in the states of Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab. The outbreak in Punjab has been related to the introduction of B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant).The scientists have found a strong connection between Delhi and Punjab, with respect to, B.1.1.7 variant.The B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant) outbreak in Punjab points out at a super-spreader event like mass public gatherings and rallies held in different parts of north India since January 2021, and highlights the important role of social factors in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.The scientists found the same pattern in Punjab and Delhi with initial seeding of Alpha variant between February and March replaced by B.1.617.2 (Delta variant) in April 2021.The study found that the surge of SARS-CoV2 infections in Delhi and nearby states was best explained by the introduction of a new highly transmissible VOC – B.1.617.2 (Delta variant) – with likely immune-evasion properties, insufficient neutralising immunity and social behavior that promoted transmission.The B.1.617 variant was first detected in India and was divided into three lineages – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and B.1.617.3.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said only B.1.617.2, one of the three strains of the B.1.617 Covid-19 variant was first detected in India.The variant has now spread to over 63 countries and is believed to be 50 per cent more transmissible than Alpha.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-caseload-attributed-to-delta-variant-in-chandigarh-punjab-266102
