Why did the BJP fail to ensure the supply of adequate vaccines to the country?” he asked.The Congress leader said all vaccine supplies, whether from domestic or foreign suppliers, are totally being controlled by the Union government.“It is a matter of great shame that the Union government failed to negotiate supplies of vaccines with both domestic and foreign manufacturers in 2020. The manufacturing capacity of the SII and Covaxin should also have been expanded in a big way. All this, despite the fact that India is a pharma hub of the entire world,” he said in a statement issued here.Bittu said only 4.29 lakh doses of Covishield were received by Punjab so far, despite the fact that the state placed an order for 30 lakh doses with the SII as soon as the Centre announced its new vaccine policy.Apart from paying Rs 18.27 crore for 5.43 lakh vaccine doses, the Punjab government has paid Rs 22.88 crore as advance for the procurement of 6.88 lakh vaccine doses, which are yet to be received, he said.According to the Union health ministry’s data, as on June 1, Punjab’s vaccine coverage was 14.13 per cent, which was lower than that of the neighbouring states and Union Territory because the state has been getting “very less” vaccine supplies, which is highly “discriminatory”, Bittu said, adding that stepmotherly treatment is being meted out to the border state.“We had demanded that vaccines be provided for free to every citizen of the country. Can Hardeep Singh Puri explain why the BJP came out with the policy of paid vaccination by the states and private hospitals with no cap on the margin?“Earlier, the Centre had capped the charges to be taken by the private hospitals at a maximum of Rs 100 but now, it has left it open to the private hospitals to charge as much as they want,” the Congress MP said.“This loot by the private hospitals, if any, is the result of the faulty policies of the central government. The Punjab government has nothing to do with this,” he added.Questioning the Union minister, Bittu asked, “If Hardeep Puri is speaking of Punjab and its issues as a BJP worker, where was he when Punjab was faced with an acute shortage of oxygen and there was a risk of patients dying in Amritsar due to it? Did he arrange even one tanker or cylinder of oxygen for the citizens of Punjab during the time of acute shortage of oxygen?” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ravneet-singh-bittu-from-punjab-slams-union-minister-puri-over-covid-vaccine-issue-264429

These sub-missions include safe food, clean water, green Punjab, road safety, nutrition, waste management, khedo Punjab, healthy soil, clean air and preventive health.In his address on World Environment Day, the Chief Minister hoped that this initiative would lead to better coordination among all stakeholders viz. Punjab Government, research institutions, industries, NGOs and the public to ensure sustainable and environment-friendly model of development.He appealed to one and all to preserve nature and natural resources, to make Punjab’s environment pollution-free by making optimal use of groundwater, diversifying into less water-intensive crops, not burning paddy straw and checking the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides.Showing concern over the pollution in rivers, the CM said concerted efforts of environmentalists like Sant Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal and head of Namdhari Sect Baba Uday Singh had led to considerable improvement in the quality of water in Kali Bein and Buddha Nullah, which flow into the Sutlej.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/on-environment-day-punjab-cm-unveils-revamped-mission-tandarust-264156

Last year, only seven persons died of the viral infection in the two months, according to the official data.Civil Surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh did not respond to repeated phone calls. However, when questioned about the reason for the rise in the death rate, a senior doctor claimed that many persons might have contracted the virus but never visited a doctor. “They may have never been diagnosed and died at their homes without medical care,” he said, refuting the claims about hiding the number of Covid-19 deaths.As per the data available with the Death and Birth Registration wing of the Municipal Corporation (MC), Amritsar, a total of 983 deaths were registered in April last year. However, the toll rose to 1,749 in the corresponding month this year. In May 2020, the MC registered 1,131 deaths, which rose to around 2,000 in the corresponding month this year.Though the data for the corresponding month this year is yet to be compiled, the entries in zonal offices reveal that around 1,500 death certificates have been issued so far. The MC staff claimed that entries for around 500 deaths reported at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Civil Hospital and Community Health Center in Verka were yet to be compiled.During the first wave of pandemic, the MC had conducted door-to-door screening and contact tracing. The MC control room did more than five calls in 2.5 lakh households through auto-operated commuter calls.However, during the second wave, no such practice was adopted for mass screening and tracing Covid-19 patients.Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu said: “Last year, we were proactive against the Covid-19 spread and yielded good results. This time, the district administration and health authorities did not make such efforts and the death toll rose. Still, there is a need to trace every Covid-infected person in order to take care of him/her and avoid the spread of the virus.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fatalities-up-77-in-amritsar-but-cause-in-3-000-victims-unknown-264147

Experts say it could be due to excessive immune response related to Covid.If treated on time, the fatality rate is quite low. Most children with MIS-C test negative for Covid, but have anti-bodies and hence, they can't spread the infection. Doctors say the biggest risk with MIS-C is the speed with which it advances.They say since most patients remain asymptomatic, it is important for parents to be watchful of symptoms that may occur two to six weeks after recovery from Covid.Dr Jagjit Singh, a pediatrician, said, “We have seen a few suspected cases of MIS-C in Bathinda.

Why was the decision taken in the first place?Puri, who attacked the state government claiming that private hospitals in Mohali charged Rs 3,200 and more for a Covid shot that cost much less, also took on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who hit out at the Centre with “where are the vaccines for our children” charge.Stating that vaccines “sold for profit” were for the 18-44 age group, Puri said: “Vaccines for children are being thrown into the garbage in Rajasthan and being used for profiteering in Punjab — the two Congress-ruled states.”Mayawati, BSP PresidentInhuman, condemnableThe Punjab Government is buying vaccines at Rs 400 each from the Centre and selling these to private hospitals for Rs 1,060 instead of passing the benefit to the people through government hospitals. Profiting during an emergency is inhuman, condemnable and saddening.Referring to the Punjab Health Minister’s statement that “he was not in charge of vaccines”, Puri today wondered who then took the decision and why it was rolled back. “Why did the government roll back the decision if nothing was wrong with it? Why did the Health Minister say he does not have control over vaccines? Was there an arrangement between the Punjab Government and hospitals,” he wondered, adding that he was not raising these questions as a Union minister but as a ‘karyakarta’ of the party from Punjab.The minister said it was “shameful” that the Punjab Government was trying to profit from vaccines meant for people. “When we raised the issue, Capt withdrew the order, which means it was fishy. Why was the decision taken in the first place?” he said.Puri said as per Punjab Government officer and in charge of Covid-19 vaccination, Vikas Garg, 4.29 lakh doses of Covishield were procured at Rs 13.25 crore (Rs 309 per dose on an average), while 1,14,190 Covaxin doses were procured at Rs 4.70 crore (Rs 412 per dose on an average).Quoting Garg’s order, he also questioned how the government was planning to get back the vaccines already administered.Puri also slammed the Congress for opposing the three farm laws and the Central Vista project. “The pro-farmer Modi government has agreed to all demands of farmers and taken several steps, including DBT on MSP, for their benefit,” Puri, who had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from Amritsar in 2019, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/profiteering-from-vaccine-shameful-hardeep-puri-264145

The assertion came after the Bench was told that the girl, minor at the time of marriage, was residing with the man on her free will.The matter was placed before Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill’s Bench after the man filed a petition seeking the quashing of the FIR registered initially for wrongful confinement under Section 346 of the IPC. The offence of kidnapping under Sections 363 and 366 of the IPC was later added to the FIR.Justice Gill observed the girl was alleged to be minor at the time of performing marriage. But the fact remained that she performed marriage with the petitioner on her free will. The parents were legitimate legal guardians under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, in the case of a minor and the marriage was voidable in terms of the Hindu Marriage Act.But since the couple chose their life partners against the wishes of their parents and was carrying on the relationship and living together, the court could take the cognisance of the fact that the welfare of the ward was of paramount importance in accordance with Section 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act and could not be ignored.Justice Gill added it was undisputed that the girl had solemnised marriage with the petitioner and their marriage certificate had also been placed on record. The petitioner, being the husband, was in relationship with the girl. In terms of Sections 19 and 21 of the Guardians and Wards Act read with Sections 6, 10 and 13 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, he had a “right to hold as the natural guardian of the minor Hindu girl married to him”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kidnapping-case-against-man-who-married-minor-quashed-by-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-264135

Two others are still at large.Nanak Singh, SSPImmaculately plannedThe immaculate planning and brazenness with which the miscreants carried out the ‘raid’ has shocked both villagers and the police.SSP Nanak Singh said the brazenness with which the miscreants carried out the ‘raid’ had shocked both villagers and the police. Officers claimed they were surprised at the immaculate planning and clockwork execution with which the exercise was carried out.Early on Wednesday, seven persons walked into a house claiming to be CBI officials. A marriage ceremony had taken place at the residence a day ago and the team knew where precisely the gold ornaments and cash were lying. The team was led by a physically challenged man who claimed he was the ‘CBI director’, while a woman accomplice addressed herself as the ‘PA’ to the ‘CBI director’. The others designated themselves as ‘constables’.The ‘director’ flaunted his contacts in New Delhi and told the family he had conducted scores of similar raids across the country. Both he and his ‘PA’ carried pistols.The SSP said as soon as they got the information, they knew it was an insider job. Investigations revealed a woman living in the house was in touch with the suspects. She had been sending them the precise location and vital inputs, he said.The seven suspects had arrived at Pathankot, 30 km from Deeda Saansian, on Monday evening and checked into a plush hotel.On the day of the crime, they hired two Innova vehicles to carry out the ‘raid’. They finished the job within 20 minutes and tied the family members with a rope before driving back to Pathankot and then to Chandigarh.To ensure the two taxi drivers did not get suspicious, the suspects got down in front of the CBI office in Sector 30-A, Chandigarh, before dispersing.“We checked the movement of vehicles at toll plazas on the Deeda Sansian-Pathankot and Pathankot-Chandigarh highways. Later, we questioned the two drivers who came up with valuable information,” said the SSP.
