25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder asks PSPCL to ensure 8-hour power supply to farmers||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday directed PSPCL to ensure at least eight hours of uninterrupted power supply to farmers, and purchase deficient power from outside the state “at any cost” to prevent any supply disruption in the ongoing sowing season.Chairing a high-level meeting to review the power supply to the farmers during the ongoing kharif season, the chief minister also directed the finance department to release Rs 500 crore to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to tide over the financial crunch faced amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who was present at the meeting, assured that his department would release these funds without delay, according to an official statement.Notably, during the past few days, the farmers at various places have staged dharnas outside the power grid stations claiming they were not getting eight-hour supply in the paddy sowing season as had been assured.PSPCL officials have earlier said it was facing a severe financial crunch as a result of slowdown in consumption and revenue collection in the past one year due to the pandemic crisis.Reiterating his government’s commitment to providing continuous eight-hour supply to farmers in Punjab for sowing their crops, the chief minister directed PSPCL to purchase deficient power, if needed, from outside the state “at any cost”, to meet the government’s commitment to the farmers.There should be no disruption of power supply to the farmers, he added.

25-06-2021||Amritsar||Yet again, Langah pleads Akal Takht for pardon||Former Akali minister Sucha Singh Langah appeared before the Akal Takht on Friday and performed ‘ardas’ seeking atonement for his past “mistakes”. He atoned his “jane/anjaane hoian bhulan (deliberate or inadvertent follies)".“I committed a blunder for which I am ready to face any religious punishment decided by Akal Takht and Sangat. I am broken both mentally and physically,” he said.Langah was excommunicated by the Akal Takht on October 5, 2017, after a video allegedly showing him in a compromising position with a woman, went viral. The woman had accused him of sexually exploiting her. However, he was later acquitted by the court as the complainant withdrew the charges.Akal Takht’s officiating Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh made it clear that the Akal Takht’s verdict stands to date. “His case could be discussed with the Five High Priests before deciding upon his pleas. He is excommunicated and no one was supposed to have any association with him”, he said.Sources say that the former SAD MLA from Dera Baba Nanak intends to re-join mainstream politics, ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls.Citing Buta Singh’s instance, Langah said that being a ‘Nimana Sikh’, he was liable to be pardoned.Referring to his octogenarian parents and children, who also approached the Akal Takht submitting ‘apology’ letters on his behalf, Langah said, “For the sake of my family, my application should be considered by the Akal Takht Jathedar who could never be put under any political influence. Socially, my elder parents and children who are of marriageable age, suffered mental harassment. I am free from all charges legally and hope that Akal Takht will take a sympathetic view and accept me back”, he said.Langah claimed that for the past 72 days, he had been attending Golden Temple prayers seeking an apology for his mistakes and returned without approaching anyone.Earlier, in violation of Akal Takht’s directions, Langah had managed to partake ‘amrit sanchar’ from ‘panj pyaras’ during a programme held at Gurdwara Garhi Baba Banda Singh Bahadur in Dhariwal, Gurdaspur on August 3, 2020.Ironically, he was pronounced the tankhah (religious punishment) to perform Sewa at the gurdwara for 21 days, which he did before undergoing initiation of ‘amrit sanchar’ ceremony after the ‘panj pyaras’ exonerated him of all charges he faced. This development had created an uproar and those who helped him in this endeavour were penalised by the Akal Takht.Langah was booked for rape, cheating, ransom and criminal conspiracy on the statement of a woman on September 29, 2017, just prior to the Gurdaspur parliamentary bypoll. Later, the woman complainant withdrew her statements claiming that she was not the woman in the purported video and all her statements produced in court were either fake or taken under pressure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/yet-again-langah-pleads-akal-takht-for-pardon-273834

Three days later, another man named Oswald Rodrigues was the lone passenger on Air India's Mumbai-Dubai flight.Flights on India-Dubai routes were one of the most lucrative ones for carriers in the pre-pandemic times due to high demand. However, since the onset of the pandemic, traffic on India-Dubai routes have taken a major hit.India and its aviation sector had been especially reeling during April and May this year due to the pandemic's second wave, which is receding currently.India suspended its scheduled international flights on March 23, 2020, when the first wave struck the country. However, special international flights have been operating under Vande Bharat Mission since May 2020 and under air bubble pacts formed with around 27 countries since July 2020.Flights between India and the UAE have also been operating under an air bubble arrangement. Under this, limited flights can be operated between the two countries with restrictions.

The CFR has increased because the number of deaths and cases has not come down in the same proportion.For the past two weeks, the state’s case fatality ratio has remained above 5 per cent. Last week (16-23 June), the CFR was 6.1 per cent. The state’s overall CFR has also increased to 2.7 per cent from 2.6 per cent around 10 days back.

In the subsequent week (June 8 to 14), it rose further to 5.8.At present the state’s overall CFR is 2.7 per cent, which means for every 100 confirmed cases, 2.7 have passed away from the virus. In April, the CFR had come down to 2.4. This increase in fatality rate is being seen nationally also. It was 1.2 per cent around 10 days back, and now it is 1.3 per cent.At present, the CFR in Haryana is 1.2 per cent, Jammu & Kashmir 1.4 per cent; Himachal Pradesh 1.7 per cent and Chandigarh 1.3 per cent.

A survey conducted by the government indicated fruit orchards covering 33,948 hectares have come up in Fazilka district. “Due to the pandemic, training camps are not being held, but the department is trying to keep the farmers informed through social media. Farmers are advised to get soil and leaf tested at the state-of-the-art laboratory that has been set up at the Citrus Estate in Abohar.”Recently, farmers joined the two-hour online camps organised by the Punjab Agriculture University. Today, some experts visited orchards in Abohar to resolve the issues raised by farmers.A study by PAU scientists indicated kinnow fruit drop starts soon after flowering and leads to falling of small fruits. This is due to natural overproduction and not of much concern to the grower. Fruit drop leads to reduction of excess load on trees. The second wave of fruit drop commences approximately one to two months after bloom, young developing fruit abscise from trees with excessive fruit set in May, consisting of about 10 per cent of the total dropped fruits, the study indicates.Jagdev Singh Brar, who now prefers to grow vegetables and fruits in his Daulatpura village farms, said kinnow fruit produce might be 20 to 25 per cent less than that of the last year, which saw a bumper crop but prices nosedived due to glut.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-seminars-punjab-farmers-learn-techniques-on-social-media-273560

While ED officials maintained the designers had been summoned only as witnesses in the case, Khaira said the selective information released by ED about payments made to fashion designers five to six years ago on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding was nothing but an attempt “to malign my public image and aimed at character assassination”.

25-06-2021||---||Punjab blames centre for vaccine shortage||Chandigarh, June 24Before the third wave of Covid hits the country, states are making efforts to ensure vaccination of every citizen, but short supply of vaccines from the Centre has affected the drive in the state.Disclosing this here today, Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said an imbalanced supply of Covid vaccine had slowed down the pace of vaccination drive at large as Punjab had a strong infrastructure to administer vaccine to 3 lakh people per day.He said the vaccination data revealed that the speed of the vaccination drive had increased manifold in BJP-ruled states like MP, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. He said on an average, vaccination administered per day in MP before June 20 was 1.75 lakh and it had increased to 17 lakh on June 21 and it makes nine-time increase in total which exposed “disparity” being made by the Centre in supply of vaccines among states.Sidhu said MP had received the supply of 17 lakh doses in a day while Punjab had got just 16 lakh doses from June 1 to 24. He said the gap between demand and supply among states was a matter of concern and equal distribution of vaccines was important.He said the success of the drive majorly depended on the supply of vaccine whereas the vaccine received by Punjab in May was just 17 lakh doses which were less and the Centre assured to deliver 21 lakh doses in June. Till now the Centre only provided 16 lakh doses which shows that the uneven supply of vaccines was hitting the drive in Punjab.He asked the Centre to ensure supply of a minimum 2 lakh doses per day to Punjab so that the set target was achieved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-blames-centre-for-vaccine-shortage-273553

BKU Ugrahan leader Jagshir Singh Jhumba said: “Farmers are facing a lot difficulty in sowing paddy these days due to inadequate power supply by the PSPCL to tubewells. As a result, farmers are being forced to use generators to draw water, but it consumes 5 litre diesel per hour. With fuel rates skyrocketing, it has put an additional burden on farmers, many of whom cannot afford it.”Jhumba added: “We gheraoed the power grid near Multania road today but if the problem persists, we will stage protests outside other power grids in the district as well. The government had promised eight-hour uninterrupted supply during the paddy season. But a majority of farmers has been receiving only five to six-hour supply, making it difficult for them to carry out sowing.”BKU Dakonda leader Buta Singh said: “A small farmer is already burdened under increased input cost of sowing. Now, erratic supply has left them high and dry. The state government’s tall claims of having surplus power have fallen flat. It will have to make amends or it will bear the consequences in the upcoming elections.”Meanwhile, farm organisations in Mansa have started mobilising support for a massive protest on June 26. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protest-against-six-hour-supply-273554

Its financial implications are too high and the financially over-stretched state may not be able to bear the additional subsidy burden.Officials of the state power and finance departments say though the exact subsidy arising out of the dole has not been calculated, it may cost the government around Rs 6,000 crore.When the state government already finds it difficult to meet the existing power subsidy to agriculture sector, industry and other socially vulnerable sections (of Rs 10,668 crore for this fiscal) and each year a large part of the subsidy is carried forward to the next year, an additional subsidy would add to the burden of the state power utilities.Even this year, an amount of Rs 6,000 crore of power subsidy due in the last fiscal has not been paid to the PSPCL.Jasvir Singh Dhiman, president of PSEB Engineers Association, says: “Though we do not object to giving free power to any section, the government should at least pay the subsidy to PSPCL on time.”Officials in the power department told The Tribune that there were 75 lakh domestic power consumers in Punjab. Of these, over 15 lakh consumers, those belonging to SC, BC, from a minority religion and those in the Below Poverty Line category, got 200 units of free power and the subsidy amount arising on this account was Rs 1,600 crore.Rs16,668 cr subsidy bill pending||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/200-units-of-free-electricity-to-all-in-punjab-may-be-untenable-273555

Sometimes, we get power for just four-five hours and that too with interruptions, leaving paddy nurseries dry and the employed labour sitting idle,” claimed a member of a farmer union.Another member of the union claimed that in certain areas, PSPCL officials were yet to inform farmers as to when power supply would be restored, if at all.On paper, the PSPCL is well placed to meet the demand of 14,000 MW from its sources within Punjab and other central sector projects, including power exchange. “However, practically there are many constraints to fulfil the demand exceeding 13,000 MW as there is a limit of 7,300 MW to import power from outside Punjab, including power purchase as per demand,” said an expert.Satnam Singh Behru, senior leader of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association, said: “Irregular supply to fields and delayed rains mean that we are suffering losses as paddy fields are dry despite arranging labour, which is now without work.”The three private generators at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and GVK Goindwal have 3,920 MW capacity. At Talwandi Sabo, one unit of 660 MW capacity was shut down three months ago. The total thermal and hydro power available on paper today is about 6,000 MW.In the last few days, the maximum gross generation from all sources within the state remains about 5,600 MW and with the start of all units at Ropar and Lehra Mohabatt, it is roughly around 6,000 MW.“With maximum possible drawl of 7,300 MW from outside the total power availability may remain around 13,300 MW. Punjab touched maximum demand of over 13,100 MW on Wednesday but Punjab was overdrawing power of more than 400 MW at that time against scheduled drawl and it touched 7,500 MW,” said All-India Power Engineers Federation spokesman VK Gupta.Meanwhile, A Venu Prasad said PSPCL had purchased 879 MW from power exchange at the rate of Rs 3.85 per unit and is meeting the highest rising power demand.“PSPCL has made arrangements to meet the demand up to 13,700 MW. The purchase of power from exchange is mainly due to failure of 615 MW unit of Talwandi Sabo thermal plant at Mansa,” he said.“This deficit is being arranged by procuring power on day-to-day basis from market, limited to transmission constraints of national grid,” Prasad said, in a statement issued here on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/power-shortage-leaves-paddy-nurseries-dry-workers-jobless-in-punjab-273556

In the first two days of launch, around 20 per cent of the daily target of vaccination could be achieved. In some blocks of the district, vaccination is said to have been below 5 per cent.The district administration had decided to achieve the target of vaccinating at least 150 residents in the selected villages of the block.To achieve 100 per cent vaccination in a targeted village, in each block around 10 villages have been identified where 40 per cent vaccination has already been over.Health officials said vaccine hesitancy was still a major factor in the rural hinterland. They said residents were reluctant to get vaccination due to impending rumours in villages.A health official said, “Social media rumours are very much there in villages. Villagers are of the opinion that many people have died within a few days of vaccination.”20% target in two days||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/special-vaccination-drive-gets-tepid-response-in-rural-areas-of-patiala-district-273547

He said the ‘padayatra’ would start on July 7 at 12 noon from Bathinda.Mehta said the government had cheated the employees by denying them their dues in the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission. He said it was the right time when people from all walks of life, came out in support of the employees, who had been denied their financial dues by the government. Mehta pointed out various emoluments such as city compensatory allowance and non-practice allowance (in case of doctors) had either been done away with or drastically reduced. The recommended hike in salary and allowances was meager, he said.BDA employees observe pen-down strikeBathinda: Bathinda Development Authority (BDA) employees observed a pen-down strike in protest against the 6th Pay Commission report released by the government recently.

25-06-2021||Parvesh Sharma||Religious, farm bodies to aid of jobless||Tribune News ServiceSangrur, June 24Unemployed youths, who have been sitting on indefinite protest at Sangrur since December 31 last year, claim to have spent more than Rs 3 lakh this year, only to be lathicharged by cops at Patiala during various agitations. The amount is said to be spent on transport facilities and other expenses to reach the district.Apart from spending from their little income that they are earning by working as labourers, vegetable sellers, operators in private companies and farm labourers, the unemployed have also been getting support from gurdwaras, farmer organisations, employees’ unions and various social organisations.“Since the indefinite agitation began, we have spent lakhs to arrange various things. An amount of Rs 3 lakh has been spent on transport facility alone to reach Patiala from various districts to gherao the CM residence there,” said BEd and TET pass union president Sukhwinder Dhilwan.Members of BEd and TET pass union along with members of other four unions, including the All Punjab 873 DPE teachers’ union, 646 PTI teachers’ union Punjab, Unemployed Art and Craft Union Punjab and Unemployed Multipurpose Health Union Punjab, have been sitting on indefinite protest here before the local residence of Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla since December 31, 2020. Earlier, they had organised indefinite protest here from September 2019 to April 2020. Similarly, ETT and TET pass youths had also been sitting on indefinite protest here before the DC office.“My family took a loan for my studies and these days I am working as a labourer to pay back that loan. Before last Assembly elections, everyone talked about jobs to unemployed, but after the government came into force, nobody is even talking about us. Our protest would continue till our demands are met,” said Kulwant Singh, another unemployed protester.While they are sitting at the protest, their food comes from local gurdwaras and they are using local cremation grounds to take bath in morning. Whenever they are caught by cops, farmers unions come to their aid and get them released.“We also want to spend time with our families and stay home rather than squatting on roads, but the government has compelled us to sit here. Polls are approaching again, this time we will not believe in any fake promises,” said Harbans Singh, another unemployed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/religious-farm-bodies-to-aid-of-jobless-273540
25-06-2021||Rajmeet Singh||Cong ‘to-do list’ tall order for Capt||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 24The time-bound implementation of the 18-point agenda conveyed to CM Capt Amarinder Singh is the course-correction strategy planned by the Congress high command to turn the wave in its favour in the run-up to the Assembly polls.“After a lot of discussion and considering all issues raised by the rank and file of the state party unit, the high command has felt that major issues that caused a rift among different power centres need to be addressed immediately. The legal and administrative considerations need to be analysed too,” AICC general secretary and Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat said.Beginning with the emotive issue of justice promised in sacrilege and police firing cases and correcting the “Congress-SAD fixed match narrative” post the adverse judgment of the Punjab and Haryana HC on the SIT probe in the Kotkapura case, the AICC panel has stressed time-bound result in the probe by the new SIT. Sources said the CM, highlighting the summoning of Parkash Badal and his son Sukhbir Badal, hinted at visible action by July-end.Another important issue touched upon by the AICC panel was ending the sand and transport mafia. It has been pointed out that sand prices continue to be on the higher side despite the government claiming to have brought changes in the mining policy and increasing revenue from auction of mining sites as compared to previous 10 years of the SAD-BJP rule. De-regulating sand mining has been on the mind of the government, but a final word is awaited. Despite bringing in new transport policy, the main issue of terminating illegal extension of bus routes allegedly being run by Akalis and changing the time table to bring the state-run buses vis-a-vis those operated by powerful private operators still needs to be addressed.Sources said hearing in the final notices of the termination of illegally extended bus routes had been delayed as private operators had moved court.The CM has been conveyed that the perception of its flagship project “Ghar Ghar Rozgar” needs to be corrected. The issue of giving jobs to kin of MLAs has been viewed seriously, with directions to benefitting MLAs to refuse the offer. The CM has also been asked to fill the posts in government departments as promised.The leadership wants the CM to announce the pending loan waiver for SC landless farm labourers, implementation of 30% quota for Dalits and weaker sections in political appointments, implementation of 85th amendment to extend quota benefit to SC/weaker sections in promotion with consequential seniority, 5 marla plots for SCs and clearing air on SC post-matric scheme dues.CM told to implement 18-point agenda1 Renegotiating power pacts with pvt thermal plants2 200 units of free power for everyone3 Nailing the transport mafia in the state4 Acting against those involved in drug trade5 Nailing sand mafia, de-controlling sand mining6 Action in sacrilege, police firing cases7 Correcting perception of ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ scheme8 No govt jobs for party MLAs’ relatives9 SC loan waiver for landless farm labour10 Clearing dues in SC Post-Matric Scholarship scheme11 Implementing 85th amendment to extend quota benefit to SC/weaker section in promotions12 Five marla plots for SCs13 Agricultural land to poor, Dalits14 Filling posts in govt depts regularly15 'Respect' for Cong workers in political, administrative set up16 Clearing air over 'Fateh' kits17 Course correction in bureaucratic control over governance18 Addressing staff concerns in implementation of 6th pay panel||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cong-to-do-list-tall-order-for-capt-273543

While sons of legislators are getting jobs on compassionate grounds, those with degrees have been left to fend for themselves. Instead of giving them jobs, the protesters were being lathicharged on roads,” said Kumar.“The same voters had elected the Congress to power in the state and now they are being ignored,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-bathinda-job-letters-given-at-mock-protest-273533

The party cited the Congress high command’s directions to the CM to deliver on his promises within a stipulated time.Addressing a press meet here, AAP MLAs Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the Congress government had proved to be a failure on all fronts, because of which there was a feud within the party.He said after the failure of the pre-poll ‘nau nukte’ (9 points) programme, the Congress leadership had now directed Capt Amarinder to work on an 18-point programme. Sandhwan said the ultimatum issued by the party leadership to release the list of tasks of his government by July 10 proved the CM’s inefficiency. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-failed-on-all-fronts-aap-273537
25-06-2021||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana High Court seeks progress report in ‘false implication’ case||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 24The Punjab and Haryana High Court has called for progress report by a special investigation team, constituted under its orders, in a case where a widow’s Covid-infected son was allegedly implicated in a drugs case after she refused sexual favour to police officers.Justice Arun Monga of the High Court has already rapped the Punjab Police for turning into “predators” in the case.Taking up the matter, Justice Monga also ruled out CBI probe into the matter after expressing satisfaction with the investigation carried out so far by the SIT. “Having gone through the preliminary report of the SIT (submitted in a sealed cover), I am of the view that the investigation is being conducted satisfactorily now and would be taken to its logical conclusion in accordance with law,” Justice Monga asserted, while directing premier investigating agency’s deletion from the array of parties.The matter was placed before Justice Monga after the women filed a petition apprehending “bodily harm” and tampering with the evidence. Justice Monga observed the allegations and factual averments in the petition were so grisly and frightful that one could only hope the same were fictitious.He also took note of the state counsel’s submissions that it was a case of honey trap laid by the petitioner that later boomeranged, before adding if that was not the case it reflected the sordid state of affairs in the Punjab Police, particularly in the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) at Bathinda.Justice Monga added: “The very protectors/ enforcers of law and order have turned into predators, making a young 38-year-old widow-mother victim of their lust… An FIR, allegedly a false one, was registered against her son under the NDPS Act by planting contraband on him so as to arm twist the petitioner. Eventually, under duress to get her son released, she yielded to the sexual demands of the CIA staff”.Referring to the earlier constitution of the all-male SIT to look into the rape case registered under Section 376 of the IPC on May 12 at the Cantonment police station in Bathinda district on her complaint, Justice Monga added it was rather intriguing, given the nature of sensitive investigation, that woman police official was not involved, which otherwise also was the requirement of law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-seeks-progress-report-in-false-implication-case-273549

He said after two months the office of the Civil Surgeon returned the cheque saying they couldn’t use the grant as neither there was a proper place to install the machine nor they had expert staff to operate it.The district got three ventilators from the PM Cares Fund, but the authorities installed all those ventilators at Indus Hospital, a private hospital at Peerjain village.Dr Mohinder Singh, Civil Surgeon, said the department had received a grant of Rs 15 lakh from the MP, but there was shortage of doctors in the hospital and they do not have expert and trained staff to operate the ventilator.He said he had written to the MP and expressed helplessness to use the grant. He said he returned the amount so that the MP might use it for any other social purpose. He said the hospital got three ventilators from the PM fund and installed them in the Indus Hospital, where patients were being treated free of cost. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rs15-lakh-grant-for-ventilator-returned-cong-mp-fumes-273550

It is learnt that the party high command had taken a serious note of the Cabinet decision to offer government jobs to VIP kin.After five ministers opposed the move during the Cabinet meeting, Jakhar had termed the appointments an ill-advised decision and cautioned the party against promoting nepotism.A few MLAs and other senior leaders of the party had also opposed the decision.Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Ludhiana Rakesh Pandey, while justifying the post of naib tehsildar offered to his son on compassionate grounds, said those opposing the move were sympathisers of terrorists and their ideology.
