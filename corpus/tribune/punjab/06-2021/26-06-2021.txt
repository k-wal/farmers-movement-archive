However, nodal officers of government schools, mentioned in the list of the district administration completely disowned the scheme and said they were no longer associated with it. About ‘Tu Mera Buddy’ schemeThe current scenario is that ‘Tu Mera Buddy’ has been left to online seminars or speeches on drug de-addiction delivered by students once or twice a year.While the administrative officials blame it on the pandemic and online education, insiders said the Education Department was not interested in this campaign and they very smartly converted it into ‘Buddy Group’.The ‘Buddy Group’ has nothing to do with the check on drugs and is rather based on sharing of class notes, videos, question papers and other school-related information during the pandemic to the students who do not own mobile phone.As this correspondent made calls to several government schoolteachers and principals, all of them initially mistook the ‘Tu Mera Buddy’ campaign of DAPO with the ‘Buddy Group’ concept. The teachers said the Education Secretary in the last few months stressed so much emphasis on the ‘Buddy Group’ programme that they had completely forgotten the three-year-old drug-related campaign.In Jalandhar, five best schools under ‘Tu Mera Buddy’ concept have even got screened – GSS Smart School, Gandhi Camp, Government Model Co-Educational School, Ladowali Road, GGSSS Basti Sheikh, GSS Smart School, Maqsudan, and GGSS School, Patara.When the nodal officer and English lecturer Jatinder Kumar of Gandhi Camp school was contacted, he denied having been deputed for any such work. Likewise, Principal of Patara school Rajinderpal Singh said, “We have held a few online events and a speech on drug abuse. Ther is no nodal officer for this scheme in the school.”A college principal when contacted said the scheme could clearly not be followed the way it had been initially designed. “It’s only through indirect methods that we can motivate students not to fall in the wrong trap. We cannot physically reach out to students and see what they are upto,” he said.Principal Kiran Randhawa of MLU DAV College, Phagwara, denied having any student enrolled under the ‘Tu Mera Buddy’ scheme of the state government. “Our teachers are very vigilant to note any wrong behaviour of students. So, this aspect is being taken care of well without any scheme as well,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govts-flagship-campaign-against-drug-abuse-in-limbo-274328

The demand has surged to unexpected 13,000 MW levels over thepast five days, peaking at 13,399 MW today. The demand during the corresponding period had remained around 12,000 MW and peaked at 13,000 levels only for three days in last July.The government has made arrangements to supply up to 13,700 MW this year through purchase agreements and power banking, besides buying electricity from the power exchange. “This peak purchase was to be made in July. However, with demand peaking early this year, we have been purchasing power from the exchange. Even tomorrow, we are buying 928 MW (@Rs 3.78 per unit), to meet the demand,” said a senior officer in the state power department, adding they were now ensuring eight-hour supply to farmers.Officials in the department, who held a meeting to discuss ways to meet the demand today, expressed concern over high demand arising out of (unauthorised) increase in load on tube-wells by hundreds of farmers. Though a voluntary disclosure scheme was announced by the PSPCL recently, officers say it has failed to enthuse farmers to disclose the additional load.“The estimates for demand are based on the demand data disclosed by customers. Our field reports now show farmers having installed higher power pumps to extract water, thus leading to the high demand,” said the officer.During the meeting, the issue of providing free 200 units to every household in the state (as directed by the Congress high command) was also discussed. The financial implications and its impact on the fiscal health of PSPCL was debated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/shortfall-as-unexpected-surge-in-electricity-demand-in-punjab-274205

Since the road belongs to the Mandi Board, we will write to senior authorities of the board for quick action to ensure adequate plantation. We have been trying to save maximum trees, but if anyone burns any tree, the area residents should bring it to our notice immediately,” Singh said.The Tribune had highlighted that many full-grown tress were burnt when wheat stubble fire had spread tothe surrounding areas.“It’s really surprisingly that Forest Department officers submitted a factually incorrect report despite the fact that some burnt trees are still there. Senior authorities of the department should look into the matter seriously to prevent such incidents and save the environment,” said Anil Kumar Kicha, Chairman of the Sangrur Market Committee.On being asked if he would conduct an inquiry to ascertain why his officers earlier failed to trace the burnt trees, the DFO said: “We are looking into that matter also.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/days-after-denial-forest-dept-admits-trees-burnt-in-sangrur-274253

26-06-2021||Saurabh Malik||CVC: Extraordinary delay in sanction of prosecution||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 25Punjab Chief Vigilance Commissioner Justice Mehtab Singh Gill has virtually put deputy commissioners across the state in the dock for apparently going soft on revenue officials by delaying the decision on prosecution sanction. Justice Gill also made it clear that mutations pleas were being decided beyond the prescribed period, leaving room for corruption.In a scathing communiqué to all deputy commissioners, Justice Gill asserted it had come to his notice that extraordinary delay was being caused for whatsoever reason regarding the grant of prosecution sanction. “This delay in prosecution sanction is specially where revenue officials are involved,” he said. Reminding the deputy commissioners of the legal provisions on the issue, Justice Gill asked them to grant or deny prosecution sanction within 30 days after the completion of probe by the investigating officer concerned. Justice Gill asserted Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2018, made it mandatory for deputy commissioners to pass appropriate orders within three months. Before parting with the letter, Justice Gill added it had come to his notice that the mutations were also being accepted or rejected beyond the stipulated period of 45 days, “which is a source of corruption”.The communiqué comes less than three months after Justice Gill took over as the Vigilance Commissioner. Information suggests he is currently working against all odds with just one peon. The file for recruiting staff is believed to be lying with the state Finance Department. As of now, Justice Gill is reportedly receiving five to six complaints on a daily basis.The Finance Commissioner, Taxation, too, has been asked to take a decision on the issue of granting sanction for prosecution of Excise and Taxation officials in the GST scam. “If these cases collapse at the stage of framing of charges in the trail court, the Vigilance Bureau will not be responsible,” Justice Gill ruled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cvc-extraordinary-delay-in-sanction-of-prosecution-274257

The measures were suggested by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.Cases in Patiala and Ludhiana, Punjab alertedChandigarh: With Punjab reporting first two cases of the Delta plus variant in Patiala and Ludhiana districts, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan has, in a letter to state’s Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, asked the state to take up immediate containment measures as the variant was highly transmissible. The Centre has also suggested sending adequate samples to the designated INSACOG laboratories for genome sequencing.Sujeet Singh, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director, said 22 had been found in Maharashtra, nine in Tamil Nadu, seven in MP, three in Kerala, two each in Punjab and Gujarat, and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, J&K, Haryana and Karnataka. The cases have been found in 45,000 samples sequenced so far.No tax on Covid ex gratiaThe government on Friday announced tax exemption for expenditure incurred on Covid treatment as well as on ex gratia up to Rs10 lakh received on death due to the pandemic.The Delta variant of concern, meanwhile, has emerged as the dominant Covid mutation circulating in India with presence in a whopping 80 per cent of the samples genome sequenced so far to study viral mutations.

26-06-2021||Chandigarh/New Delhi||Congress top brass set to  give key roles to non-Jats||In an effort to balance caste equations, the Congress high command is all set to assign key roles to non-Jat leaders while revamping the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC). The move comes in the wake of reports that the Akalis are trying to poach on Hindu and OBC leaders “neglected” by the Punjab Congress.Significantly, Lal Singh, an OBC leader who is chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board, has been repeatedly called to New Delhi by Rahul Gandhi in the past couple of days. He is said to be close to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had assigned responsibilities to the veteran leader during the recent civic polls. Owing to the “one family, one ticket” rule, Lal Singh had to give up his claim to the party ticket during the 2017 elections and his son Rajinder Singh was elected from Samana constituency. “With a 32 per cent vote share, the OBCs will play an important role in the coming Punjab polls,” a senior PPCC leader pointed out.Apart from Lal Singh, Punjab ministers Brahm Mohindra, Sunder Sham Arora, Vijay Inder Singla and Balbir Sidhu, Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dullo and MLAs Rana Gurjeet and Lakhvir Lakha met Rahul Gandhi on Friday. Capt Sandeep Sandhu, political secretary to the CM, is also learnt to have met the former Congress chief close on the heels of PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar attacking the CM’s “so-called advisers” for the “wrong” decisions, including jobs for MLAs’ kin. “I told Rahul Gandhi that the CM and the state Congress office have been in a lockdown for about four years.The Congress has been weakened in Punjab because of the growing dominance of ‘outsiders’ while traditional loyalists are sidelined,” Dullo said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-top-brass-set-to-give-key-roles-to-non-jats-273964
