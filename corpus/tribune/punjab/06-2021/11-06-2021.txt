These leaders sought a course correction in the governance of Punjab by the CM but simultaneously said he should stay in charge in the larger interest of the party ahead of the 2022 elections.The panel has noted the importance of Navjot Sidhu and his voter appeal and called for his “suitable accommodation”.The decision on Sidhu’s “accommodation” has been left to Sonia after lack of unanimity on the proposals discussed in the panel although the offer of deputy chief ministership for Sidhu was “deliberated seriously along with a similar role for a Hindu and a Dalit leader”.The CM is learnt to have categorically opposed Sidhu’s appointment as state unit  chief in place of Sunil Jakhar, but did not oppose his accommodation in “another suitable role”. The CM was open to a change in PCC leadership but preferred a Hindu leader. The CM, however, stressed the need to represent all dominant castes of the state in any leadership structure – be it through a Cabinet or party rejig.The final decision on Sidhu will be taken by Sonia, said sources. The committee also made suggestions to ensure the party returns to power in 2022 and issues of the electorate are addressed with “fair representation in the party and government positions to Sikhs, Hindus and the Dalits,” sources said.Dismissing accusations of being inaccessible, the CM apparently told the panel that in Covid times the issue was not relevant as he had been interacting with stakeholders online.KHARGE REPORT: KEY TAKEAWAYS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/adjust-navjot-singh-sidhu-suitably-says-aicc-panel-266835

From him, the police got information about Jaipal’s hideout.The Punjab Police had to race against time as Bharat could not remain ‘unreachable’ to Jaipal or his aides for very long. The police got senior intelligence and security officials of the country involved. Within two hours, a team of special task force of the West Bengal was scrambled to raid the hideout.A month-long chase, when the fugitive was spotted after a long time in Punjab on May 13, preceded the climax. Supervised by DGP Dinkar Gupta and ADGP Amit Prasad, a team of 20 field operatives, led by AIG GS Chauhan, went on his trail. The team members travelled across Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, New Delhi and Kolkata. “This time, his luck ran out,” said Chauhan.A master of forging identities and developing safe houses and network, Jaipal had hoodwinked the police all these years. “Nearly 80 plastic chip cards used to make new Aadhaar IDs with matching driver’s licences and other ID proofs, recovered from his Kolkata hideout, showed his expertise,” said Chauhan.In addition, a pen drive containing Hollywood spy and crime thrillers was found. On May 13, during a routine checking at a Khanna naka, Jaipal got into a scuffle with a police team, but fled. It was only later that the police recognised him using the CCTV footage.“He started wearing a pony tail recently, while his accomplice Jassi sported French beard. Using his photos, our software revealed his real identity. However, he carried a 9mm pistol taken away from a policeman. The same weapon was used in the murder of two ASIs in Jagraon.”They revealed Jaipal, Jassi, Darshan Singh and Baljinder Babbi drove for two days and a night after the Jagraon murders. Teams of the OCCU first spotted them in Rajasthan. The four were picked up by cops from the Rajgarh police chowki picked from the rear of a dhaba, where they were asleep, thinking they were petty drug smugglers.The police took their vehicle and asked them to follow on foot. However, the suspects fled and ran for three hours along a railway track before Jaipal contacted an associate and arranged another vehicle.They reached Gwalior and stayed there for some time. Darshan and Babbi were nabbed from Dabra, near Gwalior, on May 28. They told the police Jaipal and Jassi had gone to an undisclosed location in a white Verna car, arranged by Bharat, a businessman in Sahnewal and married to a woman in Kolkata. The police, however, could not trace the car at toll booths. It was only after Bharat’s arrest that the police learnt that Jaipal had travelled in a white Honda car, which was tracked down. Within hours of Bharat’s arrests from the Shambu border yesterday, Jaipal was killed in an encounter.Fled custody in RajasthanOn the run after killing two ASIs in Jagraon, Jaipal and three aides were picked up by Rajasthan cops at a Rajgarh dhaba, where they were asleep.

Not only this canal, but also the polluted water in Harike head affected the Gang Canal, said a senior functionary in the IGND. “We are bringing the issue of contaminated water into the notice of the state and the Union Government. For the time being, we have sounded an alert, asking people to be cautious in using the canal water,” he said.On Tuesday, NGOs and residents in Faridkot staged a protest here, near Rajasthan and Sirhind feeder canals.They protested the flow of ‘toxic’ water from Jalandhar city and the Buddha nullah in the Sutlej. They alleged the Buddha nullah picked up effluents and untreated sewage, while passing through Ludhiana, before dumping it all in the Sutlej. For a stretch of about 65 km, from Harike in Ferozepur to Faridkot, the water has turned ‘dark’. The canals also supply water to Faridkot, Muktsar and Abohar.

Many areas had unscheduled power cuts and in some villages, farmers claimed they got only six hours for fields while their residences were also without power during the day.Information gathered from PSPCL officials confirmed that the power demand touched another high of 11,787 MW on June 10 around 5.15 pm. In Patiala, Mohali, Sangrur, Amritsar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Ludhiana villages, the supply to fields was interrupted. While in Patiala unscheduled power cuts were reported in many areas on Wednesday evening, Zirakpur had over seven hours of unscheduled power cuts.Farm unions alleged despite many meetings with the PSPCL top brass pertaining to power availability and an eight-hour uninterrupted power supply, preferably at a stretch, the PSPCL failed on the first day itself. “Some villages got just five-hour power supply, while in majority, it was two hours of supply and then some snag was reported. We cannot wake up early morning and then be awake the whole night again to manage our fields in the absence of regular supply,” they said.While the PSPCL top brass says it was due to overloading of transformers and scorching heat, the PSEB Engineers’ Association claims the whole system was overloaded and many critical transformers and other material were in short supply which led to sudden outages in Punjab.PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said “there was failure of transformers in many parts of the state due to overloading and no power cuts were imposed”. “Power is fully tied up. Our staff are working hard to resolve complaints on priority,” he said.The PSEB Engineers’ Association, in another letter to the management, claimed, “The management has failed in timely decision-making for ensuring sufficient procurement of material and is now resorting to untested arrangements, which in the long run will only harm the power infrastructure.”However, the PSPCL management claims ample stock of material was available to meet any exigency for June and on-the-spot procurement was allowed to field staff.Meanwhile, hundreds of residents in Sirhind barged into the PSPCL office last night as the official on duty was not responding to their calls being made to lodge complaints to restore the supply.Unions angry with discom top brassFarm unions alleged despite several meetings with the PSPCL top brass on an eight-hour uninterrupted power supply, there seemed no preparedness. “Some villages got just five-hour power supply, while in majority, it was two hours of supply and then some snag was reported,” farmers said.Ensure uninterrupted supply: CMChief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh directed A Venu Prasad, CMD, PSPCL, to ensure eight-hour interrupted power supply to farmers during the ongoing paddy sowing season.

Far from implementing the recommendations in the interests of the farmers and the nation’s food security, the BJP-led central government had passed the farm laws that were aimed at destroying the farmers, he alleged.The Chief Minister said it was not enough for the Union Agriculture Minister to say that the doors for talks with farmers were open. The Government of India should repeal the farm laws and then sit across the table with farmers to come out with genuine and meaningful reforms in agriculture in the interest of the agricultural community and the entire nation, he said.Demanding that the central government should simplify procurement of all agricultural produce at MSP that fully covers farmers cost plus 50 per cent margin, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, he stressed the need to take the actual cost of production into account in measuring the MSP.He alleged the Government of India was increasingly becoming a bottleneck in the smooth procurement of foodgrains at MSP by making procedures and process more complicated.Capt Amarinder warned that such apathetic attitude towards the farmers would be detrimental to the long-term interests of the country. “It could push India back into the pre-Green Revolution era, forcing us once again to pick up the begging bowl to meet the food-related needs of our people,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/meagre-hike-in-msp-insult-to-farmers-says-punjab-cm-266511

Dayalan said as the probe had found that the land mutation had caused a huge loss to the state exchequer, they had reversed the mutation orders.He said they had submitted a report to the state government to frame a scheme to charge fee for land mutation as per the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).Dayalan said the state government was yet to formulate a policy for charging land mutation fee in cases of transfer of land from one company to the other, while 14 states in the country, including Haryana, had already framed a policy in this regard.The District Magistrate had ordered the probe on June 7 after 120 acres of land were transferred without the payment of stamp duty by twisting NCLT orders and guidelines.As per information, the land in Bairampur and Manak Majra villages in Mohali district had been transferred to MGF Developers from Emaar MGF in pursuance of demerger of companies as per the scheme of arrangement approved by the NCLT in its judgment in 2018.Sources said the MGF had filed an application with the Subdivisional Magistrate, Mohali, on March 16 and the same was sent to the tehsildar for further action. The then tehsildar had kept the case file pending for seeking legal verification. She had also raised objections over the non-payment of stamp duty by MGF Developers (resulting company) after getting land from Emaar MGF (demerged company).Interestingly, during the pendency of the case, the then tehsildar was transferred and the land was transferred to MGF Developers by creating a new case file.When the District Magistrate asked the District Revenue Officer to submit his report, the latter in his reply while seeking action in the case had stated that a parallel file had been created to transfer the land while the original case file was pending.Loss to exchequer as stamp duty not paid||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mohali-administration-cancels-mutation-of-mgf-land-over-tax-evasion-266520

He said though Punjabi was our mother tongue and English was already being taught in schools, the additional knowledge of foreign languages would help students excel in their careers.Sharing his experience about our people’s resilience and spirit to do something new, Capt Amarinder Singh said long back while travelling in Kapurthala district, he noticed a placard in a rural area which pointed towards a location where Italian language was taught. He said this incident revealed that people, especially the youth, were keen to learn foreign languages to settle abroad and such an initiative of the department would help the students cherish their aspirations.Underlining the need to motivate students to take up sports as a character-building exercise, the Chief Minister also directed the School Education Minister to explore the possibility of developing playgrounds in schools. Referring to a famous quote, “The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton”, Capt Amarinder said it was popularly ascribed to the generals who spearheaded the command of the famous battles and were trained in the playgrounds of Eton in the UK during their early school days.School Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla assured the Chief Minister that the department would closely work with digital platforms offering the facility of online courses in foreign languages.Hails teachers for grading index resultsWhile congratulating the teachers and staff for making Punjab no.1 in the Performance Grading Index-2019-20 released by the Government of India, the Chief Minister said it was a matter of pride that Punjab had achieved this rare feat, which was the outcome of its collective efforts coupled with hard work, dedication and sincerity||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/teach-foreign-languages-in-punjab-govt-schools-capt-amarinder-266523

The Chief Minister was quick to trash the MLA’s allegations on keeping dossiers on party colleagues. “Never done such things in my political career. My mantra for governance is trust and transparency,” he said in his tweet. Earlier addressing a press conference, Pargat questioned the CM on the leak of reports in the media pertaining to dossiers on select ministers and MLAs, and pointed towards allegations of a minister close to the Chief Minister having taken double land acquisition compensation. “If we have given it in writing, it is a confessional statement that we are running a corrupt government,” he said. Pointing towards the irrigation scam, the MLA said no action had been initiated against three IAS officers and two politicians. “In the Rs 1,200 crore scam, no bureaucrat or politician has been questioned,” he added.
