18-06-2021||New Delhi||Punjab was given more Remdesivir than UP, says Union Minister||The ruling BJP on Friday highlighted several decisions taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Punjab in “true spirit of cooperative federalism” to attack opposition parties, which often accuse the central government of overriding powers of states.Citing the example of Punjab and Assam, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the population of both states is roughly similar while Uttar Pradesh has a population of around 20 crores.“My team did an analysis and found out that the number of Remdesivir supplied by the Centre per hundred thousand people in Assam was 323 and UP 264”.“Punjab on the other hand has 632, which is almost double as compared to Assam and Uttar Pradesh,” he said, adding that this might not be an indicator as many states also procure it themselves “but for anyone to suggest that they have been short-changed or denied the legitimate share is a falsification”.The Centre recently sanctioned medical oxygen plants for 41 locations in Punjab under the PM Cares Fund, Puri said, also again taking a swipe at Amarinder Singh government over its alleged profiteering by selling Covid vaccines to private hospitals. “Congress leaders are not on the same page. Some of them think profiteering on centrally supplied medicines is legitimate. The health minister of Punjab government claimed he had nothing to do with this scam,” he said.Puri said: “Eighty per cent of Covishield procurement at a cost of Rs 309 per dose indicates that the profiteering figure has been much higher than the figure reported. After this, they probably gave 30 lakhs to just one hospital. They sold it for Rs 1060, so the profit of Rs 750 has been made”.Puri also said that it was alleged that MSP for grains will be abolished and the mandi system repealed when the government enacted three farm laws, however, the Centre made record procurement and transferred money directly to bank accounts of farmers. “The government has made it clear that if there are any doubts (regarding laws) we are ready to sit with you and are open to all suggestions. But template has to be benefit to farmers,” he said.The union minister also demanded a probe into crimes that have allegedly occurred at the sites of farmer protests with BJP the spokesperson Sambit Patra adding that "democracy has space for agitations, not crime".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-was-given-more-remdesivir-than-up-says-union-minister-270440

Some of them think profiteering on centrally supplied medicines is legitimate. The health minister of Punjab govt claimed he had nothing to do with this scam," Puri said.Citing various decisions of the Modi government, he said it abolished a "blacklist" carrying names of 333 Sikhs, granted citizenship rights to thousands of Sikhs oppressed in different countries, ensured action in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, gave FCRA registration to Golden Temple to receive foreign donations, launched 14 trains to connect holy Sikh sites and gave GST exemption to langar services run by gurdwaras.The list is long, he said, adding this is what Modi personally and his government have been doing for all states.Noting that it was alleged that the minimum support price (MSP) for grains will be abolished and mandi system repealed when the government enacted three farm laws, he said the Centre in fact made record procurement and transferred tens of thousands of crores directly to bank accounts of farmers."Government has made it clear that if there are any doubts (regarding laws) we are ready to sit with you and are open to all suggestions. But template has to be benefit to farmers," Puri said.He also demanded a probe into crimes which have allegedly occurred at the sites of farmer protests.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra added that democracy has space for agitations, not crime. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bjp-cites-modi-governments-decisions-on-punjab-to-laud-its-spirit-of-cooperative-federalism-270404
18-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre will soon write to Punjab CM for joint meeting with his Haryana counterpart over SYL||The Centre will soon write a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for a joint meeting with his Haryana counterpart to resolve the festering problem of construction of Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal project.This was informed to mediapersons by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday after he met Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.Khattar also met Environment and Forest Minister Prakash Javadekar and urged him for relaxation of rules for operation of industries in the National Capital Region (NCR). During the meeting with Shekhawat, Khattar said that Haryana should not be deprived of its due share of water from Punjab’s rivers due to inordinate delay in construction of the SYL.He wondered why the state should suffer when Supreme Court has also given a verdict in favour of Haryana and the SYL.The successive Punjab governments, including the incumbent one, have opposed the project on the grounds that the state (Punjab) is already facing water shortage as the rivers are fast depleting.With regard to sharing of Yamuna water with Delhi, Khattar informed Shekhawat that Haryana was giving the latter more than its share.Besides, the project to revive the now extinct Saraswati river, which once passed through Haryana, also figured during the discussion.According to Khattar, Shekhawat assured that Centre would provide financial help of Rs 500 crore for the venture, which includes setting up dam and barrage, including at Adra Badri—the source of the river.He further informed that the Centre has sanctioned about Rs 1,120 crore for Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM).Following his meeting with Javadekar, the Environment Ministry has removed the restriction on operation of manufacturing industries based on coal in eight of the districts located in NCR in Haryana on ground that CNG, PNG and LPG pipe lines have not been laid.Khattar had called on Union Home Minister Amit Shah yesterday evening and apprised him of the law-and-order situation in areas where farmers are picketing in protest against the three farm laws.He referred to reports of crime against women.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-will-soon-write-to-punjab%C2%A0cm-for-joint-meeting-with-his-haryana-counterpart-over-syl-270401

Besides, the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) had also been requesting the reduction in regularisation charges to facilitate industries in the state.Subsequently, the department also realised that these charges have increased manifold due to a 10% hike every year, and people are not coming forward to get their buildings regularised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/standalone-buildings-outside-municipal-limits-in-punjab-get-one-time-chance-for-regularisation-on-nominal-charges-270395

State Sports Minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who was addressing the state athletes who have qualified for the 2020 Summer Games, announced that the government would hand over Rs 2.25 crore to gold medal winners, Rs 1.5 crore to silver medal winners and Rs 1 crore to bronze medal winners.In addition, the state government has also doled out Rs 5 lakh to the state athletes as a mark of encouragement in the lead up to the Games.“First of all I want to wish all of you good luck for the Games and hope that you return with medals,” Sodhi said during a virtual conference on Friday.“We have already deposited Rs 5 lakh in your accounts as a little encouragement so far. When you return with medals we will hand over Rs 2.25 crore to gold medal winners, Rs 1.5 crore to silver medal winners and Rs 1 crore to bronze medal winners,” Sodhi announced.The state government handed over Rs 5 lakh to 26 athletes, including Indian men’s hockey captain Manpreet Singh, ace shooters Anjum Moudgil and Angad Vir Singh Bajwa, boxer Simranjit Kaur, discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur.In total, there are 20 hockey stars – both men and women-- on the list.When asked the reason for this late announcement of a cash incentive of Rs 5 Lakh for athletes, sports minister Sodhi said the idea was to help in any of the last-minute needs of the athletes.“It is not a question of whether we were late in announcing this incentive. This amount is for several last-minute running repairs that crop up before major tournaments,” he explained.“When I was active in sports I was given an ill-fitting jacket and I had to go to get it fitted for my size. Similarly, this token amount may come in handy for our athletes if they need to get any last-minute purchase or repairs,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govts-big-cash-incentive-rs-2-25-crore-award-for-tokyo-gold-medal-winners-270393

Also present were Punjab MLAs Jagdev Singh and Piramal Singh. The joining happened in the presence of AICC general secretary Harish Rawat and Congress media in charge Randeep Surjewala.Attacking AAP, Khaira said it was an undemocratic party with no system of internal reviews. “Arvind Kejriwal is into a habit of scoring self goals every few months. We appeal to the NRIs who stand disillusioned with Kejriwal that they should also join and support the Congress in large numbers. The NRIs are asking about the funds they sent to AAP.

Besides, the conference focused on key thematic issues such as smooth, efficient and friendly voter services, integration of IT applications, extensive voter outreach programme, expenditure monitoring and capacity building.The CEC urged the poll-bound states, including Punjab, to learn from the experiences of states where elections were held recently. In this context, EC shall hold two-day conference with CEOs of five states where elections are due early next year. These states are Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. Before the two-day conference with the poll-bound states, the EC shall also facilitate a virtual conference with five poll-gone states.The CEC stressed upon the issue of pendency related to the grievance redressal system and instructed the CEOs to ensure that all complaints should be redressed within 30 days.

Farmer unions are already up in arms against the government for its failure to provide the promised eight-hour power supply to their paddy fields.Sources said many villages in Punjab were not getting the assured power for their paddy fields to date and there has been interrupted supply due to tripping and infrastructure damage.PSPCL officials claimed more than 15,000 workers had so far addressed more than 1.8 lakh complaints affecting more than 50 lakh consumers across Punjab, mainly from Patiala, Kapurthala, Faridkot, Bathinda, Gurdaspur, Khanna, Ropar, Mohali, Sangrur and Barnala in the past two weeks.“The storms resulted in the breakdown of around 900 feeders of 11 kV and 20 feeders of 66 kV Towers, uprooting more than 13,000 poles, around 2500 transformers and more than 100 km of conductors, besides other equipment,” said PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad.He said supply to all domestic, commercial and industrial consumers and most of the agricultural consumers had been fully reinstated and the PSPCL was working to ensure that supply to the remaining agricultural consumers was restored by June 16 so that farmers could get the eight-hour supply.Meanwhile, the Northern Regional Load Despatch Centre (NRLDC) has written to PSPCL asking it not to draw the maximum limit of power from the northern grid.

Of the total, 54 were protection pleas filed by runaway couples from both states of Punjab and Haryana. Just 47 anticipatory bail pleas, involving life and liberty, were placed before the Benches.The fact that protection pleas, too, are required to be dealt with cannot be denied. It can, at the same time, not be ignored that the High Court itself ruled that a substantial number of such pleas was to get the court’s seal of approval and not because of actual threat perception.The cases also reflect failure to come up with an alternative mechanism for dealing with such matters. A High Court Bench had in June last year asserted: “I believe it to be the most demeaning childlike work High Court judges have been forcibly tasked with by a creation of the ingenious Bar. A solution needs to be devised to cast the burden on some other alternative mechanism of redress, including by amending the law and conferring such power on the subordinate judiciary, etc.”The High Court as of now is facing a pendency of 6,84,490 cases. The only other HC with pendency more than the Punjab and Haryana High Court is Allahabad with 7,93,154 matters awaiting adjudication.The problem is aggravated by the fact that the HC has 39 posts of judge vacant. Of the sanctioned strength of 85, it only has 46 judges. The problem is expected to worsen with the retirement of two judges later this year.Following the Covid outbreak, the HC on the last working day before the summer break was working at just 30 per cent of its sanctioned strength, with 26 judges holding the court. The HC, under the circumstances, may find itself compelled to take drastic steps to ensure effective hearing in more category of cases.High Court’s problem of plenty||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/30-of-pleas-before-5-vacation-benches-by-runaway-couples-269985

Just about seven months before the Assembly polls in the state, differences have surfaced between Advocate-General Atul Nanda and the government, evident from the abolition of 23 not-so-high-level posts “without consulting him”. His wife and Additional Advocate-General Rameeza Hakim, too, has resigned from the post she held for more than four years.Reacting to “arbitrary abolishment of posts in his office”, Nanda has shot off a communiqué to Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan, asserting the Home Department abolished 23 posts “without so much as the courtesy of consultation with me” to affect the functioning of his office. Nanda added some of the posts, including those of steno and librarian, were critical for the functioning of any lawyer’s office. “The next six months are crucial as being end of the term. The government is likely to be faced with critical litigation, which will require this office to work at its best. At a time like this, to try and cripple my office with the abolishing of posts, betrays an arbitrary approach if not, a total non-application of mind by the ACS Home.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-g-govt-at-odds-as-23-posts-abolished-269986

Members of the Mazdoor Mukti Morcha carried out a protest at Matti village, demanding action against the perpetrators.The incident happened during a meeting called by village sarpanch to resolve the dispute between zamindars (landowners) and Dalit labourers. Gurpreet and other members from the community approached the police, demanding action against the landlord and sarpanch for failing to intervene. Gurpreet claimed: “We lodged a police complaint but instead of initiating punitive action against the culprits, we are being coerced to reach a compromise. We will not tolerate such humiliation and police inaction.”A group of migrant labourers had agreed to work for Rs 2,800 on per acre basis but local Dalit labourers expressed reluctance, saying they were only demanding Rs 3,500 paid last year. Morcha chief Bhagwant Samao said: “The accused must be booked under the SC/ST Act. We will gherao the Bhikhi police station if no action is taken.”Sarpanch Sukhwinder Kaur said: “There were differences between labourers and zamindars over wages.

As paddy sowing has picked up pace in the region, farmers of various villages here have been hit hard by shortage of labourers.According to farmers, a large number of labourers, belonging to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, have not returned this time. Those who have arrived are asking for high wages along with other facilities, which were unheard of two years ago.A Malwa farmerFew takers for sowing MachinesPaddy transplanting machines are still not popular among members of the farming community. Many farmers still prefer manual transplantation to mechanisation.The farmers point out that the shortage of labourers has also raised the wage cost considerably, thus adding to the already high input cost. Labourers, who otherwise charge Rs 2,800-3,200 for transplanting paddy on an acre, have now started demanding Rs 4,500-5,000 per acre for the job. Farmers are roping in local labourers who are charging around Rs 3,500.Paddy transplantation is a labour intensive exercise in which at least two to three workers per acre are required. Though the state government is also encouraging them to opt for direct seeding of rice (DSR), a less labour-intensive method, a large number of farmers in Punjab go for the transplantation method.With migrant labourers in short supply, women are being engaged at many places to do the job. Manjit Singh of Gobindpura village said besides women, children of local labourers were being engaged in transplantation as they were free due to their summer vacation. Punjabi labourers, who have in the past decade or so taken up jobs in urban areas, are also being persuaded by farmers to help them out.Shingara Singh, a BKU leader, said it was a common practice in Punjab for women to help in paddy transplantation. But this time, the number had increased due to the shortage of migrant labourers.Gurpreet Singh of Gillpati village said “The situation is likely to improve in coming days as migrant labourers will start coming in the region in a day or so due to advancement of monsoon season, the paddy sowing will pick up pace but high wages are still a concern”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-bathinda-villages-women-children-make-up-for-labour-shortage-in-fields-269603
