29-06-2021||Saurabh Malik ||Amritsar or Ambarsar: City mall challenges DC’s name change order in HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 29What’s in a name? Everything — going by an order passed by Amritsar Deputy Commissioner.The officer has asked VR Ambarsar Mall to remove ‘Ambarsar’ from its name. The logic: the city’s name is ‘Amritsar’ in government notifications and changing nomenclature to ‘Ambarsar’ was wrong.The matter was brought to the Punjab and Haryana High Court’s notice after the mall, through senior advocate Chetan Mittal along with Udit Garg and Shifali Goyal, challenged the order passed by the Deputy Commissioner.Taking up the petition by M/s Alena Ventures Pvt Ltd, Justice Lisa Gill of the High Court issued notice of motion and stayed the operation of the impugned order dated April 23.Appearing before the Bench, Mittal contended the petitioner had no intention to hurt religious sentiments of anyone. The provision of law under which purported action has been taken by the authorities was also unknown. Moreover, the order was never conveyed to the petitioner.Mittal added Amritsar was colloquially known as ‘Ambarsar’. The word was also used in movies and songs. A market was also known as ‘Ambarsar Bazaar’. Quoting examples, Mittal submitted ‘Ambarsariya di Hatti’ and ‘Ambarsar Badiyaan’ were used at various places. There was no bar in using ‘Ambarsar’ as per the Emblems and Names Act (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950.Mittal further contended there were various news articles and social media pages claiming that ‘Ambarsar’ denoted an “emotion”. It was not just a word. Besides, various cities were referred to by colloquial names such as Benaras and Dilli. It did not signify change in the City’s name. Even under various statutes there is no bar in naming or using the word ‘Ambarsar’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-or-ambarsar-city-mall-challenges-dcs-name-change-order-in-hc-275860

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Mayawati asks cadres to ensure success of SAD-BSP alliance in Punjab||BSP chief Mayawati has asked party cadres to ensure the success of the party’s alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab in the forthcoming assembly election in the state.The elections in the state will be due in February-March next year.Also, she directed for expansion of BSP’s social base, and strengthening of the organisation in Delhi.This was during her meeting with party functionaries from the Delhi unit to review party’s organisational works.Referring to the BSP-SAD alliance in Punjab, she urged party activists to ensure its victory on every seat that will be contested by it in the forthcoming assembly elections.“In the larger interest of people of Punjab and to ensure that they are liberated from the failed Congress government, a robust effort by the BSP is imperative,” Mayawati told her party functionaries.“The present Congress government is marred by internal squabbles and factionalism. The party’s internal feud has led to neglect of public issues, and welfare of the people for long,” she said.Mayawati further said that in the depressing situation in the state, people have hopes from the SAD-BSP alliance.BSP’s moves in Punjab will be keenly watched by the Congress, BJP, and the AAP, which has all the more reason to worry.The general view attribute AAP’s meteoric rise in the state to the support, including of a conglomeration of the SCs, and other poorer and weaker sections of the society.The state has a high percentage of SC population, which the SAD would like to tap into with BSP by its side.BSP has nostalgic reasons to be attuned to Punjab as its founder, late Kanshi Ram, hailed from the state, which acted as crucible of his experimentation to mobilise SCs (“Bahujan Samaj”) politically in the country for their socio-economic-political empowerment.However, Uttar Pradesh emerged as the party’s citadel because of his experiment, leading to Mayawati becoming the chief minister, and its supremo after his demise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mayawati-asks-cadres-to-ensure-success-of-sad-bsp-alliance-in-punjab-275794

While PRTC and Punbus buses remained off the roads, private buses overcharged passengers.Intensifying their protest, the contractual workers’ union of the Punjab Roadways started their protest at 8 in the morning and kept the bus stand and roadways depots closed for four hours.

The union members stated that the protest was held across 18 roadways depots in the state and at seven PRTC depots.Despite the fact that the government had termed justified the demands of Punbus employees at various occasions, nothing had been done to implement them, said the protesting drivers and conductors.Gurpreet Singh, a union leader, said, “As per the law, the services of a contractual worker must be regularized within 240 days of his/her job, but their services have not been regularised though they have put in many years of their services. We have been working on meagre salaries, but the government is not doing anything for us.”Another member said there had been no addition to the Punjab Roadways’ existing fleet over the years.

Employees are not being promoted.The bodies of new buses should be taken from good agencies. New staff should be recruited in the roadways. The government deliberately delayed the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission and so is the case with the transfer policy,” said Baljeet Singh, president of the union.

The CM complimented the department for undertaking plantation of chandan and high-yielding bamboo (bamabusa balcooa), which gives double the yield of traditional bamboo.He asked the Additional Chief Secretary, Forests, to encourage plantation of indigenous species and motivate farmers for plantation of poplar, which was not only water efficient but also remunerative due to its demand in the wood industry.The CM underscored the need for going for breeding of crocodiles in rivers, especially Beas and Sutlej.He, however, appreciated the efforts of the department for re-introduction of ghariyal, an important component of the riverine ecosystem and present in the river systems of Punjab.Captain Amarinder lauded the efforts of wildlife for conservation of Indus dolphins that had been declared a state aquatic animal in 2019.Taking serious view of the growing population of wild boar, blue bull and roz, especially in the kandi area and cotton belt of southern Punjab, the CM asked the Wildlife Department to take effective measures to save human lives, which are often lost due to attacks by wild animals, besides causing damage to crops.To address this problem on a priority basis, the CM asked the Wildlife Department to work out modalities in sync with the Animal Husbandry Department for shifting and rehabilitating the stray cattle in those ‘birs’ that were not wildlife sanctuaries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/must-plant-traditional-trees-punjab-chief-minister-capt-amarinder-singh-275663

It is surprising Punjab has paid no heed so far to this important aspect. The assertion by the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh came on an appeal filed by Harleen Kaur and another petitioner against the state and other respondents.As the matter came up for preliminary hearing, it was contended before the Bench that the appellants, who were already inducted as teachers on contract basis, were sought to be removed by other teachers on the same terms and conditions. The counsel for the petitioners contended this was impermissible in law.After hearing the contentions, the Bench asked the counsel whether the appellants were already in service. Responding to the court query, the counsel submitted they had already been relieved.Taking note of the submission, the Bench asserted it was, as such, not clear whether the college students were being imparted education in the state of Punjab in view of the pending dispute between teachers.Issuing notice of motion to the respondents, the Bench fixed the matter for July second week for the counsel to seek instructions from the state.The matter was placed before the Division Bench after a Single Judge of the High Court dismissed a bunch of nine petitions filed by the petitioner-teachers appointed on contractual basis.The Single Judge had taken note of the submission that certain petitioners had not qualified the National Eligibility Test. Once they were not even qualified to be appointed, it would not be in the interest of the students to ensure their continuation in the service, the Single Bench had asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unclear-if-students-getting-edu-after-teachers-relieved-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-275654

Sources said the birds died after eating jamun sprayed with poison.Faridkot has thousand-odd jamun trees in and around various government offices and buildings. The trees are given out on contract every year and the contractors transport the fruit to Delhi.It is alleged contractors’ employees generally use monocrotophos, an organophosphate insecticide, on the trees. The insecticide is banned in India as it is acutely toxic for birds and human.However, for its low price and easy availability in the market, the poison is sprayed on the fruit to make it ripe quickly, said members of SEER (Society for Ecological and Environmental Resources), a voluntary organisation here.“Every year, thousands of birds fall prey to insecticides in the orchards here and expose consumers to risk as well,” said Karamjit Singh, an office-bearer of the organisation. “Contractors fetch a good price for the fruit in metro cities because its kernel is good for treatment of diabetes,” said Sandeep Arora, convener, SEER.Gurjit Singh, additional district magistrate, said orders to ban the use of dangerous insecticides were issued today and violators would be punished as per law.Deadly poison||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/faridkot-administration-bans-spray-on-jamun-trees-275652

Legal cell members, including Bhangu, Raminder Singh Patiala, Inderjit Singh, Vikas Sishar, Kiranjit Singh Sekhon and Dharmendr Malik, in a joint statement said registration of cases amounted to highhandedness by the Chandigarh Police and administration who forcibly tried to foil a peaceful ‘Save Agriculture-Save Democracy Day’ march “by putting up barricades on the road and using water cannons”. They said peaceful protest was a democratic right of the people, affirmed recently by the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court in the Disha Ravi and Natasha cases. “Protesters were provoked by the police by using force to defame the agitation.

His only grievance was against the rejection of request for advancing the date of hearing the bail plea.“Be that as it may, on February 26, in view of the assertion of the counsel for the petitioner about the precarious medical condition of the applicant, a query was put to state counsel. But even on the next date on March 25, the state of Punjab sought more time to apprise the court about the medical condition of the applicant,” the Bench observed.It added the state counsel even today submitted he was not having information regarding the applicant’s present medical condition and would file a short affidavit on the issue by the next date of hearing. The counsel submitted he would further clarify whether the petitioner remained incarcerated in jail premises or was in a hospital during the period.The matter, dubbed as Bhola case, will now come up on July 9. The case pertains to the seizure of 25 kg intoxicant powder from a factory premises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/supreme-court-rap-after-state-failed-thrice-to-file-reply-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-275648

A year later, the prices of petrol has zoomed to Rs 100.23 per litre and diesel to Rs 91.62 per litre in the state.While this has hit the common man, businesses and agriculture sector, the state’s coffers have been swelling, thanks to the increase in tax collection. The state’s VAT collection too saw a dramatic jump between May 2020 and May 2021 — from Rs 501.66 crore to Rs 1,353.22 crore.Though the VAT collection was impacted due to the Covid lockdown in 2020, the Rs 851. 56-crore jump in a year is largely on the account of the sharp rise in the fuel prices. Official sources in the Taxation Department accept that every Re 1 per litre increase in the price of the retail fuels adds Rs 0.30 per litre in their kitty as additional taxes.As of today, when the retail price of petrol has touchedRs 100 per litre in many cities like Mohali, Ropar, Pathankot and Gurdaspur, its basic rate is still Rs 39.65 per litre while it’s Rs 41.73 per litre for diesel. “The Central and state taxes imposed on the fuel are quite high. While the Centre imposes Rs 32.90 per litre as excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 on diesel, VAT on petrol is Rs 24.23 per litre and Rs 15.81 per litre on diesel. The tax on each litre of petrol is over Rs 57 and Rs 47.61 on diesel,” says Monty Sehgal of Petrol Pump Dealers’ Association, punjabMoreover, with taxes in neighbouring states like J&K, HP, Haryana and Chandigarh being much lesser than Punjab, the retail price is cheaper by Rs 2-Rs 5 per litre. As a result, the sales of dealers, of those in border areas, have come down drastically.Farmers are also likely to bear the brunt. Abjinder Singh Sangha, a farmer, says, “The prices of crops rise by barely Re 1 per kg, but the input cost (of diesel) has gone up substantially.

There are several means by which a drone can be detected, identified, disabled or destroyed, which includes radar, infrared,laser, opto-electronics, electromagnetic and acoustic means along with the use of guns, rockets or missiles. These can be fixed, vehicle mounted or man-portable.Last year, the Defence Research and Development Organisation had unveiled an anti-drone system designed by it, which is reported to have been deployed selectively so far, with state-owned Bharat Electronics Limited designated as the production agency.The Army’s Directorate of Air Defence is undertaking a project to develop counter measures against unauthorised flying objects that can be used for surveillance or attack. Launched over a year ago, the Army expects the feasibility study to take around two years, with other two or three years for developing a technology solution.The BSF is also in the process of acquiring anti-drone systems. Its requirement is for a ground-based standalone platform capable of detecting a lone suspicious flying object or a group of UAVs and react within 10 seconds.Being border states and given their history of terrorism, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir are vulnerable to cross-border smuggling and terror attacks. Security forces have reported an increase in drone activity in border areas, with several instances of drones violating the Indian air space of being used to drop arms and ammunition on this side of the border.Difficult to trackMost drones used for cross-border smuggling of arms and ammo or for attacks are much smaller than conventional aircraft. Since low altitude and their minuscule radar makes them difficult to track electronically, ground forces have to rely on visual sightings and audio signalsNo funds for techThe Punjab Police are facing financial issues in the procurement of anti-drone technology.

So now we have decided to launch an indefinite stir, which will continue until the government relents and fulfils our demands. For now we have decided to hold a three-day strike. Also, a state-level protest rally will be taken out tomorrow followed by a march towards Moti Mehal in Patiala.”He said, “Before forming the government in the state, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had promised that the services of contractual and outsourced employees of different state departments will be regularised. He had also promised ‘Ghar Ghar Naukri’ and end of transport mafia but nothing has been done on the ground. There is huge resentment among the transport sector workers as many of them have been rendering their services for the past over 15 years without being regularised. Now if the government representatives keep cancelling meetings to listen and address issues of its employees then it can reflect poorly in the upcoming elections.”Meanwhile, passengers had to bear the brunt of the strike as a majority of the government-run buses did not ply on roads and they had to wait for hours for private ones to reach their destinations. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/roadways-contract-workers-begin-stir-in-bathinda-275485

They demanded registration of a case and an inquiry marked to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).During the march, the activists broke through the police barricading and staged a demonstration in front of the former SP’s residence before courting arrest.While Kunwar could not be contacted for comment, a district AAP leader termed the allegations baseless. AAP state joint secretary Ashok Talwar and urban president Parminder Singh Sethi claimed Kunwar investigated the desecration and firing incidents of Kotkapura and pointed out the conspirators and culprits in his report.“Kunwar had to face the adversity in the existing governing system for being true to the facts. That’s why he chose to resign. The Akalis and Congress were two sides of the same coin and stood exposed,” they said. YAD leaders Gurpartap Singh Tikka, Jodh Singh Samra, Gurinderpal Singh Lalli, Gaurav Valtoha, Rana Ranbir Sing Lopoke, Sandeep Singh AR, Harjit Singh Mianwind and Sarabjit Singh, however, alleged the police were yet to take action even after it was revealed that Bhagat used a police vehicle to transport drugs from one place to another. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/youth-akali-dal-activists-gherao-ex-ig-kunwar-vijay-partaps-residence-in-amritsar-275403

The doctors are protesting against the Sixth Pay Commission’s recommendation on de-linking of the NPA with basic pay.Himachal doctors go on 2-hr pen-down strike to protest against reduction of NPA in PunjabThe call of strike has been given by the Joint Punjab Government Doctors’ Coordination Committee, which has members, including Punjab Civil Medical Services’ Association and Punjab State Veterinary Officers’ Association, Punjab Medical Teachers’ Association, Rural Medical Officers’ Association, Punjab Dental Medical Officers’ Association and Punjab Ayurveda Officers’ Association. Earlier, the government invited the doctors for negotiations to resolve the issue.

29-06-2021||---||Now, friction in Congress over SAD leader’s illegal mining charge in Punjab||Bathinda, June 28With the Assembly polls slated next year, the infighting in the Punjab Congress is getting murkier by the day. Now, Congress MLA from Gidderbaha Amarinder Singh Raja Warring has tweeted a video of SAD ex-MLA Sarup Chand Singla in which he is alleging illegal sand mining on the Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant land by Finance Minister Manpreet Badal and his brother-in-law Jaijeet Singh Johal, alias Jojo.Warring has also tagged CM Capt Amarinder Singh in it and demanded a thorough probe into the matter. Later, even Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Bittu retweeted Warring’s tweets.This is happening at a time when the Congress high command in New Delhi is holding regular meetings to resolve the infighting and put up a united front ahead of the Assembly polls in 2022.On Sunday, SAD leader Sarup Chand Singla did a live session and showed trucks being loaded in the area. Singla had accused Manpreet and Johal of being involved in the illegal sand mining. Singla also accused truck drivers of attacking him while he was shooting the video.Posting the video of SAD leader, Warring also tweeted: “Capt Amarinder ji, please take action against the people who are responsible. These are the people who are pulling the Congress down.”After some time, even Johal posted an old video pertaining to Faridkot murder case linked with Warring’s brother-in-law Dimpy Vinayak and asked Capt Amarinder Singh to conduct a thorough probe into this murder case.In February this year, a Faridkot-based contractor Naresh Kataria had killed his two children and wife before shooting himself. Kataria’s suicide note had accused Vinayak of forcing him to take this step. An inquiry into this case is going on.Manpreet’s office, however, refuted the allegations levelled by Singla. Senior Deputy Mayor Ashok Kumar and Bhatinda Improvement Trust Chairman KK Aggarwal said Singla was trying to mislead people by making allegations as he didn’t know the difference between sand and fly ash.However, party sources claimed rivalry between Manpreet and Warring was not new. In the 2012 Assembly polls, Warring defeated Manpreet, who then contested on PPP ticket from Gidderbaha. Later, Warring lost from the Bathinda urban constituency represented by Manpreet against SAD Harimsrat Kaur Badal in the General Elections in 2019.SIT to probe matter, FM denies allegation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-friction-in-congress-over-sad-leaders-illegal-mining-charge-in-punjab-275396
29-06-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon: No rains in northwest India till July 7-8||With the northern limit of the southwest monsoon (NLM) stuck at its position for more than 10 days now, the Indian Meteorological Department said on Tuesday the seasonal rains are not expected to progress into Delhi, Chandigarh, Haryana, and southern parts of Punjab for another 6-7 days. Rather, some independent forecasters believe the monsoon may continue to give the hitherto uncovered parts of the Northwest a miss till around July 10.Why it mattersAccording to Mahesh Palawat of Skymet, from Monday/Tuesday the monsoon axis is also shifting towards foothills, further leading the seasonal rains into perhaps the “longest break spell” at this time of the year. It also means that parts of central India that have been covered may also not receive rains it revives again.“Though it has happened earlier, such a long break at this time of the year is unusual. There’s no indication of rains (in Northwest) till July 7/8,” says Palawat. The IMD also adds that prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features, and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, and Punjab during next 6-­7 days.The main reason, rather the hindering factor, appears to be the prevalence of westerlies over the region, which again is “unusual” as according to Palawat by this time they generally shift into upper latitudes.“Upper-level westerlies have been persisting since June 17/18, which is unusual as generally during this time of the year they shift more north,” he says.   Notably, the IMD around July 11 said that rains will reach Delhi by June 15, which is 12 days before its usual date of June 27. Last year also the wind system had covered the entire country by June 29, seven days before the usual date of July 8. “The monsoon was really progressing well till then. Rather the low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal was expected to further boost the current, which did not happen,” meteorologists say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/monsoon-no-rains-in-northwest-india-till-july-7-8-275288
