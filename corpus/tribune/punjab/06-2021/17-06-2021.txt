A young married woman of 19, who was deserted at her native place in Bihar, was reunited with her husband working as a daily wager here after she travelled all the way from Patna to Ludhiana.Dr Pragya Jain, ADCP-I, LudhianaAfter a lot of cajoling, she narrated how her husband left her back in Bihar after a fight and how she reached Ludhiana and now has no place to live. Gradually, she told the incomplete mobile number of her husband.Penniless, the migrant destitute reached here by train, travelling without a ticket. But her ordeal did not end here. Oblivious of her estranged partner‚Äôs whereabouts, the woman was roaming aimlessly in the industrial city when a local tailor turned saviour for her and gave her shelter at his home before taking her to the local police for tracing her husband and arranging their reunion.Even as the local police station staff, where the tailor took the woman initially, proved helpless, the Good Samaritan did not lose hope and reached the Ludhiana Police Commissionerate headquarters to seek appointment with the ADCP-I, Dr Pragya Jain, about whom he had heard and read the story of how this woman IPS officer had come to the aid of a minor rape survivor while going beyond the call of her duty recently.The sustained efforts of the tailor-turned-survivor bore fruit as the Commissionerate Police not only traced the deserted woman‚Äôs husband and arranged their reunion but also ensured their rehabilitation.‚ÄúOur officers and field staffers worked overtime to trace the man, of whom the woman was having no contact details. After being traced, the man posed stiff resistance to accept the woman. However, we managed to arrange their reunion under ‚ÄúOperation Reunion‚Äù and ensured their rehabilitation with the help of local community,‚Äù the Commissioner of Police (CP), Rakesh Agrawal, told The Tribune, here on Wednesday.Sharing details, ADCP-I Dr Pragya Jain, who arranged the reunion and rehabilitation of the poor couple, said Munni belonged to Bidipur village in Nalanda district of Bihar and was married to Rohit Choudhary, who had deserted her in Bihar last month following a domestic spat. Married for five years, she was a mother of two kids, aged three and two years.On June 13, without informing anyone and leaving her kids behind with her parents, who were also daily wagers, she boarded a train from Patna to Ludhiana, without ticket, in a bid to search her husband.‚ÄúHaving no money, no mobile phone and no luggage, she reached the Salem Tabri area and started wandering aimlessly, asking for her husband, without knowing his whereabouts,‚Äù revealed the ADCP.A local tailor, Budh Dev, on seeing the destitute woman, took her to the nearby police station as she was unable to share anything about herself.Not satisfied with the response of the police station staff, Dev provided her shelter with his own family, while trying to locate her family. Today, he reached the Police Commissionerate and sought appointment with Dr Pragya Jain.‚ÄúI was intrigued at the peculiar situation and was touched by the heart-warming selfless effort of Dev,‚Äù expressed the ADCP. She herself sat with the woman and talked to her at length trying to elicit any information about her background.‚ÄúAfter a lot of cajoling, she started narrating her ordeal, how her husband had left her back home in Bihar after a fight and how she reached Ludhiana and now has no place to live. Gradually, she told the incomplete mobile number of her husband without knowing one of the digits,‚Äù Dr Jain said.While trying to locate her husband, the police also arranged her further stay at Mother Teresa‚Äôs charitable home. ‚ÄúWe tried all the possible mobile number combinations, called them up, some of which went unanswered. Then, we tried a few mobile apps, revealing photos and identity of the number owner, following which the woman identified one of the photos as that of her husband‚Äôs,‚Äù the woman IPS officer said.As technical aids revealed the man‚Äôs location, a police team, headed by SI Rashpal Kaur, found the man working at a local iron factory.‚ÄúBut her ordeal was not over yet as her husband refused to take her back, alleging marital discord. Our team then engaged with the local community leaders and factory owners to counsel both,‚Äù the ADCP shared.Finally, with the combined efforts of the police and community, the couple was reunited and their return trip to Bihar was sponsored to bring back their minor children to Ludhiana and stay happily here.The Good samaritanA local tailor, Budh Dev, on seeing the destitute woman, took her to the nearby police station as she was unable to share anything about herself. Not satisfied with the response of the police station staff, Dev provided her shelter with his own family, while trying to locate her family.

It is not about one or two individuals. A comprehensive party revamp is underway and consultations are on," he said.Asked where the matter was stuck considering the Congress wanted to fast track the matter, Rawat said, "Further deliberations are required to resolve many issues and deal with nitty-gritty. It is a complex balancing act. We have to unite the party ahead of the next elections and take everyone along."The Tribune has learnt reliably that Sidhu is not keen on a deputy CM-ship and remains adamant on the demand of being the state unit president.The CM for his part is not agreeable on Sidhu as the state chief -- a post he wants for a Hindu.The Congress is learnt to have offered deputy CM ship to Sidhu who had quit the state cabinet in 2019 after being divested of the local body portfolio.A Congress source said, "Attempts are on at a fair resolution. The CM and Navjot Sidhu are both stuck on their stands. Discussions are on to break the impasse."With the AICC panel making it clear to the party high command that CM Amarinder Singh should steer the party ahead of the next elections, it remains to be seen how far the Congress will go to "suitably accommodate Sidhu', as recommended by the panel led by Mallikarjun Kharge.Sources said the Congress would not disturb the CM much and would seek to forge unity of all factions, preferably including Sidhu, behind him.Sidhu's accommodation is holding up matters and continues to be discussed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-headway-navjot-sidhu-adamant-on-ppcc-presidents-post-269714

Of these, 1,05,830 (35.88 per cent) of the criminal cases are pending for one to three years and another 24,954 (8.46 per cent) for 10 to 20 years.The HC went into restricted functioning mode in March-end last year following Covid outbreak, following which it cancelled the summer vacation for itself and the subordinate courts in 2020. This year, the HC, however, decided to go ahead with the vacation even though the number of cases being heard drastically dipped to less than 1,000 just before the break from about 2,510 cases in April. As of now, just about six judges are holding the court during the vacation.Justice delivery hitNon-listing of applications for bail defeats the administration of justice. ‚ÄîSC BenchThe matter was placed before the SC Bench of Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice V Ramasubramanian after a special leave petition (SLP) was filed by Chunni Lal Gaba against Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement. He had challenged an order whereby his request for hearing bail application, pending since February 28, 2020, was declined. The Bench said it normally did not interfere with an interim order by an HC. But it was constrained to pass the present order as it was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù to see bail application not being listed for over a year. The Bench added an accused has a right to hearing on his bail application. In fact, denial of hearing was an infringement of right and liberty assured to an accused.‚ÄúEven during the pandemic, when all courts are making attempts to hear and decide all matter, non-listing of such an application for bail defeats the administration of justice‚Ä¶. Non-listing of an application for regular bail, irrespective of the seriousness or lack thereof, of the offences attributed to the accused, impinges upon the liberty of the person in custody,‚Äù the Bench added.It also expressed hope that the HC would be able to take up the application at an early date so that the right of the accused was not taken away.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-bail-pleas-pending-supreme-court-raps-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-269455

A preliminary inquiry indicated a large number of fake RT-PCR reports had been issued by allegedly misusing IDs of people who hadn‚Äôt even visited Haridwar. The alleged scam involved private labs that were supposed to conduct free Covid tests of Kumbh visitors in lieu of payments from the government.While a detailed investigation is on, the man claimed as his mobile number and Aadhaar card details were in public domain now, he had been receiving numerous queries from various parts of the country related to the scandal. ‚ÄúI had sent a query to the ICMR and got a reply today that as per their record, my Covid test was done at a Hisar lab.

But the move is now being seen as counter-productive. Every day, incidents are taking place where mobile phones and other items are being tossed over the prison walls. High-rise SCOs, residential and commercial complexes have come up in the vicinity of the prisons during the past few years.The escape of three prisoners from the Patiala jail has already set the alarm bells ringing. And if buildings continue to mushroom, more such incidents cannot be ruled out.As per information, the state government transferred chunks of land to the Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA) under the Optimum Utilisation of Vacant Government Land (OUVGL) scheme to generate surplus revenue. In Ferozepur, almost 21.80 acres belonging the central jail were transferred to PUDA under the scheme in 2008 following which a lot of residential and commercial hubs have come up near the jail.Another 22 acres of central jail land in Gurdaspur were transferred to PUDA around the same time. Thereafter, 22.17 acres of land of the central jail in Jalandhar were transferred to PUDA. Around 25.6 acres of jail land in Faridkot were also sold, where Baba Farid University of Health Sciences has come up now. Even in Amristar, almost 93 acres of central jail land have been reportedly transferred to PUDA.Security officials said any person with sinister designs could easily buy or rent a house or SCO close to the jail premises as PUDA further sold the land through auction to earn revenue for the government. Last year, more than 1,500 mobiles had been seized from various jails in the state due to stringent frisking and enhanced security measures but the incidents continue reportedly due to several buildings and roads being built in the proximity of the prisons.Jail officials said the security had been compromised with the sale of part of its land under the OUVGL scheme. ‚ÄúThe only preventive step can be installation of electric fencing to protect the boundary wall and more CCTV cameras and jammers for which a proposal has already been submitted,‚Äù said a senior official.1,500 mobiles seized last yearLast year, more than 1,500 mobiles had been seized from various jails in the state due to enhanced security measures but the incidents continue reportedly due to several buildings and roads being built in the proximity of the prisons||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/buildings-mushroom-near-state-prisons-in-ferozepur-pose-threat-to-security-269676

Eyewitnesses said one protester tried to jump off the roof of the building, but was stopped by his colleagues.

Both incidents took place in mid-October 2015 when cops opened fire at people who were protesting against a series of sacrilege incidents.The separate SITs into both incidents were reconstituted in mid-May this year. While the Kotkapura SIT headed by ADGP LK Yadav has hogged limelight and even summoned ex-CM Parkash Singh Badal, the other SIT is so far understanding the content of the documents.‚ÄúIt is quite a quagmire. There are more than 4,000 pages of investigation. And nearly 95 per cent of it is the same line of probe followed by the disbanded Kotkpaura SIT having IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap as the key investigator. This was quashed by the High Court. Also, both incidents had same reasons and other than some police officials, the seniors were almost the same,‚Äù said an official privy to the functioning of the new SIT. He said in contrast to the new Kotkapura SIT, the Behbal Kalan probe panel has to determine where to start the investigation and proceed thereafter. The biggest trouble is the more than 20 writ petitions, court directions and notices. ‚ÄúThe SIT officials have sent several queries for a legal opinion so that there is no controversy later,‚Äù the official said. Besides IG Naunihal Singh, Mohali SSP Satinder Singh and Faridkot SSP Swarandeep Singh are the members.This SIT has not summoned any high-profile person so far.

Having influence in Anandpur Sahib, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Patiala and Ferozepur parliamentary segments, the OBC leaders in the party are reportedly upset over not being rehabilitated in the political setup.In the wake of other parties wooing the Dalit, Hindu and OBC leaders, Capt Amarinder Singh today met leaders Satvir Singh Phallicikhi, Raman Bhalla and Dinesh Bassi, besides MLAs Chaudhary Surinder Singh, Sukhwinder Danny and Lakhvir Singh Lakha at his Sector-2 residence here.Amid reports of the Chief Minister meeting the party‚Äôs top leadership in the coming days to finalise the Cabinet and the party adjustment, regular interaction with MLAs have started and would continue over the next few days.Sources say senior leaders from Delhi are taking feedback from the dissident group leaders regarding possible names of those who could be given important assignments in the government and the party. It is learnt that the high command wants to appoint the PPCC chief of its choice.Anish Sidana, a senior party leader, said the time had come the party addressed aspirations of the OBC community, which had 32 per cent vote share in the state, as he sought to know why the post of PPCC chief or Deputy CM should be offered to an OBC leader.Reports suggest that the SAD is in parleys with a former Hindu MLA of Congress from Malwa, who has been ignored by the party, besides trying to poach Hindu and Dalit faces from AAP. After Charanjit Singh Channi, son of Congress stalwart Dilbagh Singh, quit the Congress in 2016, no OBC leader has been groomed from the Doaba region so far.‚ÄúAfter the late Gaini Zail Singh, the Ramgarhia community has been totally sidelined by the party,‚Äù said Rajpal Singh, a senior OBC Congress leader.CM to meet ministers today||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-in-huddle-as-sad-eyes-its-hindu-obc-leaders-269581

The BJP will gain a lot from them‚Äù, he addedState leaders say more ‚Äúprominent personalities from social and political space‚Äù in Punjab will join the BJP in the days to come.Though the party is expected to contest most seats on its own, it may not be averse to alliances with breakaway groups or ‚Äúhigh-profile‚Äù names/paratroopers from rival parties to take on Congress‚Äôs Captain Amarinder Singh in the polls to the 117-member Punjab Assembly. Apparently, ‚Äúaggrieved leaders‚Äù from the Opposition party are also not been ruled out yet.With SAD stitching an alliance with the BSP, the BJP is now looking at the changed caste equations in the SC/ST-dominated state. The saffron party is facing a tough situation in the state that emerged as the epicenter of farmers‚Äô protests in past months.Heckled and not allowed to hold functions in their constituencies, many party leaders are believed to have voiced concern to the Central leadership over the resistance they have been facing when they visit their constituencies. The saffron party also performed poorly in the last municipal polls, winning a handful of seats.In those terms, yesterdays‚Äô poll‚Äô strategy meeting was crucial, though Central leaders today claimed that the ‚Äúagitation was not even discussed‚Äù at the meeting between Home Minister Amit Shah, party chief JP Nadda and leaders from the state.Those who joined the BJP today called the ongoing farmers‚Äô agitation ‚Äúpolitically motivated‚Äù. ‚ÄúThat the agitation is political, Punjab farmers understand well.
