Analysis of predictive models up to June 30 indicates mid-latitude westerly winds dominating over north India during the next week.A Western Disturbance as lies over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir and its associated meteorological developments are likely to enhance rainfall along the east coast during 24-26 June. These are not favourable for enhancing monsoon activity over central and northwest India, IMD said.Forecasts based on model consensus show less probability of formation of low pressure systems over core monsoon areas as well as over north Bay of Bengal till June 30 and further weakening of lower levels easterly winds over northern plains of India, IMD added.At present, the northern limit of southwest monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar, which is about the same as it was on June 14.According to data compiled by the IMD, cumulative rainfall during this year’s southwestern monsoon across the country has been 37 per cent above the long period average (LPA) so far.As far as the region is concerned, rain was 66 per cent above the LPA in Haryana for the period from June 1 to June 22. In Punjab and Himachal Pradesh it was above the LPA by 51 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, for this period. Barring four districts in Punjab and two each in Haryana and Himachal, all parts of these states have received surplus rainfall so far.The IMD has predicted that under the influence of western disturbance and upper tropospheric westerlies, the current spell of isolated light to moderate rainfall is very likely to continue over the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains of northwest India during the next five days. A gradual rise in maximum temperatures by 3-4 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest India is also expected during the next three days||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/weakening-of-monsoon-notwithstanding-rain-surplus-in-region-so-far-272415

However, Vijay Singla, who is the former Director (Prosecution), Punjab, accompanied the SIT assuming the identity of a DSP, said SAD president Sukhbir Badal.Badal said the security staff of the ex-CM, including some Punjab police officials, were able to identify Singla.Badal told The Tribune that Singla's real identity was revealed when they questioned his credentials. Badal said the SIT "violated" the High court order by bringing a retired official under a fake identity."This smacks of a conspiracy and proves our point that the whole probe was and is politicized, " he said.An Akali leader said Singla left the room when the Badals' questioned the legality of his presence during questioning.SAD leadership maintained that the SIT claimed that the official was a DSP."He was wearing a mask due to which he was not immediately recognised," said an Akali leader.However, government sources said the SIT had not faked the official's identity."The SIT is empowered to attach a legal expert to the investigation. It is allowed by the High Court. Moreover, Vijay Singla is well known to the Badal family as he had been their advocate earlier, so there was no question of faking his identity," the official said.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had quashed the previous SIT for biased investigation.Badal was questioned for nearly three hours by the SIT on the sequence of events leading to police opening firing at a mob protesting the series of sacrilege incidents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kotkapura-firing-case-sit-questioning-ex-cm-parkash-badal-brought-along-retired-official-under-fake-identity-says-sukhbir-272395

Kejriwal was here to induct former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh into the party fold.Bid to tarnish SAD’s imageThe cat is out of the bag! It’s clear now how AAP & Congress, using services of Kunwar Vijay Pratap, have done everything to tarnish SAD’s image. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, sadIn the presence of party’s state president Bhagwant Mann, Punjab affairs in charge Jarnail Singh, co-in charge Raghav Chadha and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema, Kejriwal said while discussions were on within the party to select the right candidate as the CM face, he was certain the entire state would be “proud” of the party choice.“I can tell you that a member of the Sikh community will be our CM face. Punjab is the only state having a Sikh CM,” he said.Asked whether Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu was would join the party, Kejriwal said Sidhu was with the Congress and he respected him. “I believe such loose talks should be avoided with respect to Sidhu,” he said.Addressing Kunwar as ‘Afsar bhai’, Kejriwal said like him, Kunwar too didn’t belong to any political family. Pointing out that the former IG, who recently took voluntary retirement from service, played a vital role in “digging out the truth” behind the Bargari sacrilege and police firing cases, the Delhi CM said Kunwar invited the wrath of the entire system and had to take voluntary retirement.Kejriwal claimed his party would deliver “justice” in the sacrilege and subsequent police firing cases. “Entire Punjab is watching how the masterminds of the Bargari sacrilege and Kotkapura firing cases are roaming freely. If voted to power, the culprits will be put behind bars and justice will be done,” he said.Kejriwal and Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh later paid obeisance at the Golden Temple and Durgiana Mandir.

It has been accepted for hearing during the ongoing summer vacation and is expected to come up for consideration before a Division Bench this week.Among other things, Bajwa — who has filed the filed the petition in person — has sought directions to the respondents to apply brakes to the appointments sought to be given on compassionate ground.Among other things, Bajwa has taken the ground that the decision to give government jobs was in violation of the policy governing compassionate appointments. Besides, the decision came after a delay of 37 years in the favour of “very influential and rich persons” who were the legal heirs of the MLAs.Bajwa has further submitted that the appointments on public posts of inspector and naib tehsildar could not be given in an arbitrary and unconstitutional way. This was especially relevant as hundred of eligible persons, who had lost their father or breadearner while performing their duty towards the state, were ignored.In his “mentioning plea”, Bajwa stated: “The prayer is for listing the case during the holidays as the public appointments are being made in haste. Those who have been selected are already well-off after a gap of 37 years.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/job-row-double-trouble-for-punjab-government-272242

Only Sub-Inspector or Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) can be appointed directly by the government. The issue is learnt to have been pointed out by the Home Department.Interestingly, the initial proposal was to appoint Bajwa’s son as a Sub-Inspector, but the Cabinet decided to recruit him as an Inspector. Sources said the Home Department had objected to the appointment of Bajwa’s son as a DSP on compassionate ground as he did not meet the criteria.Two days ago, PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar had opposed the decision to give jobs to the sons of party MLAs. Cautioning that the party would be accused of promoting nepotism, Jakhar had urged the Chief Minister to reverse the “ill-advised” decision.A number of MLAs have pointed out that people’s representatives must work for the masses and not personal gains. Five ministers — Charanjit Channi, Sukhjinder Randhawa, Tript Bajwa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria and Razia Sultana — had opposed the appointment.Citing assets of the MLAs, party leaders had questioned the legislators for seeking government jobs on moral grounds. As per the affidavit filed by Bajwa during the 2017 elections, he had shown moveable and immoveable assets of Rs 5.40 crore and that of his spouse of Rs 27.95 crore. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/inspector-cant-be-recruited-directly-says-home-dept-272243

Kunwar, who has served a long innings in the Majha region, was inducted into the AAP in the holy city of Sikhs. It is here that several hardline religio-socio organisations had recently honoured him for his investigation into the sacrilege issue.Aman Arora, senior AAP MLA, said Kunwar’s induction would help the party establish itself in the Majha region, while creating a narrative of how a party “guilty” of sacrilege and the other which promised to punish the guilty, colluded to deny justice to the Sikhs.Political observers feel that it is to support the ‘Panthic’ narrative that AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal declared that the party’s CM candidate in the 2022 elections would be a Sikh. Some others feel that these moves may help AAP politically, but not electorally.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/induction-of-former-sit-chief-aimed-at-getting-foothold-in-majha-region-272244

Jaipal and another person were killed in an encounter with a special task force of the West Bengal Police in Kolkata. Jaipal’s father and other relatives had subsequently claimed they had spotted some “unusual marks” on the body.Justice Jhingan noted the body of the petitioner’s son was lying at his place for nine days and rejection of his prayer for a second post-mortem at the current stage might result in irreversible damage.Justice Jhingan also made it clear the order was being passed after ignoring the technicalities and considering the nature of the relief sought.Appearing on the PGIMER’s behalf, senior advocate Amit Jhanji assured the Bench needful would be done for complying with the court directions. Petitioner’s advocates APS Randhawa, Dhananjay Grover, Ishma Randhawa and Simranjit Singh, in turn, submitted the father would himself bring the body to the PGIMER as he was not ready to hand it over to the police.“Let the petitioner hand over the body of his son to the PGIMER, Chandigarh, on June 22 at 10 am for conducting the second post-mortem,” Justice Jhingan asserted, while directing the handing over of the report’s copies to the petitioner, the Punjab Police, and other authorities concerned.Justice Jhingan added it would have been appropriate to hear the West Bengal authorities in normal circumstances. But the petition was being decided today itself, considering time was of the essence and in view of the Supreme Court directions.The matter was placed before Justice Jhingan’s Bench after it was remanded back by the Supreme Court with observations that the Punjab and Haryana High Court erred in initially dismissing the petition on the grounds that the death had occurred in Kolkata and the post-mortem examination too was conducted there.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/form-board-for-2nd-autopsy-of-jaipal-singh-bhullar-pgi-told-272245

Only one of them went on to become a minister, while others have either remained just MLAs or even failed to win polls.Former DGP (J&K) PS Gill, who hailed from Punjab, courted quite a controversy when he joined the Shiromani Akali Dal to contest elections from Moga. He failed miserably and later joined the BJP.IG Bhagwan Singh Danewalia was among the first to try second innings in politics. He was the chief of the Punjab Police in the 1970s when an Inspector-General was the highest rank in the police force. He was a reformist and penned three books advocating changes in policing apart from social reforms. He chose to float his own party arguing that neither Congress nor the Akalis meant betterment of the state.He contested byelection from Faridkot against Jagdish Kaur, mother of sitting Congress MLA Kikki Dhillon, butpolled negligible votes.DSP Bishambar Das joined the BJP after retirement and won the Narot Mehra Assembly elections.

The Agriculture Department is finding it hard to convince the farmers of Doaba — a region more suitable for the crop — to sow maize as the alternative kharif crop. Farmers say low market price, no government procurement and problems in drying the harvested produce were making it less remunerative to sow maize this season.The area under maize was down to 1.08 lakh hectares even last year and this time, as the sowing for the kharif varieties of maize has begun, the department has set a target to bring 1.5 lakh hectares under the crop. Even now, as the spring maize has started arriving in mandis, the farmers are ruing that their crop is being sold at as low as one-third of the MSP of Rs 1,850 per quintal. Since there is no government procurement, the private players are offering only Rs 600 to Rs 850 per quintal (depending on the moisture content in the crop).Director, Agriculture, SS Sidhu said, “No doubt that maize is the best alternative to paddy and we are dependent on private buyers for the price. But we can certainly hope for a better price in the days to come as some bio-asanol projects being approved by the Centre are in the pipeline and these could get set up in parts of Doaba and Majha in the near future.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-govt-purchase-farmers-fail-to-get-msp-for-maize-272251

Farmers said against the promised eight-hour uninterrupted supply to the agriculture sector by the state government, they had been getting power supply for six to seven hours, thereby resulting in shortage of water required for paddy sowing.Using generatorsWe are left with no alternative, but to use generators to draw water from tubewells. But, this requires large quantities of diesel, thereby adding to the input cost. Jagshir Singh Jhumba, leader of bku (ugrahan)Farmers rued that daily one-two hour cut in electricity could delay paddy sowing. Harpreet Singh and Ramesh Kumar, both farmers from Mehma Sarkari village, said, “The substation started power supply at 6 am, but it was switched off around 1 pm. We are yet to water a large chunk of our fields.”Jagshir Singh Jhumba, a leader of BKU (Ugrahan), said, “The supply from almost every power grid is affected in the district. PSPCL officials do not even attend our phone calls and complaints. If the department does not restore uninterrupted electricity supply, farm unions will start gherao at different power stations in the district soon.”Baljit Singh, Superintending Engineer, PSPCL, said, “If supply is reduced for some duration then it is compensated by providing extra power within 24 hours. We ensure that farmers get uninterrupted supply during the paddy season.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bathinda-villages-get-only-6-hr-power-supply-sowing-affected-272262

Alleging that many close to local political lobby have been “wrongfully transferred lakhs of rupees”, villagers are now demanding a probe into the whole acquisition process and transfer of compensation amount” at the behest of the local political lobby.“In Aakrhi village, a panchayat member was allotted Rs 51 lakh compensation despite the fact that he neither owns land nor has any girdawari in his name,” claim over a dozen residents who have now demanded an impartial probe into the case. “In majority of the cases, poor landless tillers received merely Rs 9 lakh and in a few cases they were sidelined to accommodate politically connected persons,” says a villager.The acquired land near a government school in the same village has been shown away from the school premises and allocated to a marriage palace, allege villagers.“Even this needs to be probed as to how a marriage palace can come up just adjacent to a school. The whole land compensation process needs a thorough probe to ascertain the role of the panchayat and rural development officials and also the local politicians,” claims Gurdhian Singh Seona, senior leader of the Krantikari Kissan Union.“Everyone knows the political lobby that has minted crores in this land compensation process. Only an impartial probe can unveil the land mafia in these villages,” he said.In a complaint submitted to the Rajpura SDM, a copy of which was marked to the CM, many villagers have stated that the administration should conduct a fair probe. “In many cases, MGNREGA funds continue to be wrongly distributed among kin of local panchayat members. So, they don’t object to the wrongful compensation being paid to outsiders,” it read.Rajpura SDM Khushdil Singh said: “As per the government directions, the village panchayat gets Rs 25 lakh, while the tiller gets Rs 9 lakh per acre. We will verify the complaint in detail.”The integrated manufacturing cluster will be developed with the help of the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation on more than 1,100 acres of land.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rajpura-villagers-allege-scam-in-land-acquired-for-it-park-272263

22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC orders second autopsy for gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday directed the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, to constitute a board and expeditiously conduct the second postmortem of alleged gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar.The direction by Justice Avneesh Jhingan of the High Court came on a petition filed by Bhullar’s father Bhupinder Singh. Bhullar and another person were killed in an encounter with a special task force of the West Bengal Police in Kolkata. Jaipal’s father and other relatives had subsequently claimed that they spotted some “unusual marks” on the body. Justice Jhingan noted that the body of the petitioner’s son was lying at his place for almost nine days and rejection of his prayer for the second post-mortem at the current stage might result in irreversible damage. Justice Jhingan also made it clear that the order was being passed after ignoring the technicalities and considering the nature of the relief sought. Appearing on the PGIMER’s behalf, senior advocate Amit Jhanji assured Justice Jhingan’s Bench that the needful would be done for complying with the Court directions. The counsel for the petitioner, in turn, submitted that the father would himself bring the body to the PGIMER as he was not ready to hand it over to the police.“Let the petitioner hand over the body of his son to PGIMER, Chandigarh on June 22 at 10 am for conducting the second postmortem”, Justice Jhingan asserted, while directing the handing over of the report’s copies to the petitioner, the Punjab Police, and other authorities concerned.Justice Jhingan added it would have been appropriate to hear the West Bengal authorities in normal circumstances. But the petition was being decided today itself, considering that time was the essence and in view of the Supreme Court directions.The matter was placed before Justice Jhingan’s Bench after it was remanded back by the Supreme Court with observations that the Punjab and Haryana High Court erred in initially dismissing the petition on the ground that the death had occurred in Kolkata and the postmortem examination too was conducted there. Claiming that the nature of injuries showed Bhullar was shot point-blank, his father had asked for issuance of directions to the State of Punjab to conduct the second postmortem either at Chandigarh PGIMER, AIIMS Delhi, or some independent institute “to the know the exact detail and nature of the injuries caused due to police torture on the various parts of the body”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-hc-orders-second-autopsy-for-gangster-jaipal-singh-bhullar-271901
