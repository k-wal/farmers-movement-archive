Our government is fully committed for the welfare of our sportspersons," Singh tweeted.Talking to the media, para-athlete Sanjeev Kumar said they were not given jobs by the state government despite assurances.Kumar said he had won many medals and awards, including the Punjab government's prestigious Maharaja Ranjit Singh Award.Another para-athlete, Veena Arora of Amritsar, also asked the Punjab government to provide jobs to them.Taking a dig at the government, the protesters said if it could offer jobs to the sons of two Congress MLAs on compassionate grounds, then there is no reason why it cannot give jobs to them.They were referring to the Punjab cabinet's decision to appoint Qadian MLA Fatehjang Singh Bajwa's son Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa as an inspector in the Punjab Police and Ludhiana MLA Rakesh Pandey's son Bhisham Pandey as a naib tehsildar in the Revenue Department on "compassionate" grounds.AAP legislator Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the special athletes were more qualified and fit for government jobs than the sons of Congress MLAs and leaders.The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government made a lot of announcements for sportspersons, but most of them are living in poverty now, he said.The AAP leader added that para-athletes had staged a 'dharna' last year as well to remind the government of its promise of jobs to them.

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Manpreet Badal should quit for lopsided 6th pay panel report: Chugh||BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Thursday flayed the Amarinder Singh government for accepting lopsided recommendations of the sixth pay commission and inciting government employees to go on strike.In a statement, Chugh demanded the resignation of state Finance Minister Manpreet Badal for having failed to vet the recommendations of the pay commission in view of the hardships faced by the government employees. Chugh said if the BJP comes to power in the state, it would revise the recommendations of the pay commission to help the employees.He said the government's insensitivity towards the demands of doctors at a time when they were fighting Covid as frontline warriors, was reprehensible.Chugh said the state government should have held discussions with the government employees to hear their grievances before implementing the pay commission report."But the chief minister and the finance minister seemed to be plotting more for political gains out of it than to give real relief to the employees", Chugh said.Given the kind of governance in Punjab, Chugh said, there is a gloomy atmosphere all around. He said if liquor mafias, sand mafias and transport mafias are running the state the government employees should not have had much hope from the Amarinder government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/manpreet-badal-should-quit-for-lopsided-6th-pay-panel-report-chugh-273369

The celebrations kicked off the International Olympic Day with a cake cut by players and the office-bearers of the academy.Surjit Academy celebrates Int’l Olympic DayDronacharya Awardee and Olympian Rajinder Singh (Junior), who recently got appointed as the Chief Hockey Coach by the Punjab Government, congratulated all the players on this day. Expressing concern over the falling standard of women’s hockey in Punjab, he said the Department of Sports, Punjab, would soon take up hockey at the grass-root level in the state with full planning so that more Punjabi players can make their place in the Indian hockey team.Harjot Kaur of Surjit Hockey Academy also read a paper on International Olympic Day on the occasion. Earlier, the players paid tributes to late Milkha Singh and his wife Nirmal Milkha Singh.Speaking on the occasion, Surjit Hockey Society general secretary Iqbal Singh Sandhu said Punjab led the country in hockey but the selection of only one player Gurjit Kaur in Indian women team for Olympics-2021 is a testament to the sharp decline in the level of women’s hockey in Punjab. As many as nine players are in Olympic hockey squad from neighbouring state Haryana.Sandhu said Government Senior (Girls) Secondary School, Nehru Garden, Jalandhar, had been running the country’s leading girls hockey training centre for almost 40 years now and Olympian and International players like Nisha Sharma, Harpreet Kaur, Ajinder Kaur, Rajni Sharma, Surjit Bajwa, Sharanjit Kaur and Rajbir Kaur are the products of this hockey centre.Apart from producing Olympians, international and national athletes, Punjab had the honour of winning the highest number of national championships till 2016, but this excellent hockey centre got permanently closed in 2016.Sandhu said a hockey academy for girls should be established in Jalandhar without any further delay. He also demanded that an experienced woman hockey coach should be appointed to impart hockey training who could better understand the difficulties of the women players.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/standard-of-womens-hockey-witnesses-a-decline-in-punjab-273307
24-06-2021||GS Paul||Jobless, Punjab para players to return awards||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, June 23Dejected by the false assurances of government jobs, Amritsar-based Paralympian Veena Arora, along with other para players of national and international repute, have decided to return their state sports awards in protest.Along with her, at least seven para players of various disciplines from Punjab including international wheelchair para badminton player Sanjeev Kumar, state awardees Kuldeep , Gurdeep, Rajeshwar, Varinder Khanna, Gursewak and Jatinder from various parts of Punjab, will stage protest outside the CM’s residence in Chandigarh on Thursday. Recipient of prestigious Maharaja Ranjit Singh Award, Veena (46) said on the one hand Capt Amarinder-led government offered jobs to its effluent MLAs’ sons for political gains, whereas on the other, the deserving ones were left in the lurch. Launching a scathing attack on policy matters, she pointed out that more than a sportsperson that too disabled who brought laurels in the sports field, a ‘tiktok’ star Gurnoor finds prominence on Capt Amarinder’s priority list, whose father was inducted into the police.“Similarly, the kin of those who died by consuming illicit liquor, too, gained government’s attention and were offered jobs. What about us who had put the state on global map?” she asked. She said a dharna was staged outside the CM’s residence in 2019, too, but it culminated with hollow promises made by his OSD.Over two decades ago, Veena lost her right hand to the negligence on the part of doctors. “I was 25 then. My right hand had to be amputated as it had developed gangrene due to wrong prescription. Another jolt was that my husband left me and our 3-year-old child. It took me some time to rebuild my will power,” she said. With no assistance from the state government or district administration, Veena ran a block printing business to make both ends meet. About her interest in sports, she said in 2010, she came across a person in New Delhi, who inspired her to try special sports. “I never knew about para sports. It took me two years to build my confidence and I took admissions to Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to undergo training.” There was no looking back after that.Achievements aplenty||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jobless-punjab-para-players-to-return-awards-273206

Once the budget of wedding photography used to run in crores in Amritsar offering employment to a large number of professionals, but now, the profession is seeing a steep downturn due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the last one-and-a-half years.Restrictions imposed in the wake of Covid-19 such as not having more than 20 persons at a marriage ceremony, unable to travel in flights or trains have made once big fat Punjabi wedding a pygmy affair.There are hundreds of photo studios in the city catering to wedding photography. Nearly 20 of these cater to high-end marriages engaging them for Rs 2 lakh and above. So, the high-end shops used to engage 10 to 20 persons to discharge the job efficiently. Barring a few, a majority of them have retrenched their staff.Vijay Malhotra, running two photo studios in the city, said those families who used to spend Rs 2 lakh and above on photography and cinematic shooting stretching for 10 days have now brought it down to one or two-day affair. He said he is paying salaries to all his 15 employees, but this cannot be afforded by all photo studios.NRI weddings and people from agriculture background used to form a major chunk of customers. Air travel restrictions brought down their arrival. Major embargo on not more than 20 persons in the wedding has taken away locals as well, who are now investing their money in giving gifts of gold ornaments and fixed deposits.Earlier, these families used to invest in asking for pre-wedding shoots, four-k quality cinematic candid shoot, equal to shooting a Bollywood movie. Candid photography was another genre in which persons used to be clicked in their natural background without their prior intimation.Similarly, the 10-day long wedding programme has been reduced to a two-day affair. Earlier, wedding celebrations used to start with a bangle ceremony, DJ night or ladies sangeet, then bachelorette party, mehandi shoot, dress shoot, parlour or make-up shoot, ribbon cutting, milni, sehrabandi, baraat, jai mala and phere among others.Rakeshwar Sharma, whose family is operating a photo studio on a prime commercial location Crystal Chowk for the last over five decades, said many families were conducting the wedding in a day. “Now, no bill amount crosses the Rs 30,000 mark. With this amount in hand, I cannot afford to keep the staff of seven persons. So, all of them have been laid off,” he said. Each cameramen is equipped with superior quality cameras costing Rs6lakh and above. With paltry liquidity, it is not economically viable to engage men and material.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/big-fat-weddings-in-punjab-a-pass%C3%A9-blame-it-on-covid-273210

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Back from Delhi, Punjab CM gets going||The current crisis in the Punjab Congress has set off micro-management of the Capt Amarinder Singh led-government by the party high command, if the slew of decisions taken in the past few days are any indication.Ever since the brainstorming by the party high command to resolve the crisis began, the Punjab Cabinet in its recent meetings has taken important decisions on long-pending issues like regularising contractual safai karamcharis and clearing the pending dues of SC students.Efforts on for Capt-Sidhu truce: RawatSources reveal the Chief Minister has promised time-bound action in the next one month in the SIT probe into the Kotkapura police firing case, as being demanded by dissident ministers and MLAs, including Navjot Singh Sidhu. “The written statement by Fatehjang Bajwa to decline the offer of the government job was also due to intervention by the party high command,” said a senior party leader. The state government was all set to implement a long-pending demand of waiving loans of landless farm labourers, he said. Minister Charanjit Singh Channi said the long-pending issues related to Dalits and poor were in the knowledge of the party high command and the state government was addressing them. Though the Chief Minister, during his yesterday’s interaction with the AICC-appointed Kharge panel, is learnt to have taken a voluminous notes of the decisions taken vis-à-vis the 2017 election manifesto, the panel on the basis of feedback from ministers, MLAs and other party leaders has spent time on discussing the way forward in the implementation of the pending or incomplete agendas like controlling the sand and transport mafia, bringing down the power rates, re-negotiating the power purchase agreements, visible action on the ground in the Kotkapura police firing case, besides other important issues. After returning from Delhi, the Chief Minister is learnt to have called a meeting of officials to prepare an action plan to implement key promises, as flagged by the Kharge panel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/back-from-delhi-punjab-cm-gets-going-273014

We have met the minister a number of times and submitted representations, but to no avail. At one of the meetings last year, he had said the government would increase Rs 500 in the first phase and the rest of the hiked amount would be paid in a phased manner. However, we haven’t received even a penny. After holding district-level meetings, we have now decided to hold a state-level rally in Patiala,” said Samra.“In addition to the honorarium, there are a slew of other long-standing demands that the state government has failed to address in its four-year rule,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/awaiting-dues-nambardars-to-hold-stir-in-patiala-273061
24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Staff salaries highest in country, claims Punjab govt||Even as various sections of Punjab employees have raised the banner of revolt against the state government for accepting the “meagre hike in salaries” recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission, the state government says their salaries continue to be the highest in the country and will take up over 40 per cent of the state’s total revenues.Patwaris also reject reportPatwaris and kanungos have also rejected the report of the commission, saying they have received no benefit. “The benefit to patwaris in 2011 (by the Tikshan Sud committee) was only for a handful of employees,” said Mohan Singh, legal secretary of the Kanungo AssociationA look at the pay commission report shows that the reason for a substantive section of employees getting a small hike is that they had received a raise in pay scales in 2011 over and above the Fifth Pay Commission report that was implemented in 2009. Though the Fifth Pay Commission was effective from 2006, it was implemented in 2009.Officials in the Finance Department say the basis for calculating a hike in the pay scales is always the previous pay commission, but employees are calculating their hike on the basis of the revised pay scales granted to them by the sub-committee.“The total impact of the recommendations of the sub-committee of 2011 was Rs 3,000 crore per annum (or Rs 12,000 crore in four years till December 2015). Moreover, employees are not justified in demanding that hike in salaries be calculated on a multiple of 2.74, saying this was the method adopted by Government of India’s Seventh Pay Commission. We have granted a hike in salary by a multiple of 2.59 to Group C and D employees, but for others it has been in multiples of 2.64-2.72. It is only for those who received additional incentives in 2011 that the hike has been in multiples of 2.25,” said a member of the commission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/staff-salaries-highest-in-country-claims-punjab-govt-273063

24-06-2021||Chandigarh/Ferozepur||Gangster Jaipal Bhullar cremated after 2nd autopsy rules out torture||Slain gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar was cremated today in Ferozepur two weeks after his death in a police encounter. The family agreed to cremate him following a second postmortem report by a Board of Doctors at the PGI stating he died of a firearm injury and there were no other extraneous wounds on his body.Jaipal’s father Bhupinder Singh, an ex-Punjab Police inspector, however, alleged the report was seemingly concocted and apparently made under pressure from senior officials of the state government. The second postmortem report was conducted by a medical board constituted by the PGI on Tuesday following an order by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.The cremation was done amidst large presence of police force, intelligence sleuths and mediapersons who apparently outnumbered the relatives and friends. Jaipal’s younger brother Amritpal Singh, who is presently lodged in the Central Jail, Bathinda, was brought here “handcuffed” by the security personnel to perform the cremation and do the last rights.During the cremation, Amritpal wanted his handcuffs to be removed but taking no chances, the escorting police personnel did not oblige. Immediately after the cremation, Amritpal, who is one of the accused in the 30 kg gold “loot” that took place in Ludhiana last year, was whisked away back to Bathinda.Earlier, Jaipal’s body was brought here from Kolkata on June 11, but before the cremation could take place, his father alleged there were marks on his body, indicating torture, after which he approached the district administration and the High Court, saying another postmortem should be done.In the report issued by the PGI team, it was mentioned that there were no injuries on the body which did not indicate any physical torture. The report said the majority of injuries were firearm injuries and even the fracture on the left forearm was perhaps caused due to impact of bullets resulting in shattering of the bone. It finally said no underlying injury was found at any place which could suggest any kind of torture.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gangster-jaipal-bhullar-cremated-after-2nd-autopsy-rules-out-torture-273095
24-06-2021||Chandigarh||A first, 20 Benches to hear criminal cases||Nearly 15 months after the Punjab and Haryana High Court went into restrictive functioning mode following Covid outbreak, it has decided to ensure that the administration of justice was not defeated by dedicating 20 Benches to hear criminal matters.This is, perhaps, the first time in the past several years that so many Benches will take up cases involving life and liberty.New roster to expedite hearingIn March 2020, before the outbreak of the pandemic, the High Court had just about 15 Benches hearing regular and anticipatory bail matters, besides other criminal cases. As the virus from Wuhan left the judiciary in crisis with the High Court judges, other judicial officers and the staff testing positive for Covid, the number of cases being heard, including criminal matters, had to be reduced drastically.But the new roster, which comes into force from June 28, is expected to expedite hearing in all categories of cases, including bail pleas. Cases after 1995 related to senior citizens, crime against women, differently abled person, juveniles, marginalised sections, Prevention of Corruption Act, cases in which proceedings before the lower courts have been stayed and remand cases from the Supreme Court, would also be taken up on priority basis.An analysis of the roster also makes it clear that almost all judges hearing criminal matters will be taking up anticipatory and regular bail petitions. The roster is significant as the Supreme Court, less than a fortnight ago, had made it clear to the High Court that at least half of the judges were required to sit on alternative days during the prevailing pandemic to accord hearing to “persons in distress”. The High Court, as of now, has 46 judges, with 14 judges in seven Division Benches.The SC, otherwise also, in the case of Babu Singh vs State of UP had held that right to bail was included in the personal liberty under Article 21. Its refusal would be deprivation of that liberty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-first-20-benches-to-hear-criminal-cases-273097

Initially, I thought the airline staff was not allowing me to board due to Covid-induced restrictions. I told them that I had a valid Covid-19 negative test. With just half an hour left for the plane to take-off, I made some calls to some important people in New Delhi following which things got moving,” Oberoi told The Tribune over phone from Dubai.The businessman, a UAE golden visa holder, had flown to India from Dubai on June 12.The UAE had suspended entry for passengers from India on April 24 following the second wave of Covid with only certain categories allowed to still fly into the country. These included members of the diplomatic missions, golden visa holders, UAE nationals and passengers specifically granted permission by the UAE authorities.Oberoi said: “Last month, an Emirates flight had flown from Mumbai to Dubai with just one passenger Bhavesh Javeri, CEO of the Dubai-based Stargem group. He was the sole passenger of EK 501, paying 909 dirhams (Rs 17,700) for the trip.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/for-rs-15-000-nri-bizman-sps-oberoi-flies-solo-to-dubai-on-248-seater-ai-plane-273102

24-06-2021||New Delhi||ED summons 3 top fashion designers in PMLA case against Punjab Congress MLA Sukhpal Khaira||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned three top fashion designers of the country in connection with a money-laundering case against a Punjab Congress legislator, official sources said on Wednesday.They said the designers have been sent notices to appear for questioning before the Central probe agency in Delhi by next week.The names of the designers are being withheld as they were unavailable for comments.The summons is related to a money-laundering case against Punjab Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and his family members. The agency had conducted searches against the accused in March, the sources said.Khaira was a rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA when the raids were carried out. He has recently re-joined the Congress.The legislator from the Bholath Assembly seat in Punjab’s Kapurthala district won the election in 2017 on an AAP ticket.However, he resigned from the primary membership of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party in January 2019 and floated his own outfit, the Punjab Ekta Party.The ED has alleged that Khaira is an “associate” of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers.The 56-year-old politician has denied any wrongdoing and said he is being targeted by Central agencies as he has been vocal against the Centre’s three new farm laws.The case against him pertains to the probe in a 2015 Fazilka (Punjab) drugs-smuggling case in which 1,800 gm of heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by security agencies from a gang of international drug smugglers.The sources said the ED has found that certain payments, including in cash, were allegedly made to the three designers and hence, the agency wants to know their version of the transactions and record their statements.The ED had filed the case under criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Khaira and others after studying a Punjab Police FIR.“The drugs were smuggled through the India-Pakistan border and one of the kingpins of the syndicate is in the UK.“Khaira was actively aiding and supporting the gang of international smugglers and enjoying the proceeds of crime,” the agency has alleged.

24-06-2021||Aditi Tandon||Sonia Gandhi to decide Punjab matter by July 10: Harish Rawat||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 23Congress president Sonia Gandhi will decide on the Punjab Government and party revitalisation by July 8-10, AICC general secretary in-charge of the state Harish Rawat said on Wednesday after meeting Rahul Gandhi in the National Capital.Rawat said the AICC panel formed by Sonia Gandhi in Punjab held detailed discussions with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh yesterday on the progress of 18 major party manifesto promises and set deadlines for him to deliver on pending pledges, including Bargari and drug rackets within the perimeters of the law.Rawat also said that the panel has already submitted a report to the Congress chief on the structural, organisational and political issues related to Punjab and her decision on the matter will come by July 8 to 10.Commenting on the meeting with Capt Amarinder, Rawat also said that the panel had asked the Chief Minister to take action against the sand and transport mafia, besides ensuring free 200 units of power per urban households in the state.”A lot of promises were made in our manifesto. Many promises have been fulfilled. We discussed all that with the Chief Minister. The AICC has given clear deadlines on certain issues and asked for time bound implementation. For instance, Bargari is an emotional issue in Punjab, and we respect the sentiments of people. So, we have told the Chief Minister to find a solution to it within the perimeters of public sentiment and law. After all, everything has to be lawful,” Rawat said.He added that on the drug issue, the state government had acted against some mafia and some will soon be acted on. “Power is a big issue. Urban Punjab has complained of being disregarded in the matter. The AICC has instructed the Chief Minister to ensure free 200 units of power per urban household. We have also sought action on delivery of SC scholarships, and loan waivers for the poor and Dalits, besides regularisation of land encroached by them,” Rawat said.He said the Congress manifesto had assured 100 per cent action against the sand mafia and the Chief Minister had said he would get the matter examined legally to take control of the sector. “The government has taken steps to weaken the transport mafia and more steps are in the pipeline,” said Rawat, adding that the Chief Minister will soon make important declarations on these issues to the media in Chandigarh.To media questions about former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s public statements against the Chief Minister, Rawat said, “We have taken note of these statements. I have called for the statements by Sidhu, will examine them. Where I feel I need to advise him, I will advise him. That is the work of the general secretary. So far, everyone in Punjab has heeded my advice.”On Sidhu’s public remarks, Rawat added the former minister had also noted that he would abide by the decisions of the high command.Asked about the Punjab Congress face for 2022 state elections, Rawat said, “We will discuss that matter when the time comes.”He also said the party will call Sidhu for discussions soon.Earlier today, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, Finance Minister Manpreet Badal, MPs Ravneet Bittu and Partap Bajwa also met Rahul Gandhi.Jakhar later said he was hopeful of an early resolution of the Punjab issue, given the level of seriousness with which Rahul Gandhi is viewing the matter.”We discussed ways of strengthening the party and resolving differences of opinion between leaders. The seriousness with which Rahul is watching the issue, I am confident of an early solution. The Congress will politically revive from Punjab,” said Jakhar, adding that compensatory job to kin of MLAs was wrong and could not be defended.“Some so-called advisers have landed the CM’s office in a spot. What is wrong cannot be called a right,” the state chief added on the issue of jobs to sons of MLAs in the state.Bajwa, meanwhile, said MLAs and ministers who want to fight elections in Punjab have discussed with the leadership the ways to get reelected.”We spoke about the current political situation of Punjab, where we stand electorally, what are the expectations of the people from us,” said Bajwa.On who would be the party’s face in 2022, Bajwa said that is for the leadership to decide.“I have told Rahul about my assessment and about how genuine the grievances of some leaders are. We held threadbare discussions on every issue and I suggested my solution on how to win the state,” Bajwa said, adding that he was expecting a solution in a week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sonia-gandhi-to-decide-punjab-matter-by-july-10-harish-rawat-272922
24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Congress MLA Fatehjung Bajwa declines Punjab govt’s job offer for son||In what is being seen as a damage control move for the Congress party, MLA Fatehjung Singh Bajwa has given in writing to the party high command that he does not require a government job for his son, Arjun Bajwa.The Punjab MLA’s son was recently given a job of an Inspector in a Cabinet meeting.It is learnt that the Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat was asked to call the MLA, asking him to give in writing that he did not require the job.The MLA who yesterday went to Delhi, gave in writing to Rawat in this regard.The issue of offering jobs to the MLA’s son has become a major embarrassment for the party.Recently the PPCC chief, Sunil Jakhar, and other senior leaders opposed the decision to give jobs to sons of party MLAs Fatehjung Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey.The decision to give appointments on “compassionate ground” was taken at a Cabinet meeting yesterday.At least five ministers Charanjit Channi, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Tript Bajwa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria and Razian Sultaan had strongly opposed the move during the Cabinet meeting.Cautioning that the party would be accused of promoting nepotism, Jakhar had said, “Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh must reverse the ill-advised decision.”Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Nagra had said the people’s representatives must work for the people and not for personal gains.“The Cabinet should rollback the decision. We should meet the promise of ‘ghar ghar naukri’ instead of giving jobs to the kin of MLAs who don’t need it,” he had said.Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring appealed to the MLAs not to accept the jobs being offered to their sons.“It would amount to cheating with the common man.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-mla-fatehjung-bajwa-declines-punjab-govts-job-offer-for-son-272919
