27-06-2021||New Delhi/Washington||'Sikhs For Justice' begins lobbying among US lawmakers, terminates it within 3 months||Sikhs for Justice, a secessionist group facing multiple probes in India and declared an unlawful entity, has summarily terminated its lobbying among US lawmakers within three months of launching a campaign to garner their support, documents show.In the lobbying disclosure reports filed by its registered lobbyist, 'Blue Star Strategies LLC', 'Sikhs for Justice' (SFJ) has been described as a "US-based NGO that supports the secession of Punjab from India".The lobbyist has further disclosed in its filings that the specific lobbying issue of its client was to "raise awareness in the US of treatment of Sikh community in India".The documents submitted to the US Senate Lobbying Disclosure platform show that Blue Star Strategies' lobbying registration report on behalf of Sikhs For Justice was filed on March 12, 2021, while the first quarterly disclosure report was filed by it a little over a month later on April 19.Besides raising "awareness in the US about the treatment of Sikh community in India", the initial filing also mentioned, "efforts by the Sikh-American diaspora in the US to draw attention to these issues" among the specific lobbying issues.However, the second part was omitted from the lobbying disclosure filings made post-registration.Also, in less than three months of the registration, Blue Star Strategies filed a termination report for its lobbying activities on behalf of SFJ, effective May 31.The termination report was subsequently posted on the US Senate Lobbying Disclosure platform on June 15.While no particular reason has been given for the termination, the lobbyist has disclosed 'less than USD 5,000' as income from the client for the second quarter of 2021, while a similar amount was disclosed in the first-quarter report.It has also disclosed the US House of Representatives and the Department of Justice among the houses/agencies covered under the lobbying activity for the client.Queries sent to the lobbyist as well as the client through their websites remained unanswered, while there was no response to calls made to the phone numbers listed there.SFJ has been in focus in the recent past in India after several people, including activists associated with the long-running farmers' protests on Delhi borders, were issued summons by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a case registered against this organisation.In the FIR, SFJ has been described as "an unlawful association under the UAPA Act" and has been accused, along with other Khalistani terrorist groups, of conspiring "to create an atmosphere of fear and lawlessness and to cause disaffection in people and to incite them towards rising in rebellion against the government of India".It has also been alleged that as part of this conspiracy, huge funds were being collected abroad for on-ground campaigns and propaganda against missions in countries like the USA, the UK, Canada, Germany, etc.SFJ's Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was among the nine individuals linked to separatist Khalistani outfits who were designated as terrorists by the Indian government in July last year under the UAPA Act.Later in December 2020, the NIA filed a charge sheet against 16 people associated with SFJ and based in the US, UK and Canada under the anti-terror law, UAPA, for allegedly indulging in seditious activities and promoting enmity on the grounds of region and religion in the country. These also included Pannun. The documents filed on the Senate Lobbying Disclosure platform further show that it was the second attempt by SFJ at lobbying for its cause among the US lawmakers, but the previous one was done indirectly.In March 2020, an entity named 'Greater America LLC' had engaged lobby firm 'The Livingston Group, LLC' on behalf of SFJ and the offices covered for the lobbying activities at that time included the White House Office.It had also disclosed an income of USD 10,000 from the client towards lobbying activities in the first quarter of 2020, but it filed a termination report within a month on April 17, 2020.The specific lobbying issues mentioned in the disclosure report at that time were "issues related to the intimidation and harassment of US citizens of Sikh ethnicity by individuals and entities outside of the United States for expressing their personal and political views."  Lobbying is a legal activity in the US, but the lobbyists need to be registered and need to file quarterly disclosure reports comprising details like lobbying income and expenses and offices covered for their respective clients.The Government of India also has a registered lobbyist in the US which typically covers issues related to bilateral relations between the two countries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sikhs-for-justice-begins-lobbying-among-us-lawmakers-terminates-it-within-3-months-274856
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to install 75 more oxygen plants by July-end||The Punjab government will install 75 more oxygen plants in the state by July-end, boosting the supply of the life-saving gas ahead of a possible third Covid wave, Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan said on Sunday.Mahajan said all relevant departments have been asked to complete the installation of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants by July-end, ensuring pressure and purity of oxygen.With this, the demand for medical oxygen will be met at all healthcare institutes in Punjab, she said in an official statement after chairing a high-level meeting to review the installation of the PSA plants and allied works.Mahajan asked the relevant officials to ensure the completion of all pre-activities for the installation of PSA plants by July 15 so that work of installation and commissioning is completed by July 25.During the meeting, Principal Secretary (Water Supply and Sanitation) Jaspreet Talwar, who heads the State Oxygen Management Group, told Mahajan that Punjab has two PSA plants, with a capacity of 1,400-litre per minute (LPM) each in Ludhiana and Jalandhar.While 42 plants have been allotted by the Centre, mainly for medical colleges and district hospitals in the state, another 33 plants have been arranged by various agencies and private bodies in the state.This will add to the state capacity of generating medical oxygen by more than 50 metric tonnes (MT) per day, she added.A pressure swing adsorption plant utilises the phenomena of some gases getting attracted to or “adsorbed” to particular solid surfaces when passing by it under high pressure, an official said.Owing to this phenomenon, when air is passed through a tank under high pressure, nitrogen in the air gets adsorbed on the tank’s internal surface made up of or coated with a layer of zeolite, and this results in the release of oxygen-rich air from the tank, serving the medical purpose, the official explained.

Yesterday, protesting farmer unions gheraoed the Barnala Superintending Engineer of the power authority. Under such conditions, it has become impossible for us to ensure quality supply to consumers,” said Dhiman.“The fears of engineers have come true and Punjab is now facing a severe power crisis. Due to poor planning, sufficient manpower was not arranged. The claims of the management regarding adequate power stand exposed with recurring cuts and insufficient supply to farmers,” said an association member.“It is ironic that healthy thermal units are not being revived even when the state is in the middle of a major power crisis,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pspcl-govt-ignored-alert-on-electricity-crisis-engineers-274642

He termed it a Pak conspiracy to weaken Punjab’s youth and weaning them from armed forces. He also launched a week-long statewide awareness drive by the School and Higher Education Departments.Earlier, Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the state government had made considerable progress in tackling drug abuse. He said medicines worth Rs 70 crore were being given every year to the persons undergoing treatment for drug de-addiction. The number of persons undergoing treatment had increased from 2,67,000 to 6,72,000, with the state government having spent Rs 70 crore to provide free medicines to patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/need-more-synergy-among-forces-agencies-to-curb-smuggling-punjab-cm-274584

Mobilised and funded by NGO HIV/AIDS Alliance for two years, the project witnessed success as women began turning up for de-addiction treatment in large numbers as a result of direct outreach by former drug dependents and staff.But with six members — including one counsellor, staff nurse, manager each and three outreach workers — leaving after the project ended in December, women are now shying away from turning up.After the NGO left, the state government has failed to provide additional workers to sustain the project. The Outreach Programme for Women Drug Users — a project run under the HIV/AIDS Alliance at the Navkiran Kendra in Kapurthala — was started in February 2019 and ended on December 31, 2020. The project provided nine (of total 15) WHO-approved de-addiction services under one roof as well community mobilisation services.Rehabilitated drug dependents from the North-East came to Kapurthala and visited women addicts across various hotspots, hearing their stories and accompanying them to centres. They held workshops for women and 10 drug dependents from Kapurthala were even taken to Delhi for one such event. However, the much-needed boost to women de-addiction services came to an abrupt halt when the NGO wrapped up its project on the completion of its tenure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-hits-lone-de-addiction-project-for-women-274585

Block in charge Assistant Superintendent Tarsem Pal has been transferred.Jail Superintendent Balkar Singh Bhullar said after receiving orders from senior officials, the three jail officials were immediately placed under suspension for negligence.“When inmates were holding a hookah party inside their cell, the officials displayed negligence on duty as they failed to act. The gangsters made a video and posted it on social media. They even enjoyed Punjabi songs on an LED TV in their barrack,” added Bhullar.The probe report questioned the presence of banned substances, including hookah, inside the jail and the role of officials on duty.After the matter came to light on May 16, Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had marked a probe to ADGP (Prisons) Parveen Kumar Sinha. The probed was conducted by DIG (Prisons) Surinder Saini, who submitted the report to the ADGP.The jail had recently witnessed a major controversy after Punjabi singer Karan Aujla entered the premises with police escort on April 7.

No justice in the following 4.5 years. Today, new SIT inches closer to justice for Punjab’s soul & you cry of political interference. Political interference was that which delayed justice by 6 years.”Responding to Sidhu’s tweet, Majithia said: “Sidhu seems to have lost his mental balance in his desperation to become CM.”He said Sidhu and other Congress leaders were flogging a dead horse on the drugs issue. “The Congress is not taking any action on the allegation of corruption against the staff of Sidhu.

He, however, ruled out repeal of the laws, as demanded by the protesters. “I want to appeal to the unions to end their agitation. The government has already conducted 11 rounds of talks with the farmers. Agricultural reform laws are going to change the standard of their living,” he said.Tomar said a large section of the country was supporting the laws but if the unions had any objection to any provision, the government was ready to “discuss and find a solution to their concerns”.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 unions protesting at various Delhi border points, claimed the farmers were detained in states like Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana during the protests. The farmers were to submit memorandum of demands to the President through Governors.Terming Tomar’s recent statements as “perplexing and contradictory”, the SKM asserted that farmers were not seeking some “meaningless amendments”, maintaining the laws had “fundamental flaws”.Farmers from various parts of Punjab had gathered at the Amb Sahib Gurdwara in Mohali from where they started marching towards Chandigarh in the afternoon. The police used water cannons and even resorted to mild lathicharge to stop the farmers, but they succeeded in entering Chandigarh after breaking through barricades. Carrying flags of unions and raising slogans against the BJP-led government, the protesters, including women and youths, marched towards Chandigarh on tractors and other vehicles or on foot.Led by union leaders, including Manjit Dhaner, Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ruldu Singh Mansa and Manjeet Rai, the farmers marched till the Madhya Marg light-point where the Chandigarh Deputy Commissioner came to accept their memorandum.In Panchkula, farmers from several parts of Haryana gathered at Gurdwara Nada Sahib and headed towards Haryana Raj Bhavan, forcing their way through a layer of barricades. Led by BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni, the protesters were stopped at the Chandigarh-Panchkula border where the state police had deployed water cannons and trucks.Farm protests began on November 26 last year in the wake of the parliament passing The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.

It had quizzed ex-CM Parkash Singh Badal for about two hours earlier this week. Sukhbir was Deputy CM and held the Home portfolio when incidents of desecration and the subsequent police firing on protesters took place in Kotkapura on October 14, 2015.Sources said Sukhbir was asked as to who had given the go-ahead to the district administration and the police to open fire on the protesters, to which he reportedly replied that “officials on the ground” had decided to do so in self-defence. The SIT also wanted to know the role of the Home Minister in police postings/transfers shortly before the sacrilege incident in Bargari on October 12, 2015, and the Kotkapura/Behbal Kalan police firing two days later.Sukhbir later alleged the SIT was trying to implicate the Badal family to “please the Congress high command and those opposing CM Capt Amarinder Singh within the party.” In a show of solidarity, SAD leaders Bikram Singh Majithia, Balwinder Singh Bhundar, NK Sharma and Daljit Singh Cheema gathered outside the Punjab Police Officers’ Institute where Sukhbir was being questioned.The SIT had run into controversy over the presence of legal expert Vijay Singla during the questioning of Parkash Singh Badal.

Now the government is hell-bent on giving the reins of the agriculture sector to big corporate houses. We will not let that happen.”“We are firm in our resolve and will continue our fight until the laws are repealed,” said Mann.

Emphasising the need for having a Sainik School each in the Malwa, Doaba and Majha regions, the three natural geographical divisions of the state, he said it was felt a third Sainik School in Bathinda would suitably cater to this requirement.The Chief Minister noted Sainik Schools were prestigious institutions that had consistently maintained the highest standards in imparting education to children across the country.For many years, he said, the schools had groomed youth into responsible citizens and many key positions in the armed forces were today manned by alumni of these schools.Sainik School, Kapurthala, is currently the only such institute in Punjab, established way back in 1961.“The youth of Punjab have always displayed an exemplary zeal to join the armed forces and serve the nation. There is, thus, an urgent need to establish additional Sainik schools in the state,” stressed the Chief Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-seeks-sainik-school-for-bathinda-writes-to-rajnath-274574

27-06-2021||Bathinda||Capt Amarinder Singh failed on promised power: AAP||Notwithstanding tall claims of surplus electricity, the state government has failed miserably in providing uninterrupted eight-hour supply to farmers amid the ongoing paddy sowing season, claimed AAP kisan wing state president Kultar Singh Sandhwan here today.Lashing out at the government, Sandhwan accused Capt Amarinder Singh of harassing farmers over electricity “at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.Sandhwan said: “Under a conspiracy, the farmers were being provided only four hours of power, instead of promised eight hours, for agriculture. Even canal water supply is being cut off. Attempts to appease Modi by embarrassing farmers sitting at the Delhi borders, fighting against the agricultural laws, have been exposed.”“The CM is now releasing Rs 500 crore for management of power out of fear of farmers’ wrath. If the intention was clear, the government should have made arrangements for power procurement and eight-hour uninterrupted supply in May,” he added. He condemned the police crackdown on farmers who were going to submit a memorandum against the farm laws to the Governor today. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-singh-failed-on-promised-power-aap-274577

27-06-2021||Chandigarh||State rule denies annuity to gallantry awardee’s widow||A Punjab Government rule is denying resumption of monthly annuity paid to a widow of a Kirti Chakra recipient who had subsequently remarried. The annuity, under rules, can continue to be paid to the widow only if she remains single or remarries the brother of her deceased husband.In 1999, an officer from 11th Sikh Regiment, Maj Raman Dada, had been awarded the Kirti Chakra posthumously after he died in an encounter in Assam in which 10 terrorists, including three by the major, were killed by his unit.His widow had initially received the annuity paid by the Punjab Government, which was stopped after she remarried in 2005. In 2011, she got divorced. Now residing in Dehradun, she had taken up the case with the government for resumption of annuity due to her financial circumstances, but present rules resulted in her appeal being turned down.According to some retired officers, a widow’s rights, including pensionary benefits, do not get curtailed on remarriage and the same have been upheld by the courts. They have pointed out that if other benefits continue, why should one allowance be stopped?While pensionary benefits to armed forces personnel and their dependants are paid by the Centre, certain allowances and benefits to gallantry awardees or some other categories of soldiers are paid by the state government.The matter has been taken up at the highest level with the government, with the chief minister also being apprised of the issue. Resumption of annuity would require a policy change. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/state-rule-denies-annuity-to-gallantry-awardees-widow-274582

27-06-2021||---||Punjab CM Amarinder reiterates demand for national policy on drugs||Chandigarh, June 26Reiterating his demand for a national policy on drugs, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday underlined the need for more synergy between the Special Task Force, the police and the intelligence wing to eliminate drugs from the state.Calling for the support of all stakeholders to fight the menace, which he termed a global problem, the Chief Minister said while the neighbouring states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi had agreed to put in place an effective mechanism for tackling drug smuggling, no significant progress had been made.Asserting his government's zero tolerance to drugs, Capt Amarinder attributed the problem to the strong nexus among smugglers, gangsters and terrorists to promote narco-terrorism in the state, as well as Pakistan.Interacting with the people on the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, the Chief Minister said most of the drugs, especially heroin, are smuggled into Punjab from Afghanistan via Pakistan, bordering states like Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Delhi, and even Nepal.He termed it a Pakistan conspiracy to weaken Punjab's youth and keep them away from the armed forces. He cited the instances of drug drops via drones, and seizure of 700 kg of heroin smuggled into Punjab through Kandla port.In addition, several deadly weapons have been smuggled by Pakistan through Uri sector in J&K, he added.Expressing concern over a recent incident of large drug seizure in Canada, the Chief Minister said it was shameful that the involvement of a few Punjabi youth in the crime had not only defamed Punjab but also brought disrepute to other Punjabis living peacefully across the globe.On the progress made in the fight against drugs, the Chief Minister said Punjab had successfully got two category gangsters deported -- Sukhpreet Budhha from Armenia in 2019 and Sukh Bhikhariwal from the UAE in 2021.Gaurav Patiyal was in the process of being deported from Armenia, while Ramanjit Romi, a handler of gangsters, was being brought back from Hong Kong.Further, efforts were on to bring back gangsters Harry Chattha from Portugal and Gagan Hathur from Australia, he said.On the Buddy Programme, which was launched on October 2, 2018, with the aim of educating children about the ill-effects of drug abuse, Capt Amarinder said it has so far been implemented in 16,000 educational institutions (government and private), with 7.5 lakh Buddy Groups, comprising more than 37 lakh students and 1.30 lakh Senior Buddies, formed.On the occasion, the Chief Minister also digitally launched live destruction of seized drugs and narcotics in Amritsar by a special team led by Sukhchain Singh Gill, Commissioner of Police, Amritsar.The consignment included 659 kg of heroin (worth Rs 1,318 crore in the international market), 3,000 kg of poppy husk, 5.8 crore pills and capsules, 166 kg ganja, 5 kg charas and large quantities of bhang, smack, syrup, injections.He also launched a week-long state-wide awareness drive by the School and Higher Education Departments.Earlier, Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the state government had made considerable progress in tackling drug abuse.He said medicines worth Rs 70 crore were being given every year to the persons undergoing treatment for drug de-addiction.The number of persons undergoing treatment had increased from 2,67,000 to 6,72,000, with the state government having spent Rs 70 crore to provide free medicines to the patients.He urged the Chief Minister to introduce a subject on drug awareness in the school curriculum to educate students to refrain from drugs.DGP Dinkar Gupta said that since Punjab shares around a 550 km border with Pakistan, it has become a major transit route to smuggle heroin, mainly produced in Afghanistan, to other states across the country.Pakistan has established a huge smuggling infrastructure at the borders to smuggle heroin into Punjab, using different methods, including rivers, border fencing, sea route.He said that over 420 big fish (on the basis of recovery of over 2 kg heroin) were arrested in the last four years.The state police had also managed to nab the most-wanted narco smuggler Ranjit Cheeta from Sirsa, the DGP said, adding that the Special Task Force in January 2020 had busted a narcotic unit in the Sultanwind area of Amritsar with the arrest of an Afghan national, and also confiscated over 190 kg heroin.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-amarinder-reiterates-demand-for-national-policy-on-drugs-274398

A separate probe is underway in that case.Meanwhile, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday slammed Sukhbir Singh Badal and said the new SIT “inches closer to justice for Punjab's soul.”  Sidhu tweeted, “6 Yrs since sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji.. No Justice in 2 yrs of your rule.. No Justice in the following 4.5 yrs.. Today, New SIT inches closer to Justice for Punjab's Soul & you cry of political interferance.. Political interference was that which delayed Justice by 6 yrs."            Sidhu tagged the tweet of Sukhbir Singh Badal in which the former deputy chief minister accused Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of implicating the SAD leadership in false cases at the alleged instance of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi."While farmers suffer, CM is busy keeping Gandhi family happy & has accepted @RahulGandhi's directive to implicate SAD leadership in false cases. New SIT formed after old one was indicted over political interference, is being run by state vigilance dept,so nothing has changed,” Sukhbir had said in a tweet on Friday.   6 Yrs since sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji..
