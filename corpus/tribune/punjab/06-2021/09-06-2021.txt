Shiv Lal Doda, his nephew Amit Doda, property business partner Rajiv Chugh, SAD Abohar circle president Suresh Satija and Jaipal Singh Bhullar of Ferozepur had been named in the FIR. Satija later denied the allegations.Cops had been deployed at Gurjant’s Subhash Nagar residence here. The then SP Dr Ketan Baliram Patil and DSP Rahul Bhardwaj had visited the locality after receiving the complaint and made adequate security arrangements. They had assured the family of fool-proof security cover.Gurjant had accompanied Bhim Tank to Doda’s farmhouse in Ramsara village on December 11, 2015. While Bhim died after his limbs were chopped off, Gurjant survived the assault.Gurjant said in a statement to the city police that, “On December 19, 2019 a man called and threatened me with dire consequences if I deposed against Shiv Lal Doda, Amit Doda and Simranjit in the court.”Bhullar could not be rounded up for interrogation in this case also.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gangster-jaipal-bhullar-had-also-threatened-bhim-tank-murder-cases-key-witness-265951
09-06-2021||Ludhiana||Differences between farmers and govt over farm laws can be resolved by talks: SS Johl||The three farm laws cannot be scrapped directly by the government without introducing a repeal bill in Parliament, an agricultural expert said on Wednesday.Holding the laws in abeyance and talking over them across the table are the only solutions to the problem, Dr S S Johl, a noted agriculture expert and adviser to four previous prime ministers, said.Dr Johl, 94, who is a recipient of Padma Bhushan in 2004 rued that none of the senior statesmen came forward to mediate or make a serious attempt to help the two sides in resolving the differences over the laws between the agitating farmers and the central government.Read also: Centre increases MSP for Kharif crops, paddy support price hiked by Rs 72 per quintalHe said, “It is a sorry state of affairs that the political leaders of the day in Punjab are only small, part-time politicians having their eyes fixed on nothing but the vote banks.”     Neither anybody came out in any sympathy with the farmers nor did anybody try to assuage their hurt feelings or discuss the problems with them with an open mind to educate them and to find some way out, said Johl.He suggested to the farmers that instead of harping on the repeal of the three laws, they should prepare a pointwise list of their demands and specifically come out with provisions they want to modify, delete, change or add to the existing laws.“I am sad that farmers are still passing through bad times, facing hardships, committing suicides and being exploited by different political parties for their vested agenda,” Dr Johl said.“A lot still needs to be done to mitigate the farmers’ sufferings and give them their due price for their products,” he added.He also held the central government responsible for allegedly failing to explain its stand properly and showing undue haste in enacting the three laws.They should have held detailed discussions with all stakeholders before bringing in these laws, he said.Scores of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year demanding the repeal of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and the enactment of a new law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The government, however, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over these laws.The government last held talks with farmer leaders on January 22. The talks between the two sides came to a halt after the January 26 tractor rally by farmers in Delhi turned violent.

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD to hold ‘dharna’ at official residence of CM on June 15||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) announced on Wednesday that it would hold a ‘dharna’ at the official residence of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh here on June 15 to demand the immediate dismissal of Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu besides institution of a CBI probe into the vaccine and Fateh kit scams.The SAD said it would also demand that land being acquired in the state for national highways be done on the market rate along with award of displacement compensation to farmers. It said it would join farmers to protest against the ridiculously low compensation being offered to them for acquisition of their land for expressway projects in case the government did not amend this policy and offer compensation to farmers as per the policy of the erstwhile SAD-BJP government.Party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said SAD President Sukhbir Singh Badal would lead the symbolic ‘dharna’ at the residence of the chief minister on June 15 and that it would be attended by the party’s senior leadership including core committee and PAC members, legislators, former legislators, constituency incharge, district presidents and youth office bearers.The party spokesperson said the vaccine scam as well as Fateh kit scam had shaken the conscience of Punjabis who were shocked that an elected government and its members were profiting from their misery during a time of pandemic.“Though the Congress government has admitted its fault in the vaccine scam whereby it sold vaccines to private hospitals at huge margins and in turn allowed the latter to charge steep premiums, no action has been taken against anyone. Instead of dismissing the Health minister, Capt Amarinder Singh is shielding him and even trying to silence the opposition by registering cases against senior Akali leaders for holding a peaceful and democratic protest to demand justice in the case”. He said the voice of the SAD could not be suppressed by such high handed tactics and that it would intensify its agitation further in case those guilty for the scam were not booked and punished.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-to-hold-dharna-at-official-residence-of-cm-on-june-15-265906

09-06-2021||---||LPU granted patent for fruit-flavoured chocolate||Tribune News ServicePhagwara, June 8The office of the patents, Government of India, has granted a patent to the researchers and scientists at Lovely Professional University for “a novel double fermentation process for fruit-flavoured chocolate with antioxidant properties”.The patent relates to innovative method of processing cocoa beans using double fermentation to modify the cocoa bean’s flavour profile and antioxidant property. LPU scientists’ innovative methodology may enthrall chocolate lovers including children, adults and the elderly. Seeking to file the patent in other countries as well, the LPU has already filed Patent Cooperation Treaty for the same.In the existing method, the chocolate manufacturers use synthetic flavours to bring fruit flavour to a chocolate. This is not considered good for health, as it causes serious health hazards. To prevent such artificial flavours, LPU’s patented method is to add natural flavours. The antioxidants in cocoa have been linked to impressive health benefits, including less inflammation and reduced risk factors for heart disease. The new product will also have a potential to lower the risk of developing overweight and obesity.Congratulating LPU researchers to keep on imbibing positivism, creativity and energy that they are possessing even in the present hard times, LPU Chancellor Ashok Mittal invoked all researchers to work on novel and socially useful scientific ideas.LPU researcher from the school of bioengineering and biosciences, Dr Jastin Samuel shares: “During the process, cocoa beans are first fermented and the natural aroma and flavour of cocoa are obtained. It is further fermented using fruit pulp or the rind (peel) to add fruit flavour to the chocolate. It helps to add around 40 per cent natural antioxidants to the cocoa beans. This method is cost-effective because industry does not need additional infrastructure to implement this process. Moreover, it helps in providing improved flavour and quality of the chocolates, which would certainly be easily acceptable and likeable to all customers.” Dr Evangeline Christina and microbiology student Radhika Lakhanpal are also important part of the research team.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lpu-granted-patent-for-fruit-flavoured-chocolate-265829

Coming up at the Air Force Station in Halwara, which is one of the oldest frontline airbases of the Indian Air Force (IAF), the facility will be made operational by October 31.A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting, chaired by the Chief Secretary, Vini Mahajan, recently.Confirming the development, the Chief Secretary told The Tribune that based on the advice of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to the Punjab Civil Aviation Department, two separate tenders — one for the construction of new terminal building and other for the apron — will be floated.“The PWD has been directed to float the tenders immediately and the same will be awarded after requisite approval from the AAI,” she said.Mahajan disclosed that the entire funds of Rs 43 crore estimated to be spent on the new airport terminal and apron would be spent by the GLADA and later reimbursed by the AAI.“Operations from the new airport will be started at the earliest in consultation with the AAI,” added the Chief Secretary, who reviewed the progress of the project at a virtual meeting of the Public Investment Management (PIM) committee on the infrastructure development projects under implementation in the state.She directed the officials concerned to ensure that the project was completed as per the approved specifications and within the stipulated timeframe.Sharing the progress report of the ongoing work on the project, which has been marked as project of key concern on the directions of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Deputy Commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said over 95 per cent construction of boundary wall at the Halwara airport had been completed and it was expected to be completed on schedule by June 10.Similarly, 90 per cent construction of the approach road to the new airport had been completed and was expected to be completed on schedule by June 15, he revealed.The ADC (Projects), Dr Neeru Katyal Gupta, said separate tenders for new terminal building and apron were being floated forthwith.The tentative cost of the civil terminal conclave to be spread across 135 acres, worked out by the PWD, was brought down from initial Rs 58 crore to Rs 43 crore after consultation with the AAI and approval by the Technical Adviser to the CM.While the construction of 630-metre-long boundary wall had cost Rs 3.01 crore, a sum of Rs 8.3 crore was spent on the construction of 5.1-km-long with 5.5-metre width approach road.Sahnewal airport to closeThe decision to build a new international airport in the Maximum City of Punjab was taken after the state government had raised the demand with the Centre sometime back following which the AAI conducted a pre-feasibility study of the Halwara IAF station and gave nod to set up international civil enclave here to meet the growing demand for civil flight operations.The existing Ludhiana domestic airport at Sahnewal will be closed once the flight operations commence at the new civil enclave in Halwara.Pre-fabricated steel structureThe project entails building an interim arrangement to attend immediate requirements to make international flights available to the residents of Ludhiana, which was the state’s largest industrial and business city with a population of nearly two millions, by the end of this year.The interim terminal building will be pre-fabricated steel structure with modern outlook, spread over 2,000-sq km area with 3,800-sq metre canopy space having a seating capacity of 300 passengers. The PWD (B&R) was the main executing agency, while a private firm was hired for architectural design of the project.The scope of the project includes a new terminal building along with the ancillary facilities like apron taxiway extensions, substation, boundary wall and approach road.“The terminal will be a state-of-the-art building as per norms and requirements of the AAI, while construction of apron will be suitable to park one AB321-200 type aircraft and widening of taxi track and car park will accommodate 75 cars,” the DC revealed.The common concourse area will have provision for snack bar, toilets, AC switch room, drinking water, separate toilets for men and women, first-aid room, supporting office for AAI and airlines. The check-in area will comprise four check-in counters, adequate queuing space and baggage conveyor belt with storing space for 50 baggage trolleys.Besides the flight information display system with adequate number of display devices in departure, arrival and security hold area for passenger facilitation, an adequate number of X-ray machines for scanning baggage with required number of security equipment will be installed as per the AAI norms.Interim terminalBefore the construction of a regular terminal, an interim building will come up to begin the airport operations here, informed the ADC (Projects), while adding that 161.28 acres of land, comprising 135.54 acres for airport and 25.74 acres for future development, had already been acquired.She revealed that an alternate approach road to the airport from the Delhi-Katra Expressway was also under proposal by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/halwara-international-airport-to-be-operational-by-october-31-265726

BJP leaders have been claiming that state has no role as all equipment have come from the Central government, but Congress leaders say without the support of the state government, the Centre cannot instal the plant.“The equipment to instal oxygen plant at Sangrur headquarters has come from the central government and it’s funded by PM CARES. We are passing through the toughest time as Covid has badly hit our country. Though the Punjab Government has failed to provide even basic health facilities, its leaders are not trying to befool residents and making baseless statements about oxygen plant,” said Jatinder Kalra, state coordinator of BJP cells.Sangrur is worst-affected with Covid as its case fatality rate (CFR) of 5.3 percent is highest in the state. As per sources, to date the district has witnessed 799 Covid deaths. Sangrur health block has registered the highest deaths (121), followed by Longowal (116), Moonak (84) and Kauhrian (77). Of the total deaths, 607 deaths have taken place from January to date and 411 occurred in May alone.“The Centre government is also dependent on state residents.

09-06-2021||Manav Mander||Wary of Covid testing, pregnant women in villages avoid hospitals||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, June 8To avoid getting tested for Covid, pregnant women from rural areas are running away from hospitals.Their non-cooperative attitude sometimes forces doctors to call the police to help them in conducting the test.The dipping number of deliveries being done in government hospitals every month is also a testimony to the fact that pregnant women from rural areas are drifting away from institutional deliveries. Sources revealed that a few healthcare workers were conducting deliveries at home.According to the health department data, in Ludhiana district, 1,432 deliveries were done in the government sector in January, which reduced to 1,270 in February, 1,265 in March and further dipped to 1,037 in April.The scene in the private sector is no different. Dr Saroj Aggarwal, president of Ludhiana branch of Indian Medical Association, said rural women were frightened at the mere mention of Covid test and the number of patients from villages had dipped drastically.“Once a woman (from rural belt) in labour pain came to the hospital and we told the family that Covid test will be done before admitting her. But they started arguing and when the staff did not budge, they took the woman back home. They said the woman will deliver the child at home but won’t get the Covid test done. This will also lead to rise in infant mortality rate,” she said.Charitable hospitals in the city, which earlier used to have huge footfall from the rural belt, especially pregnant women, had gone down considerably, Dr Aggarwal said.ASHA workers are a bridge between the rural population and the healthcare system. Kirandeep Kaur, who works in Punjola sub-centre of Fatehgarh Sahib, said these days pregnant women were not getting admitted to government hospitals.“Once I took a pregnant woman from Kotla Jattan village to a hospital where she tested positive for Covid. She was referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, where she was quarantined. After this incident, villagers panicked and none of the women is now coming forward for institutional deliveries at government facilities,” she said.Jeet Kaur, another ASHA worker from Pakhowal block, said if earlier she used to help 45 rural women in their pre-natal stage, the number had now dipped to just 30. “Many migrant women are going back to their native places and coming back after delivery,” she said.A doctor in charge of the Urban Primary Health Centre in Ludhiana said rural women had a misconception that the report of everyone being tested for Covid would be positive. “The number of women coming for their monthly check-ups has also gone down,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wary-of-covid-testing-pregnant-women-in-villages-avoid-hospitals-265505

While a court fee of Rs 10 crore was deposited in June 2013, the case is still on 36 years after the incident.In 2019, the court had proposed to both parties to settle it amicably, but the SGPC has not yet decided on accepting the proposal.SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the compensation was symbolic and that no amount of money could bring succour to the loss borne by the community.“The court has proposed to initiate settlement amicably outside its purview, but we are taking legal opinion and consulting with Sikh scholars before taking any step,” she said.The sole aim of filing the suit and seeking compensation was to make the Centre admit to the fact that the attack on the shrine was unjustified. SGPC chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami said: “Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, we could not follow it up. I am going through the files. After scrutinising the court directions, we will be in a position to decide whether to go for amicable settlement or not,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/operation-blue-star-sgpc-seeks-legal-advice-in-damages-case-265506

Even activists are holding farmer union flags in the fields while planting paddy.The BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) has also announced that their village unit will keep a vigil on the paddy transplanted and would gehrao police or Agriculture Department officials if they try to stop the work. They also assured nobody will be allowed to uproot the planted paddy.BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) district president Ram Singh Bhainibagha said: “Canals and water channels are running dry. The government has just assured power for motors from June 10. In view of the shortage of labour, farmers have started transplanting paddy”. Farmers have started paddy transplantation in Bhainibagha village in Mansa and various other villagers which have a good influence of farm unions.The state government had notified that no farmer in the state would be allowed to transplant paddy before June 10. Earlier, transplantation of paddy used to begin on June 1, but from the last few years, the government has been delaying the practice to check the declining water table in the state, reduce the burden of subsidy and improve the quality of basmati.Farmers said the reason behind the early transplantation was shortage of labour as the number of migrant labourers from Bihar, UP and other states, who used to come to Punjab during the paddy season, declined drastically last season. Officials of the Agriculture Department said it had come to their notice that early transplantation of paddy was going on in some villages and they would soon take action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fearing-labour-pangs-farmers-plant-paddy-in-advance-in-mansa-and-bathinda-districts-265509

The arrival of the crop in the local grain market began a week ago.Major Singh, a farmer from Verowal village at the market, said the crop was procured at Rs 1,550 per quintal on Monday, and it further sold at Rs 1,525 on Tuesday. Major Singh, who is a regular maize producer, said the crop sold at Rs 750 to Rs 1,250 last year.Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu, president, Kisan Sangharash Committee, Punjab, said the central and state governments had been asking the farmers to adopt crop diversification and come out of traditional wheat-paddy cycle, but was denying them the MSP on most of the crops, including pulses and maize.Kuljit Singh Chief Agriculture Officer said there was no surety of MSP on maize, because of which farmers were not ready to adopt crop diversification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-msp-on-maize-in-tarn-taran-265510

The Majha brigade, comprising Cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Sukhjinder Randhawa along with some MLAs, had reportedly joined hands with the dissidents against the CM.So far, they had been the epicentre of power dynamics in the state Congress. From playing an important role in the Gurdaspur parliamentary byelections in 2018, which saw Sunil Jakhar winning, to siding with the CM, the Majha leaders had been in the forefront. The CM had been giving prominence to the Majha brigade to outwit his opponents like Partap Bajwa.But the power dynamics changed after the Majha leaders joined the league of leaders who have started questioning the Chief Minister on delayed justice in sacrilege and police firing cases and other unfulfilled poll promises such as ending the drug mafia, transport mafia besides other issues.Party legislators said the CM should remove the retired bureaucrats appointed in different government bodies, and instead appoint traditional Congress leaders.“Through the appointment of Lalli Majithia, the Chief Minister wants to give a message that he is supporting leaders who fought against Akali leader Bikram Majithia, who represents the Majitha Assembly segment. It is also being seen as a move to destroy the narrative of friendly match with the Akalis,” said a senior party leader.Change in power dynamics behind moveCapt meets MPs ahead of Kharge report||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/to-counter-majha-brigade-cm-picks-majitha-face-as-pungrain-chief-265511

The police somehow got an audio clip in this regard. Shamsher Singh Shammi, who recently contested the municipal council election as an Independent, said, “I am a Dalit. We are Congressmen from three generations. I had unsuccessfully contested the MC election as a Congress nominee during the previous SAD-BJP regime. This time, local MLA Ajaib Singh Bhatti had promised me the ticket to contest the election as a Congress nominee. However, he did not allot me the ticket so I had to contest as an Independent, which I lost. I made an audio clip appealing to Bhatti to contest the election from Malout and not to run to some other constituency,” he said, adding, “Just because of this, the police picked me up. I had to even sign an apology letter.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rebel-congress-leader-detained-by-malout-police-265513

The force, may, after ascertaining facts, take such remedial measures as may be found necessary, including coercive measures against the persons found responsible for violating the law, following due process, read the NGT orders. The orders came after some tree lovers and environmentalists approached the tribunal, alleging illegal axing of trees at the mill.  As per the petition, the Forest Department had not taken permission from the Union Environment Ministry before ordering felling of trees as the area of the closed sugar mill was a deemed forest area in terms of various judgments of the SC. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/act-against-illegal-felling-at-faridkot-cooperative-sugar-mills-ngt-265514

However, the control and management of such land would continue to vest in the gram panchayat or the state government till it was used, or was capable of being used, for village common purposes.The ruling by Justice Kshetarpal came on a petition filed against the state of Punjab and other respondents by Labh Singh and other petitioners. Going into the technical aspects of the matter, Justice Kshetarpal asserted Rule 16 (ii) of the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Rules provided that the proprietary rights of land reserved for village common purposes, by imposing pro-rata cut on landholding of the owners at the time of consolidation, would continue to vest in the proprietary body of the estate or estates concerned.Justice Kshetarpal added a five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court held in 1965 that the land so carved out by imposing a pro-rata cut for common use of the villagers would not result in divesting the ownership of the proprietors or proprietary body. Subsequently, another five-Judge Bench again held that the proprietors would continue to be the owner and there was no divesting of the title. Another Bench also held that the ownership of Jumla Mushtarka Malkan land did not vest in the gram panchayat.But the state counsel insisted that the proprietary body stood divested of the title of the ‘Jumla Mushtarka Malkan’ land in view of Section 42A. Justice Kshetarpal asserted the Act did not provide for acquisition, divesting, confiscation, seizure, impounding, appropriation or annexation of the proprietary rights. “If the argument of state’s counsel is accepted, the provision most likely would be rendered unconstitutional,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/common-land-proprietorship-remains-with-owner-rules-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-265515

The state share was just 10 per cent. He accused Sampla of indulging in Dalit vote politics. “Despite letters by CM Capt Amarinder Singh to the PM and the minister concerned, nothing happened. Now, Centre is blaming us,” Chabbewal said.Recently, the Joint Association of Colleges had announced to withhold the roll numbers of SC students as the state government had failed to reimburse Rs 1,549 crore to the colleges.

The case is sub judice. The students are apprehensive they may have to pay the entire fee, amounting Rs 2 lakh, in 13 days.The university has announced open-book end-term online exams from July 1. The students are required to clear their dues on or before June 20. The students, who have been demanding concession on the ground that the university had not incurred expenditure as the campus remained shut, called the decision arbitrary.“They are directing students to submit the fee in 13 days. They are forcing us to pay up by making it a precondition for the exams. We will move court tomorrow,” said a student associated with the matter.The students added the university had already provided relief to LLM students.Registrar Dr Naresh Vats said: “We have written to the Secretary, Higher Education, seeking approval to hold the exams.” Regarding the submission of fee, he said: “We have held a number of meetings with students and offered to give them a concession. Some agreements have been reached. Meanwhile, fee submission will be subject to the court ruling and as such, the university will reimburse the amount later, if needed.”He added the university had already asked students to write to the administration if they faced difficulty in submitting the fee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rajiv-gandhi-national-university-of-law-demands-fee-students-to-move-court-265520

A third tender was floated to procure more kits at a price above Rs 1,338 per unit,” he alleged.The last tender cost nearly 60 per cent more than the first one, Bhatia said, accusing the Congress of indulging in “corruption and scams” even during the times of a pandemic.“It is a matter of shame that the Congress is doing a scam during the pandemic. This is Punjab’s ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi should break the silence because the people of Punjab want answers. They want to know why the state government is profiteering from the sale of Covid vaccines and purchase of these kits and why the CM is silent on the issue,” Bhatia said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/opposition-ups-ante-against-punjab-govt-over-kit-scam-265536
