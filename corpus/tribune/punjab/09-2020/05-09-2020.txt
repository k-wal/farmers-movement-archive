It was only after I submitted my resignation on ethical grounds, the voices were being raised against ‘pardhan saheb’ (SGPC president) to follow suit. It was then that he had tried to justify that I was held accountable by the probe panel. If I was among the guilty officials, then why was my resignation accepted? I should have been chargesheeted. Neither did I receive any chargesheet nor any official confirmation about acceptance of my resignation,” he said.He added that the moot question of the ‘whereabouts’ of ‘saroops’ was still unanswered.“It was yet to be known who else and on whose behest the saroops were sent and where were these sent,” he said.Roop Singh said though he had resigned from the post but he was ready to cooperate in any kind of inquiry. He also questioned that if he was held guilty of not maintaining records, what was the point of spending crores on accountants and audit firms for keeping records.“An office note that speaks about 80 saroops getting damaged in May 2016 fire incident was deliberately leaked because it had got my signatures. The truth was that this office note was written by assistant supervisor Kanwaljit Singh only and I had just forwarded it to my subordinate to take next necessary action. How could I be responsible for it,” he said.Reacting over it, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said the probe report clearly indicated Roop Singh’s name among the responsible persons. However, he said the SGPC executive in its meeting today withdrew the move to initiate criminal proceedings and that the guilty officials would be punished by the SGPC only as per norms.“I had mentioned his name as the probe panel had held him guilty and lenient in getting the records of saroops maintained. Since no criminal proceedings would be taken now, SGPC, being the apex body, would decide the punishment on its own. Since he has already quit, he might enjoy the immunity of any official action from our side,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/missing-saroop-row-sgpc-ex-chief-secretary-says-his-name-being-dragged-unnecessarily-136859

05-09-2020||GS Paul||SGPC ex-chief secretary Harcharan Singh dies of heart attack||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, September 5Former SGPC chief secretary Harcharan Singh passed away due to cardiac arrest on Saturday morning. He was 75.Survived by his wife Dalwinder Kaur and daughter Nimrata Kaur, Harcharan Singh suffered a mild heart attack but could not survive it, his nephew said.The SGPC executive had on August 24 announced to initiate criminal proceedings against him as he along with other officials was held accountable for misappropriation of 328 saroops of Guru Granth Sahib.He was also summoned at Akal Takht along with the 2016 SGPC’s executive body on September 18 for not performing mourning prayers for the loss of saroops in an accidental fire in May 2016 at Guru Granth Sahib Bhawan in Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib.A former banker, Harcharan Singh was handpicked in August 27, 2015, by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal for the post on contractual basis for three years.His hefty salary of Rs 3 lakh per month and perks had also courted controversy, which he volunteered to reduce to Rs 1 lakh. Short of completing a two-year term, he had resigned in July 29, 2017, while terming it as compulsion due to "personal reasons".The post was created first in 2003 for veteran Akali leader Manjit Singh Calcutta, but his appointment was struck down by the Sikh Gurdwara Judicial Commission soon after.This post was specially revived for the second time in SGPC’s history to look after the financial affairs. Ever since he assumed the office, he remained an eyesore for many, both inside and outside the SGPC, apparently due to his inability to handle the "religio-political" affairs in a diplomatic manner.Despite not being part of any decision-making process but a "conveying authority", he was held responsible for controversial decisions, including the pardon granted to the Dera Sacha Sauda chief in 2015.Harcharan Singh had also invited the ire of the SGPC after he authored a book, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee di Vartman Stithi, highlighting the alleged shortcomings he experienced during his term with the SGPC. The book was released in Chandigarh in February in the presence of rebel Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-ex-chief-secretary-harcharan-singh-dies-of-heart-attack-136761

They were later booked by the police.Former Senior Deputy Mayor Kamaljeet Bhatia even had a minor scuffle with security guards deployed at the MP’s residence when they resisted his entry. Bhatia reportedly went inside to check if the MP or his son or Congress leader Vikramjit Chaudhary was inside.

Though SAD spokesperson Pawan Tinu was also participated in the demonstration, he stayed outside the house.The protesters raised slogans of “Sadhu Singh chor hai” and asked the Jalandhar MP to explain his silence over the issue.

05-09-2020||---||PUBG ban does not go down well with gaming community||Amritsar, September 4PUBG, a popular multiplayer online game, has been banned in the country along with 117 other Chinese apps. The second wave of web-based applications ban by the Ministry of Information and Technology, PUBG that has millions of active users in India has become one of the biggest causalities of the escalating tensions between India and China.While the gaming community is unhappy about the decision that might have direct implications on professional gamers’ careers, there is a segment of players that has already found alternatives for their gaming appetites. “It is disappointing that the game has been banned, but one can still access it through a PC. I feel that the game was like a social media platform where we could connect with others and engage in communication. Then there was the thrill of engaging in battles, different levels of the game. Nonetheless, we do have a few alternative games that would provide for a replacement,” said Yajur Kapoor (18) who is a pro-gamer.Another gamer, Supreet Wadhawa, says, “I do not think that this game will be banned for long as it generates good revenue from India. Surely, the promoters of the game would look for options to sustain their presence. PUBG doesn’t have any Chinese connection as its parent company is USA based.” Meanwhile, a list of variants such as Call of Duty and Free Fire has suddenly found new takers.Apart from parents, who definitely must have found some relief with the ban, not many are pleased with the move. “Banning apps is just a smokescreen so people do not ask the real questions. If the government actually wants to take a firm stance against China, the import duties on products should be increased exponentially so that people automatically switch to other products and leave a dent in the Chinese export revenue. For everyone celebrating the ban on PUBG, it is not the game to blame, it is the simple fact that parents shy away from responsibilities and have found an easy out by handing their kids a smartphone. They will instantly replace this habit with a more toxic one without you knowing it. The same goes for games like Candy Crush or apps such as Instagram, that eat away your time without raising any alarms. The solution is moderation and helping kids realise the potential of technology rather than just handing over extremely powerful devices that allow them to access any piece of information out there,” says Chandan Nagi, a branding and marketing professional and avid gamer.Even experts say that post ban, parents need to be more watchful of their kids’ activities. “Gaming, just like gambling, is a behavioural addiction. It encourages impulsive and compulsive behaviour and now that most of the kids, who were addicted to PUBG, will not be able to access it, will succumb to negative emotions. The sudden stop in their need-based habit can have repercussions and parents need to observe them with care and sensitivity,” says Dr JPS Bhatia, neuro-psychiatrist, who runs Punjab’s first Internet de-addiction centre in city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pubg-ban-does-not-go-down-well-with-gaming-community-136660

This showed the extent to which they were ready to stoop to further their political agenda in the state, Amarinder added.AAP unrelenting on dharamsotHe said Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement that AAP workers would go around in villages of the state with oximeters “further exposed their desperation to woo the people of our state, where they have no political standing left”. Unlike the Kejriwal government, which had to beg for help from the Centre when the cases peaked in the national capital, Punjab was fully prepared to handle the crisis, he said, adding that while 10,000 pulse oximeters had already been procured and distributed, a tender had also been floated for another 50,000 to further support the frontline health workers and patients in home isolation, among others.There was no dearth of equipment in Punjab. It was Delhi which seemed to be perpetually in need of help from others, said the CM.

We cannot grant you bail,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told senior advocate Vikas Singh, who represented Kumar.The Bench, which also included Justice AS Bopanna and Justice V Ramasubramanium, also declined his plea for hospitalisation, saying his medical reports suggested he didn’t need to be sent to a hospital.As Singh contended that it was a faulty judgment and testimonies of witnesses was completely reversed, the top court said his appeal against the Delhi High Court’s judgment convicting him in the case would be heard when court reopens for physical hearing.On behalf of riot victims, senior counsel HS Phoolka opposed Kumar’s bail plea, saying he was being looked after properly in the jail.Earlier, the court had refused to give him interim bail on May 13 this year after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that “It’s a case genocide and he was leading a mob.”Kumar (73), who had sought interim bail on the ground of his poor health conditions, is in jail since December 31, 2018, when he surrendered after being convicted and awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in the case.He has challenged the Delhi High Court’s verdict of December 17, 2018 that awarded him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life”. The case relates the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/84-riots-supreme-court-rejects-sajjan-kumarss-bail-plea-136395

The superintendents concerned were also asked to coordinate with the NIA to facilitate the examination in accordance with guidelines issued by the State and the Central Government.“The questions whether such a direction could be treated as transfer of the trial and whether a second FIR could be registered on the identical issues, require deliberations.... Further proceedings before the Court of Special Judge, NIA, Mohali, shall remain stayed till the next date of hearing,” Justice Chauhan added.Fixing the case for November 17, Justice Chauhan also directed the counsel for the Union of India and other respondents to file their replies in response to the contentions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/uapa-case-proceedings-before-nia-spl-judge-under-high-court-lens-136397

In a new revelation, it has been found that many government school students have been attempting to jump to a higher class, breaking the class continuity and attending online classes with their seniors. Such cases have especially come at government schools which have seen higher fresh enrollment recently.The authorities of several government schools in Jalandhar said they had found a few cases of this nature. The school principals said as many parents were approaching them for admission, they were giving provisional admission to children till the time they furnished their previous records.Later, during regular admission, as they sought details of previous schools and verified the same through the Aadhaar-linked accounts, they found instances where parents attempted to promote their children to a class one year higher than the standard they should have ideally gone to.Maninder Thukral, Principal of Government Junior Model School, Jalandhar, said, “I have come across three such instances where parents attempted to promote their child to a class a level higher than he should have ideally gone to. A parent, whose ward should have ideally gone to Class IX, got him enrolled in Class X and all this while, he had been taking classes with Class X students. When we were to send his registration for the board examination, we sought his result card for Class IX.He admitted that he never went to Class IX and was directly jumping to Class X from Class VIII.” She pointed out that there were similar two cases in lower classes.Digital programme for parentsTo provide e-content to Anganwadi children, Punjab Social Security, Women and Child Development Minister Aruna Chaudhary will launch ‘Digital Parent Margdarshak Programme’ on September 5 on Teachers’ Day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/online-admission-norms-being-flouted-complain-schools-136403

Posters already affixed may be removed, he directed.The move is aimed at minimising the stigma resulting from the affixing of such posters on the front doors of such patients’ homes, thus also negating the fear of testing, said the Chief Minister, once again appealing to the people to come out for early testing, diagnosis and treatment of Covid. The psychological trauma, which the patients were seen suffering from as a result ofthese posters — meant to protect neighbours and contacts — was defeating the purpose of the exercise.Capt Amarinder urged people to continue taking all necessary precautions and follow all guidelines for home isolation/ quarantine, notwithstanding the removal of the posters. Violation of these guidelines was a punishable offence under the Disaster Management Act, he said.Don’t let guard down, cautions captChief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh urged people to continue taking all necessary precautions and follow all applicable guidelines for home isolation/quarantine, notwithstanding the removal of the posters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-posters-to-be-affixed-outside-homes-of-patients-in-punjab-136407
