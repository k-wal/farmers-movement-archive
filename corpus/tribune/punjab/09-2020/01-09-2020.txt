The delegation also handed over the report of the state additional chief secretary which has accused “SC welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot of presiding over an Rs 63 crore scam besides other irregularities”.The SAD delegation which was led by former minister and party SC wing president Gulzar Singh Ranike and included Sohan Singh Thandal, Pawan Kumar Tinu, Dr Sukhwinder Kumar and Baldev Khaira clearly told the minister that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh could not be expected to ensure a free and fair inquiry into the scam. They claimed that the chief minister had become party to protecting and shielding the tainted minister.Pawan Tinu alleged the Punjab government had been systemically working to deny Dalit students their rights and that there was no hope of transparent disbursement of the SC scholarship under the present dispensation. “Accordingly we requested the minister to create a mechanism to ensure SC scholarship funds amounting to Rs 309 crore which were lying with the government since ten months could be disbursed to genuine beneficiaries at the earliest.”Stating that the issue had been raised by Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal with the social justice ministry earlier and led to today’s action, the delegation members said the scam was detected by the additional chief secretary. They said the minister had been accused of misappropriation of Rs 39 crore for which no official record had been found besides disbursing Rs 24 crore to private educational institutions against whom the government had ordered recoveries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/officer-equivalent-to-punjab-cs-to-probe-scholarship-scam-union-minister-to-sad-134742

The workers were led by the leader of the Opposition, Harpal Singh Cheema, and party MLA Prof Baljinder Kaur.The protesters raised slogans against the state government and burnt an effigy of the Chief Minister and the Cabinet Minister. They submitted a memorandum to the Governor through the DC.Cheema said: “Rather than dismissing the minister, the CM has initiated a process to award a clean chit to the minister. Rather than trusting a senior IAS officer who conducted the inquiry, he has handed the inquiry to another officer (Chief Secretary). The report submitted by the Additional Chief Secretary makes it clear that the Cabinet Minister has played with the lives and futures of Dalit students, darkening their future prospects. Given the seriousness of the charge of a scam worth Rs 63.91, the minister should have been immediately dismissed and his associates also arrested.” Cheema demanded an inquiry into the scam by a sitting judge of the High Court or the CBI or any other Central agency.The protesters also demanded that the ambit of the inquiry be increased to 2012-13 year, alleging discrepancies worth Rs 1,200 crore during the previous Akali-BJP regime as well. “If the government did not take action against the minister, we will hold statewide protests, a beginning of which has been made from the Doaba region,” Cheema said.Order inquiry by CBI or HC judge, SAD urges govtLeaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal on Monday staged a protest against the state government, demanding a probe by the CBI or a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana Court into the role of Cabinet Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot in the alleged Rs 55.97 crore post-matric scholarship scheme scam.SAD MLAs Pawan Tinu and Baldev Khaira criticised the government for ignoring the report against the minister by an IAS officer holding the post of Additional Chief Secretary. “The report clearly indicates how the government records were tampered with and new bank accounts created at the minister’s behest. The report provides enough material to dismiss the minister, but the CM is not ready to take action and has called for another inquiry, giving an indication that he wants to save a minister facing allegations of corruption,” said Tinu.The leaders said for the past three years, SC and ST category students in the state had been facing hardships as the minister extended the scholarship benefit to a few colleges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-demands-minister-dharamsots-dismissal-134585

Two Joint Secretary-level officers in the department have been deputed to conduct the probe.Taking strong exception to the Union Minister’s decision, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh said the Centre went ahead with the probe without even consulting the state government or waiting for the report of the Chief Secretary’s investigation into the matter.CM retorts to Bajwa’s scams’ comparison“The move is yet another attack on the federal structure of the Indian constitutional polity,” the CM said, adding that the move was clearly aimed at eroding the state government’s authority, as part of the BJP-led Central government’s agenda to undermine the governments in all non-BJP ruled states.Meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry and Hoshiarpur MP Som Parkash, who had taken up the matter with Gehlot, said a strict action would be taken against those involved in the scam.The probe marked by the Union Minister follows the Additional Chief Secretary, Social Welfare, Punjab, submitting a report to the Punjab Chief Secretary on serious irregularities in the disbursal of the scholarship funds in 2019. The report questions the role of Social Welfare Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot in the disbursal of the scholarship funds.After the report generated the political heat in the recently held daylong session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, with the Opposition asking for the minister’s resignation, the Chief Minister directed Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to thoroughly probe the matter.Questioning the CM’s move, Congress Rajya Sabha MP and former PPCC Chief Shamsher Singh Dullo said with Dharamost holding on to the charge of the department, the inquiry was not possible.

It also ruled that regular bail plea before children’s court was not maintainable.The question for adjudication before Justice Jaishree Thakur’s Bench was whether a child in conflict with law, being tried as an adult for the purpose of trial under the Juvenile Justice Act, could maintain an application for regular bail under Section 12 of the Act or Section 439 of CrPC before the children’s court and the High Court.Justice Thakur asserted the only Section pertaining to a juvenile’s bail was 12 of the Act. It clearly spelled out that bail would be allowed to a child, who allegedly committed a bailable or non-bailable offence, notwithstanding anything contained in CrPC or any other law.But the directive came with a rider. Bail was not to be allowed where reasonable grounds appeared for believing that the juvenile’s release was likely to bring him in association with known criminal, expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger or defeat the ends of justice.The Board was to record reasons for declining bail. “The Act does not differentiate between bail being allowed to a juvenile alleged to be involved in a petty offence, serious offence or a heinous one, or between a juvenile being tried as an adult before the children’s court,” Justice Thakur said.On argument that the Board would become “functus officio” or without further official authority once the matter was transferred to the children’s court, Justice Thakur asserted it was unsustainable in the absence of any other provision under the Act for deciding bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-juvenile-board-to-handle-childs-bail-plea-134328

He said the states had almost no role in the finalising the tax rates under the GST and future borrowings and repayments would also change, based on the decisions taken by the GST Council, where the Centre plays a decisive role.In his letter, Manpreet also sought clarification on the compensation calculation in the period after January 2021.

Following this, the police booked him on August 24.Bachittar Singh alleged the police were harassing him for moving the court against the mining mafia. He said he had raised the issue of illegal mining and ‘goonda tax’ in the area many times. Instead of taking action against the offenders, the authorities targeted him.The Mining Officer said Bachittar Singh had lodged a complaint against a few residents of Aaspur village regarding mining. After conducting a probe, she found his allegations were true and lodged a complaint with the police against the suspects.While SSP Akhil Chaudhary didn’t respond to calls, SHO Harkirat Singh said registration of the case was a “clerical mistake” and Bachittar Singh was only a complainant. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-make-u-turn-after-booking-whistle-blower-134332
