SIT has not been able to establish the missing links in the murder episode.Police sources added that Saini will also be questioned for the elimination of other persons, the names of whom had cropped up during the statements recorded by the eyewitnesses.The former DGP is facing charges of murder in case of CITCO employee Balwant Singh Multani, son of a former IAS officer Darshan Singh Multani when Saini was serving as SSP of Chandigarh. Saini was booked by Mohali police at Mataur police station under Section 302 of the IPC and before that he managed blanket orders of anticipatory bail before murder charges were added to the FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/multani-case-sumedh-saini-fails-to-join-investigation-cites-health-issues-149001

30-09-2020||New Delhi||Not advisable to give Rs 100 per quintal incentive to farmers for not burning stubble: EPCA||A Supreme Court-mandated pollution control authority has said it “may not be a viable option” to provide an incentive of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy produced to farmers for not burning stubble.If at all necessary, any such incentive should be provided by state governments from their own budget, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority told the apex court in a report submitted on Wednesday.Following the Supreme Court guideline to incentivise farmers to stop stubble burning, the governments of Punjab and Haryana last year announced a bonus of Rs 2,500 an acre for small and marginal farmers.Farmers say the incentive can help them cover the cost of fuel used in operating machinery for in-situ management of stubble.Last year, the Punjab government provided incentives amounting to Rs 28.51 crore to 31,231 farmers. The state has sought funds from the Centre this year, saying it won’t be able to pay on its own.The Haryana government provided incentives amounting to Rs 1.63 crore to 3,930 farmers last year. This year, it plans to disburse bonuses worth Rs 301 crore.          The EPCA report said, “After deliberations, it was found that inclusion of cost of stubble removal in MSP (minimum support price) may not be a viable option.”   “It has been agreed that any such incentive, if at all necessary, should be provided by the state government from their own budget,” it said.EPCA member Sunita Narain said, “Incentive should not be given to stop people from doing something bad.”“We believe the farmers can be incentivised in different ways – by giving free machinery or buying stubble from them. An incentive for not burning stubble is a perverse incentive. This has been our view for the last three years,” she said.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR. Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue. Farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it.Farmers in Haryana burnt 1.23 million tonnes out of the 7 million tonnes of paddy residue produced.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble burning.But these measures are yet to make any significant impact on the ground. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-advisable-to-give-rs-100-per-quintal-incentive-to-farmers-for-not-burning-stubble-epca-148991

Patiala witnessed the highest positivity rate in August – 11.21 per cent. The rate dropped to 7.68 per cent in September.In August, 40,994 samples were collected while 4,594 people tested positive for the virus that meant every eighth person among the sampled population had tested positive in August.Though total corona positive cases in September—and not the percentage—were highest, that was due to higher sample collection – around 26,000 more than the previous month.As per the data shared by the Health Department, Patiala recorded 5,136 positive cases out of the 66,846 samples collected in September, thereby, every 13th person tested positive among the sampled population.Health experts — given the declining trend of percentage of positives — believe that the district has already surpassed the peak of coronavirus in the district. Experts said despite ramped up sampling, the positivity rate did not increase in September, therefore August was the worst-hit by coronavirus until now.Patiala has been witnessing a drastic drop in the number of coronavirus cases over the past few weeks. On September 16, the district had reported around 292 positive cases while the it reported only 71 cases on Tuesday. In fact, the positivity has dropped to just 3- 4 per cent in the last week of September.Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said along with the positivity rate the total positive cases have also started to decline. He said, “The figures explain that August month had the highest positivity rate. The sampling was increased, but the positivity rate did not increase in September. Good contact tracing of positive patients and prompt isolation thereof at home and health centres seems to have borne the fruit.”However, Malhotra cautioned that people should not – at any cost – give up on corona guidelines. The situation might worsen if the guidelines are not strictly taken care of.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/august-witnesses-highest-covid-positivity-rate-patiala-goes-past-corona-peak-148972

The other two protest strategies announced by the farmers unions are gheraoing of businesses run by multinational companies who are intended beneficiaries of government withdrawal from food grain procurement; and asking all gram sabhas to pass resolutions against the new laws, which farmers believe are intended to stop government purchase of crops.The protest on Thursday will be outside the residences of Union Minister Som Prakash in Phagwara, former Punjab BJP president Shwait Malik in Amritsar, and former MLA Sukhpal Nannu in Ferozepur.Other than helping the protesting farmers with rations, performing artistes- singers and theatre artistes, too, have been moving from village-to-village, mobilising people to come out and protest and will also be performing at the venues of protest.Public announcements are also being made from religious places in rural and semi-rural areas, while vehicles with loudspeakers urge people to join the protests in large numbers. While youth clubs in villages have extended support, so have the commission agents, traders bodies, and associations of various government employees.As farmers in the state prepare to launch their biggest offensive against the agriculture laws, amongst the political parties, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal, too, have started their protests. While AAP has started its campaign to energise Gram Sabhas against the new laws, by holding a function at Gharachon village in Sangrur, Akali Dal is planning Kisan March from the three Takhts tomorrow, claiming participation of two lakh farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-find-friendship-in-some-unlikely-quarters-as-protests-continue-over-agriculture-laws-148963

The administration will honour all such farmers in coming days across various grain markets of district.“Bawa Singh had sown paddy in his 6 acres through DSR without burning paddy stubble and we procured his crop within two hours and honored him in the presence of other farmers. We will honour such farmers across the district during paddy procurement,” said DC Ramvir.“I have directed agriculture department authorities to share the details of progressive farmers who are contributing to saving the environment. Apart from ensuring the purchase of their paddy immediately, our officers will also honour them,” said the DC.Majority of farmers were also surprised as they did not expect such honour, but they say that without incentive they could not manage the crop residue and they are compelled to burn paddy stubble.“When we burn stubble, first of all we inhale dangerous smoke and create health problems for us. Though we appreciate the effort of the DC, we request Punjab government to release some financial help so that we could manage stubble without burning. We do not want to burn stubble, but we are compelled for it” said Gurjant Singh, a farmer from Lehra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sangrur-dc-honours-progressive-farmer-procures-his-paddy-in-2-hours-148936

30-09-2020||Gurnaaz Kaur||National Award-winning director Rajeev Kumar’s upcoming movie, Siri, highlights the plight of farm workers in Punjab||Paving the way for a fresh narrative, National Award-winning director Rajeev Kumar is dedicated to creating a new movement in the Punjabi film industry. His debut film Nabar gave him a loyal following and also the strength to create meaningful cinema. His latest release Siri, which took over a year for him to releases since getting funds for such subjects isn’t easy, highlights the agrarian crisis, not just of small farmers, but, more importantly, of farm workers.“People know about the deaths and suicides of small farmers, but the labourers who work with them…No one has ever focused on them.” As he researched on the topic and found data from three universities in Punjab (GNDU, Punjabi University and PAU), he says it was a shock to know that the number of suicides by labourers, due to debt, was more than the number of suicides by the farmers. “The traditional meaning of the word Siri is working partners and the truth is that there are two victims in the ongoing struggle,” he laments.Apart from depicting the crisis, Rajeev has also included the causes—adverse effects of the Green Revolution, corrupt officials in the agriculture sector, supply of poor seeds; exploitation by agriculture experts, poor compensations, corporate nexus, faulty government policies and a lot more. “We want to inspire those on whom this film has been made, so that they can fight for their lives and rights.”Taking up an issueAn alumnus of the Indian Theatre Department, Panjab University, Rajeev’s love for issue-based theatre led him to make similar films. “I’ve done theatre with Gursharan Singh. His theatre included social issues and so did many other theatre groups in Punjab. But such subjects weren’t dealt with in mainstream cinema. Those were stereotypes, either comedy or romanticising a bygone era of Punjab. The current situation was of no one’s interest and that encouraged me to take it upon myself to do something about it,” he asserts.Before donning the director’s hat, he had spent 10 years in the TV industry, officiatingat senior positionsand generating content.In 2010, with much experience, he knew it was time to go back to the reason of moving to Mumbai- depicting the true state of Punjab on the big screen.Today, 10 years later, in his repertoire are films such as Nabar, Aatu Khoji, Saavi and Chumm. If in Nabar he brought forward the struggles of a poor farmer who fights for his son, in Saavi, an 18-year-old girl protagonist who is married to a four-year-old, he brings to light the age-old tradition of Muslim Gujjar families in the region, who still practise barter of women. His short film Aatu Khoji is about the time in Punjab where there were rural investigators, who found thieves and other culprits by following footprints. Chumm is a film that revolves around the plight of the Dalit community. This self-funded film, besides being screened at Cannes, has been shown in France, Canada and other international film festivals. But what is exceptional about it is its screening in over 300 villages where the audience comprised Dalit women. “This was an effort to simplify my cinema,” he says. “Although my films were being appreciated, shortlisted by festivals, but these are the stories of commoners and their struggles. Those are the people who do not have the spending power and rarely go to experience a film in a multiplex; therefore I decided to take the film to them,” he adds.Up nextExcited about his latest film, he says, “Siri is so relevant to this time when farmers are fighting for their rights. The agitation has a deep-rooted connectionto the World Trade Agreement, but not many know about it or talk about it. There’s a lot of politics at play. As the film is reaching the villages of Punjab (there have already been eight screenings in one month), I see a possibility of people getting aware of the real cause.”There may be challenges in creating socially relevant cinema, considering there aren’t producers to back such projects, but Rajeev is satisfied because he is giving to his audience a hope for change and, above all, a true depiction of the state of affairs!||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/national-award-winning-director-rajeev-kumars-upcoming-movie-siri-highlights-the-plight-of-farm-workers-in-punjab-148829

Besides, he has also generously donated Rs 20 lakh from his savings for the maid, who took care of him for the last 10 years.The LIC Class-I Retired Officers’ Association has shared his story with all members.“A month after the demise of Dr PS Pritam, we have now learnt that he has donated his flat covering an area of 2,050 sq feet, which could be worth Rs 1 crore. He has expressed his willingness that it could be used as an old-age home for people with no one to look after them or for some religious activities. Further, Dr Pritam donated an amount of Rs 20 lakh to his maid, who was from a humble family background. We salute Dr Pritam for this extraordinary act of kindness for the cause of humanity. May God bless eternal peace to his noble soul,” said BR Mehta, senior vice-president of the association.Managing director of Jalandhar Heights Township Sukhdev Singh also confirmed: “A month prior to the demise of Dr Pritam, his brother rang me up and shared with me his willingness to donate the flat for a noble cause. He discussed with me the possible social means, for which it could be used. I am waiting for further correspondence from their side.”He said the property rate was not as high and would have to be calculated once all legal processes for liquidation were followed.Surjit Singh Arora, the younger brother of the deceased, confirmed the development.“My brother was indeed a very noble soul. We wish to use his property for a good social cause, which could be for an old-age home, a gurdwara or any other welfare purpose. So far, we have not had the heart to touch his belongings. We still need time to execute his wishes. I even intend to add up something from my side for whatever project we start in his name. The entire plan may take another month or so to take some shape,” he said, adding that Dr Pritam did not have a wife or kids and that all siblings would jointly take the call.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/before-death-retired-lic-officer-donates-jalandhar-flat-worth-rs-1-crore-for-social-cause-148808

It helps in easy management of crop residue and is one of the best alternatives to stubble-burning.”He said the cooperative societies were provided with machinery in the past. He said farmers should avail maximum benefit and added that farmers can rent baler machines for better management of crop residue.While the government had made it mandatory for combine harvesters to have the SMS attachment, operators were still hesitant to fully adopt it as the SMS slows down the speed of machine and increases diesel consumption. “Due to slow speed, a combine will harvest less area, which will have direct impact on the earnings of an operator,” said a combine operator. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sms-essential-to-manage-crop-residue-agriculture-department-148503

30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Farm unions join hands to take on corporate houses||Thirty-one farmer unions in Punjab have decided to intensify their agitation against the new farm laws, beginning October 1.Read also: With the farmers unanimous in their opinion that the laws are meant to favour corporates, all farmer unions have accepted to join in the protest of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) of ghearoing the corporate houses.Four-pronged strategyEven as Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh extended his government’s full support to the agitating farmers, the unions have decided on a four-pronged strategy — protests outside residences of all BJP leaders and their social boycott; gherao of businesses owned by MNCs; rail roko across the state; and exhorting the gram panchayats to pass resolutions against the farm laws.Before meeting the Chief Minister, the representatives of farmer unions assembled at Kisan Bhawan here this morning. The farmer leaders were unanimous in their opinion that a special session of the Vidhan Sabha should be convened by the CM to come up with an Act that could circumvent the farm laws.Chairing a meeting with representatives of 31 farmer unions to take their views on the matter, the Chief Minister assured of all possible legal help to fight the farm legislations, including a special session of the Vidhan Sabha to discuss and decide the way forward. The Chief Minister said he would be discussing the issue with his legal team later today to finalise the next steps, including challenging the farm laws in the Supreme Court.Buta Singh Burjgill of the BKU (Dakaunda) said the CM-led delegation expressed apprehension that even if a resolution or law was passed by the Assembly, the Punjab Governor, who is a BJP nominee, could withhold it. “We assured them that we will exercise our democratic rights to ensure that the Governor sent the Acts to the President,” he said.Captain Amarinder slammed the Akalis for pawning off farmers’ interests to large corporates to promote their petty political interests. All panchayats in the state would be requested to pass resolutions against the agriculture Acts, and the same would be sent to the Union Government, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-unions-join-hands-to-take-on-corporate-houses-148518
30-09-2020||Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh says his government is exploring all avenues to fight the new farm Acts legally.||Exploring all avenues to oppose farm legislations||In his interaction with Sanjeev Singh Bariana, he spells out his future course of action.Harsimrat can’t be trusted. For that matter, even Sukhbir. Harsimrat first claimed that the farm ordinances would benefit the farmers, then she said farmers felt those were dangerous. And, the SAD’s former alliance partner BJP claims it had left the job of convincing the farmers to the Akali leadership. As far as the Punjab Congress manifesto is concerned, I want everyone, especially the media, to go by facts instead of taking Harsimrat at face value.There is no question of Manpreet or any other Punjab representative endorsing something that never came up for discussion. These are all lies that the Union Government has been propagating, beginning with the claims made by a Union minister in Parliament. That’s what the Badals did before the 2017 elections.I met representatives of 31 organisations not as a politician, but as Chief Minister, to take suggestions from them. I will now discuss the matter with legal experts. I have assured the unions that my government will fight tooth and nail to protect their interests.I don’t think farmers are so weak that anyone can take over their fight. The fact is that it is a matter of concern for entire Punjab. That’s why I had convened an all-party meeting to reach a consensus on the issue. The BJP and the SAD had aggressively defended the ordinances then, ignoring the interests of the state and its farmers.We are considering all legal options and taking advice to see what can be done to protect the interests of our farmers. Assured MSP on all crops is something we have been consistently fighting for. But instead of considering our demand, the Union Government is bent on doing away with the MSP altogether.The Centre needs to rethink these legislations and scrap them or at least put them in abeyance and defer their implementation, till the time they can discuss their implications with all stakeholders, including the farmers and state governments. Also, as I have maintained repeatedly the anger of the farmers will provide Pakistan and its ISI the platform for exploiting this opportunity to foment trouble in Punjab, which will cause serious problems for India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/exploring-all-avenues-to-oppose-farm-legislations-148519

Senior Jain was not present at the meeting.Addressing the party workers, Sukhbir Badal said the Akalis always stood by farmers and his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal (Bathinda MP) resigned from the Union Cabinet to protect the rights of the farmers.“Those who don’t know anything about agriculture have made farm laws. Punjabis constitute only 2 per cent of the total population of the country, but they provide food to the entire country.” While claiming that 90 per cent of the foodgrain markets in the state were established during the tenure of the Akali government, he said, “Punjab’s market system is the best and can’t be shut arbitrarily.”Lashing out at the BJP, he said Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badal used to make every political decision by consulting his NDA partners, but the BJP-led NDA government did not consult the SAD.Sukhbir accused Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh of having double standards. He did not forward the Assembly resolution, rejecting the three erstwhile farm ordinances to the Union Government.“In the meantime, not only were the ordinances taken up as Bills and ratified by Parliament, but they also became Acts after receiving the approval of the President,” he added.He asked the Chief Minister to tell farmers why he got the resolution passed in a special session if he did not have any intention to forward it to the Union Government and Parliament.“You are talking about fighting for the cause of farmers, but you are missing from action. I request farmer organisations to tell Capt Amarinder to come out of hiding first,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/unite-for-farmers-cause-sukhbir-to-workers-148520

The only way to stop stubble burning is to provide assured financial assistance in the form of bonus on crop or lump sum grants on the basis of land holding,” Lakhowal said.On the rail roko agitation, the BKU leader said the farmers were geared up to intensify the agitation from October 1 and their protest would continue till the state government adopts a resolution in the state Assembly against the farm Acts and the Centre scraps these laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/give-compensation-else-will-burn-stubble-farmers-body-148563

30-09-2020||Chandigarh||Raise issues at party forum, Shamsher Dullo, Partap Bajwa told||Congress’ Punjab affairs incharge Harish Rawat has expressed displeasure with senior party leaders Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo for repeatedly raising the state’s issues outside the party forum when these were already being followed by the top leadership.Harish Rawat, Punjab Affairs inchargeBridging the gapThe leaders should raise their concerns at the party forum, before the top party leadership, if not in Punjab. Being senior leaders, both have access to party high command. I am here to bridge the gap between the leadership and party’s rank and file.A former Uttarakhand Chief Minister, Rawat, who has been tasked by the party high command to iron out differences between top state party leaders, said both former PPCC presidents, Bajwa and Dullo, well understood the party’s functioning. “They should raise their genuine concerns at the party forum, before the top party leadership, if not in Punjab. Being senior leaders, both have access to party high command.”After conducting one-to-one meetings with party MLAs, Rawat without referring to differences between the CM and party leaders Partap Bajwa, Shamsher Singh Dullo and Navjot Singh Sidhu said the political situation was conducive for the party, but it was crucial for leaders to put up a united face. “I am here to bridge the gap between the leadership and the party’s rank and file,” he said.However, the Punjab affairs incharge said the case of Bajwa and Dullo couldn’t be compared with that of Sidhu. “With limited experience about party’s political structure, he took some time to adjust his way of working. He is an asset. He will be judiciously used in the run up to the 2022 elections.”Refusing to divulge details about the feedback from the MLAs, Rawat said it was unfortunate that the new body of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee had not been announced. “I am trying to bridge the disconnect between the top party leaders, MLAs and party workers. I am working out to ensure that the ministers sit in party offices to listen and solve the grievances of workers. I will see that things work out between the government and party workers,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/raise-issues-at-party-forum-shamsher-dullo-partap-bajwa-told-148617

At Golden Temple, staff members and devotees can be seen without masks and not maintaining social distancing.With top chairs of senior vice-president and chief secretary vacant as a fallout of the misappropriation of “saroops”, getting Covid protocols implemented inside the shrine complex is a challenge.A senior official said making the masks “mandatory” had been under consideration for long, but the “devotion” factor put the SGPC on a back foot.“It was observed that people approach ‘Guru da Ghar’ with a faith. They believe that they could never be harmed while on the premises. But, it is the SGPC management’s responsibility to persuade them “politely” to follow the Covid-19 protocols inside the shrine complex,” he said.Initially, dedicated health teams were deputed at all entrance points of the shrine. Sanitising dispensers and tunnels were put in place at different spots. Also, the devotees were being sent in batches inside the sanctum sanctorum, maintaining at least one-metre distance.Now, pilgrims and SGPC sewadars could be seen without safety masks and gloves. Even volunteers in the Langar Hall move around unmindful of safety measures. Making the situation worst is the ongoing protest opposite the SGPC headquarters where many people could be seen without masks and close to each other.Golden Temple manager Mukhtiar Singh said health teams were withdrawn ‘just’ two days ago for unknown reasons. However, Akal Takht acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh has repeatedly been asking devotees to adhere to health guidelines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pandemic-norms-go-for-a-toss-at-golden-temple-complex-148623
30-09-2020||Chandigarh||High Court restrains mid-term transfer of teacher||A day before her retirement on attaining the age of superannuation at 58, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today restrained the Punjab Education Department from relieving a teacher mid-term.The order by Justice Manoj Bajaj came on a petition filed against the state of Punjab and other respondents by Jasbir Kaur through counsel Kapil Kakkar and Shreesh Kakkar. Working as math mistress at a government high school in Hoshiarpur, the petitioner had challenged the department’s action of not granting her extension up to March 31 next year in terms of the Punjab School Teachers’ Extension in Service Act, 2015.It was contended by the counsels that the state government framed the Act to prevent disruption in studies of student in schools following the retirement of teachers on attaining the age of superannuation in the midst of an academic session.Kapil Kakkar submitted the petitioner’s case was duly forwarded for grant of extension in service up to March 31 by the head of the institute on June 18. But formal order granting extension in service to the petitioner was not issued in a typical bureaucratic manner. It was not only illegal and arbitrary, but also against the object and spirit of the 2015 Act. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-restrains-mid-term-transfer-of-teacher-148630
