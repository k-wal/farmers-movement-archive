20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Police use water cannon to stop Punjab Youth Cong workers from entering Haryana||The Haryana Police on Sunday used a water cannon to stop Punjab Youth Congress activists from entering the state through Ambala during a tractor rally against the Centre’s farm-related Bills.The Youth Congress activists were going to Delhi through the Chandigarh-Delhi highway when they were stopped at the heavily barricaded entrance to Haryana by police.The situation at the Haryana-Punjab border turned tense as the protesters remained adamant to continue their march towards the national capital.Some activists tried to set a tractor on fire after the march was stopped.The Haryana Police denied permission to the Youth Congress workers, saying they would not allow the traffic movement on the national highway to be disrupted and also cited the coronavirus restrictions.After being denied permission to enter Haryana, the Youth Congress activists terminated their protest at the site.Vehicular traffic was disrupted on the highway. However, there was no blockade on the highway.Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, who also joined the Youth Congress protesters, said all parties, except the Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP, are standing with farmers for their cause.He slammed Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, accusing him of earlier supporting the “black laws”.Indian Youth Congress president Srinivas B V said his party stands shoulder-to-shoulder with farmers and dubbed the reforms as “anti-farmer”.Punjab Youth Congress chief Barinder Singh Dhillon told media in Mohali’s Dera Bassi that this is the “beginning of the fight for the rights of farmers”.Black balloons were also released earlier in the day by the protesters as a mark of protest against the Bills. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-use-water-cannon-to-stop-punjab-youth-cong-workers-from-entering-haryana-144057
20-09-2020||---||Will take BJP, its allies to court over unconstitutional anti-farmer laws: Punjab CM||Chandigarh, September 20Vowing to fight till his last breath to protect the interests of the state’s farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday said his government will take the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, including the Akalis, to court over the new unconstitutional, undemocratic and anti-farmer laws of the Central government.“We will move the courts and fight the draconian legislations as soon as they get the Presidential nod and become the law of the land,” he said, expressing shock at the way the BJP-led Union Government brute-forced the Agriculture Bills through the Rajya Sabha today.The Chief Minister questioned the rationale behind putting the controversial and vicious Bills, which were a blatant encroachment of the State’s powers and control of the Agriculture sector, to voice vote, despite strong reservations by the Opposition and inadequate numbers in the House. Why did the House not go for division of votes on this critical issue, which has even divided the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), he asked.“They (BJP and its allies) clearly don’t care for what these laws will do to the farmers,” he said, flaying the BJP led government for selling the interests of the farmers to big corporates.BJP’s so-called ‘watershed’ moment will be the death of agriculture and will endanger the nation’s food security, warned the Chief Minister. By pushing the Bills through without consultation with the key stakeholders and even without taking the government of Punjab, a major contributor to India’s agricultural sector growth, into confidence, the Central Government had shown that it had no concern whatsoever for the farmers or the farm sector, he said.Pointing out that the Bills nowhere make any mention of retaining the MSP, Amarinder said this clearly exposes the ill intent of the Central Government, which has a poor trust record as far as states go. If they could not adhere to the clearly defined provisions on GST, how can one trust them to uphold their verbal assurances on MSP, he questioned.Every single provision of these Bills, said Amarinder, was crafted to destroy lakhs of small and marginal farmers in particular, who could not hope to compete in the monopolistic system that the Centre aimed to bring into the sector. “Where will these poor farmers go to sell their produce with the states no longer the pivotal players in the entire agricultural marketing system,” he asked.Pointing out that these farmers were nowhere near getting the Government-mandated MSP on their foodgrains in the open market that exists even today to a limited extent, the Chief Minister said it was unfortunate that instead of strengthening the State-led marketing system, as the Congress had promised in its manifesto, the central government had chosen to end it completely.Amarinder also lashed out at the Opposition for continuing to mislead the farmers by spread misinformation on the Congress manifesto of 2019 LS polls, which spoke of repeal of existing APMC Act in order to bring a new, improved legislation that would provide for more markets and more facilities for procurement of the farmers’ produce. What is more, the Congress manifesto clearly and categorically promised to retain the MSP regime, which the BJP government is refusing to do, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-take-bjp-its-allies-to-court-over-unconstitutional-anti-farmer-laws-punjab-cm-144047
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Stubble burning can exacerbate COVID situation in north India: Expert||The stubble burning which is likely to start later this month ahead of the Rabi crop sowing season can exacerbate the Coronavirus crisis, an agricultural-cum-environment expert has cautioned.“If alternate arrangements to stubble burning are not made, pollutants like particulate matters and toxic gases like Carbon Monoxide and Methane could give rise to severe respiratory problems, which will further worsen the COVID 19 situation, as the Coronavirus also impacts the respiratory tract,” Sanjeev Nagpal, also an adviser to the Union and the Punjab governments on the crop residue management, told PTI on Sunday.“Last year, nearly 50,000 cases of stubble burning were reported in Punjab. Stubble burning contributes about 18 to 40 per cent of particulate matter to atmosphere in northern plains. It also emits large amounts of toxic pollutants like Methane, Carbon Monoxide and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,” said Nagpal, also the MD of Sampurn Agri Ventures Pvt Ltd (SAVPL).Last year’s stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana had contributed to 44 per cent of the pollution in NCR Delhi, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the Ministry of Earth Science.Nagpal said stubble burning causes not only massive air pollution but also affects the soil health, which is already in a bad shape in Punjab.The practice of stubble burning combined with excessive use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years has resulted in the decrease of soluble silica, carbon and other essential nutrients in the soil, he said.“Silicon (Si) is one of the most prevalent soil macro-elements, performing an essential function in healing plants in response to environmental stress. The loss of soluble silica in the soil has given rise to silica deficiency in humans exposing people to a greater threat of COVID 19 and other diseases,” Nagpal said.“Insufficient amounts of silica in humans reduce their immune response towards viruses and pathogens,” he added.Punjab alone produces over 55 metric tons of crop residues each year out of which over 40 per cent have been found surplus, he said.Nagpal said the resolution lies in large scale collection of crop residue from farmers at a price by various plants and state governments, its storage, and then using technology for its conversion into organic manure and also biogas.Nagpal’s SAVPL project in Punjab’s Fazilka has devised this technology in association with IIT and PAU, Ludhiana. The project had purchased about 10,000 MTs of paddy straw last year which benefitted around 500 farmers, he claimed.The plant is making 8 MTs of silica manure per day now against a total capacity of 25 MTs per day, he said, adding the capacity of the project is to process 15,000 MTs of crop residue every year.“Our concept is to process stubble to make silica-rich manure that will improve soil health and food quality thereby improving people’s health. We want the Punjab government to give a fillip to the model of ‘crop residue management through its conversion into manure so that it is replicated across the state,” said Nagpal.“This will not only solve the stubble burning problem but will also help produce healthy food thereby helping farmers get better prices for quality food and consumers a chance to buy directly from farmers at a reasonable price,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/stubble-burning-can-exacerbate-covid-situation-in-north-india-expert-144044
20-09-2020||Ravi S Singh||Punjab, Haryana feature prominently during discussion on agri Bills in Rajya Sabha||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 20Punjab and Haryana featured prominently during heated discussion on two farm reform related Bills in Rajya Sabha on Sunday.Ongoing agitation of farmers from the two states was the dominating references by the speakers, both from the BJP and the opposition parties.The stand out was the sharp exchanges by Congress’ MP from Punjab Partap Singh Bajwa, who initiated the discussion on the Bills from the Opposition and Bhupender Singh Yadav of the BJP, who is a native of Haryana but elected to the House from Rajasthan.Yadav was the first speaker from the BJP immediately after Bajwa’s turn.Flaunting his credentials as a speaker on agriculture related issues, Bajwa said he is a son of a farmer and hence, was conversant with grievances of farming community. He said farmers of Haryana, Punjab and western UP are agitated against the Bills and see them as an “attack on their conscience”.Yadav countered Bajwa through his opening salvo saying he has dyed-in-the-wool “kisan” parentage, and a native of Haryana.Referring to Bajwa’s reference to agitation of farmers of Punjab regarding the Bills, he said a similar bogey was raised in the seventies in the state against the iconic Bhakra Dam, which emerged as the life-line of the state.“Bogey was raised that electricity would be squeezed out of water from Punjab’s river from the dam to sap it of its power,” Yadav said.He said the Congress is in the habit of indulging doublespeak and spreading negativity, and in this context he referred to anti-CAA agitation.He further said a high-powered committee was constituted by the Manmohan Singh government with the then Haryana Chief Minister BS Hooda to recommend measures to enhance farmers’ income.The committee had also recommended measures to allow farmers to sell produce outside the mandis.BJP member from UP Surendra Nagar said the Bills will allow farmers to sell their produce at any place in the country.Due to the present restrictions the farmers of Haryana cannot sell their jaggery in the markets of Bihar where their produce will fetch a better price, Nagar said, pitching in with his hereditary association with agriculture.Naresh Gujral of the SAD said his party opposed the Bills as they were against the interest of farmers  of the state, who have contributed to the progress and food security of the country.SS Dhindsa, who floated a new Akali Dal after parting ways with Badals-led SAD, said jawans from Punjab who fought for the country’s security at the borders were sons of farmers.AAP member Sushil Gupta also pitched himself as a native of Haryana. He cautioned the government that the farmers of the state will not forgive it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-haryana-feature-prominently-during-discussion-on-agri-bills-in-rajya-sabha-144035

20-09-2020||Amritsar||PSGPC raises Sikh girl’s abduction case with authorities||The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) has intervened in the alleged abduction and forcible conversion of the religion of a young Sikh girl.  Taking cognisance of the incident, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal has sought the intervention of Union External Affairs Ministry to bring justice to the girl and her family.Nonetheless, the PSGPC officials along with the girl’s family members met Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri in the presence of Punjab’s Minister for Minority Affairs Ijaz Alam Augustine and chairman of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) Dr Aamir Ahmad, and apprised them of disappearance of the girl.Talking to The Tribune over phone, the PSGPC president Satwant Singh told that the girl had gone missing from her father’s house located near the Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hasan Abdal, a city in Attock district of Punjab province in Pakistan.“The federal and provincial ministers and officials had assured us that she would be reunited with her family,” he said.When asked about the ‘seriousness’ of Pakistan authorities in this matter keeping in view the leniency that was adopted in an earlier identical incident, he said, “We have faith in Pakistan authorities that justice would be done.  The police have launched a hunt for the missing girl. Our endeavour is to recover the girl and ensure that exemplary punishment be given to the guilty ones. We are constantly in contact with the district police officer of Attock for the latest updates on the situation,” he said.Meanwhile, a case was registered against an “unknown abductor” immediately after the girl’s father had filed a complaint.It was the girl’s father Pritam Singh, a granthi in Gurdwara Panja Sahib, who revealed the incident on social media that her daughter was missing for the past ten days. In his message, he had feared the forcible conversion of her religion.At the moment, it would be premature to confirm that the girl has converted to another religion.

20-09-2020||---||Ex-sepoy still active in reuniting families separated during Partition||Amritsar, September 19After taking part in the 1965 and 1971 wars against Pakistan as a sepoy in the Indian Army, Harbhajan Singh Brar realised that he was fighting against his own people. “I had no enmity with them. Deep down in my heart, I was emotionally attached to them,” says Brar, who left the Army in 1972. He then embarked upon a mission to reunite friends and families across the border.The peace activist, who has arranged meetings of hundreds of Punjabis who got separated during the Partition of Punjab, is still active in ensuring permanent peace on the Indo-Pak border.Since 2004, he has arranged 650 visas for people of the two Punjabs. A majority of those he helped were at the end of their lives and had always cherished a dream to visit the land they had to leave in 1947.He recently organised condolence meetings in memory of 10 lakh Punjabis killed during the Partition in 1947. On August 15 this year, peace activists across the state associated with Brar’s Sai Mian Mir Foundation remembered millions of Punjabis who paid a heavy price for the Independence.Brar’s family had migrated from Chak 7 village in Khanewal tehsil of Multan district during the Partition. “I could not sever ties with the land of my ancestors. The land of Guru Nanak and Baba Farid can’t be hated for political reasons”, said Brar.How the idea took shapeWhen he first time visited Lahore with a “jatha” of Sikh devotees in 2006, the idea of reuniting lost people took shape. “During the tour, we visited the tomb of Hazrat Sai Mian Mir. I met with Mian Mohammad Aakram Betu, a retired judge. We discussed the composite culture and religion of both Punjabs. Thousands of persons died with the unfulfilled desire to see again their villages in India and Pakistan. So we decided to arrange visits of such people,” Brar reminiscences.And thus started the journey of Sai Mian Mir Foundation, the organisation Brar formed to arranges visits for “jathas” to Pakistan. “The governments are heartless as they don’t want people meet each other. The unwanted checks of security agencies of both nations and formalities for processing of visa applications discourage us. At the age of 75, I am still active in peace initiatives,” he says.Brar penned three books about his journey and experiences. His first book, ‘Sanjan Aar-Paar Dian’ was published in 2011 and is also available in Sahmukhi. He wrote tales of those people who were separated in 1947 and met after decades. His two other books, ‘Sai Mian Mir Ate Sikh Guru’ (2017) and ‘Sanjan da Wagda Darya’ (2018), express the ties between Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus.Brar and his foundation used to serve the patients from Pakistan, who travels to Delhi for treatment. Apart from this several Pakistani Singers including Reshama and Naseebo Lal enjoyed hospitality of Brar at his residence near Khalsa College.“Once, sitting in the backyard of my house with Naseebo Lal, I asked her what it felt to be sitting here. In reply, she said it was like sitting at her father’s house. It was a proud moment for me,” shared Brar.He gave the credit of initiatives to his wife Sukhjeet Kaur Brar, saying, “No one can march on the path of activism without the wife’s support.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ex-sepoy-still-active-in-reuniting-families-separated-during-partition-143932

Trains will be halted at identified locations in the state,” he said.On September 20 (Sunday), the farm organisations will burn the effigies of PM Narendra Modi at various locations in Punjab to protest the tabling of farm Bills in the Rajya Sabha. The farm organisations in Haryana have also given a call for a complete bandh tomorrow.Sukhdev Singh Kokri, general secretary, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), alleged that the Union Government was working on a hidden agenda to abolish the minimum support price (MSP) of foodgrains. “When the government has already proposed delisting the foodgrains from the list of essential commodities, how can you expect that the MSP will continue in the future,” he asked. He said the corporate houses would set up their own system to purchase foodgrains outside the ambit of grain markets, which would lead to a monetary loss of 6 per cent development tax and 2.5 per cent mandi tax.Dr Darshan Pal, state convener, All-India Farmers’ Struggle Coordination Committee, claimed that the Union Government was also contemplating withdrawal of the direct subsidy on power and fertilisers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/30-farm-unions-want-bills-rolled-back-143638
20-09-2020||Chandigarh||Akalis never had any lure of office: Badal||Akali patriarch and former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has hailed the party’s decision to pull out of the Union Cabinet as a landmark moment and insisted that the Akali Dal has a long history of rejecting lure of office and standing up for principles.Parkash Singh Badal, ex-chief minister‘Nothing dearer than principles’With the resignation of Harsimrat, the SAD has demonstrated yet again that nothing is dearer to it than its principles as well as the interests of farmers.Speaking for the first time on the issue of Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation, Badal said: “The lure of office means nothing to an Akali. Countless times, as during the Emergency, we turned down outright offers of power as a price for silence against injustice. But we always spurned such offers and preferred to stand by the country and principles, and filled jails for that. That tradition will always live on.”“I am proud that when the hour of reckoning arrived, my party, as always, held aloft the flag of justice for farmers and other exploited sections of society. This flag symbolises the identity of the Akali culture and movements and it is a great feeling to watch it flying high,” said Badal.Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister‘Leave NDA if you are with farmers’The Badals should stop lying, and instead, come out in the open against the NDA by withdrawing from the alliance… otherwise claims of standing with the farmers are hollow.The former Chief Minister said the farmers’ issue was linked to the national interest. “Agriculture is the backbone of our economy. If farmers and agricultural economy suffers, the whole economy, including trade and industry will suffer too.”Batting for farmers, the SAD patriarch said: “The Punjab farmers had always come to the country’s rescue when it needed to be saved from the ignominy of famines and dependence on other nations… today, it is the country’s turn to stand by the farmers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akalis-never-had-any-lure-of-office-badal-143639

20-09-2020||Chandigarh||CM Punjab: Nothing common  in Congress manifesto, Bills||CM Capt Amarinder Singh today asked the Akalis to stop “lying and misleading” the people of the state by comparing portions of the Congress manifestos with the anti-farmer Bills.Instead of flashing the copies of the manifestos, the SAD and AAP should have made the effort to read the relevant parts first, said the Chief Minister, while slamming the Opposition over their “unsubstantiated and blatantly false allegations” against the Congress on the issue.Referring to Congress manifestos for the Lok Sabha and the last Assembly elections, Captain Amarinder said nowhere had the party spoken about bringing any of the changes that the Centre was trying to impose on the nation with its legislations.In fact, the manifestos had clearly talked about strengthening the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) system to make it even more beneficial to the farmers, the CM said.The state Congress manifesto of 2017 had stated that the APMC Act should be updated to ensure a direct access to farmers to the national and international markets through digital technology without tinkering with the existing MSP system, while the LS manifesto spoke about strengthening the marketing system by repealing the existing Act and bringing in new provisions that would provide for establishment of thousands of kisan markets to allow easy access to farmers within two-three kilometre range.Captain Amarinder said the Punjab Congress manifesto had promised that the “state government will ensure lifting of foodgrain within 48 hours and payment by procurement agencies within three days.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cm-punjab-nothing-common-in-congress-manifesto-bills-143684
