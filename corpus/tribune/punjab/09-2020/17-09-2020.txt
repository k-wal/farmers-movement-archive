17-09-2020||K V Prasad ||Oldest allies, Sena first and now SAD, on path of separation from BJP||Tribune News Service New Delhi, September 17 The Shiromani Akali Dal on Thursday night its fired first salvo within the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance by pulling out its lone representative in the Union Council of Ministers.The move signalled a fissure in the three-decade old association the regional party from Punjab has had with the BJP. That Harsimrat Kaur Badal referred to it in her resignation letter reflects that ties forged by the BJP veterans Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani may have lost the sheen the partnership mutually benefitted since 1996. Ironical it may seem that during the last one year, the BJP relations with two of its oldest and staunch supporters – the Shiv Sena and the SAD -- have slid down. While the Shiv Sena moving away could be explained to a political compulsion of forming a government in Maharasthra, there is no such apparent pressure on the Akalis. The elections to the State Assembly is still a good 17-odd months away. The SAD has stopped short of taking a clean break from the BJP. Now that the three Agri-Bills the SAD is opposed to are on course to get a parliamentary nod, the Akalis may have to work on its political calculations on its maintaining the alliance with the national party. Yet, it chose to step out of the Modi government on a day the BJP celebrated the birthday of the Prime Minister as a start of a ‘Sewa Saptah’ (Week of Service).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/oldest-allies-sena-first-and-now-sad-on-path-of-separation-from-bjp-142577

Why didn’t Harsimrat Badal oppose the Bills when the Cabinet was approving them? Why don’t Akali MPs resign from Lok Sabha and why don’t they take support back from BJP?”Congress MP Partap Bajwa also asked why the Akali Dal hasn’t dissociated from NDA.Bajwa tweeted, “ Harsimrat Kaur Badal has resigned from the Union Cabinet, yet SAD remains a member of the NDA. This half-hearted step shows the real intention of the SAD. This resignation is not one on principle, but an attempt to hoodwink the public.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-dares-akali-dal-to-dissociate-from-nda-142571
17-09-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Lok Sabha passes 2 agri sector Bills amid protests by Opposition, farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Sept 17Amid widespread protest by farmers across the country, the Lok Sabha passed two more farm sector-related Bills.This even as Shiromani Akali Dal, a part of the ruling NDA combine, protested against the bills. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a Union minister and Akali MP, resigned from the Cabinet.The Congress and almost the entire Opposition opposed the Bills terming them as ‘anti-farmer’.The House passed the two Bills — ‘The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020’ and the ‘Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020’.More than five hours of debate ensued before the Bills were passed around 9.45 pm on Thursday.Sukhbir Singh Badal, the President of the Akali Dal and MP from Ferozepur, said “the Bills will ruin what we have created as agriculture infrastructure in Punjab in the past 50 years”. He opposed the Bills vehemently.Ravneet Singh Bittu, Congress MP from Ludhiana opposed the Bills and termed these as ‘black laws’. He asked the Central Government, “why are you intervening, agriculture is a state subject”.Bittu asked the government to not implement this in Punjab and Haryana, and try it out in other states. Punjab, he said, was a border state, ‘don’t needle it’. “Sometime you raise SYL and then you come up such Bills,” he said.Punjab Congress MPs Gurpratap Singh Aujla, Jasbir Singh Dimpa also opposed the Bills. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann was among the opposers to the Bill. The TMC, the AAP and the BSP also opposed the Bills. The Shiv Sena supported the government, the BJD wanted it to be sent to the standing committee.Justifying the Bills, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh termed them as ‘revolutionary’. “Farmer will be free to sell produce anywhere and to anyone, freeing him from selling the produce only at the designated ‘mandi’. Sales done outside the mandi will attract no tax of Centre or state governments.”The Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), will remain in states, Tomar said, adding that Bills should not be criticised for political reasons. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) system will continue and no contract will be allowed between private trader and farmer that can affect land holding of farmer. Even in case of dispute, the land of the farmer cannot be sold to recover any damages.Tomar assured that Narendra Modi government is committed to protect the rights of farmers. The government has paid Rs 92,000 crore to farmers across the country through the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme.The government says the Bills will provide for the creation of an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers’ produce. Also, it will provide for a national framework on farming agreements that protects and empowers farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farm services.On September 16, the Lok Sabha cleared the ‘Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020’, amid strong objection from Opposition MPs, who termed the move “anti-farmer and pro-hoarder and pro-corporate”.The Lok Sabha that assembled for the day at 3 pm on Thursday was adjourned till 4 pm following obituary reference to Tirupati Lok Sabha MP Balli Durga Prasad Rao. He was undergoing treatment for COVID-19 and died at a hospital in Chennai on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lok-sabha-passes-2-agri-sector-bills-amid-protests-by-opposition-farmers-142569

17-09-2020||---||Harsimrat’s resignation from Union Cabinet: Too little too late, says Capt Amarinder||Chandigarh, September 17Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday said Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s decision to quit the Union Cabinet was another in the long chain of theatrics being enacted by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).He said despite the “slap on their face” by the Central government over the Farm Bills, SAD has not quit the ruling coalition.Questioning SAD’s decision to continue to remain a part of the BJP-led NDA coalition at the Centre, the Amarinder said even Harsimrat’s resignation was nothing more than a “gimmick” to “befool the farmers of Punjab”.“But they (the Akalis) will not succeed in misleading the farmer organisations,” he said, calling it a case of ‘too little, too late.’Harsimrat’s resignation from the Union Cabinet has come too late to be of any help to Punjab and its farmers, said the Chief Minister.Had SAD taken a stand earlier and supported the state government against the ordinances, the situation might not even have come to such a pass, and the Centre might have thought 10 times before introducing the ordinances and pushing the anti-farmer legislations in Parliament, he added.Also read: Harsimrat Badal resigns from Union Cabinet in protest against farm BillsEven now, the only reason for the SAD’s decision to pull their sole minister out of the Union Cabinet was motivated not by any concern for the farmers but to save their political fortunes, and the fizzling political careers of the Badals, who had lost all credibility in the eyes of Punjab’s people, said Amarinder.It was the angst of the farmers and the pressure mounted by the state’s farmer organisations, which were up in arms against the vicious ordinances since they were brought in by the Government of India, that had compelled the Badals to change their stance on the ordinances, he said.“Did Sukhbir and Harsimrat and their coterie not see the damage the legislations would do to Punjab’s agriculture and economy all this time? Or were they so blinded by their greed for power that they deliberately chose to close their eyes to the danger posed by the ordinances?” asked Captain Amarinder.Now that their game-plan had been completely exposed, the Akalis were left with no option but to take a public stand against the farm Bills to protect their electoral vote-bank in Punjab, the senior Congress leader quipped, asserting that the people of the state had rejected them earlier and will reject them again.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/harsimrats-resignation-from-union-cabinet-too-little-too-late-says-capt-amarinder-142555

The move will encourage the establishment of more private universities in the state, the spokesperson added.This decision has been taken in line with the recommendations of the committee, constituted under the Chief Secretary by the Higher Education Department with the approval of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to consider the representations received from various sponsoring bodies for relaxations and amendments in various clauses of the 2010 policy for the establishment of new private universities in the state.According to the spokesperson of the Chief Minister’s Office, as per provision 4.5(iv) of the aforesaid policy, the constructed area required for setting up of multi-domain university in Punjab is 50,000 sq m, which is the highest in India. Thus, the state government has decided to amend the existing provision 4.5(a)(iv) of the policy for reducing the requirement of constructed area to 30,000 sq m for multi-domain university and 15,000 sq m for single-domain university.“The amended policy will further facilitate higher capital investments in the field of higher education and it is expected that two more universities, which have tie-ups with globally acclaimed universities, would set up campuses in Punjab,” the statement further read.The Cabinet also gave the nod to amend the existing provision 4.3(g) of the 2010 policy, making sponsoring body eligible for setting up of private university on leased land, subject to the lease being a long-term one, for at least 33 years, from a government authority or gram panchayat.It may be noted that the Punjab Private University Policy, 2010, had no provision for taking land on lease for setting up a university while most of the states in India have such enabling provision of land requirements.Under the Punjab Private University Policy, 2010, aimed at bringing in private high-quality education in the higher education sector, the state government has so far approved 14 universities. Apart from these, proposals to establish four more private universities are under process.Punjab Cooperative Audit (Group-B) service rules to be amendedMeanwhile, the Cabinet also gave the approval to amend the Punjab Cooperative Audit (Group-B) Service Rules, 2016, by merging the post of Senior Assistant (Accounts) with that of the Senior Assistants, to pave the way for promotional avenues to the Senior Assistant (Accounts) working in the Audit Wing of the Cooperative Department.

17-09-2020||---||Why would MPs need direction from Capt Amarinder on farm bills, they knew party stand: Punjab Congress leaders||Chandigarh, September 17Slamming the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for its concerted attempt to divert public attention from its failure to protect the rights and interests of the farmers, a group of Punjab Congress leaders, including PPCC president and Cabinet Ministers, said on Thursday that in sharp contrast to the Akalis, the Congress was totally in unison over the Farm Bills and had not needed a whip to vote against the Union Government’s reprehensible bid to destroy the state’s agriculture, a press statement by state government read.They were reacting to the statement of SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema over the fact that Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had led a delegation on Wednesday to submit a memorandum to the Governor on the issue “instead of directing his MPs to express solidarity with the farming community by voting against the agri ordinances”.“The Congress MPs have been fighting against these dangerous anti-Punjab ordinances from the outset and knew which way to vote, unlike those of the SAD whose MPs were totally lost due to the total lack of clarity or direction from their leadership which has been changing its stance on key issues to suit their personal interests,” said MP Manish Tiwari.He was joined by PPCC president, Sunil Jakhar, and Cabinet Ministers Manpreet Badal, Sukhjinder Randhawa and Bharat Bhushan Ashu.The Congress MPs from across the country had voted against the bills, which the BJP-led NDA succeeded in passing through a brute majority in the House by voice vote, the state government said in a statement.The Congress members of the Parliament already had clear directions from the party leadership, including Captain Amarinder Singh as well as the high command in Delhi, on the party’s stand on the Ordinances, which the Akalis openly and clearly supported at the time of their introduction, they said. “Why would they need new directions, given that there had been no change in Captain Amarinder’s or Congress’ stand on the issue, unlike SAD’s Sukhbir Badal?” they quipped.They pointed out that it was the SAD, along with the BJP, which had refused to reject the Ordinances during an all-party meet convened by Captain Amarinder and had subsequently stayed away from the Vidhan Sabha session to avoid voting for the resolution against the same. The sudden U-turn by SAD president Sukhbir Badal thereafter naturally left the Akali MPs at a loss to figure out what their party’s stand was, necessitating a whip to vote against the Bills in Parliament, the ministers added.“Even now,” the ministers said, “Sukhbir and his wife Harsimrat Badal continue to cling to their pretence of power in the NDA in the hope of promoting their petty personal interests.”“Why has Harsimrat not quit the Cabinet? Why has Sukhbir not pulled the SAD out of the NDA even after the Narendra Modi government failed to address their purported concerns on the farm Bills?” asked the Congress ministers and the MPs, adding that the entire drama had clearly been enacted by the Akalis for public consumption, with no intent whatsoever to protect the interests of Punjab and its farmers.As for acting against Union Minister of state Raosaheb Danve, who had misled the Parliament with his false statement on Punjab’s stand in the high-powered committee on the ordinances, they pointed out that Captain Amarinder had already sought an unequivocal apology from the minister.The Congress would continue to fight against these legislations within and outside the Parliament and would not get side-tracked by the SAD drama, the party leaders asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-would-mps-need-direction-from-capt-amarinder-on-farm-bills-they-knew-party-stand-punjab-congress-leaders-142480
17-09-2020||---||Include Punjabi in J&K official Languages Bill 2020: INTACH||Amritsar, September 16The exclusion of Punjabi language from the list of official languages of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) will cause a setback to the cultural heritage of Punjab and would be injustice to the significant Punjabi speaking population in the region.This was opined by Punjab state convener and member governing council, INTACH, and professor of applied linguistics, Dr Sukhdev Singh.He appealed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the decision. “The Punjabi language has been a major language in the region comprising present Indian Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu Kashmir and the present Pakistan. The languages like Dogri are so closely related to Punjabi that Dogri has been considered a dialect of Punjabi before it was declared a language”, he said.Although Dogri is now said to belong to the Western Pahari group of languages, it has so close affinity with the Punjabi language that many scholars argue “Dogri is a spoken form of Punjabi”.Dr Singh said, “Unlike most Indian languages, Dogri is a tonal language like Punjabi. Both these languages are closely related and therefore Dogri was listed as a dialect of Punjabi in the national census before it was declared an independent language. The similarity between the languages eliminates the barriers in communication and cultural exchange. Besides, there is a sizeable Punjabi speaking population of Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir .”The Punjabi language was a recognised language in the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. It is also included in the list of languages of the government-supported Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages, which was set up in 1958.Dr Singh said the Central Government should review the decision of excluding Punjabi, Pahari and Gojri from the Jammu and Kashmir Official Languages Bill 2020, in view of the facts related to the cultural diversity.He argued that Punjabi needs to be recognised the second language in the neighboring Indian states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir respecting the linguistic rights of the people and their culture.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/include-punjabi-in-jk-official-languages-bill-2020-intach-142368

He said because the amount of scholarship funds to be given to Dalit students was released by the Centre, it should also be investigated for the scam by CBI. He said those convicted in the investigation should be given severe punishments so that no one thinks of getting involved in such a scam again.He said he would not form alliance with any party for the 2022 Assembly elections and claimed that only the Lok Insaaf Party government would be formed. He said the Akali Dal Badal’s seats would be reduced to a single digit in the 2022 Assembly elections.He also said the BJP had no basis in Punjab and that is why it was compelled to form an alliance with Akali Dal Badal. He said the Congress would have to sweat a lot to save even one and a half dozen of its seats in coming 2022 elections.He said Navjot Sidhu was an honest person and that’s why he had been kept out of the Cabinet. Describing captain and his ministers as corrupt, he said in the departments that the captain has held with him, thousands of crores of seed scam, tax scam and liquor scam, etc have Taken place.He said two years ago, in a meeting at the PAP complex in Jalandhar, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had promised to install a tubewell for drinking water for Charan Chhoh Ganga but it has not been fulfilled till date.

His father said his son always wanted to join the Army, as he was fascinated by the lives of officers, but his dream only got a push when he visited England on a visitor visa in 2017 and met his brother-in-law, who, too, is serving as an officer in the British army, and who gave wings to the dreams of Harminder by motivating him to at least give it a try.His father said Harminder after completing his studies moved to Australia in 2008 and after working there for nearly eight years, he came back to Jalandhar in 2016.“My son came back because he wanted to do some reputed job. In the meantime, we fixed his marriage, too! Thereafter, when he visited England, his brother-in-law, Nishan Singh, asked him to join the British army. Inspired by his words, he immediately started his preparation as well as physical training. Eventually, in February 2020, he got selected and just a few months ago he joined the Royal Artillery,” he said.“It’s really a proud moment for everyone in the family, as getting a reputed job in a foreign country is not easy. People are losing jobs already due to Covid and employment has become a serious issue. Thus, I am very much thankful to God for showing us this day. There is no bigger happiness for a father than to see his son live his dream,” said Salukhan, who performs kirtan here, adding that Harminder’s two younger brothers Maninderpal Singh and Jagwinderpal Singh, were also living in Australia at present. While one was still studying, the other one was working.Meanwhile, Ranjit Kaur, wife of Harminder Singh, said her son, who is just 3-year-old, was very fond of wearing military uniform. She said he also wants to be a soldier like his father when he grows up.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/proud-parents-on-cloud-nine-as-son-selected-in-british-army-142354

Over 100 buses from the district left for the UT from the city bus stand, including 52 government buses. While the buses to Chandigarh started plying early in the day, the rush of passengers was limited. As per the first seven routes of the Jalandhar depot-1 buses, around 71 passengers were ferried to UT.Kuldeepak, an official at the city bus stand, who manages the permit and routes of Roadways buses, said the buses operated with earlier guidelines only with not more than 50 per cent capacity.

The count of passengers is expected to rise in the coming days, as many enquires were earlier received regarding the bus services to Chandigarh,” Kuldeepak said.Meanwhile, drivers ferrying passengers said, social distancing norms were followed and it was ensured that passengers wore masks and their hands were sanitised, before boarding the buses. “There was no rush at most bus stands in the morning hours, but many people expressed relief at the resumption of bus services,” said Gurjit Singh, a conductor. Navraj Batish, Roadways General Manager, said: “After the suspension of buses in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, the Roadways has already suffered losses in crores and even as the services to Chandigarh have resumed, the recovery rate is still low due to the 50 per cent capacity rule.”He also confirmed that inter-state movement of buses would remain terminated until the next orders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/relief-for-jalandhar-passengers-as-bus-service-resumes-to-chandigarh-142357

Had the government made required arrangements to transport vegetables to big towns, we would not have suffered so much,” said Salim, a vegetable grower from Malerkotla.The growers allege that vegetables perished in their fields. Despite having made the required transport arrangements, they were not allowed to ferry their produce.Before the lockdown, around 100 trucks of vegetables were sent daily from the Malerkotla vegetable market (the biggest vegetable market in the state) to Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Delhi, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and Haryana. However, after the lockdown was imposed, the supplies reduced drastically, as only 40 trucks were sent.

In rural areas, the boxes have been installed at gurdwaras and temples in the vicinity.Those interested are just required to drop their credentials, such as, their name, four passport size photos, proof of age, previous class result, any ID proof and their contact number. The provision is available for all students seeking admission to either primary or senior secondary classes.So far, 1,11,994 students have enrolled themselves this year, as against 98,692 enrolments last year. There has been a spike in the number of admissions by 13,302. Most of the new admissions have been students who migrated from private schools.District Education Officer (Secondary) Satinder Bir Singh, who came up with this initiative, said compared to last year, there had been a spurt in the number of admissions in government schools by 11.63 per cent. For admission to Classes XI and XII too, a surge has been witnessed, with 3,000 and 4,000 new enrolments, respectively.The idea has caught the attention of Secretary, Education, Krishan Kumar, and will be shortly adopted in Patiala and other districts.At a time when parents and managements of private schools are at loggerheads on the issue of school fee, many government SMART schools have caught the fancy of parents. Government Senior Secondary School (GSSS), Chheharta, has enrolled 498 students from private schools; GSSS, Mall road, saw admission of 254 private school students; and GSSS, Mahan Singh road, admitted 294 students of private schools.Satinder said, “We have digital classrooms, and e-content will also be made available to students. We are not short of any private school.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/drop-box-for-school-admissions-142269
