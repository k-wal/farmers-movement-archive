He asked MLAs to work with Panchayats to identify “rumour mongers” and help check negative propaganda.Amarinder also said that 28,688 tests were conducted on Tuesday and that the number will be taken to 30000 tests a day soon.“The focus of the state government is on saving lives, for which early testing is essential,” he said. “Anti-social elements are defaming Punjab,” he said. “Claims of organ harvesting of deceased Covid patients are incorrect and illogical,” he said, warning of strict action in such cases. “We have to effectively counter such campaigns,” he told the third group of Congress MLAs as part of his series of virtual meetings with ministers and party legislators the Covid situation in the state. He asked the ministers and MLAs to visit their districts and constituencies to take stock of the ground situation over the next three days.“With the peak expected in the state in the next two weeks, it was important for the elected representatives and officials to work together to tackle the crisis,” he said.‘Crack down on misinformation’Amarinder accused Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi under Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of not doing enough to contain the spread of the virus.“Despite its lower population, Delhi, which is ruled by AAP, has reported worse data on the pandemic. They (AAP) have made it a subject of competition,” he said.“Nowhere has such a thing happened, and in fact the Congress has been supporting state governments across the country in their fight against Covid, in sharp contrast to AAP and the Akalis who are trying to derail the Punjab government’s efforts,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-allows-international-travellers-with-covid-negative-certificate-to-opt-for-home-quarantine-138803

09-09-2020||Chandigarh||New system of deemed approvals to be implemented to promote business ease: Capt||Expressing dissatisfaction with Punjab’s 19th rank in the Ease of Doing Business Survey, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said his government aims to put the state in the top five next year, with a new system of deemed approvals to be implemented soon to further promote business ease.The Chief Minister said the government was working on implementing a system of deemed approvals wherein online automatic clearances will be issued on the expiry of the stipulated period, he added. The process of setting up new industrial parks to attract investments from foreign and domestic companies was also on, he said, citing the upcoming state-of-the-art Mega Parks in Ludhiana, Rajpura, Bathinda and Mohali.Reiterating his government’s commitment to fully supporting investors as they strive for normalcy in the post-COVID environment in the coming year, the Chief Minister said his team of officers would do everything possible to help and facilitate the industry in Punjab.Inviting the industry to partner the state in improving its skill training and make it more job-oriented, Captain Amarinder said: “you need skilled manpower and you can absorb these trained youth at better rates.”The Chief Minister was chairing a virtual round-table conference with some industry leaders on the job landscape and required skill-set for the post-COVID world, organised by Chitkara University, under the Punjab Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission.Underlining his vision to employ in every household in the state, the Chief Minister cited the success of his government’s flagship Ghar Ghar Rozgar Mission programme to increase employment and employability of youth. District Bureaus of Employment & Enterprise have been set up in all districts, he said, adding that his government was working to respond to the demands of skilled labour by the industry. Skill deficit in the unemployed youth is identified, and matching is done with employer demands, he said, adding that more than 8 lakh youth have registered themselves on the Pgrkam.com portal to avail this facilitation.The Chief Minister further said the New Education Policy would be tweaked by his government to suit the specific requirements of the state, particularly in the context of the post-COVID environment that would need a new skill-set for employing youth.Underlining the unique challenges faced by Punjab, a predominantly agricultural economy that had been trying to shift towards greater industrialisation under his government, the Chief Minister said skill development for rural children, in particular, was a challenge. The New Education Policy, which the state was currently examining in detail, would need to be tailor-made to the needs of the state, he said.The world is changing and we will have to change along with it, said Captain Amarinder, adding that his government’s efforts were aimed at stopping the brain-drain by promoting relevant education and skills, with the best of universities in the state. Mohali was being developed as a major education hub, with Plaksha University coming up there, he added.The pandemic had hit the industrial development process adversely, and caused the economy to suffer immensely, said Captain Amarinder, adding that even amidst the crisis, the state had received an investment of about Rs. 2500 Cr. which is a strong sign of investor confidence in Punjab. Overall the state had received investments worth over Rs. 64,000 cr on the ground in the last 3.5 years in response to the new industrial policy launched by his government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/new-system-of-deemed-approvals-to-be-implemented-to-promote-business-ease-capt-138752
09-09-2020||New Delhi||1994 kidnapping case: Will SS Saini get exemption from appearance in CBI special court?||Former Punjab Director General of Police Sumedh Singh Saini's legal troubles are getting compounded day-by-day.Barely two days after the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissed his anticipatory bail plea in the 1991 Multani kidnapping and murder case, a 26-year-old case of abduction and disappearance against him is coming up for hearing in the national capital before a CBI Special Court on Thursday.Saini has no protection from arrest in the FIR registered against him for alleged illegal abduction, detention, torture and custodial death of Balwant Singh Multani in December 1991.He has the option of moving the Supreme Court or surrendering before the trial court or the police. The state can initiate the process to declare him a proclaimed offender.In Delhi, Saini is facing trial along with three others for alleged abduction of automobile businessman Vinod Kumar, his brother-in-law Ashok Kumar and their driver Mukhtiyar Singh.While Vinod and Mukhtiyar were picked up by the police from the parking lot of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on March 15, 1994, Ashok was allegedly abducted from Ludhiana the same day.The CBI has already filed an application seeking cancellation of exemption from personal appearance given to Saini. Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal is likely to take up the CBI's plea on Thursday.After the rejection of Saini's anticipatory bail plea by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Multani murder case, even the complainant was likely to seek his personal appearance.This criminal case was registered against Saini and others by CBI on the orders of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on March 24, 1994. It was transferred to Delhi by the Supreme Court in 2004 after Vinod’s mother Amar Kaur expressed apprehension that Saini being a senior IPS officer might influence witnesses.Kaur—who waged a 24-year legal battle for her lost son—had deposed in a wheelchair against Saini before a Delhi court. She died here on December 12, 2017.CBI Superintendent of Police Dharampal Singh who probed a kidnapping case against Saini had in July 2019 turned hostile and refused to support the prosecution case.Earlier, Justice Rajive Bhalla, a former Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, had appeared before the CBI Special Court as a prosecution witness. Justice Bhalla was counsel for Vinod -- one of the three missing men feared murdered, before his elevation to the Bench as an HC Judge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1994-kidnapping-case-will-ss-saini-get-exemption-from-appearance-in-cbi-special-court-138712

09-09-2020||Nonika Singh||Punjabiyat would reflect  in everything I do: Amritpal Singh Bindra||Ignorance may or may not be bliss… But often it can open doors to new learning and experiences. As happened with producer and writer Amritpal Singh Bindra. Prior to the making of Bandish Bandits he may have had no interest or inclination towards the sublime world of Hindustani classical music. But when he heard his friend Namit Das, son of ghazal singer Chandan Dass, share how his father had spent 19 years trying to understand a raga, he was clearly both flummoxed and awestruck.It not just set him thinking, but also became a Eureka moment for him and his director friend Anand Tiwari. Thus was born Bandish Bandits, the popular Amazon Prime show, which has millennials tapping to the beats of classical music. In the beginning when they pitched the subject to several platforms, the naysayer told them to look at other subjects like say Bollywood or other genres of music. But once Amazon Prime came on board, it was a smooth sail. Of course, challenges too were very many, and the biggest challenge that Bindra faced while writing this show was how to make it entertaining, how to ensure it reached out not just to Indian but international audiences without diluting the authentic strength and beauty of classical music.Not a cakewalkWriting a musical drama where music is the story anyway is no cake walk. Bindra shares how the musical pieces were written before they began shooting and nothing was left to chance. Of course, this is a lesson that Bindra, who acquired a postgraduate degree in Fine Arts from New York Film Academy and worked for biggies like Avatar and Chronicles of Narnia, had learnt from Hollywood. “The biggest takeaway for me has been the amount of prep they do before starting any project.”Indeed, things have begun to change closer home too where he asserts talent was never in dearth, only due diligence was not paid enough attention. “Now, of course we have reached a point where we are creating content, which is technologically advanced, subtle and nuanced.” This healthy change, he attributes to rise of social media thanks to which, “Lazy writing will be called out and so would plagiarism be.” But don’t the hyperactive netizens call out much that is totally uncalled for? He agrees that there is random hate floating too. But he would rather focus on positive criticism and takes all the feedback (for Bandish Bandits) seriously. The second season (you bet it is in the offing), would factor in much of it.Formidable teamBoth worked as assistant directors in Barfi; In 2013, Amritpal Singh Bindra and AnandTiwari formed Still and Still Media Collective. Dubbing their creative partnership as akin to husband and wife relationship, who disagree to agree on most counts, Bindra says, “Friends as business partners is an equation that works really well.”Unique storiesWith a solid background in the way west creates spectacles, having worked in the marketing department of Fox International Productions, can we expect majestic sci-fi escapades from him in near future? Bindra says, “More than genres, we are interested in telling unique stories and making value addition as storytellers with a difference. For us story dictates everything else.” This philosophy reflects in much of his work, be it web series such as Bang Baaja Baaraat, Official Chukyagiri or movies like Love Per Square Foot.Indians understanding of what a producer does might be limited, but much of the creative calls, he insists, are taken by the one who wears the producer’s hat.Up nextSoon he may don the director’s mantle too. A Punjabi story…we so hope? And this Punjabi who grew up in Mumbai and speaks Punjabi oh-so-fluently quips, “Punjabiyat would reflect in everything I do.” And not just a Punjabi film he is toying to make.By the way, among the many exciting projects he and Tiwari are working on is a deal they have clinched with Dharma Productions - a film on Indian spymaster RAW founder RameshwarNath Kao. Baiters on social media might be fulminating and spewing fire at Karan Johar, but Bindra is adamant, “The fact that is he is collaborating with rank outsiders speaks louder than trolls. In all our interactions with him, we have received due regard and respect.” Indeed, who can ignore talent and a mind that refuses to toe the line! Fresh and uncommon was not just the USP of Bandish Bandits, but everything Bindra has done and intends to do.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabiyat-would-reflect-in-everything-i-do-amritpal-singh-bindra-138602
09-09-2020||Avneet Kaur||Deewan Khana — An epitome of great revolutionary legacy Shaheed Bhagat Singh||Khatkar Kalan(Nawanshahr), September 8For over a century now, the ancestral home of Indian Socialist Revolutionary — Shaheed Bhagat Singh — is the pride of Khatkar Kalan in Nawanshahr.But a few people know that the house was built in 1858 by Bhagat Singh’s great-grandfather Fateh Singh, who named it ‘Deewan Khana’, as he would hold a durbar at the house to impart justice to the people of his village. Besides, he used to encourage people and tell them that governments may come and go, but their problems would find solutions if they earmark them jointly.As the country will be celebrating Bhagat Singh’s 113th birth anniversary on September 28, let’s all pledge to bring the change he dreamt of, and, instead of holding rallies, political events, we should follow his ideology in true spirit. Taking the message from this house, people should strengthen gram sabhas to plan the village. Bhagat Singh raised the slogans of Inquilab Zindabad and Samrajyavad Murdabad, but the country’s leaders and some parties were limiting his message, thereby restricting his ideology. – Prof Jagmohan Singh, Bhagat Singh’s Ludhiana-based nephewIt is said that after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the East India Company officials started suppressing people. So, to protect themselves, people took up arms. During the 1857 revolt, the British government requested Fateh Singh for help against the rebels, but he refused to oblige.“Since then, the house has been an epitome of great values and resistance to the colonial rule exhibited by the family,” said Prof Jagmohan Singh, Ludhiana-based nephew of Bhagat Singh.Prof Singh said it was after a great struggle that he managed to get the house converted into a protected monument in the 1980s, as many questioned the connection of Bhagat Singh with the house, claiming that he never visited the place. The truth is though Bhagat Singh was born and brought up in Faisalabad (now in Pakistan), he used to visit the house regularly, along with his grandfather Arjan Singh. He had many fond childhood memories associated with the house, Professor Singh said.Throwing light on his struggle to protect the house, Prof Jagmohan said: “While the portraits of Bhagat Singh have made their way to the offices of politicians, especially those from Punjab, who make a beeline to Khatkar Kalan village on every birth and death anniversary of Bhagat Singh or during elections, the martyr gets effaced from their memories in a matter of days.”A walk through the past...As per information, Bhagat Singh’s mother lived in this house till 1975, but it was in 1982, that the house was declared a monument under the Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964. After that the family handed over its responsibility to the government to preserve it as a national monument. But the legendary freedom fighter’s house was relatively ignored for a long time. Sources say it was first in 2005, when the chappar (sewer pond) found in front of Bhagat Singh’s house was converted into a memorial park, but the structure of the house was not touched and one of its walls remained in bad shape and the paint peeled off from its lower walls owing to dampness. Prof Jagmohan Singh said: “The Department of Archives/ Culture used to be mostly out of funds whenever they were approached for restoration. It was like we had to beg in front of the government for grants even though the house’s upkeep should have been its job.” It was only in 2015 that the Department of Cultural Affairs, Archaeology and Museums, for the first time, started restoring the house since it was handed over to it in 1984 by the family. Before that, the local panchayat used to take care of the house. The house was restored at a cost of Rs42 lakh by the state government, he said.Prof Jagmohan recalled that in 2017, when then Punjab Tourism Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu went to the village to take stock of the ongoing museum work at the village, he handed over a cheque for Rs2.5 lakh from his ministerial funds to then Deputy Commissioner Sonali Giri, in favour of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), as the state government miserably failed to clear the power bills of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s house and of the memorial park. “Such was the plight of the house and ignorance of the state government,” he said.Items on displayItems such as utensils, wooden boxes, a table, an almirah, some pictures, an old wooden bed with carving, a weighing machine, a charkha (spinning wheel), and a typewriter, which is said to be of historical importance and has links with the freedom fighter, have been put on display at the house.The house nowIt was in July 2015 that the state government hired a Chandigarh-based private firm to carry out the restoration work at the house in a way that it could attract more and more visitors.The restoration work was completed in 2016 and the roofs, which were in a dilapidated condition earlier, were removed and replaced with new ones keeping the original form. The walls of the rooms, kitchen have now been repaired with a special technique to strengthen these by restoring its historical value. The floors of the building were restored and its level has also been raised. Old doors and windows have been replaced with new ones. Special cabins for displaying the belongings of the martyr and his family have been made, so that these are not damaged by visitors by frequently touching it. The house has got a complete facelift and is one of the most visited places in Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/deewan-khana-%E2%80%94-an-epitome-of-great-revolutionary-legacy-shaheed-bhagat-singh-138353

Detailed judgments were not yet available.He now has the option to pursue his legal remedies by moving the Supreme Court or to surrender either in the court or before the police. The state, in the meantime, can initiate proceedings for declaring him a proclaimed offender. A Punjab Police team had last week conducted a raid at Saini's house in Chandigarh.Saini had filed the petition following the addition of murder charge (Section 302, IPC) to the case. Appearing before the Bench through videoconferencing, Saini’s counsel had argued that he was earlier granted bail in the same case when it was registered for abduction (Section 364, IPC). As such, he should be granted anticipatory bail on addition of Section 302 as it was the same case. He also pressed upon the fact that FIR registered by the CBI in 2008 for the same incident was set aside by the Supreme Court.Rebutting the arguments, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and special public prosecutor Sartej Singh Narula argued that the investigation was at its initial stage when the accused was granted bail for offence under Section 364. At that time, hardly any evidence was collected by the special investigation team. As of now, there was sufficient evidence on record for indictment of Saini in Multani’s custodial death.It was added his custodial interrogation was required to find out about police officials involved in illegal abduction, detention, torture, and disposal of Multani’s body.The Bench was also told about a triple murder case going on against Saini in Delhi. Even after his retirement, the CBI’s investigating officer had turned hostile. It was added Saini was also responsible for intimidating a sitting High Court judge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-dismisses-bail-petition-of-sumedh-saini-138485

The passage was closed on March 16 following the Covid-19 outbreak.A four-member Pakistani team had met Indian officials at the Zero Line last week to finalise the coordinates of both the bridges. The corridor, which is a 4.6-km thoroughfare stretching from Dera Baba Nanak to Kartarpur in Narowal district of Pakistan, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 9 last year. The corridor facilitated the movement of pilgrims who wanted to pay obeisance at the Kartarpur shrine where Guru Nanak Dev spent final years of his life.Sources said the Covid-19 pandemic had come as a blessing in disguise for the Indian authorities.“There were a lot of security concerns that Pakistani army and Inter-Services Intelligence would use the passage to execute their nefarious designs. Even Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta had expressed apprehensions. The MHA wanted a reason to shut down the operations and the pandemic came as a convenient excuse,” said a senior official. Officials said since the corridor also catered to devotees from outside Punjab, it would not be feasible to open it till rail and air services got back to normal.Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said he would urge the CM to talk to the MHA to find a way forward.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kartarpur-pilgrims-wait-likely-to-stretch-on-138334

These bogus firms are owned by personal assistants of Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon. Accusing Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of embezzling funds in connivance with some government officials, Harsimrat alleged the material was shown purchased from non-existent firms and payments to the tune of crores were made to them. These non-existent firms were owned by the personal assistants of Dhillon, she alleged.The entire payment to the material suppliers had been released based on estimates even for works that never started on the ground. Job cards were issued to ineligible persons, she alleged.Meanwhile, Dhillon refuted the allegations. “This is not the first time that the Badals are leveling such frivolous allegations. Earlier, Sukhbir Singh Badal had also made such complaints. Two high-level inquiries were conducted by the Union ministry, but no truth was found in the allegations,” he said.“Each time Sukhbir Singh Badal contested from this constituency, he promised to convert Faridkot into California. In reality, Sukhbir and Harsimrat are opposing brick-lining of streets in the district by asking the Union Ministry to stop funds under the MGNREGA,” Dhillon alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-orders-inquiry-into-misuse-of-mgnrega-funds-138335

It may, in alternative, file a closure report stating that no offence appears to have been committed in the opinion of the police. In case of a closure report, notice is issued to the complainant or the victim.He, in turn, can challenge the report and raise objections. The Magistrate is not obligated to accept the closure report and may deal with it in different ways, including order further investigation by cops.Taking up the petition against the State of Punjab and other respondents by Ravinder Kumar in one such matter, Justice Raj Mohan Singh observed Nabha Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate rejected the cancellation report and the matter was sent for further investigation vide order dated October 13, 2018, in a case alleging criminal breach of trust.Justice Raj Mohan Singh also took note of counsel Mansur Ali’s contention that the impugned order was totally non-speaking as the Court did not give reasons for the complainant’s dissatisfaction.“The complainant being an interested party would obviously not be satisfied with the cancellation report. Recital in the impugned order that the complainant was not satisfied, in my considered view cannot be the sole ground to discard the cancellation report....,” Justice Raj Mohan Singh added.Referring to the facts of the case in hand, the Bench added the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate did not elaborate upon the reasons for the complainant’s dissatisfaction except the allegation that the police did not consider the material aspects of an inquiry report in the petitioner’s favour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-discontent-with-cancellation-report-no-basis-for-further-probe-138338

Switzerland-based Proton Mail, a highly sophisticated cyber platform, has not shared any information with the police.An e-mail was sent to the then Vice-Chancellor, RK Kohli, wherein it was mentioned that the question bank used by the university to conduct online exams was hacked. The email was sent from ProtonMail, which is an end-to-end encrypted (identity of the sender is not revealed) and a paid email service. In the mail, a link was also given, which gave access to all the questions. The system was password enabled, but was compromised, after which the university cancelled 13 exams of various subjects.Bathinda Deputy Superintendent of Police Ashwant Singh, Investigating Officer, said, “Proton Mail has not shared details about the identity of the hacker, but we will talk to senior officials. We will try to get more details about it in coming days.”The police have asked the Proton Mail to share the information pertaining to the Internet Protocol (IP) address from where the email was sent, but so far it has failed to get any information.In the wake of Covid-19, for the convenience of students, the CUP had opted for online exams, but hackers sensed an opportunity and attacked the cyber security system of the university, used to conduct the examination, and accessed the question bank.Earlier, the university administration had zeroed on a group of around 10 students from a particular state who scored exceptionally well in the semester exams conducted on the first three days.CUP Registrar Kanwar Pal Singh Mundra could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cops-grope-in-dark-over-central-university-question-bank-hack-case-138339

The present hotspots in the state are likely to show signs of recovery even as new hotspots have started to emerge.Dr KK Talwar, Expert group headNot a seasonal fluThe only way out is to convince people to immediately get themselves tested once they show symptoms and not succumb to baseless rumours of organ harvesting or that the disease is a seasonal flu.“While Covid cases are showing signs of plateauing in Ludhiana and Amritsar, Bathinda, Ferozepur and Gurdaspur are emerging as the new hotspots in the state. As the mortality rate remains high, the only way out is to convince people to immediately get themselves tested once they show symptoms and not succumb to baseless rumours of organ harvesting or that the disease is a seasonal flu. As new hotspots emerge inthe state, aggressive testing will help the state combat the pandemic,” said Dr KK Talwar.Dr Talwar, who heads the Punjab Government’s expert group on Covid, said many lives could be saved if fear and rumour-mongering regarding the disease were stopped. “It is because of fear of being compulsorily taken for institutional quarantine and baseless rumours that people are coming for testing only at a much later stage of the infection. The fact that daily 70-80 patients become critical and require ventilator support shows they are approaching hospitals at an advanced stage of the infection. Punjab is a high-risk zone for Covid, mainly because the co-morbid conditions among the Punjabi population — diabetes, hypertension, cancer, obesity and renal ailments requiring frequent dialysis — are high,” he told The Tribune.He warned that this stage of high mortality could continue for another eight to 10 days, saying, “We are up against time. The state government has taken pro-active steps to remove the stigma associated with the viral infection by ordering that stickers would not be pasted outside houses and by giving relaxation in home isolation norms.”When asked about the basis for the earlier statement by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on over 80 per cent of the population getting infected by the disease, Dr Talwar said the response was based on a mathematical calculation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/getting-tested-early-key-to-reducing-fatalities-expert-138318

Also, ventilators provided to the hospital are lying unused.As per sources, three Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) and three Senior Medical Officers (SMOs) have been transferred for unknown reasons during the past three months, which has adversely impacted Covid management in this district.During the initial period, when the lockdown was imposed, Dr Navdeep Singh was posted as the CMO.

Later, Dr Sukhjiwan Kakkar was appointed for the post but he was reportedly transferred within eight days.Till date, 44 deaths have been reported due to Covid in the district and the cases are increasing with each passing day. Besides, hundreds of patients are suffering from other diseases like dengue, typhoid, malaria and other kinds of viral infections. In this scenario, the frequent changes have impacted the healthcare management adversely.Local businessman Inder Gupta, who was admitted to the Civil Hopital after he tested Covid-positive, said unhygienic and poor sanitary conditions, besides lack of housekeeping arrangements, posed a huge challenge for the patients. Even the food being served was not up to the mark. These portrayed a grim picture of healthcare facilities due to which the patients were reluctant to get admitted to the Civil Hospital. They were rather making a beeline outside private clinics and hospitals, he added.None of the three ventilators recently provided to the Civil Hospital are functional. A ventilator which was provided by one of the NGOs is lying abandoned without any care. Another two ventilators, provided by Ferozepur MP Sukhbir Singh Badal, have also not been put to use yet, reportedly due to unavailability of requisite manpower. Sunir Monga, a social worker, said it was unfortunate that the ventilator donated by their NGO was still not functioning. “We had collected money from our pockets to purchase the ventilator for the hospital. However, the entire efforts seem to have gone futile,” he added.Posts lying vacantOf the 31 sanctioned posts, nine posts of doctors, including a surgeon, an orthopaedic, two paediatricians and one anaesthesiologist, are lying vacant at the Civil Hospital while only 63 doctors are working against 106 sanctioned posts in other healthcare centres in the district. Four doctors have been reported Covid-positive to date besides staff nurses, paramedics and other health officials, who also have contracted the virus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/frequent-transfers-bane-of-healthcare-in-ferozepur-138321

It is these students who will be ready to serve the state in rural areas. Instead of subsidising medical education to make it within the reach of common man, the Congress government has increased fee in both government as well as private medical colleges.”The SAD leader said in case the government did not withdraw this unjustified hike, the shortage of doctors in the state would increase further. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/roll-back-mbbs-fee-hike-demands-sad-138323

Areas need to be identified where rumours are widespread. We have asked the state government to set up ‘rumour registries’ in every district,” he said. An investigation should be launched into every rumour, he added.The state has also been asked to use social organisations, such as Mahila Arogya Samitis, Village Health and Sanitation Committees, Panchyati Raj institutions and NGOs, to check rumours. Though the Chief Minister has asked all MLAs and ministers to counter rumour-mongering by political opponents, the team felt the problem could only be dealt by ensuring social participation in such efforts.The team recommended that strict legal action should be initiated against all those spreading falsehoods. The team has also asked the state to commission some studies to sociology departments of various universities to conduct in-depth studies on the social reasons behind rumours.The team has asked the state to focus on mental health issues of the infected population. Provisions in this regard were already there under the National Mental Health Programme, it said.Key recommendations||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rumours-derailed-covid-fight-in-punjab-central-team-138325

This could be a “game plan” of the Arvind Kejriwal's party, he said.Sidhu warned people that the party was "misleading" them “just as they had done in Delhi” where the Covid situation was “critical” with all 11 districts of the national capital among the country's 35 worst-affected areas. He said the Opposition party was promoting oximeters as a medicine while the fact was that it simply helped detect oxygen levels in a person's body. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/balbir-singh-sidhu-aap-plan-to-use-oximeters-may-spread-virus-138326
