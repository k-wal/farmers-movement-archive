08-09-2020||Saurabh Malik||No anticipatory bail for Sumedh Saini in Multani case||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 8The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday dismissed the anticipatory bail petition filed by Punjab’s former Director-General of Police Sumedh Singh Saini in three-decade-old Multani kidnapping and murder case.Justice Fateh Deep Singh also dismissed another petition filed by Saini for declaring the probe “non-est” and in violation of a Supreme Court judgment.Saini, for the time being, has no protection from the Court in the FIR registered against him in the case alleging illegal abduction, detention, torture and custodial death of Balwant Singh Multani in December 1991. He now has the option to pursue his legal remedies by moving the Supreme Court or to surrender either in the court or before the police.The state, in the meantime, can initiate proceedings for declaring him proclaimed offender (PO).    Saini had filed the petition following the addition of murder offence under Section 302 of the IPC to the case.Appearing before the Bench through videoconferencing, Saini’s counsel had primarily argued that he was earlier granted bail in the same case when it was registered for abduction under Section 364 of the IPC.As such, he should be granted anticipatory bail on the addition of Section 302 as it was the same case. He also pressed upon the fact that the FIR registered by the CBI in 2008 for the same incident was set aside by the Supreme Court.Rebutting the arguments, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and special public prosecutor S.S. Narula had argued the investigation was at its initial stage when the accused was granted bail for the offence under Section 364. At that time, hardly any evidence was collected by the special investigation team. As of now, there was sufficient evidence on record for indictment of Saini in Multani’s custodial death.It was added his custodial interrogation was required to find out about police officials involved in illegal abduction, detention, torture and disposal of Multani’s body.The Bench was also told about a triple murder case going on against Saini in Delhi. Even after his retirement, the CBI’s investigating officer had turned hostile. It was added Saini was also responsible for intimidating a sitting High Court judge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-anticipatory-bail-for-sumedh-saini-in-multani-case-138164
08-09-2020||Vishav Bharti||Facebook post on Shiv Batalvi’s love affair triggers debate||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 8A Facebook post about Shiv Kumar Batalvi’s alleged love affair with Anusuya Singh, writer-publisher Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari’s youngest daughter who passed away at Merida in Venezuela on Sunday, has triggered a debate. She was 84. A post made regarding alleged love affair between Anusuya and Shiv on Facebook page 'Kitab Trinjan' has opened several lesser-known pages from the poet’s life. Even during her last visit to India, Anusuya had visited Shiv Kumar’s family in Patiala.The social media post claimed that she was poet’s first love. “Anusuya had a love affair with Shiv Kumar, as claimed by the poet, and that her father did not approve of it. Though it has always been denied by some members of her family as more of a myth created by the poet.”Her family, however, stands divided over the narrative. Wife of Anusuya’s nephew, Poonam Singh who now is the editor of magazine ‘Preetlari’ denied that Gurbaksh Singh ever opposed the marriage between Shiv and Anusuya. “Anu had spoken to me at length about all things. The first point is that she (Anusuya) was asked by her father if she wished to marry Shiv, to which she said no. After that he told her that then she must go and study. Anu told me she could not see herself as a wife to him. She was not even twenty when her first husband committed suicide.”Poonam added till the last day that she could physically, she made it a point to look at a star she said was for Shiv, and in her last visit to India she asked us to accompany her to meet Shiv’s family which was then in Patiala. “She gave me all other details too about the passion, about which I shall only say in her defence that she was a passionate person. As many men can be too. Why a woman has to be punished for eternity and more? No, Shiv did not create a myth, but should have been more sporting perhaps... definitely he was hurt and felt sad.”Poonam wrote that Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari always stood by all his daughters. “Even the eldest confided something to myself... in an informal manner. He may not have wanted the eldest to get married to a Muslim and be parted from India... it may be true. But there were other things too. And Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari’s daughter Protima married a Hindu Bengali Communist and his daughter Urmila married Com Jagjit Singh Anand, also a love marriage and it was inter-caste.” Kitab Trinjan’s comment on Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari’s opposition to the affair, Sukirat Anand, nephew of Anusuya (her elder sister Urmila’s son), called that part tendentious at best, in fact “salacious in nature”.“She did not have a “passionate” affair with Shiv, it was more a myth created by Shiv. And I say this with some authority as in 2003 I had a long chat with her about it. I have no reason to doubt her version as she was always a frank person with Western sensibilities,” he said.Anand added that Anusuya’s first marriage was not arranged. She had a love marriage.Shiv’s son Meherban Batalvi, who is based in Canada, also rejected the story. While talking to The Tribune over phone, he confirmed that Anusuya had visited the family a few years back. “But she also said theories of her affair with my father were all people’s wild imagination,” he said.    Taught English in VenezuelaMost of her life, Anusuya taught English at Merida University in Venezuela. She was from the first batch of the Patrice Lumumba People's Friendship University of Russia (PFU) in 1960. The PFU was established in 1960 to provide higher education to Third World students. In university, she fell in love with Raul Jesus Estevez Laprea, who was then studying physics. In 1965, they moved to Venezuela. Both taught at Merida University.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/facebook-post-on-shiv-batalvis-love-affair-triggers-debate-138160

It was only his love for the cactus plants that took him to several exhibitions to procure various varieties of cactus.Uppal, a retired Guru Nanak Dev University employee, now boasts of having nearly 800 varieties of cactus and succulents in aloevera, sansevieria, caralluma, euphorbias milli of about 50 colours in his 150 yard terrace.The entrance of his house is also adorned with big thorny trees named pacypodium lamarie, which has beautiful white flowers which adds to the aesthetic beauty of his garden.“People are hesitant to keep these prickly cacti as they believe it brings misfortune in one’s life but they ignore the fact that the cactus pulp has many medicinal values as it stores water and provides oxygen round the clock,” he pointed out. The best part is they do not lose their strength and can survive in extreme conditions.“Scientifically, the cactus possesses more medicinal properties than other flora species as they release more oxygen than other plants as the pulp of cacti contains water with healing qualities,” he said. “However, owning these water efficient plants is an expensive affair,” he quips. A lot of cacti are sold at high prices and those who love plants are ready to buy them. It all started with only two cactus plants which he bought from a local nursery in 1992. “I used to plant flowers and other greens, but they demand so much care. It was difficult to take time out of my busy schedule at that time,” he said. He said later he started visiting some cactus collectors in Patiala and at Cactus Garden in Chandigarh which piqued his interest in the thorny plants.“I started collecting cacti in 1997. After developing an interest in succulents, I started visiting various cacti shows and exhibitions in Chandigarh, New Delhi, Panchkula and other places to gain more knowledge about thorny beauties,” he said. Every time he visits these exhibitions, he adds some more varieties to his terrace garden. He also runs two groups of social platform for selling and purchasing cacti.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/blooming-thorny-beauties-enhance-charm-of-his-garden-138145

Since he has been directly contacting the Prime Minister’s Office and taking decisions on this front, the further course of action will also come from him.The authorities of all universities are waiting for the state government to take a decision on this front. So far, no meeting has been called of Vice Chancellors of universities to take a final call on the modalities of the examination. The Supreme Court had given the universities three options to conduct the examination: Online mode, offline mode or blended form. The university officials are largely in favour of the online mode so as to wind up the process fast and announce the result at the earliest.Vice Chancellor of IK Gujral Punjab Technical University Ajay Sharma said, “We are expecting a meeting with the Technical Education Minister to decide the process of holding the final-year examination. We had earlier conducted a survey taking feedback from students regarding their choice for modality of examination. Now, we are in the process of getting it conducted afresh.”“We have so far received no communication from Guru Nanak Dev University on how to go about the examination for final-year students. I personally feel it is very difficult to take examination in this situation when our students are scattered across Punjab and even in other states,” said Dr Atima Sharma, Principal, KMV College. Examination controller of GNDU Manoj Kumar said, “We will follow whatever guidelines we get from the state government.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/modalities-for-final-year-exams-yet-to-be-decided-by-punjab-govt-137828

Under the pilot project, the water recharge system has already been operationalised successfully at Chanauli village in the Nurpur Bedi block, which has been notified as an overexploited zone by the Central Ground Water Board.Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Deepshikha Sharma said the rooftop area of the school building was 1,580 square meter, and over 10 lake litre of water would be saved with this initiative.The ADC said given the over-exploitation of groundwater in the zone, it was necessary to take measures so that there was no more depletion in the groundwater level. It was planned that all government school buildings would be used to set up water harvesting projects. This would also percolate the habit of saving water into the minds of youth, she said.After covering all 58 schools in the Nurpur Bedi block, the project would also be started in Morinda and Chamkaur Sahib blocks, where the groundwater level had been depleting fast, she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ropar-schools-to-have-rainwater-harvesting-system-137820

The samples of the seed were sent from Gurdaspur and Ajnala areas. The major reason for non-performance of this high-yielding variety is that the seed used in the state is not pure,” Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said.The CO-238 variety of sugarcane is considered to be high-yielding and grown on almost 50 per cent of the area under cane cultivation in Punjab.He said the same variety in areas of Western UP and Haryana was giving an average yield of 356-370 quintals per acre whereas in Punjab, having similar soil and climatic conditions, it was 40 quintals per acre.Shivrajpal Singh Dhaliwal, sugarcane incharge, Sugarfed, said the reason for impure variety in state was its late recommendation in 2014-15, though it was cleared for cultivation in other states in 2009.“For this season, around 20 lakh seed samplings of pure varieties have been distributed to farmers. We will introduce single-bud technique cultivation this year onwards to increase yield,” said Randhawa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/seed-programme-for-better-cane-yield-137823

Contrary to this, we have a flying squad report which says five ‘saroops’ were burnt in fire and nine were damaged due water sprinkled to douse the flames. The unauthorised printing was being done on verbal orders of deputy secretary Gurbachan Singh, without intimating the higher authorities. He was also held guilty of issuing forged receipts and orders, as stated in the report on the basis of which he was sacked by the SGPC executive committee on August 27.The probe panel discovered that earlier, unrecorded 61 ‘saroops’ were prepared with the same modus operandi on his orders, as confirmed by binders Kulwant Singh and Jaspreet Singh.Close to his retirement, Kanwaljit Singh, the assistant supervisor of the SGPC publication department, had disclosed the disappearance of ‘saroops’ from the records.SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta said Kanwaljit had drafted an official note on February 20, stating 80 ‘saroops’ were damaged in the fire that occurred in May 2016, and got it endorsed from former chief secretary Dr Roop Singh and a secretary so that these could be adjusted in the record. “The exercise was devised to cover up the discrepancy in records but could not fructify due to lockdown restrictions,” Mehta said.Kanwaljit could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lockdown-helped-unravel-missing-saroops-mystery-137824

The Bench has given the state counsel 10 days to get the ground shifted.The direction came after the state counsel assured the Bench he would talk to the respondents and make sure the ground was shifted and the carcasses were cleared. He also undertook before the court the filing of a “positive report” within 10 days.Taking up the petition filed against the state and other respondents by Gurpreet Singh through counsel Manish Kumar Singla, the Bench asserted the plea and the photographs clearly disclosed the pathetic condition under which the residents were living. The record also indicated that representations were sent to the respondents and even the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in July 2019.The Bench said it was unable to understand how the pollution control board, the DC and other respondents could be so heartless to the situation, particularly when the ground was said to adjacent to a school where children would go for studies.

Special relaxation had been given by the Finance Department to enable colleges to hire other manpower, he said.The Chief Minister also directed formation of DC-led committees for distribution of food packets to poor families under home isolation or quarantine, in order to encourage testing, as such families generally refrained from getting themselves tested for Covid for the fear of losing their meagre earnings.In other measures, it has been decided that government hospitals will now permit serious Covid patients with special dietary requirements to have home-made food, if they wish so. To alleviate the psychological stress of serious patients in isolation in hospitals, and of their family members, the government will provide some equipment in these wards to enable video calls between patients and their attendants. Further, the Chief Minister has directed all government labs to start providing the Cycle Threshhold (CT) value of an RT-PCR test as it can give useful information to the doctors treating a Covid patient.To ensure regular monitoring of Covid patients in home isolation, especially those above 40 years of age, Capt Amarinder told the Health Department to put in place a system of ensuring their clinical progress to check sudden deterioration. Covid patient tracking officers had been appointed in each district to ensure such patients received due care, he said.Expressing concern over the delayed testing, whichwas leading to an increase in fatalities, the Chief Minister urged the departments to aggressively reach out to people to go for testing at the first sign of symptoms and not indulge in false bravado.Book rumour-mongers: CM to DGPCapt Amarinder Singh directed DGP Dinkar Gupta to crack down on rumour-mongers and web channels spreading misinformation on Covid.

Saini, for the time being, has no protection from the court in the FIR registered against him on the allegations of illegal abduction, detention, torture and custodial death of Balwant Singh Multani in December 1991.The bail petition was filed following the addition of murder offence under Section 302 of the IPC to the case. Appearing before the Bench through video-conferencing on Saini’s behalf, senior advocate APS Deol and HS Deol primarily argued that he was earlier granted bail in the same case when it was registered for abduction under Section 364 of the IPC. As such, he should be granted anticipatory bail on the addition of Section 302 as it was the same case. He also pressed upon the fact that the FIR registered by the CBI in 2008 for the same incident was set aside by the Supreme Court.Rebutting the arguments, special public prosecutor SS Narula and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra argued that the investigation was at its initial stage when the accused was granted bail for the offence under Section 364. At that time, hardly any evidence was collected by the special investigation team. As of now, there was sufficient evidence on record for the indictment of Saini in Multani’s custodial death.Narula said his custodial interrogation was required to find out about the police officials involved in the illegal abduction, detention, torture, and disposal of Multani’s body. The Bench was also told about a triple murder case going on against Saini in Delhi. Even after his retirement, the CBI’s investigating officer had turned hostile. It was added that Saini was also responsible for intimidating a sitting High Court judge.After hearing arguments for more than four hours, Justice Fateh Deep Singh reserved the verdict, while fixing the case for Tuesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-relief-for-punjab-ex-dgp-sumedh-saini-hc-reserves-verdict-138077

Dhaliwal was then the Director, Social Welfare.Wait for probeWe should wait for the probe being conducted by a committee constituted under Chief Secy. Whatever I had done was right. —Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, Phagwara MLAThe payment was released in September 2019 on the basis of tampered signatures of another IAS officer, Devinder Singh, who replaced Dhaliwal on August 30, 2019, months after the re-audit was announced by Dhaliwal.In May 2018, a special audit of the funds disbursed during the previous SAD-BJP government (2012-2017), conducted by the Finance Department (FD) on the instructions of the Council of Ministers, had reported a recovery of Rs 8.53 crore from the erring institutions.Subsequently, the SWD conducted the re-audit of 14 institutions on the basis of an internal note signed on July 2, 2019, by Dhaliwal, Deputy Director Parminder Gill and other sub-ordinate staff. A scrutiny of documents suggests on April 16, 2019, FD’s instructions to the SWD to conduct an audit of only those institutions that had been left out in its special audit were “misconstrued” to allegedly benefit the institutions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mla-balwinder-singh-dhaliwal-under-lens-in-scholarship-scam-138083

As per records, 55 per cent of Covid deaths at Government Rajindra Hospital, which caters to 10 districts of the state, took place within 48 hours of admission of patients.Experts are attributing this to the delay in providing tertiary healthcare and ICU facilities to the patients. There are only three government-run tertiary care hospitals in the state. Of the 348 Covid deaths at the hospital till Saturday, 40 per cent had taken place within 24 hours of admission, while 55 per cent of patients had died within 48 hours of admission. Most of the patients were referrals, whose SPO2 levels were alarming, said the hospital authorities. A doctor said: “Dialysis of Covid patients is available at the Rajindra hospital only. Even patients from Ferozepur district are referred here, which is at a distance of 200 km from Ferozepur.”Surbhi Malik, IAS and incharge of the Covid ward at the hospital, said many patients were declared brought dead when they reached the hospital. This led to a spike in the number of Covid deaths. “Sometimes, it is clinically impossible to save patients when their oxygen levels are critically low. Also, despite having the best facilities and doctors, there is a spike in the number of deaths, because of the delay in admission of patients,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/at-rajindra-hospital-patiala-55-deaths-within-48-hrs-of-admission-137816
