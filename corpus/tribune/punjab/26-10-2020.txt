However, the Railways decided to extend its suspension of goods train operations in the state, saying protesting farmers are still blocking the tracks.In a letter on Monday, Goyal said sporadic obstruction of tracks was still continuing at many places, especially around Amritsar and outside the power plants at Naba and Talwandi Sabo, and also outside the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) silo at Moga.“Petroleum and container rakes are not being allowed. Railway drivers need to have confidence and security to operate freely. Indian Railways started freight trains and started moving empty coaching rakes to maintenance depots for maintenance on October 22 and 23 after an assurance was given by the local police that dharna has been lifted,” he said.The rail minister further said some of the freight trains and empty coaching rakes were obstructed again on October 23 after which railway drivers and guards refused to operate trains in Punjab unless they are assured that trains will not be obstructed.“They are apprehensive that there may be some incidents of run over people obstructing the trains. They are asking for assurance from the state government that all train movements (freight and passenger) will be allowed without any obstruction and necessary security will be provided by the state,” Goyal said.Farmer bodies in Punjab had decided to ease their ‘rail roko’ agitation, allowing the movement of goods trains keeping in mind the shortage of coal and diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser.Several industry bodies had also complained about not receiving their inputs due to the agitation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rail-minister-seeks-punjab-govts-assurance-of-train-crew-members-safety-to-restore-freight-services-161475

Besides this, processing units, which include those for processing coarse grains, fruits, vegetables and oil seeds, are also coming up at the mega food park,” she said.Stating that a large part of the Ssate would be benefitted by the initiation of maize processing in Punjab, Badal said the mega food park had also established three primary processing centres at Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar and Amritsar. She said these centres would create a readymade market for maize farmers.“The processing center at Hoshiarpur is ready while those at Amritsar and Jalandhar, which also have cold storage facilities besides dry warehousing and grading yards, are set to be completed soon. This will reduce wastages severely and ensure optimum value to farmers for their maize crop,” she said.The former minister said Sukhjit mega Food Park was among the three mega projects including one at Fazilka and Ludhiana, which she had been facilitated by the food processing ministry during her tenure. She said the ministry had given a grant of Rs 47 crore for the Phagwara Park besides obtaining various approvals on its behalf from State and central agencies.The Bathinda MP said Punjab had received an investment of Rs 1,200 crore in the food processing sector during her tenure in the food processing ministry which would benefit 1.25 lakh farmers besides giving employment to 40,000 people.She said these initiatives had resulted in attracting private investment of Rs 800 crore through 41 projects including 19 cold chains, seven food testing laboratories, three clusters, four food processing units and four backward-forward linkage projects.“A grant of Rs 400 crore was given for these projects,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/harsimrat-kaur-badal-says-start-of-third-maize-based-mega-food-park-to-help-farmers-and-encourage-diversification-161414

In fact, they had all appreciated the Governor’s willingness to meet them at such short notice to accept their memorandum and copy of the resolution passed in the Assembly against the Farm Laws, he added. “The reason for Bir Devinder’s unhappiness over the same is not only inexplicable but indicates his desperation to hog the media limelight in any manner whatsoever,” said Amarinder.The Chief Minister pointed out that Governor VPS Badnore has always been patient and available to hear out all legislators and ministers, and has been meeting them even during these scary times. Instead of appreciating that, Bir Devinder was exploiting the prevailing situation to score political brownie points, he said, terming the former deputy Speaker’s comments as regrettable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinder-flays-bir-devinder-singhs-criticism-of-governor-as-unwarranted-161412

It is 100 times more biodiverse and completely free from chemical fertilisers. It is also cost-effective and easy to maintain.The methodology adopted for growing the sacred forests is the Miyawaki rapid afforestation technique pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki.“The method helps build dense and native indigenous forests. It involves planting dozens of native indigenous species in the same area and the forest becomes maintenance-free after the first three years,” explains EcoSikh project manager (South Asia) Ravneet Singh.The procedure for developing the sacred forests is simple. A fenced plot suitable for plantation with underground and overhead clearance is selected. The soil is tested for its capacity of water retention, perforation and organic content. Required biomass is chosen and mixed to stabilise all above parameters. Thus, the forest bed is carefully prepared. The land is levelled. Indigenous plants native to the region are precisely quantified and procured. They are distributed and planted following a layered structure according to the Miyawaki method.The entire forest is provided a support system, security from animals, and additionally the forest bed is heavily mulched which helps to regulate soil temperature and survival of micro-organisms and small creatures in the soil.Experts associated with eco-forests claim that every land can be turned into a forest. As Ravneet Singh says: “Like human beings, trees also show a remarkable resilience which we noticed when the forest cultivated at a low-lying industrial area in Ludhiana survived despite waterlogging and heavy contamination with oil spills. Though we were apprehensive that the major chunk of the forest would be lost, it came as a huge surprise that 80 per cent of the forest trees survived!”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ecosikhs-guru-nanak-sacred-forests-a-reason-to-cheer-for-ludhiana-district-161221

26-10-2020||Rajmeet Singh||Legislative lacunae||GAUGING the unrest among farmers, Punjab has taken the legislative route to pass amendments to the Central laws, throwing the ball in the BJP’s court. The amendments seek to secure the MSP and initiate criminal action against those buying the crop below the MSP, besides provisions against hoarding of foodgrains, even though it is the Centre that procures grains and pays for the produce at the MSP.Political analysts and agriculture experts say the amendments are based on apprehensions that the Centre is shying away from procurement and could eventually dismantle the MSP regime. The state government has tried to address the concerns of the farmers by tabling the Bills in the Assembly. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has even threatened to knock at the door of the Supreme Court if the President refuses to give his assent.No sooner were the amendments passed during the recent House session that Congress leaders and spin doctors were out in the field, setting the agenda for the 2022 Assembly polls.Every major political party in Punjab, be it the ruling Congress or the opposition Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party, is trying to reach out to the huge vote bank of farmers. In the run-up to the 2017 Assembly polls, the Congress had promised a major loan waiver scheme to woo farmers. This poll sop had paid dividends to the party.The BJP, the ruling party at the Centre, has launched a series of schemes for farmers in recent years, including Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), but the 2020 laws — initially promulgated as ordinances —have put the party on a sticky wicket. It is a moot point what the farmers would gain from this tussle between the state and the Centre.A political analyst, Prof Pramod Kumar, Director, Institute for Development and Communication, says the main issues of the Centre procuring the foodgrains and giving the MSP have not been addressed in the state amendment Bills. Instead, the state should have passed a resolution seeking a written commitment from the Centre to address both issues.“The basic question is: who is going to procure the foodgrains? If the Centre doesn’t procure at all or procures partially, will the state do the needful? If the Centre fixes the MSP at less than the cost of production, will the state fix its own MSP and procure the produce? If neither the state nor the Centre fully procures, then who will procure? If the Centre says that it will procure as per its Acts, will the state government debar it from procurement,” asks Kumar.What the Bills offerThe Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill: No sale of paddy and wheat in Punjab will be valid unless the payment is equal to or above the MSP. Those buying at less than MSP will be liable for punishment of three years and a fine.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill: Makes it mandatory for those entering into contract farming with farmers to pay the MSP or above. Punishment of three years and fine if the law is violated.The Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Punjab Amendment) Bill: Keeps all powers to fix stock limits of foodgrains with state. Rejects the Centre’s powers to fix stock limits. The Bill aims to protect the consumers from hoarding and black marketing of agricultural produce to secure and protect the interests and livelihood of farmers and farm labourers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/legislative-lacunae-161259
26-10-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Punjab’s Farm Bills: Farmers in for the long haul||THE passage of the farm Bills by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha last week witnessed rare — though short-lived — unanimity between ruling and opposition parties. The Bills, many experts fear, may not be legally tenable, but the fact that various political parties together opposed the Centre’s laws is a significant development.Gian Singh, an eminent agro economist who has studied farm suicides caused by high rural indebtedness in the state, says just like Punjab ushered in the Green Revolution and made the country food-surplus, the state has now taken the lead in confronting the Centre over laws aimed at corporatising agriculture. “Other non-BJP-ruled states are looking to emulate Punjab’s Bills,” he adds.The passage of these Bills seems to have placated the farmers, who had been protesting for a month or so, for the time being. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), says they are aware that the Bills are unlikely to offer them protection against the Central laws.“Our agitation has got a big boost with the entire House (except two BJP MLAs) supporting the amendments to the Centre’s laws. It emboldens us to take on the Centre at the national level,” he adds.The state government maintains that agriculture, Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) and land are state subjects under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, and states have the powers to frame laws and make related policies. Some officials, however, admit that the Central laws would be in force in the state till the time the Bills passed by the Punjab Assembly are cleared by the Union Home Ministry and sent for the President’s assent. They are apprehensive that the Bills may not be granted approval. “The ideal thing would have been to amend the APMC Act, and declare the entire area of the state as a primary market yard. The Central laws are applicable only outside the area of an APMC,” says a senior officer on the condition of anonymity.The Union Government can frame laws to control the production, supply and distribution of agricultural products. Thus, this aspect of trade of commodities falls in the Concurrent list, and the Centre has framed its Acts on this basis. In this light, it is yet to be seen if the Bills passed by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha can stand legal scrutiny, being in direct conflict with the Central laws.Eminent food policy expert Devinder Sharma says the most important difference between Punjab’s Bills and the Centre’s Acts is that the former keep the mandis relevant and recognise MSP as a right of the farmers.Another dimension of the Bills is that these will dissuade private players from entering Punjab. Already, private participation in foodgrain procurement in the state is less than 1 per cent. By passing Bills that make buying of foodgrains at rates lower than MSP a punishable offence, inviting fine and a three-year prison term, the state is virtually shutting the door on private players. Already, big corporate houses prefer buying grains from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh because of the high tax rates in Punjab. Only horticultural crops and cotton see some private participation. With MP and UP implementing the Central laws and imposing minimal taxes on the purchase of agricultural produce, the corporates could shun Punjab.Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary, BKU (Dakaunda), however, feels that is a distant possibility. “The success of our struggle now, to stop corporatisation of agriculture, will ensure that the Centre does not shun the purchase of crops. Buying crops and maintaining adequate food stocks are needed for the nation’s food security and we hope better sense prevails on the policy-makers. The system of buying grains from farmers has continued for decades; it sustains agriculture here. In a welfare nation, this cannot be stopped. That is why indications to this effect are meeting with stiff resistance from not only farmers, but also from all sections of society in the agrarian states,” he adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabs-farm-bills-farmers-in-for-the-long-haul-161253

Recent evidence shows that over the nearly three decades, there has been a gradual increase in the use of permanent methods of family planning among couples with only daughters.The proportion of couples with only two daughters who accepted sterilisation more than doubled from 16% in National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-1 (1992-1993) to 33.6% in NFHS-4 (2015-2016).Among couples with only three daughters, the proportion on sterilisation rose from 20% to 34%.New trends found by researchers from the International Institute of Population Sciences indicate that while son’s preferences still dominate, the previous rigidity around the mindset is waning even in high son preference states of Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra.“The rise in the percentage of married couples having only daughters and yet adopting permanent methods of family planning has increased indicating reduced historical aversion to daughters-only families and weakening patriarchal norms,” say researchers who, apart from looking at national data, also studied district health statistics for three high son preference states of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and three low son preference states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Results show that the proportion of currently married couples with only one child (daughter) who adopted sterilization between two rounds of district survey rose from 1.5% to 3.1% in Punjab, 0.7% to 5.1% in Haryana and 5.4% to 10.3% in Maharashtra.Corresponding rise for couples with two children (daughters) rose from 4.7 to 7.9% in Punjab; 2.9 to 9.9% in Haryana and 25 to 36% in Maharashtra; and three daughters rose from 8.8 to 13.1% in Punjab; 4.6 to 13.1% in Haryana and 36.4 to 47.6% in Maharashtra.Among couples who have either sterilised or do not want more children with only one daughter, the increase (among high son preference states) has been the largest for Haryana (20%) followed by Maharashtra (10%) and Punjab (8%).In Punjab, 21 per cent currently married couples with one daughter have either sterilised or do not want more children. Gurdaspur, Kapurthala top in PunjabPanchkula best in Haryana||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/acceptance-for-daughters-growing-shows-survey-161200

If they are aggrieved by the farm legislations, each and every section of society ought to stand by them,” he said.BKU (Kadian) chief Harmeet Singh Kadian condemned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not budging from his stance and listening to farmers. “Modi’s statement that he would neither withdraw nor amend any of the three farm Acts smacks of arrogance while also being undemocratic in nature,” said Kadian, adding that in the wake of fierce opposition by farmers to the Acts, the government must discuss the same across the table.Meanwhile, BKU (Lakhowal) leaders Gurwinder Singh Koom Kalan and Harinder Singh Lakhowal have slammed BJP president JP Nadda who had termed the ongoing agitation (by farers) as a protest of arhtiyas and middlemen. In a joint statement, the BKU leaders said Nadda had rubbed salt into the wounds of farmers by rubbishing their widespread agitation against Acts. They said the farmers across the nation stood united.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhiana-residents-march-for-farmers-161103

The announcement of the boycott has been made in protest against millers being stopped from doing inter-state trade of paddy. Their trucks of paddy purchased from other states were returned resulting in huge financial losses to them.The decision was taken in a meeting of the Rice Millers and Exporters’ Association held in Jalalabad on Saturday. The millers have also written a letter to CM Capt Amarinder Singh demanding smooth trade of paddy. They also condemned the FIRs registered against the millers for bringing paddy from other states.Rice miller and exporter Kapil Gumber said he had purchased eight trucks of paddy from Haryana and UP. The trucks remained stranded at different locations during the farmers’ agitation. He alleged the trucks were returned by the administration resulting in huge losses to him.“The millers are legally allowed to buy basmati from other states as it is exported after shelling.

He said with the enactment of the “draconian” laws, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) could not be pressed to lift the produce, which would make the minmum support price (MSP) and mandis redundant.Akalis rake up 2018 Dasehra tragedyPointing out the scarcity of government food storage silos in Punjab, he recommended that the state government should establish cold storage units to cater to rural belts. The Congress’ firebrand leader said if the Centre failed to offer the MSP, the state government should come to the rescue of farmers.He recommended that the state government should form a ‘farm model’ based on the demand and supply in the state. “The state should adopt a ‘cooperative’ programme to counter the Centre’s ‘corporate’ culture. Of the 23 crops, the MSP is offered just on paddy and wheat. That’s the reason the farmers opt for these two crops only. Why not make farming of pulses, sugarcane, vegetables and fruits profitable. The state government can make it possible by constituting cooperatives by roping in farmers,” he said.He said if crop diversification was made lucrative, Punjab would not have to import vegetables, fruits and pulses from other states. He said this step would also help to prevent depletion of water table as the paddy and wheat require a lot of water for irrigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/counter-corporate-culture-with-cooperatives-navjot-sidhu-161105

He alleged armed with ‘kirpans’ and sticks, the activists attacked the staff members, including a ‘dharmi fauji’.Those booked under Sections 307, 452, 148 and 149 of the IPC included Sukhjit Singh Khosa, Dilbagh Singh, Manjit Singh Jhabbal , Baljit Singh Muchhal, Manjit Kaur, Lakhbir Singh and 50 others.These are the members of various Sikh outfits, including the Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee. They have been staging a sit-in outside the hall since September 14.Terming it a ‘biased’ action, Balbir Singh Muchchal, head of the satkar committee, said the SGPC management had manipulated the clash episode in its favour but they would continue to ask questions over the missing ‘saroops’.“The police took no time to file an FIR against us and never bothered to reach out to our members who are lying injured in the hospital,” Muchchal said.Longowal, however, alleged some activists attempted to disrupt the traditional ‘maryada’ of the Golden Temple, loitered in the shrine complex in an inebriated condition and locked the entrance gates of the hall.Meanwhile, AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan visited the injured members of the satkar committee. “The Akal Takht Jathedar must take strict action against the culprits,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/day-after-clash-sgpc-gets-over-50-sikh-activists-booked-161106

Stating this here today, SAD former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said national leaders would be contacted in this regard in the first week of next month. Chandumajra, who reached here to participate in the jor mela held by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on the occasion of Dasehra, said the recent actions of the Centre indicated the country’s federal system was being damaged and it was heading towards centralisation of powers. In the past 72 years, several attempts had been made to dilute the powers of states, and goods and services tax (GST), new education policy and farm laws were yet another attempt in that direction, he added. On the SAD’s future strategy over farm laws, Chandumajra said his party was ready to make any sacrifice. He reiterated the SAD’s demand to bring the entire state under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act to negate the effects of the laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-plans-inter-party-conclave-on-federalism-161107

Besides onions and potatoes, a surge in the prices of all other green vegetables have created problems for the residents.Many farmers, who sold their potatoes and onions at lower rates, are now compelled to purchase the same crop at higher rates.“Everyone has already been grappling with the financial implications of the Covid-19 pandemic and now the steep rise in the prices of vegetables has multiplied the woes of residents,” said Savita, a local.Announce financial help: farmers’ bodyThe rate of potato has climbed to Rs 50 per kg, onions Rs 75 per kg, tomato Rs 50 per kg, cauliflower Rs 70 per kg, brinjal Rs 60 to 70, carrot Rs 80 to 100 per kg and peas at Rs 120 per kg.“Earlier, due to the lack of storage facility, we sold potatoes at the rate of Rs 12-14 per kg, however, now we are buying the same at the rate of Rs 50. It’s happening because the government has not been helping farmers by providing them with proper marketing and storage facilities,” said Nirbhai Singh, a farmer.Vegetable growers said there might be a further spike in the prices, as new crop would start coming after 15 to 20 days. Besides, many of the growers suffered huge losses as their produce rot in fields in the absence of transportation arrangement by the government. As a result, some of them had switched gears to earn livelihood.“The state government should announce financial assistance for the vegetable growers to ensure adequate supply of vegetables to residents,” said Mehmood Akhtar Shad, president, Farmers’ Federation, Malerkotla.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/veggie-prices-likely-to-shoot-further-161109

Dr Balwinder Singh, Chief Agriculture Officer of Moga and Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer, said the system-fitted harvesting machine could chop and spread the straw coming out of the rear of the combine harvester evenly for uniform straw load in the fields. This also helped in crop emergence and establishment, they said. The use of the system on combine harvesters was made mandatory by the Punjab Government in January 2017. The Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has licensed this technology to around 120 manufacturers.

The family had claimed it was a terror attack as they were on the hit list of various Sikh militant organisations for fending off attacks during the heyday of terrorism in Punjab.However, sources in the Tarn Taran police said the investigations so far did not support their claims.

Balwinder’s son Arshdeep Singh was among the 10 youths arrested by the Patti police on July 3 for possessing arms.The police claimed Balwinder’s security was withdrawn after he allegedly attacked a block development officer in 2013.Balwinder, his wife Jagdish Kaur, his elder brother Ranjit and his wife Balraj Kaur had received the Shaurya Chakra in 1993 for valour while fighting terrorism.Balwinder’s wife had claimed her husband was on the hit list of terrorists, but even after repeated requests, the police failed to restore their security.Intel lapse led to murder: BittaAnti-Terrorist Front (ATF) president Maninderjit Singh Bitta has expressed concern that even after 10 days of the murder of Balwinder Singh, no breakthrough had been made in the case.

The scholars and senators of the university, including Ashok Goyal, Anu Chatrath, Rajesh Gill, Keshav Malhotra, Rabinder Nath Sharma, Ronki Ram and Harpreet Singh Dua, said the UT administration’s decision to postpone the elections in view of Covid-19 was based on an “erroneous and factually incorrect” recommendation of the UT SSP and Director, Health Services, Chandigarh.Notably, the SSP had said a large number of voters from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Maharashtra who were members of faculties would arrive in Chandigarh to cast their votes.The scholars said no one would come from Maharashtra, Rajasthan or Haryana to vote in the faculty elections. “Besides three members from Delhi, and a few from Punjab, all others who will be participating in the voting process are from the tricity,” they said. “The reasoning is unfounded also due to the fact that hundreds of people are coming to Chandigarh daily by flights, trains and roads, not only from different corners of the country but also from abroad. All restrictions on inter-state movement have also been lifted now under Unlock 5,” they said.

With teachers taking their unutilised leave together in November and December, there is a loss of study in the most crucial time for the students, who have to make preparations for the annual exams, reads the letter by the Director, School Education Department “The teachers should be asked to desist from availing more than two CLs each in November and December,” the Director wrote. While a woman teacher can avail maximum 20 CLs in a year, a male teacher with 10-year service can take up to 10 days of leave per year. For the male teachers with 10-20 years of service, 15 CLs can be taken while after the completion of 20 years of service, 20 CLs can be taken. Some teachers said the letter had caused discontent among them. As November and December have many festivals and weddings, many employees save their leave with the motive of utilising these for attending functions in their families.
