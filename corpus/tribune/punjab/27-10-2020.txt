27-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Punjab farm laws: Instead of protecting farmers, they will limit their competitiveness, Centre’s assessment||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27Instead of protecting farmers, Punjab farm bills “limit their competitiveness, disincentivise investment by the private sector in the state and hinder overall development of the agriculture sector", says an assessment by the Centre of counter-laws passed by the State Assembly last week.Pointing to "multiple contradictions" in Punjab's laws, including on the MSP,  it says the three Central Acts passed by the Parliament aim at providing “freedom and more choices to the farmers” through a “national framework for agreements and options of trade and commerce outside state-regulated markets in addition to existing choice of sale through state-regulated markets and under MSP”.However, “provisions in Punjab Bills are in contradiction to the Central Acts and defeat the very objective. They claim to have been passed to protect farmers but in reality do the opposite due to ambiguity and conflicting clauses".Further, the bills suggest implementation of the Central Acts will depend on the notification in the Official Gazette by the state government even when the Central Acts are already in force. "Such a change in date of implementation of Central Acts with a retrospective effect is completely unlawful," it adds.There is a clause in the Punjab law suggesting that no sale or purchase of wheat and paddy will be valid unless the price paid is equal to or greater than the MSP announced by the Central government whereas the Central Acts do not deal with MSP at all, it says.“Central Act provides for mutual agreement on the price between the buyer and the seller based on market forces and independent of MSP.“The intent behind the Central Acts is to ensure that farmers have a greater choice in the agreements they enter into and can mutually finalise prices with buyers based on quality, variety, etc., in addition to continued access to MSP procurement by the government.“Besides there is low probability that farmer agreements will be entered into for standard varieties of wheat and paddy, and hence there is no relevance of this addition by the state government,” it adds. Besides, clauses like “punitive action against buyer who pressurises a farmer to sell below MSP will create confusion among buyers and farmers regarding the crop below FAQ and not fit for procurement on MSP”.“Such provisions will lead to reduced competitiveness among Punjab farmers in comparison to other states.”Adding “any other situation” to the list of exceptional circumstances in the Essential Commodities Act "will lead to unlimited regulatory power in the hands of the state government”.

All Over India, farmers will protest before government offices, including central, and offices of BJP leaders and their allies as well corporates,” leaders said.

27-10-2020||---||Sukhbir Badal blasts move for reduction in states’ share in revenue pool||Chandigarh, October 27Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday lashed out at the Centre’s proposed move to further slash states’ share in the Divisible Pool of Revenue, a press release by the SAD read.Badal reiterated his party’s demand that the states’ share in this pool must be raised to 50 per cent “at the very least”.The Akali leader also called for a national initiative to protect the federal structure of the country.“Time has a come for a nationwide awareness and movement for securing greater fiscal autonomy for all states. This is the only long-term solution to the Centre’s growing hegemony, which in fact is working against our national interest.”He said the Shiromani Akali Dal had always been a votary of more powers to the states and has made huge sacrifices for this cause. “Strong states mean a strong India, just as strong limbs mean a strong body. You cannot weaken legs and arms or heart and lungs and still claim that the body as a whole would remain strong. Those at the helm at the Centre need to understand this,” he stressed.Badal also stressed the need for revisiting the formulae for the horizontal allocation of funds among various states.“It is unfortunate that the federal structure of the country has been under constant attacks from successive governments at the Centre. Unfortunately, the present government is no exception. The states have already been reduced to the status of beggars at the Centre’s door. The latest reported move is only one more step to impoverish them further and to make them complete slaves before the Centre,” said Badal in a strongly worded statement here this afternoon.The former deputy chief minister of Punjab further said the Centre had been usurping the states’ resources by using the backdoor channels such as the subtle and frequent shifting of issues from the State to the Concurrent List.“The Centre has been taking a frequent resort to legislating on the Concurrent List to leave little breathing space for the states. All this has reduced the federal structure of the country to a mere joke,” he added.Badal scoffed at the reason being advanced to justify the latest move at reducing states’ share in the revenue pool.“Giving COVID-19 as the reason for the Centre’s increased liability is ridiculous. The real burden of dealing with the virus is upon the states as health is a state subject. The states have had to cope with immense additional stress on their health services because of this virus. If anyone needs more funds to deal with the virus, it is the states,” said Badal.The Akali leader said that the states’ share in this revenue was already meagre considering how much they contributed to this revenue and how vast their liabilities and development needs were.“The states’ share must be increased to more than 50 per cent,” he concluded.

Later, Manjinder started demanding Rs 1.04 crore and threatened him.Garg, in the note, says he paid Manjinder Rs 12 lakh through bank, but the latter demanded Rs 1 crore. Despite repaying the entire transferred amount, Manjinder charged 10 per cent interest on the little amount he used on a monthly basis.He further writes Raju, Aman and Babbu were criminal-mind persons who got him involved in investment firm Cryptonation Igbt and Affari Coin and transferred their liabilities to him. The three had Bitcoins but told public they had nothing and that the investors should contact Garg for refunds, he adds.In the note, he calls Sanjay a fake financier who got blank cheques from him and his wife some years ago.

The board, as such, cannot lose sight of the larger picture and refuse to correct simple mistakes in the name of students or parents in the certificates.Cited own bylaw to deny changeThe assertion by Justice Sanjay Kumar came on a petition filed by a student, claiming “Singh” was wrongly added behind his father’s name in the school records.As a result, the CBSE issued class X and XII examination mark-sheets and certificates, including migration, after recording Singh as a suffix to his father’s name. The petitioner applied to the CBSE through his school for correction and issuance of duly corrected mark-sheets and certificates. But the CBSE’s regional office rejected the request on the ground that the school record did not support the desired correction.Justice Kumar added, significantly, it was not the CBSE’s claim that the plea for correction of father’s name was not genuine or not borne out by sufficient record. The CBSE, only on the strength of its own bylaw, stated the petitioner could not seek change of his father’s name.It was the petitioner’s admitted case that a mistake was committed by his parents while getting him admitted to a school as the transfer certificate produced by them at the time reflected “Singh” in his father’s name.A perusal of the material placed on record by the petitioner clearly manifested that his father’s name did not carry “Singh”. The petitioner’s birth certificate issued by the Sub-Registrar, Births and Deaths, also indicated the s father’s name did not include “Singh”.“This being the factual position, the rather pedantic approach of the CBSE in blindly insisting on strict implementation of its own bylaw cannot be accepted. It is not the case of the CBSE that any incorrect particulars are sought to be projected by the petitioner or that any fraud is being perpetrated by seeking correction of his father’s name,” Justice Kumar added.

The flight is operated by Alliance Airlines.Officials said the development would help boost the sagging economy of the parliamentary constituency and also parts of neighbouring states of J&K and HP.Sunny Deol, MP On MP’s demandEven during the pandemic, the three-day-a-week flight was operating at 80% capacity. Hence there is a need to increase its frequency.Hospitality honchos, too, are happy as the Punjab Infrastructural Development Board has started work on turning the twin islands of Musharba and Kalara, located in the Ranjit Sagar Dam lake, into major world-class water sports and tourist hubs.In 2014, then Dy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal had flown in hoteliers from New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune in a special flight to convince them about the area’s tourism potential. However, the project failed due to little or no connectivity of the city with other parts of the country.“Highways have been constructed in recent years. This meant that tourists directly drove to the neighbouring states of J&K and HP without making a stop-over in the town as was the case earlier. This resulted in a massive loss of revenue for the nearly 100-odd hotels in the city,” said Anil Vasudeva, former mayor of Pathankot.On June 23, Deol had written a letter to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri requesting him to improve air connectivity “because he had to face flak from the business community of his constituency.”“This was enough to convince the ministry officials to make the flight a regular one. In the not so distant past, the city’s economy used to be based on tourism, timber and transport. However, with travellers giving the city a miss, businesses fell flat,” said Vasudeva.

The fund would be utilised for meeting fee and other expenses of students in case college faces a crisis similar to the one it had faced in 2017, said sources in the Medical Education Department.The Medical Council of India (MCI) and Dental Council of India had withdrawn the recognition to the dental and medical colleges of the Gian Sagar Educational and Charitable Trust in 2017 after the management failed to come up with a concrete revival plan for the institute. At the time, the government had shifted around 1,500 medical and dental students to other medical institutions operating across the state.The Baba Farid University of Health Sciences has already started the process of MBBS and BDS admissions. It is expected that the state will have 1,135 MBBS and 1,030 BDS seats this time.There are hopes of addition of 100 new MBBS seats in the state with the starting of BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences at Mohali as the fourth government medical college in the state.During the inspection of the institute some time ago, the MCI board of governors had denied permission to grant temporary recognition to the Ambedkar institute to start classes due to inadequate infrastructure and teaching faculty.Since then, the process to recruit the faculty has been going on in top gear so that the MCI’s decision could be reviewed. However, the National Medical Commission has refused to review the MCI decision, revealed sources.

27-10-2020||---||Burning Prime Minister’s effigies hurtful, says Tarun Chugh||Chandigarh, October 26Demanding a criminal case, the BJP today termed as hurtful the burning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s effigy instead of Ravana’s on Dasehra in various parts of the state.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh said it was a religious festival celebrated across the country and outside. It was condemnable that the Punjab Government made no effort to prevent the act of burning PM’s effigies, he said.“Any tinkering with the festival, especially with effigies of Ravana, amounts to hurting religious sentiments. The Congress seemed to be encouraging the act as its government did not take action to prevent such an incident,” Chugh said.The BJP chief was reacting to several incidents of burning effigies bearing PM’s photo to protest the Central farm laws. Chugh said such a treatment given to the Prime Minister of a country was highly condemnable.

Responding sharply to Bir Devinder’s comment on parliamentarians and other visitors ‘not being treated with dignity and respect by the Governor since the Covid outbreak’, the CM said the statement showed lack of maturity and understanding of the situation by the SAD (Democratic) leader. — TNS
27-10-2020||---||200 farmer unions to launch joint stir||Chandigarh, October 26In a rare display of unity, over 200 farmer unions across the states have decided to come together to launch a joint protest against the three farm Acts passed by Parliament last month and the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill, 2020.The unions, under the aegis of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), will be starting nationwide protests on the lines of agitation in Punjab. A call for a nationwide “Chakka jam” on all highways has been given for November 5.Though the farmer unions in Punjab had lifted their blockade on railway tracks last week and resolved to allow goods trains to operate, a decision of the Ministry of Railways to stop the trains to Punjab is now being perceived as an “economic blockade’ of the state by the Centre. The issue was discussed at a meeting of the AIKSCC working group in Delhi today.‘Centre trying to alienate us’We had decided to shift our protests from tracks to railway stations to allow goods trains.... but the Centre has made an attempt to alienate farmers in their struggle. —Darshan Pal, Krantikari Kisan Union Chief“We have strongly condemned the action and asked for restoration of the goods train services,” said Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union.Other than this, a roadmap to take up the fight at the national-level was readied by the AIKSCC working group today. As many as 20 members of the group, including many farmer leaders from Punjab, held a preliminary meeting in Delhi to discuss the framework of the national-level protests. The plan would be discussed in the meeting of all 200 farm union leaders, who are members of the AIKSCC, on Tuesday, Jagmohan Singh, a member of the AIKSCC, told The Tribune.

27-10-2020||---||Bid to derail farmers’ stir in Punjab: AAP||Chandigarh, October 26Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state president and MP Bhagwant Mann has condemned the Union Government for stalling goods trains to the state, alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi had adopted a revengeful attitude towards the state with an attempt to derail the farmers’ struggle.Bhagwant Mann, AAP MP‘PM should shun arrogance, help peasants’The Prime Minister should shun his arrogance and hold farmers’ hands in this hour of crisis. The suspension of train services is an attempt to sabotage their ongoing protest. In an official statement, Mann said the dictatorial and arbitrary decision to stop goods trains to Punjab with a rider regarding passengers trains was a clever ploy to sabotage the farmers’ struggle against the black laws.The AAP MP accused the Prime Minister of running away from holding talks with the farmers as he (Modi) was more interested to protect the corporate houses.Mann advised Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh that instead of appealing farmers to call off their stir, he should raise their genuine concerns with the Prime Minister.
27-10-2020||---||Suspension of goods trains: Don’t punish Punjab, says SAD||Chandigarh, October 26Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said here today the suspension of goods trains’ movement in the state could lead to “an economic blockade of the sensitive border state” and shatter its already staggering economy.Sukhbir Badal, SAD President ‘Move will hurt already sagging economy’The suspension of goods train services could create an economic blockade of the state, which is already suffering due to fund crunch, and destroy its trade and industry. He said the Central Government’s approach smacked of “needless and ominous confrontation which would serve no one’s interest”.He urged the Government of India to immediately resume normal goods train services in the state.“The decision to further suspend the goods trains in Punjab would completely devastate the entire business, trade and industry, apart from agriculture here. The decision needs to be reversed immediately. Do not punish the patriotic and peace-loving people of Punjab for demanding their democratic rights,” said the SAD president in a statement here.

Till Sunday, both divisions operated 173 goods train. However, at some places, empty rakes of goods trains as well as loaded trains were stopped by protesting farmers. As a result, the goods trains have been once again suspended due to operational and safety considerations,” said Rajesh Aggarwal, Divisional Railways Manager (DRM), Ferozepur Division. He stressed operations of goods trains were not possible in a ‘restricted’ manner because several factors like availability of rakes, staff and power were interlinked so as to ensure smooth running of goods trains.“We cannot compromise on the safety and security of our men and material,” said the DRM, adding that their operations were suffering due to the uncertainty prevailing due to the blockade of tracks.Sources said the Ministry of Railways had sought assurance from the state government on the safety and security of its rakes and train operating staff before it decided to resume the freight services.“We have to micro-manage the rail operations and even a small stumbling block somewhere can inflict a body blow to the entire movement,” the Ferozepur Division DRM said.While the Railways has cited operational constraints in suspension of goods trains’ movement in the state, those reading between the lines have termed the move as a “snub” by the Central Government both to the agitating farmers and ruling Congress government in the state.
27-10-2020||---||Restore railway services in Punjab, Capt Amarinder Singh urges Piyush Goyal||Chandigarh, October 26Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has sought the personal intervention of Union Railways Minister Piyush Goyal for the immediate restoration of the freight movement, which remains suspended in and through the state even after the farmers’ decision to partially lift their blockade.Capt Amarinder Singh, CM‘No reason to stop freight operations’The Railways’ decision has negated the partial success of negotiations with the farmers so far… there is now no plausible reason to stop freight operations in the state. The Chief Minister spoke to the Union Minister on Monday in the light of the decision of the Railways to extend the ban on the movement of goods trains, initially imposed for two days (on October 24 and 25), by another four days.Citing the grave impact of the non-restoration of freight traffic by the Railways, the Chief Minister also wrote to Goyal expressing concern that if the freight movement was not started immediately, “not only will Punjab face serious disruption in economic activities and shortage of essential supplies, but Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Leh and Ladakh will also face serious economic crisis.” He cited various requests received by the state government from different quarters, including Central ministries and departments, for immediate resumption of freight movement through the state.Earlier, the state government had succeeded in convincing the farmer unions to allow the partial resumption of services with withdrawal of their blockade from October 22. However, after the restoration of movement of freight trains on October 23, the Railways unilaterally stopped the movement of all freight trains in the state, Captain Amarinder pointed out in his letter to Goyal.The Chief Minister asserted the freight train service had continued almost without pause throughout the lockdown period even when the passenger trains operations were completely stopped.Later, on the Chief Minister’s directives, Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan also spoke to the Chairman, Railway Board, and noted that the CM had set up a committee of three ministers to discuss complete lifting of their ‘rail roko’ blockade to allow even passenger trains.

We even protested today on the outskirts of Malout town by blocking a road. Now, we have urged Capt Sandeep Sandhu, political secretary to CM, to intervene. We are suffering a loss of nearly Rs 60 per quintal just because of the cartel of some rice millers and officials of a government procurement agency.”When contacted, Gurmanpreet Singh, District Manager, Markfed, Muktsar, said, “This village was allotted to our agency this year. The purchase is being done as per the norms. Even today crop was procured. As per records available, no purchase was done from the village in the past five years. Now, farmers expect that nearly one lakh bags of paddy will come to the purchase centre.”Dewan Chand Sharma, District Food and Civil Supplies Controller, said, “There was some issue.

27-10-2020||Aman Sood||Spike in farm fires in Punjab to worsen air quality in border districts||Tribune News ServicePatiala, October 26Already facing a spurt in farm fires in the border belt, the air quality in districts nearing the Punjab-Haryana border, and eventually Delhi, is sure to take a further hit with farmers starting to burn paddy stubble in the Malwa belt. The air quality in Punjab is already worsening with people complaining of breathing difficulties and smog-like conditions on the city outskirts.Harvest yet to begin in many parts of beltWhile crop in many parts of the Malwa belt is yet to be harvested, it already accounts for around 50 per cent of the total farm fire incidents recorded in the state. As many as 6,000 of the total 12,985 cases have been recorded in the belt.On Sunday, people complained of a black ash layer over their vehicles in Patiala and adjoining areas falling from the sky. “It was the straw particles blown from burning fields that settled after being blown away by wind speed,” said a top Punjab Pollution Control Board official.Ferozepur and Patiala saw maximum cases of stubble burning in the Malwa belt, which recorded over 3,700 of the total 6,000 farm fires in the Malwa belt till October 25.The data from the Punjab Remote Sensing Authority showed that farmers were now resorting to farm fires in the fertile Malwa belt. Information gathered from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and Agriculture Department officials confirmed that farm fires were fast spreading in the Malwa belt and would further affect the air quality index of Punjab.“Farmers are now resorting to stubble burning as they have little window before preparing the fields for the next crop,” said a senior government officer. Stubble burning has been on the rise in the Malwa region since October 20.Satellite data revealed that till October 24 night, Ferozepur had the maximum 1,537 stubble-burning incidents, followed by Patiala 1,160, Faridkot 630, Muktsar 333, Moga 232, Ludhiana 349, Bathinda 326, Mansa 232, Sangrur 413 and Fatehgarh Sahib 407. In the Majha belt, Taran Tarn and Amritsar continue to top the defaulting list with 2,620 and 1,800 farm fire incidents, respectively.“A majority of farm fires in the Malwa belt started last week and the number is only going to grow in the next 10 days,” said a top official.
27-10-2020||---||Weeding out doubt over Punjab’s farm Bills||Speculation and smokescreens have historically been potent tools to trivialise achievement and advancement. Though momentarily, they allow the user the proverbial sleight of hand to shift focus from fact to fiction. I say this in the context of the reactions to the farm laws enacted by the Central Government and consequent legislation by Punjab.The Central laws, shrouded first as ‘emergent’ ordinances and then as controversially passed Acts, created new ‘trade areas’ within the states, put these trade areas outside the existing state market/mandi system and, hence, beyond the regulatory scope of the existing state law. The protective mechanism and oversight of local/state structure evaporated, leaving the farmer vulnerable to exploitation by large trading houses in farming agreements. The nationwide unrest the Central legislation has caused bears testimony to this.This invariably laid the basis for the state to step in and ensure that the interests of the farming community were not held to ransom by big traders and corporate houses. On October 20, Punjab passed its own farm Bills, reinstating legislative protection for Punjabi farmers.On plain reading, the three Punjab Bills firstly ensure a level playing field on pricing. They mandate that the purchase of wheat and paddy (Punjab contributes around 32 per cent of these two foodgrains to the Central pool), at a price lower than MSP (Minimum Support Price) shall not be permissible.As in any good law, compliance is ensured by introducing a deterrent. Compelling a farmer to sell his produce at less than the MSP has been made a criminal act with a minimum punishment of three years’ imprisonment and fine. An additional avenue of dispute resolution over and above the remedies available under other laws in force has also been provided. Minimum thresholds for validity of contracts for farm produce in the state have been provided without doing violence to the Central laws.In 1952, the Supreme Court of India had rightly declared in the case of Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga, “The legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community, by whose suffrage it comes into existence...” The Punjab legislature felt the pulse of its community and unanimously passed the Bills to protect its farmers. In doing so, the state has admirably fulfilled its constitutional duty to the people by whose suffrage it came into existence. Yet, without looking at the pith and substance of the laws in question, bugles of some apprehended ‘repugnancy’ are being sounded. The Bills have now been placed for the Governor’s assent.This takes us to the smokescreens of what-if scenarios: What if the Governor does not give assent on account of ‘repugnancy’ with the Central laws? What if the Governor sends the Bills to the President instead for his assent? What if the President does not give assent? What if the President/Governor withholds assent indefinitely?There is, in law, nothing repugnant in the state Acts. Repugnancy only occurs when the provisions of both laws “are fully inconsistent or absolutely irreconcilable” with each other, as held by the Supreme Court in the case of KT Plantations (2011). Apart from the obvious legal position that agriculture and markets are state subjects, it is well settled that the prescription of a higher standard or additional qualifications by states to fine-tune any (omnibus) Central law is very much within the jurisdiction of a state's legislative competence. It is a mode of legislative conduct known to law. Examples are available in many spheres, including education, service qualifications, and, more recently, in the Covid-19 lockdowns that were subject to more onerous conditions imposed by states.In the absence of any legal repugnancy and with the far-reaching public good that the Bills ensure, surely the Governor ought to provide his assent to the Bills expeditiously. The naysayer, however, speculates that the Governor will refer the Bills for Presidential assent or will withhold consent indefinitely. Surely, the Governor or the President will take into account repugnancy or lack thereof and the prevailing conditions in the state and grant assent.Cursory research would reveal that the indefinite withholding or denying of consent by the President is not a common occurrence, as is being bandied about by all and sundry. It would be a constitutional abnormality, if not an aberration, echoed only once when President Zail Singh received the Postal Bill on December 22, 1986, and was to demit office on July 25, 1987; he neither consented nor refused assent, but ‘sat on the Bill’, creating what is known as a ‘pocket veto’. Arbitrarily denying consent when protective laws have been so unanimously passed by all parties/Members of the House, for an otherwise vulnerable class, such as farmers, may even be termed as a constitutional crime.Standing tall above all this are the provisions of our Constitution and its history. The President (and Governor in a state) “occupies the same position as the King under the English Constitution,” said the Chairman of the Assembly’s Drafting Committee, BR Ambedkar, on November 4, 1948, while introducing the draft Constitution in the Assembly. The changes made in the draft on the President's assent (Article 91) denied him any veto power, pocket or other power allowing him to “declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom” and to do in a period “not later than six weeks after the presentation to him of a Bill for assent” if it is not a money Bill. In October 1948, the drafting committee removed the six weeks’ limit and substituted for it the words ‘as soon as possible’. They are stronger than the words ‘as soon as may be’ used in Article 22(5) apropos of the furnishing of grounds of detention to detenues. As for withholding consent indefinitely, it is trite law that where no time limit is prescribed for exercise of power, such power has to be exercised within a reasonable time.Rather than speculation, it is time for solutions. Given that ‘the right to food’, recognised as a constitutional right by the Supreme Court, was the object in passing the National Food Act, 2013 (a Central Act), while passing the Central laws, the Central Government has lost a golden opportunity in making MSP a statutory right.A financially empowered farmer results in augmented crop yield, which, in turn, nourishes the food bowl of India. Procurement by the FCI feeds the Public Distribution System of the country and an economically vibrant agrarian society would feed the masses. There could be no better motive for a law. And no higher cause in public interest.
