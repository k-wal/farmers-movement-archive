13-06-2020||---||Punjab CM Amarinder for strict checking of entrants from Delhi||Chandigarh, June 13Expressing serious concerns about the spread of Covid-19 in the state from those coming from outside, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday called for strict checking of entrants from other states, particularly Delhi, where cases were spiralling out of control.He, however, made it clear that Punjabis were welcome to come to Delhi for Covid treatment in Punjab after getting their hospital beds reserved here on the recommendation of a Delhi hospital. The Chief Minister was responding to a question from a Punjab resident working in Delhi during his Facebook Live #AskCaptain session.On the issue of sealing Punjab’s borders with other states, Amarinder said while Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh had sealed their borders with Punjab, people were coming from Haryana and Delhi every day in large numbers. On Friday alone, 6,500 vehicles entered Punjab from Delhi and Haryana, which translated into about 20,000 new people coming from these states on a single day.His government was mulling ways to make entry norms more stringent, given the increasing number of positive cases in the state, said the Chief Minister.Though the state was still performing relatively better than many others in the country, cases in Punjab were also continuing to spiral, necessitating tough measures, the Chief Minister said. While nobody likes restrictions, he had been forced to imposed weekend and holiday curbs to protect lives, he said, adding that restrictions on inter-state movement on these days were also intended to check unnecessary socialising.Pointing to the spike of 117 cases in a single day in the state, the Chief Minister attributed the sharp rise to the influx of people into the state, which has witnessed the entry of as many as 43,000 people in just one month.In addition to people landing in Amritsar from Dubai and other places, trains culminating in the historic city were also adding to the deluge of people, he said, adding that the three cities of Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana have seen the maximum cases. Restrictions were important to check the spread further to other districts such as Pathankot, Patiala and Gurdaspur, he added.

13-06-2020||---||Stringent action against private hospitals overcharging COVID-19 patients: Punjab Health Minister||Chandigarh, June 13Punjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, on Saturday, warned of stringent action against all such hospitals, including cancellation of licences, who are trying to exploit the pandemic situation.The Minister said the Punjab government would soon be fixing the charges for COVID-19 treatment keeping in view the interest of both the patients and the private hospitals. “But, at no cost, the government will allow exploitation of patients during this critical situation by private hospitals”, he added.“This is a catastrophic crisis when everyone is fighting for survival and some unscrupulous private hospitals have tried to resort to open and wanton loot of the helpless patients,” Sidhu said in a statement issued here on Saturday.The minister said his attention had been drawn towards the unprecedentedly high charges imposed by the private hospitals for the treatment of COVID patients.“It is sad and shameful on their part that instead of making positive contribution towards fighting this pandemic, some hospitals have resorted to extortion, which will not be allowed at any cost,” he said.Balbir Singh Sidhu warned that the licences of all such hospitals will be cancelled and all their facilities will be withdrawn. Besides, he added, the government reserved the right to withdraw the land provided to these hospitals at highly concessional rates.The Minister has called a special meeting on Monday to decide the fee structure for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. He said all factors would be taken into consideration.“We do not want private hospitals to suffer any financial losses, but we will not allow extortion at any cost and that too during the time of emergency,” he clarified.The government will fix a particular fee for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients, which will be publicised, and which the private hospitals will also need to display.“And for sure, the treatment of a COVID-19 patient should not cost several lakhs of rupees,” Balbir Singh Sidhu made clear.

The factory has already suffered significant losses — owing to the ongoing strike.”However, the workers’ union, after the decision of the labour department, has threatened to intensify their strike against the company.Balbir Singh, general secretary, Milkfood Worker Union, said they would knock the door of court — along with holding demonstrations against the company. He said, “The decision by the labour department is arbitrary because we were not called by the labour officials to represent our view. This shows the nexus of corporate and government.”Meanwhile, JP Singh, Assistant Labour Commissioner (ALC), Patiala, said the decision was taken as per the act. He said, “The strike has already been called illegal by the competent authority, consequently, company can take action against the workmen.”

13-06-2020||---||17 asymptomatic Punjab cops test positive for COVID in random sampling||Chandigarh, June 13A total of 17 Punjab Police personnel have tested positive in a random sampling of 7,165 cops posted in various police stations and on other frontline jobs.The police personnel were tested as part of a special RT-PCR COVID testing drive ordered by DGP Dinkar Gupta amid apprehensions of a spike in cases in the wake of relaxation of the curfew in the state, and almost three months of multifarious frontline duties by around 48,000 policemen working 24/7 during the statewide lockdown.This translates into around 0.9 per cent positive cases of the total samples for the police force, as compared with the average of 2 per cent positive cases for the entire state, said Gupta.The state’s higher percentage among general population was understandable since testing of citizens is normally carried out either for symptomatic individuals or for their primary or secondary contacts, in contrast to the random exercise conducted among asymptomatic Punjab Police personnel, the DGP added.The DGP disclosed that of the 17 positive cases, 14 belonged to district police, two (including a cook) were from State Armed Police/Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) and one from Punjab Home Guards (PHG).Sangrur has reported the maximum number of positive cases, said the DGP.While 1,868 of the 7,165 samples collected till June 12 had tested negative, results for 5,280 were pending, said Gupta, adding that the sampling process started on June 1, and efforts were being made to test a maximum number of police personnel posted in police stations and other high risk areas on a daily basis depending upon the spare sampling and testing capacity available with the Health Department.He further said that all the 17 infected cops were in isolation, either in Civil Hospitals or in the COVID care centres established by the Punjab Health Department.The DGP had, through a video-conference, directed all SSPs/CPs and IGs to conduct RT-PCR test for all police personnel with high risk exposure, with focus on personnel engaged in frontline roles in over 400 police stations of the 27 revenue/police districts of the state.The DGP directed the district police chiefs, as well as the Special DGP of the State Armed Police, to carry out the random sampling of a cross-section of the Punjab Police personnel, including drivers of police vehicles, prison vans etc.He told the officers he was concerned about the probability of increase in infection among police personnel deployed on public and frontline duties.Since the Health Department had a shortage of trained sampling teams, the doctors and paramedics attached with the police were put through a quick training programme by the Health Department in taking samples.The exercise would help the department in making an assessment of the extent of problem in the police force, and would also enable the department to ensure the best possible medical treatment to the policemen and their families, said the DGP.It would also help the Punjab Police make proper arrangements and build adequate capacity for testing and medical treatment of its personnel to combat any crisis situation in the future.Meanwhile, a Covid positive ASI, with co-morbidities, was reported to be in critical condition in Amritsar, the DGP informed.He was, however, not part of the random sampling exercise undertaken by the department, Gupta said, adding that all out efforts were being made to ensure the best possible treatment through the expert group set-up by the Punjab Government under Dr KK Talwar, former Director, PGIMER, Chandigarh.

Anmol Narang, is a second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia. She did a year of undergraduate study at the Georgia Institute of Technology before transferring to West Point, where she will graduate Saturday with a degree in nuclear engineering.She hopes to pursue a career in air defense systems."I am excited and honored to be fulfilling my dream of graduating from West Point,” Narang said in a news release from the Sikh Coalition, a nonprofit based in New York that works to protect the constitutional right to practice faith without fear.“The confidence and support of my community back home in Georgia has been deeply meaningful to me, and I am humbled that in reaching this goal, I am showing other Sikh Americans that any career path is possible for anyone willing to rise to the challenge.”      Narang will complete her Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, officials said. Following that, she will then head to her first post in Okinawa, Japan, in January.Congress passed a law in 1987 that prohibited Sikhs and other religious communities from maintaining their articles of faith while in the military. A Sikh's visible articles of faith, including turbans and unshorn facial hair, were banned.Narang required no accommodation for her articles of faith, but the coalition said “her exemplary service to date underscores how diversity and pluralism remain core strengths of the U.S. military and the country as a whole.”      US Army Capt Simratpal Singh, a family friend, said he is proud of Narang who is “breaking a barrier for any Sikh American who wishes to serve.”          “The broader acceptance of Sikh service members among all of the service branches, as well as in top tier leadership spaces like West Point, will continue to benefit not just the rights of religious minority individuals, but the strength and diversity of the US military,” he said.

13-06-2020||Avneet KaurJalandhar||Mask must even while driving alone, says DCP (Traffic) Dogra||Ever since the curfew was lifted in the state, a lot of restrictions were put in place to ensure the safety of residents. One of the most important rules is to wear a mask every time you step out. The failure of doing so will lead to a penalty of Rs 500. However, the rule got many residents wondering if it was applicable when you are driving alone with windows rolled up.Challans issued so farTill date, the district police have issued 6,428 challans, including 198 issued on Friday, for not wearing a mask under the ‘Mission Fateh’ initiated by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, thereby imposing a fine of Rs25.59 lakh on the defaulters.Various social media posts have been making the rounds with residents asking the logic behind wearing a mask when you are alone. Also, the recent incident in Patiala when a woman doctor was issued a challan for not wearing a mask while driving a car, apparently when she was on her way for Covid-19 duty, brought the public and doctors’ fraternity together under one umbrella raising objections over this mandatory rule.Richa Chadha, a resident of Friends Colony and working as a sales manager in a private firm, said, “I was on my way to the office when a woman constable near BMC Chowk stopped me and issued a challan for not wearing mask. I told her repeatedly that no one is in the car; I am driving alone with windows shut, so on what grounds I am being challaned”.She said the constable replied her that they had strict instructions from the government to challan everyone for not wearing a mask while venturing out.“We understand that the government has devised rules for the safety of the public, but these should make some sense. Even doctors have said that it’s not necessary to wear a mask when you are alone,” she added.Naresh Dogra, DCP (Traffic), while talking to The Tribune, said it was mandatory to wear a mask no matter if you were driving alone or with people at your back seat. “As per a notification issued by the Director of Health Services, those who don’t wear a mask while venturing out will be fined Rs 500. And that’s what the police have been doing. It is for the safety of the residents and they should understand the gravity of the situation”, he added.

However, J&K and Haryana have registered recoveries below the national average. J&K’s cure rate is 34.65 per cent as against Haryana’s 34.69 per cent. HP’s cure rate is 54.23 per cent.Government sources said the cure and mortality rates were the best indicators of the quality of state’s Covid response and management.“These two indicators determine the response to the pandemic since the virus is here to stay and a vaccine or a drug is not in sight,” VK Paul, member health, NITI Aayog, said.A growing recovery rate means cured persons progressively outnumber the infected and the proportion of persons susceptible to the virus decreases. Once this proportion decreases considerably the pandemic curve will start to drop.

Such patients should not be counted in the Punjab caseload, but in that of Delhi. — Dr Harish Malhotra, Patiala Civil SurgeonThree residents of Delhi have been admitted to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala after they tested positive for COVID-19, while another came to Mohali, the Punjab government officials said.According to the officials, all four travelled on Friday from Delhi to Punjab, where they tested positive for COVID-19. They added that the patients were, however, claiming that they travelled to the state to visit their relatives and not for the treatment.A 57-year-old bank manager, posted in Delhi for the past several years, tested positive for the disease in Patiala on Friday. His son claimed that after showing corona symptoms, his father visited several hospitals for the treatment, but wasn’t entertained anywhere.In another case, an elderly couple has been admitted to Government Rajindra Hospital here. Officials said the husband-wife duo visited the health facility as soon as they reached Patiala from Delhi on Wednesday. They had got tested at a private lab in the Capital and were found positive.Concerned over the emerging trend, the Health Department has alerted the policymakers to find a solution.Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu alleged that people in the New Delhi were being denied testing and medical services. He took a swipe at the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, saying the situation exposed the “tall claims” of the Delhi Chief Minister, who always said they had successful health services there.After approaching their relatives or friends in Patiala, the three patients reached the hospital for testing for COVID-19 and treatment, the officials said.Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said it appeared as if all of them were visiting the state on purpose—for corona treatment.“We have informed the Director, Health and Family Welfare. Such patients should not be counted in the Punjab caseload, but in that of Delhi,” he said.Malhotra said they would not be included in Punjab’s coronavirus tally as the patients hailed from Delhi but were only being treated in Punjab.Another patient from Delhi came to Mohali on Friday night for treatment, officials said.“We have isolated him and will treat him,” said Mohali Civil Surgeon Manjit Singh.“We have informed about this case to the Mohali Deputy Commissioner,” he added.The state Health Minister said the state government would provide treatment to every patient.“Today, the Delhi government has given up. They used to say their Mohalla clinics and hospitals were very successful,” he alleged.Sources said people from Delhi were approaching their friends, extended family members and acquaintances in Punjab to find accommodation on rent. A property dealer said he was hunting for a ‘kothi’ (house) on rent in Mohali for two families from Delhi.Dr Sumeet Singh, District Epidemiologist, said, “There have been several cases of people from Delhi visiting their relatives and friends in Punjab as the situation in the Capital seems to be worsening by the day. The corona positivity rate of those coming from the NCR and Maharashtra is quite high compared to other places.”The Punjab government had announced the imposition of stricter lockdown on weekends and public holidays in the state. The state government had also mulled imposing strict conditions, including mandatory testing certification, for entrants from Delhi to Punjab in the wake of the situation assuming “alarming proportions” in the national capital. — With inputs from PTI

The farmer union accused the commission agents of buying sunflower seeds from Punjab at cheaper rates and selling them at minimum support price (MSP) in Shahabad.While the MSP for sunflower seeds is Rs5,650 a quintal, the private players are offering around Rs4,300 to 4,500 a quintal to farmers. Krishan Malik, Shahabad grain market committee secyCrop registered through e-NAMThe crop belonged to two farmers of Rajpura, Punjab. Their crop was registered through e-NAM portal which got auctioned in the private market.BKU spokesman Rakesh Bains said, “A total 238 bags of sunflower seeds were brought from Punjab and were being offloaded at a shop in the grain market. When we reached there, the commission agent who was getting the stock offloaded, failed to give satisfactory reply about the sunflower seeds. Such practice is not possible without the support from the government officials. While the local farmers are struggling to sell their produce, as the procurement agencies have stopped buying after their quota for sunflower procurement exhausted, commission agents are bringing the produce from other states to reap profit. There are a large number of farmers who are yet to get registred at the ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal as it is yet to be opened.”After the farmers raised objection, the market committee officials took the stock into their custody. The BKU has requested the Deputy Commissioner to get the matter investigated.Shahabad grain market committee secretary Krishan Malik said, “The crop belonged to two farmers of Rajpura, Punjab. Their crop was registered through e-NAM portal which got auctioned in the private market. Only the crop of registered Haryana’s farmers will be purchased at MSP by the procurement agency.”

Parents subsequently moved the court for also being heard. Advocate-General Atul Nanda too appeared before the Bench claiming there was no question of financial hardship since schools conducting online classes would continue to charge fee "in respect of such classes".Representing 3,500 schools, senior advocate Puneet Bali submitted the cases of parents in genuine distress would be considered on individual basis for fee waiver, reduction and deferment.Bali questioned state's jurisdiction to order independent bodies against charging for services. Referring to 2016 regulations, Bali submitted fee to be charged included salary and development charges. As far as transportation charges were concerned, Bali added the schools were required to pay for permits and road tax, besides salary to conductors and drivers. He said the state wanted schools to pay for everything and not charge anything. If the state was willing to take the burden of paying fee and salaries, schools would not charge even a single rupee as fee.Defending the state's stand, Nanda referred to 187-page reply filed by him stating among other things that the memo reasonably prohibited the charging for meals, transportation and buildings. Meals and transportation were not being offered and buildings were closed. Besides, it was a policy decision and the same could not be tested in writ proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution. He added that other states had passed similar orders without intervention by the courtsNanda was earlier asked by the Bench to intervene for resolving the issue, following which a series of meetings were held with all concerned. The CM was also kept in the loop. His stand to resolve the issue was today backed by a section of lawyers. Parents will now be heard on June 15.
13-06-2020||Kuldip BhatiaLudhiana||Amid paddy sowing, power demand soars in Punjab||With paddy season on and summer at its peak, the daily demand for power in the state has crossed 10,000 MW. The power utility has made the provision for additional power generation to meet the growing demand by making one unit of Guru Gobind Singh Termal Power Plant at Ropar (Unit VI), which was supplying nearly 150 MW, operational today.Officials of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) have indicated that in the coming days when paddy sowing would peak and industrial/business activity would pick up, the total daily demand for power could grow by 50 per cent. They said to some extent the situation could go out of hand given the fact that the total availability of power to the state from all sources was to the extent of around 13,900 MW.According to PSPCL officials, the power situation was being monitored round the clock and depending upon the surge in demand, more power can be requisitioned from independent power plants (IPPs) in private sector at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and Goindwal Sahib. At the same time, power generation could also be commenced at the two government-owned thermal power stations at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat.Senior officials of the power utility said as of now there was no need for concern over the power scenario because the three thermal plants in the private sector (IPPs) had a total generation capacity of almost 4,000 MW and in addition depending on the demand of electricity, the public sector thermal plants at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat could be made fully operational.

Appearing before the Bench through videoconferencing, petitioner’s counsel Jagmohan Bansal submitted that Bassi, engaged in the trade of iron and steel products, was arrested by the respondents in September 2019, under Section 69 of the Act.After completing the investigation, the respondents filed a complaint under Section 132 of the Act before Amloh court, alleging that the petitioner passed on input tax credit by issuing sale bills to parties without the supply of goods.The counsel added that the petitioner was granted interim bail by the High Court and the matter was pending for August. The trial was at pre-charge evidence stage for past eight months and no witness had been examined till date.Challenging the vires of Section 69 and 132 of the Act, the counsel submitted that Article 246-A was inserted with effect from September 16, 2016, vide 101st Constitutional Amendment, whereby the union and the state legislatures were empowered to levy tax on goods and services.It was contended that the power to levy tax included the power to make law with respect to “ancillary and incidental matters”. But the power of arrest and the prescription of sentence was neither covered under ancillary, nor incidental, matters. The provision for arrest or sentence for an offence against the law could be inserted in any enactment, if permitted by the Constitution.The counsel added criminal trial for offences under Section 132 and arrest under Section 69 were without jurisdiction, having no backing of the constitutional provisions. “We find considerable force in the submissions was raised and demonstrated by Jagmohan Bansal, advocate for the petitioner,” the Bench added, while issuing notice of motion to the respondents.The Bench directed the trial court to adjourn the case beyond the date fixed by the High Court. Punjab Additional Advocate-General Pankaj Gupta accepted the notice on behalf of the state and the other respondents. The case will now come up for further hearing in July last week.
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab fears fall in GST compensation||Amid growing concern over its fiscal health, the likelihood of a fall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) devolutions to Punjab is becoming a major cause of concern.The Government of India’s GST collections in the first two months of the ongoing fiscal have dropped to about 45 per cent, as claimed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, after she chaired the 40th meeting of the GST Council in Delhi today. This means that the problem of giving compensation to all states, including Punjab, will only get aggravated in the coming days.Punjab had estimated that its GST receipts in 2020-21 would touch Rs 15858.68 crore, as against Rs 13443.23 crore in 2019-20. Last week, the Government of India had released a GST compensation of Rs 2,866 crore to Punjab as compensation for the months of December, January and February. With the state’s own sources of revenue nearly drying up because of the prolonged lockdown, the GST compensation is a major source of income for the state. With the economic revival still away because of the recession that has set in, the fall in the GST compensation by the Centre (because of a fall in its own collections) will make things difficult for the state.Notably, the state is facing a shortfall of 30 per cent in its total revenue receipts during this fiscal because of the lockdown. Officials in the Finance Department say the revenue shortfall could be over Rs 21,000 crore against a budget estimate of Rs 7,3975.08 crore as revenue receipts for 2020-21.Official sources in the government told The Tribune that the state had raised the issue of release of GST compensation for the month of March at the earliest. “The government has a compensation cess of Rs 8,000 crore, from which the compensation for March can be released immediately,” said a senior official in the state government, while confirming that the issue had been raised in today’s meeting.
