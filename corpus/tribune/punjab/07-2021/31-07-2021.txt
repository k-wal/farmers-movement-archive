31-07-2021||Jupinderjit Singh||In a first, BSF officers appointed Punjab jail superintendents||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 31After deputing some battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for security, the Punjab Jails department on Saturday posted four officers of the Border Security Force (BSF) as superintendents of central jails in four districts.This is the first time that officers from the BSF or any central security force have been posted as heads of a jail in Punjab, said ADGP Jails PK Sinha.Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said officers from the BSF have been taken on deputation to upgrade the management and security.

The caller identified himself as Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the general counsel for the SFJ.“We will not allow Jai Ram Thakur to hoist the Indian Tricolour,” he said.He further said, “Himachal Pradesh was part of Punjab and we are seeking a referendum in Punjab. Once we liberate Punjab, we will make sure that we take over Himachal Pradesh areas which were part of Punjab.”          The FIR has been registered under Sections 124 (sedition), 153-A (act prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 506  (intimidation) of the IPC, Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and 66-C of the IT Act, the spokesperson said.This case has been lodged on the basis of recorded audio clips received on mobile phone by many journalists and citizens, he added.The spokesperson said the pro-Khalistani outfit SFJ was banned by the Union government under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for anti-India activities on July 10, 2019.This pro-Khalistani organisation is based overseas with their network in the USA and other countries, he added.The investigation conducted so far has revealed that the audio clips were sent through international numbers (voice over internet protocol), he added.Investigation is underway to identify the caller, he said, adding that police are seeking cooperation from central agencies to bring the accused to justice.

Out of the total pendency cases in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, 304447 are criminal matters, predominantly involving life and liberty.Otherwise, 158570 or 22.68 per cent of the total pending cases are up to a year old; 231637 or 33.13 per cent are pending between one and three years; 92551or 13.24 per cent are pending between 10 and 20 years, and 10519 or 1.5 per cases are awaiting adjudication for last 20 to 30 years.To make the matters worse, the High Court is expected to witness an unmanageable flood of litigation once it reopens for normal “physical” operations.  Available information suggests a substantial number of cases, filed but yet to be numbered, are lying in the High Court Registry to be taken up upon the resumption of physical hearing.The situation is expected to further worsen because of the impending retirement of Judges. The High Court is currently functioning at almost half the sanctioned strength with just 46 Judges against the sanctioned strength of 85. No less than two Judges are retiring this year, including one in August. Another five Judges are retiring next year.The last time the collegium made recommendations for elevation was in August 2020. The names of five advocates — Jasjit Singh Bedi, Pankaj Jain, Vikas Suri, Sandeep Moudgil and Vinod Bhardwaj — were finalised and forwarded. These were further forwarded by the Centre to the Supreme Court as late as in April this year and are believed to be pending. On the other hand, the last time the collegium recommended the names of judicial officers for elevation as High Court Judges was more than two years back.The process of appointing judges is lengthy and time consuming. Once cleared by the States and the governors, the file containing the names with intelligence bureau reports is placed before the Supreme Court when it meets. The names cleared for elevation are then sent to Union law ministry before their warrants of appointment are signed by the President. The process could take several months, if not taken up on priority basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/case-pendency-nearing-7-lakh-mark-in-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-291012
31-07-2021||New Delhi||Oppn parties demand President’s intervention for formation of JPC on farmer deaths||Some opposition parties, led by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), met President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday to seek his intervention in asking the government to set up a JPC on farmer deaths and allow a discussion in Parliament on the farmers’ issue and the Pegasus snooping controversy.Leaders of SAD, NCP and JKNC met the president and handed over a letter signed by the representatives of various parties for his intervention.The Congress, however, was not a signatory to it.The letter by various parties, including SAD, Shiv Sena, NCP, BSP, JKNC, RLP, CPI and CPI(M), seeks the president’s intervention to ensure the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to ascertain the details of farmer deaths during their agitation against three agriculture laws of the Centre and allow a discussion on their issues in Parliament.After meeting the president, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said the entire Opposition is demanding from the government for the last two weeks to allow them to speak in Parliament on issues concerning people.Among those who met Kovind included Mohammed Faizal (NCP), Hasnain Masoodi (JKNC), Ritesh Pandey (BSP) and Balwinder Singh Bhundar (SAD).Badal said she herself had approached the Congress and the TMC and wanted these parties to accompany them during the meeting with the president, “but unfortunately, it is before you that no one has reached here. We had sought time from the president”.All opposition parties are giving adjournment motions in Parliament on the farmers’ issue and the Pegasus snooping row, she said, alleging that it is the government’s duty to enable Parliament to function, but it is stonewalling the Opposition.“We have come here to tell the president that democracy and democratic traditions are under threat and the voice of parliamentarians is being crushed inside Parliament too. This is a big loss to democracy.“We have appealed to the president, who is the custodian and conscience keeper of the country, to put pressure on the government and admit the people’s issues raised by the opposition parties and allow Parliament to function,” the former Union minister told reporters.She said they may belong to small political parties, but represent people from across the country, from Jammu and Kashmir to Lakshadweep.“We have urged the president to put pressure on the government to let Parliament function smoothly so that people’s issues are addressed,” the Akali leader said.She said farmers are sitting on the roads for the last one year and at Delhi’s borders for eight months, and 500 of them have lost their lives.But when the agriculture minister says no farmer has died during the agitation against the three farm laws, it adds to their anger, Badal said.“The government says this is an issue concerning only one state, but MPs have come here from different states, from every nook and corner of the country,” she added.“The snooping issue is also an issue of national security. Why is the government not agreeing for a discussion on these issues and running away?“We have also appealed to the president to form a Joint Select Committee comprising MPs from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to work out a solution for the protesting farmers. How many more farmers does the government want dead? Five hundred farmers have already died during the agitation,” Badal said.The opposition leaders have demanded that tributes be paid in Parliament to the farmers who have died during the agitation.“We hope that the president would surely tell the government to allow Parliament to function and let public money not be wasted. At least, listen to the families of those farmers who have died,” Badal said.Masoodi said, “We have also urged the president to restore statehood to Jammu and Kashmir.”  Badal said they had urged the Lok Sabha speaker on Friday to form a JPC to find out how many farmers have died during the agitation.“We have now urged the president to form the JPC. We want that the government should not run away from Parliament as it has a responsibility,” she added.Asked about the government accusing the Opposition of stalling Parliament, she said the government just wants to buy time.Every party wants a discussion but the government does not, she alleged.“Simply allow a discussion on both these issues and the House will start functioning and everything will settle down,” the SAD leader said.On the absence of the Congress and the TMC from their meeting with Kovind, she said till the time the Opposition is not united, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will continue to benefit.

We further direct the state PCB to now ensure compliance and file compliance report,” the Bench said.The industry may achieve suggested water consumption/minimisation steps, reduction in generation of effluents, following proper ferti-irrigation plan, to be duly monitored and compliant with emission standards, the tribunal said.It also asked the state pollution control board to clarify on dual mode of disposal system consented - on land and in Dhanaula drain and mechanism for monitoring standards with two different systems of disposal.The pollution control board may assess compensation for violations till required pollution control devices are set up and ensure that no environmental degradation takes place, it said.The state PCB has to put the industrial unit to notice of proceedings before the NGT so that it has an opportunity to show cause before the Tribunal as to why the green panel should not take coercive measures in the matter for its continuing failure. The registry may also send notice by e-mail to the said unit, the NGT ordered.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Beant Singh Bajwa, President, National Anti-Corruption Council against violation of environmental norms by Trident Factory, Dhaula, Mansa Road, Barnala, Punjab.The matter is listed fir further consideration on November 12.

Of which Rs 3.4 crore has been spent as land cost and the remaining Rs 3 crore on its construction.While paying floral tributes to the great revolutionary on his 82nd martyrdom day, the Chief Minister said the supreme sacrifice made by the martyr would ever inspire our younger generations to imbibe the spirit of nationalism and patriotism. He also appealed to the local leadership for proper upkeep of this memorial as he has often noticed that after sometime such places of reverence got neglected.The Chief Minister also interacted with the descendants of Shaheed Udham Singh, namely Jeet Singh, Gian Singh, Ranjit Kaur, Mohan Singh, Shyam Singh, Gurmeet Singh and Malkit Singh from Sunam and honoured them with shawls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amarinder-dedicates-shaheed-udham-singh-memorial-at-sunam-to-people-290976

Such behaviour can’t be tolerated,” he said.Witnesses said farmers jumped over three barricades to counter the BJP dharna. The police had to resort to lathicharge in which a dozen farmers were hurt. Additional force was called to diffuse the tension. Farmers reportedly removed the billboards that carried PM Modi’s portraits. SKM leaders intervened and pacified farmers.SKM leader Het Ram Beniwal later announced to organise protests against BJP leaders in all villages across the district.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-laws-protesters-clash-with-bjp-workers-near-abohar-290613

Rajbir Enterprises was the firm that had allegedly financed Rana’s aides Amit Bahadur and Kulwinderpal Singh to participate in the mining auctions, over which he had to resign.The episode had led to speculation over whether Gurinder also financed sand mining auction bids. The transfer of the amount had taken place on May 23, 2017, the last day for depositing security to participate in bidding.The ED officials said even though the amount was transferred back from Rajbir Enterprises to Jatin Garg’s account two days later, the day the scam got reported, everyone involved in the front and back transactions would be questioned. The Singlas and Garg had earlier denied using Gurinder’s money.The ED has so far investigated only five of the 35 suspected projects involving Gurinder’s “shady” deals and so far found violation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to the tune of Rs 42 crore. “We are probing the remaining cases and all money trails linked to the sand mining contract case,” said an ED officer.Rana, however, clarified: “I already have a clean chit in the mining case from the Justice Narang Commission. All departments, including the income tax, have done all kinds of investigations. No one could find anything against me.” He added: “Singla runs an accountancy firm and handles accounting works for so many people, including me. So, how was I involved? Still if the ED wants to probe anything against me, I have no problem.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ed-investigates-contractors-link-in-sand-mining-scam-290618

He said incentives should be given to doctors, specialists and super specialists to attract the best talent to the government sector, instead of making savings by pay cut. He said if there were cuts in salary and allowances, doctors were bound to leave government jobs and move to private sector or abroad.Meanwhile, Dr Nitin Kumar, former Chief Executive Officer, Punjab Gau Sewa Commission, said government doctors and veterinarians felt cheated as during the ongoing pandemic, they worked with great dedication and devotion even at the cost of their health and by putting their families at risk just to alleviate the sufferings of the public.Dr Sanjeev Khosla, former Director, Animal Husbandry, Punjab, quipped that in the prevailing scenario, under the ‘one health programme’ , veterinary and medical doctors had a crucial role to play and were supposed to form joint strategies and programmes to contain and combat the spread of emerging new diseases globally. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/vets-restore-25-npa-make-it-part-of-salary-290619

While one centre has been placed under suspension, two others have been put on notice. The schemes, aimed at training youths at the grassroots and instilling entrepreneurship skills in them, are part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ (collective development of everyone) initiative.In a letter to the Manager, Punjab Skill Development Mission, seeking further action, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Development) has stated M/s Rose Mary Educational Trust, Bathinda, which comes under the NULM, had marked the attendance of 30 students in ‘CRM domestic — non-voice course’ and 26 students in ‘general duty assistant — advance course’ but during a surprise inspection by the ADC (D), no students were found in both classes. Further, it stated, during the checking, no separate building was found for the centre affiliated with and accredited by the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). The centre was in fact based out of a building used for courses under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY) scheme.It was noticed that photographs uploaded by the centre manager were of students of courses run under the DDUGKY scheme.In a separate letter, it said M/s Saraswati Knowledge Park, Bathinda, which also comes under the NULM, had marked attendance of 28 students in ‘construction electrician LV course’, but during inspection, no student was found in the class. Similarly, wrong facts were presented by the centre, which also didn’t have a separate building.Further, action has been initiated against the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Charitable and Educational Society, which comes under the PMKVY, over poor performance of students as they all flunked the “draughtsman mechanical course” exam twice. During a review meeting, the centre failed to provide a satisfactory reply. Gagan Kalra of M/s Rose Mary Educational Trust and M/s Saraswati Knowledge Park claimed: “On the day of the inspection, a student had fever, due to which we had to send back all students over Covid-19 fear.” Refuting the allegation of fraud, Kalra claimed they had been running the centres “efficiently” and had “provided internship to thousands of students after training so far”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-bathinda-skill-centres-under-lens-290621
31-07-2021||Saurabh Malik||High Court: Punjab has no jurisdiction over discontinuing academic course||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 30The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the state has no jurisdiction in discontinuance of an academic course. The Bench also made it clear that Punjabi University’s directions to an institute to seek the approval of DPI (Colleges) for discontinuation of a course were illegal and unsustainable in law.The ruling by Justice Sudhir Mittal came on a petition by the governing body of the Akal Degree College for Women, Sangrur, against the state of Punjab and other respondents. The Bench was told the petitioner established the Akal Degree College for Women in Sangrur. A communication dated February 20 last year was addressed to the Punjabi University Vice Chancellor requesting for permission to discontinue with the Bachelor of Arts course from academic session 2020-21 following reduction in student strength and resultant financial stress. A letter was sent to the college principal on May 27 last year that approval of the DPI (Colleges) for discontinuation was necessary as it was an aided course. The DPI (Colleges), in turn, directed the petitioner not to discontinue admission for the course for academic session 2020-21 till a decision was taken.Justice Mittal added the Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service of Employees) Act, 1974, was framed to provide security of service to the employees of affiliated colleges and to grant pensionary benefits to employees appointed against the aided posts. But the Act’s provisions did not entitle the government to interfere in the matter of discontinuance of a course. Justice Mittal directed the university to take a decision on the petitioner’s request expeditiously and not later than four weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-punjab-has-no-jurisdiction-over-discontinuing-academic-course-290622

But Ram was charged extra. So, the commission have imposed a fine of Rs 3,000 on the Lehra Bega toll plaza and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bathindas-lehra-bega-toll-plaza-fined-rs-3k-for-overcharging-290624

Since water level in the Ghaggar has crossed the danger mark and is still increasing, we could not drain out rainwater from our fields into the Ghaggar,” said Jasvir Singh, a farmer from Moonak.Sangrur Chief Agriculture Officer Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal said, “We are in touch with the senior authorities and updating them regularly.”The affected villages of Andana block include Makraud Sahib, Mandvi, Chandu, Bushehra, Shergarh, Shahpur Thedi, Nawagaon, Banarasi, Andana, Chatha Gobindpura, Phulad, Hamirgarh, Bhundar Bhaini, Surjan Bhaini, Salemgarh and Moonak while the remaining villages are in the Lehra block.“The Punjab Government has not released required funds to strengthen embankments and for draining out rainwater.
