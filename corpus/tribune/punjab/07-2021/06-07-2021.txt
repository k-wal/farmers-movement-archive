If these fixed charges being paid to Private Power Plants under PPAs were not paid, it would directly & immediately decrease cost of Power in Punjab by Rs. 1.20 per unit,” claimed the Amritsar East legislator.Questioning the clauses of the power purchase pacts, Sidhu claimed that PPAs, which were signed during the previous regime, were based on a “wrong calculation” of power demand in the state.“Peak Demand of 13,000-14,000 MW is only for four Months whereas Non-Peak power demand falls down to 5000-6000 MW, But PPAs have been designed & signed to pay fixed charges at the peak demand,” he claimed.He also pointed out that there was no provision for mandatory supply of electricity during the paddy transplantation.“Even more alarming! There is No Provision for mandatory supply of power from these Private Power Plants during the peak season under the PPAs... Thus, they have shut down two power plants in this paddy-sowing season without repairing them & Punjab has to buy additional power,” Sidhu claimed in another tweet.He claimed that the “faulty” PPAs have cost people of Punjab “thousands of crores”.“Punjab has paid Rs 3,200 crore just as Coal-washing charges due to faulty replies to pre-bid queries before signing PPAs. Private Plants keep finding loopholes to file litigation that has cost Punjab Rs 25,000 crore already,” he claimed.

Their work is as difficult as managing the centre stage at the Singhu border. Members of various teams constantly make strategies and start working early in the morning.In Nawanshahr, teams have been divided into four zones Nawanshahr, Banga, Aur and Balachaur block.Members sensitise youngsters and masses to visit Singhu border to keep the movement alive. Apart from holding protests, press conferences and meets, the teams look after every aspect of giving momentum to the cause.Showing black flags to Congress MP Manish Tewari on his recent visit to Nawanshahr to burning copies of the agri laws, the farm unions have proved their strength and presence in remote areas as well.Bhupinder Singh Waraich, coordinator, Kirti Kisan Union (Nawanshahr), said there’s no stopping now. “We raise issues that affect general public. Recently, we protested against the state government for not providing electricity for 8 hours during the paddy season. Now, we have planned to hold a huge protest on July 8 against increase in prices of petrol and diesel. In the same manner, we follow orders of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and act accordingly,” he said.Waraich said despite farmers being busy during transplantation of paddy, they ensure that morale of their counterparts at Singhu, Tikri and Ghaziabad borders, stays high. He said a bus full of farmers and their supporters heads to Delhi every week.Women have been contributing equally. Groups of women had started awareness campaigns in Nawanshahr villages months ago. They have been going to every household and organising meetings to make people aware of the agri laws. “We talk to women and tell them that the fight can be won only if they support farmers and do their bit,” said a member of a women team.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/behind-the-scenes-the-unseen-forces-holding-farmers-movement-together-279011

To ensure transparency in the working of manufacturing units and plug loopholes, the department decided to get a third-party audit done from the IIT-Ropar. — TNS45 plants covered||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/iit-ropar-begins-liquor-units-audit-278655

06-07-2021||Saurabh Malik||Peddlers engaging poor, jobless for drug supply: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 5Drug peddlers are engaging unemployed persons, addicts and the poor to act as carriers to escape the police net by not getting caught with the contraband, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear.The Bench added not being found in possession of narcotics and drugs was not a pointer towards their innocence when other incriminating circumstances showed their involvement.The ruling by Justice HS Madaan came on a petition by a 35-year-old man seeking pre-arrest bail in a case registered on February 26 under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act registered at the Verka police station, Amritsar Police Commissionerate.The petitioner was nominated as an accused in the case following alleged disclosure statements made by some other accused during the course of investigation. It was alleged the accused used to purchase heroin from the petitioner.Justice Madaan also made it clear that the custodial interrogation of the petitioner-accused was essential “to find out from where he had been procuring the contraband and to which other persons he had been supplying the same”. It was also essential to find out details of the drug cartel and chain of supply. The investigating agency would not be able to find out the further links in the chain and to know about the drug peddlers higher in the hierarchy in case his custodial interrogation was denied.“The drug peddlers are cautious and careful not to get themselves caught with the contraband. Rather, as has been noticed, they generally engage unemployed persons, drug addicts and poor persons to act as carriers so as to deliver the drugs to the consumers. Therefore, not actually been found in possession of narcotics and drugs does not point out towards their innocence when other incriminating circumstances are there to show their involvement,” Justice Madaan asserted.Referring to two other criminal cases registered against the petitioner-accused, Justice Madaan added it, rather, went on to show that he had been treading the path of crime. His readiness and wiliness to join the investigation also failed to find favour with the Bench as Justice Madaan observed custodial interrogation was more elicitation oriented since a person couched in comparative safety of pre-arrest bail would certainly not disclose all the facts within his knowledge.Amritsar caseThe ruling by Justice HS Madaan came on a petition by a 35-year-old man seeking pre-arrest bail in a case registered on February 26 under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act filed at the Verka police station, Amritsar Police Commissionerate||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/peddlers-engaging-poor-jobless-for-drug-supply-hc-278657

Sources say the fresh stocks are expected to reach on Friday.A senior official in the health department said in Muktsar district, 25,229 doses were administered on Saturday and 6,091 on Sunday. “The state government had told us to hold mega vaccination camps and use the stock within two days or the remaining vaccine will be transferred to some other district. This is why we held several camps in the district and finished the stock,” the official said.On this, some local residents said it was surprising that the government, just to create some record, asked the officials to use the stock within two days. “There should be some foolproof planning to vaccinate people every day. The shortage creates panic,” they said.Dr Ranju Singla, Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Muktsar, said: “The vaccine is out of stock at present. The fresh stocks are expected to reach here by Friday.”Notably, in the past too, the vaccines had gone out of stock on June 28 and the vaccination drive was resumed on July 3.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-weekend-mega-camps-muktsar-runs-out-of-vax-again-278662

Consequently, cess worth crores has not been deposited at the labour department, which is used for the welfare of construction workers.As per the BOCW Cess Act, 1996, 1 per cent of the total cost of any construction facility has to be deposited with the labour department as labour cess. The Education Department, in 2016, had already issued orders to the District Education Officers, stating every school had to deposit 1 per cent cess for any construction work at the school. However, none of the schools, despite the instructions, paid the labour cess.VK Janjua, Principal Secretary, said, “We will again write to the Education Secretary to issue fresh directions to schools to deposit the labour cess.”Meanwhile, school heads and principals, who get the construction work done, told The Tribune that they were neither informed by any government agency nor had they received any additional amount for labour cess.

The only way forward is a new legislation in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha with retro-effect capping power purchase prices to make the anti-people agreements redundant.”In a veiled attack on the Chief Minister, the former Cabinet Minister, in another tweet, said: “A white paper on PPAs must be brought in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha to make Badals and other authors of these corrupt agreements accountable to people... I have been demanding this since 2017, but the bureaucratic control of departments corners people-elected ministers to mere showpieces.”Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa, too, sought to know the concrete steps taken to renegotiate the PPAs during four and a half years of governance. “The PPAs signed by the SAD-BJP government are still enforced. These agreements have caused irreparable financial burden on the state. The same officials who negotiated these anti-Punjab PPAs on behalf of the previous government are still holding important positions in the present dispensation. It must be mentioned here that these individuals can create a roadblock for any long-term change to the status quo,” he said.Bajwa pointed towards an order of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) allowing BSES, a power distribution company in Delhi, to renegotiate its PPA with the NTPC-Dadri power plant on July 1. Similarly, the Government of Uttar Pradesh has also in the past successfully renegotiated signed PPAs.MP Manish Tewari said review or cancellation of the PPAs was a complex legal issue. “It must be done.

The state has been given three years for converting all open storage facilities into covered structures.However, the state is in a dilemma over the issue as it wants the Centre to give it some guarantee for the usage of the capacity they create either on their own or through private entities. As the two sides get locked in the nitty-gritties of the issue, nearly 100 LMT of wheat is currently stocked in the open, vulnerable to the vagaries of weather as well as pest infestation.Official government sources admit that the directions from the Centre had been received and the state was in agreement for the construction of closed storage facilities. The state plans to construct closed foodgrain storage structures, having a combined capacity of 63 LMT. To begin with, all state food procurement agencies — PUNGRAIN, Punjab Warehousing Corporation, Punjab Agro Industries Corporation, PUNSUP and MARKFED — will be building 2 LMT of the covered storage each.“The problem, however, is that who will pay the rent for the storage facilities and ensure that the highly cost intensive infrastructure that is created, remains economically viable. There could be times where there is no use of the storage facilities, as Punjab moves an average of 20 LMT of grains to the recipient states each month,” said a senior government official.However, Punjab is planning to launch the Expression of Interest (EOI) for creating this storage soon, even as the Centre has indicated that a guarantee would not be possible and that it should create structures on the same pattern as Haryana (which is also a food producing state).Interestingly, other than the state government, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) itself is contemplating creating silo storage of 19.75 LMT in the state. Confirming this, AS Thind, chief general manager, FCI-Punjab, said the proposal was still in a nascent stage. He said Punjab already had 5.50 LMT of silo storage. “As more scientific storage is created in the state, the stock damage will be reduced substantially, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-tells-punjab-to-do-away-with-open-storage-space-for-foodgrain-278672

Subsidised power was currently being given to 1,43,812 industrial units in Punjab with an annual subsidy of Rs 2,226 crore, he claimed.“In sharp contrast to Punjab, where my government is giving free power worth Rs 6,735 crore to 13,79,217 farmers, the AAP government in Delhi has made no effort whatsoever to extend similar support to the agricultural community there,” said the Chief Minister. Pointing out that the Kejriwal government was among the first to notify one of the anti-farmer laws of the Centre in Delhi, he accused AAP of pretending to sympathise with farmers of Punjab.Capt Amarinder said the Delhi Government was fooling people by putting a small amount into one pocket, by way of 200 units of free domestic power, and taking away a higher amount from the other in the form of high tariffs being paid by shopkeepers, industry and farmers for commercial and agriculture power. The Delhi Government was charging Rs. 11.34 per unit from small shopkeepers and other commercial establishments, which was 50% higher than what was being charged in Punjab, he claimed. In fact, he said, every resident of Delhi was indirectly paying much more for power than what was being paid by residents of Punjab.“The Punjab Government is paying an annual power subsidy bill of Rs 10,458 crore, while the Kejriwal government is paying Rs 2,820 crore, when the population of Delhi is a mere two crore compared with Punjab’s three crore. This translates into average power subsidy in Punjab at Rs. 3,486 per person, as against Rs 1,410 for a Delhi resident,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/arvind-kejriwal-making-false-promises-punjab-cm-278675

Warring has accused Manpreet of adopting pick-and-choose policy while releasing funds.Speaking to The Tribune over the phone today, Warring said: “Yesterday, Manpreet had come to Madhir village here to attend a bhog ceremony of his distant relative, who is still an Akali. He announced Rs 30 lakh for the discharge of water from village pond, even though on member of the village panchayat was present there.”He said: “Manpreet recently announced some funds for Fattanwala village in the memory of his close relative. Similarly, he recently announced some funds at the bhog ceremony of the mother of his close aide in Bathinda town. Further, he sanctioned development funds for a municipal ward in Muktsar town, where the councillor is his close aide.”Warring said: “I ask the Finance Minister to release funds for government colleges as well, which were announced in the first budget of the present government. Major construction work of these colleges is still pending. Further, Kotbhai to Bhallaiana is a planned road in Gidderbaha and I have repeatedly requested to all those concerned to release funds for its repair, but to no avail. Similarly, nearly 50 village ponds in Gidderbaha require funds for cleaning. The funds should be released for these villages too.”Manpreet was not available for comment, but his brother-in-law Jaijeet Singh Johal ‘Jojo’ said: “Manpreet had gone to attend a bhog ceremony at Madhir village, where some Congressmen met him and requested him to announce funds for the village pond’s pipeline. Being the Finance Minister, he simply announced it. Warring should be happy to have received funds for his constituency rather than making it an issue.”A few days ago when former MLA Bathinda-cum-SAD leader Sarup Chand Singla raised the issue of alleged illegal mining in Bathinda, accusing Manpreet and Jojo, Warring had shared the video on social media and demanded a probe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-mla-raja-warring-targets-punjab-fm-manpreet-badal-over-funds-278676

Briefing on the end-of RMS (2021-22) procurement, FCI CMD Atish Chandra said the highest procurement of 132.10 LMT wheat was from Punjab. Last year, Madhya Pradesh topped the list. According to Chandra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and J&K recorded their “best-ever”.     An all-time high MSP of Rs 84, 369.19 crore was directly transferred into the accounts of 4916424 farmers across the country under the 'One Nation, One MSP, One DBT' scheme. A record 49.16 lakh farmers benefitted against 43.35 lakh, last year, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said. Story HighlightsAccording to the FCI CMD, Rs 26103.89 crore were paid to 885117 farmers in Punjab and Rs 16706.33 crore to 760636 farmers in Haryana, the two states leading the agitation against three central farm laws. It was the first time that farmers in the two states received remuneration for grain directly into their accounts.With 132.10 LMT wheat procured from the state, Punjab regained its leader’s position among states and UTs from where central and state agencies procure grains for welfare schemes. With 129. 42 LMT in 2020-21 RMS, Madhya Pradesh topped the list followed by Punjab (127.14 LMT). This year, 128.08 LMT wheat was procured from MPAmid the expected issues related to bumper procurement and storage management, Chandra said “preparations for extra storage were made in advance based on procurement targets. Some unscientific storage is due to huge volumes of procurement. Currently, only 17.91 LMT grain is under unscientific storage. It is a small amount compared to what we have under scientific storage. We are committed to liquidating by July-end by disbursing it to beneficiaries. The PMGKAY has been greatly helpful. During 2020-21, only 0.003 per cent of grain (1800 tonnes) were damaged,” he said.       Notably, most of the grain under unscientific storage is in Punjab and Haryana.Chandra said the FCI moved highest ever foodgrains, 594 LMT in 2020-21 in comparison to 389 LMT during 2019-20 under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna.The Centre is running the longest ever exercise of distributing free food grains to people during this pandemic time, Pandey said, adding that 278.25 LMT foodgrains have been allocated under PMGKY 3 & 4 for the benefit of the most vulnerable.Close to 1.5 crore monthly portability transactions are being recorded under ONORC, he said, adding that the Centre will very soon finalise a modal guideline based on suggestions received from States/UTs for preparing a list of common factors for inclusion or exclusion in ration cards for beneficiaries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/record-procurement-of-wheat-at-433-24-lmt-in-rms-2021-22-says-centre-278627

Police also used teargas shells to stop the protesters.Earlier, talking to the media, Rana slammed the Amarinder Singh-led government in Punjab for “not being able to curb the drug trade in the state which has flourished under the Congress rule”.He said before coming to power in 2017, Amarinder had promised to wipe out drug menace from the state.But he has completely “failed” in doing so. In fact, drug trade had “flourished in the state”, Rana claimed.
