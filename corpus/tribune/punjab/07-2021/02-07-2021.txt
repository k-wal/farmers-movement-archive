02-07-2021||Faridkot||Police firing: SIT records Panthic leader’s statement||Probing the six-year-old incident of police firing on Sikh protesters at Kotkapura, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Punjab Police on Friday recorded the statements of many persons, including Panthic leaders Panthpreet Singh and Rupinder Singh Panjgrain, both key and prime witnesses to the Kotkapura police firing incident of October 14, 2015.The SIT had also summoned Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, one of the prime witnesses, but he could not make it before the SIT today.In his statement to the SIT, Panthpreet Singh alleged that on October 14, 2015, the police used teargas shells, cane-charged protesters and fired in the air at a chowk in Kotkapura to disperse peaceful protesters.In his statement to the SIT, he claimed that after the sacrilege incident at a gurdwara in Bargari on October 12, 2015, the Sikh sangat had moved to Kotkapura and started a peaceful protest dharna.Next day, on October 13, Ranbir Singh Khatra, the then IGP, reached the dharna site and the participants offered their arrest to him.“The police arrested us in full public view but instead of sending us to jail, they released us after four hours as their motive was just to disperse the gathering,” claimed Panthpreet.“We again assembled at the chowk and resumed the dharna. On October 14, the police asked us to offer arrest. We agreed but asked them to send us directly to the jail and not harass us like the previous day. But all of sudden, the police resorted to unprovoked use of force, used teargas to disperse protesters and opened firing in the air to scare them away,” he said.“Many innocent persons were injured in this use of force by the police and a large number of them were put under arrest and sent to the judicial custody for two days,” he said.On October 14, 2015, immediately after the police firing incident, a criminal case was registered against 15 protesters, including Bhai Panthpreet Singh and Bhai Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale, for the alleged offence of instigating the protesters to attack the police with sharp-edged weapons and opening fire on cops.However, in August last year, the SIT headed by then IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had declared about 20 persons, including both these Sikh preachers as innocent.Panthpreet Singh rued that the FIR in the case against them was still not cancelled despite the state police declaring them innocent and they were entangled in a false case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-firing-sit-records-panthic-leaders-statement-277229

Besides, I used to get a message on my cellphone every morning about the power requirement in the state and the generation capacity. However, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh is least bothered about the power scenario in the state. The demand for electricity has increased with the passage of time, but he has not done anything to increase the generation. Some power plants are still not operating to their full capacity."He termed Amarinder a 'nikamma' (useless) man. "Recently, I found illegal mining in the Beas. However, Amarinder registered a case against me. I challenge him to arrest me," said Sukhbir.The SAD chief said he would visit Fazilka, Jalalabad and Jalandhar on Friday.

Initially, the government had ordered a ban on use of ACs in offices, which was later revoked and offices were asked to function from 8 am to 2 pm.The Chief Minister urged the protesting Power Department employees to call off their strike, which had aggravated the crisis, with complaints of breakdowns resulting from overloading of feeders and sub-stations not being addressed promptly.Reviewing the situation at a high-level meeting, the Chief Minister constituted a three-member committee, comprising Additional Chief Secretary (Development), PSPCL CMD and Special Secretary (Finance), to resolve the grievances of the agitating employees.He assured the employees of duly considering their genuine demands for appropriate action. He pointed out that many of the demands of the employees, such as increase in employee National Pension System (NPS) share, restoration of generation incentive, etc. had already been accepted, and the 6th Pay Commission scales were also being implemented by various boards/corporations of the state.The Chief Minister urged the employees to withdraw their agitation in the interest of the state’s agriculture and industry, as well as domestic consumers who were facing a difficult time due to prolonged power outages amid the Covid pandemic.

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab industries in 2 zones to shut for 2 days||As Punjab grapples with an unprecedented power crisis, industry in many parts of the state has been directed to shut operations for two days from 2 pm on Friday , even as domestic and commercial power consumers face unscheduled power cuts.Had warned govt: UnionPSEB Engineers’ Association president Jasvir Singh Dhiman said they had warned the government not to shut the Bathinda thermal plant and two units of Ropar plant. “Now Punjab is facing a shortage in peak summer, thanks to the lopsided power purchase pacts,” he said.There has been a massive surge in power demand in the agriculture sector, because of the ongoing paddy cultivation. The shutting down of two units — one at Talwandi Sabo (660 MW) and the other at Ropar (140 MW) — has only added to the shortage. Against a demand of 14,600 MW, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) could today supply 13,124 MW of power. The 1,500-MW shortfall led to the power utilities imposing restrictions. Widespread protests were held across the state against the power cuts, with the AAP and SAD turning it into a big issue.State appeals to BBMBPunjab has appealed to BBMB to supply it additional power, but this may be difficult because of the low water level in the dam.Due to the demand-supply gap, industrial units located in the central zone (Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh, Khanna, Amloh and Sirhind) and north zone (Jalandhar, Phagwara and Hoshiarpur) of the state, have been directed to shut down their operations compulsorily for 48 hours, from 8 am on Friday. They can now resume operations only after 8 am on Sunday. Initially, the 48 hour cut was imposed from 2 pm today. The industry in these areas constitutes 90 per cent of the total units in Punjab.Industrialists said the shutdown would hit them hard. “With a two-day cut, the loss in Mandi Gobindgarh alone will be Rs 150 crore. The government could have imposed a daily 12-hour cut, rather than two compulsory weekly offs. That way industry would have been able to function and retain labour,” said Mahinder Pal Gupta, president, Induction Furnace Association. In Ludhiana, industrialists said the imposition of power cuts would break the back of the already struggling industry. Badish Jindal, president, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Federation, asked: “How can industry survive in this situation?”Information received from the PSPCL showed that the demand in the agriculture sector had peaked to over 4,000 MW. “Due to the delay in monsoon and the falling groundwater table, farmers are being forced to use higher capacity pump sets to draw groundwater for cultivation. Till last year, the peak demand had not exceeded 13,000 MW. Our system has transmission capacity of 6,400 MW over and above the generation. The current transmission is 7,400 MW. We will have to control the demand in the peak months, as no system can be prepared for the seasonal variations in power demand (from 4,500 MW in winters to 15,000 MW now),” said A Venu Prasad, chairman, PSPCL.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-industries-in-2-zones-to-shut-for-2-days-276828

02-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court: Quasi-solitary confinement illegal||Prisoners are human beings despite their liberty having been curtailed, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today ruled, adding the confinement of “professional criminals” such as “gangsters” in individual cells for the most part of the day for limitless periods was impermissible.Bench observationsHolding their “quasi-solitary confinement” to be illegal and violative of the rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, Justice Sudhir Mittal suggested housing identified prisoners in separate barracks, instead of cells with “mess” provision.Justice Mittal asserted more than four decades had elapsed since the Supreme Court asserted “protection of the prisoner within his rights was part of the office of Article 32”. But the true import of the Supreme Court directions apparently had not percolated to the prison administrators.Justice Mittal was hearing petitions filed through counsel R Kartikeya, Saurav Bhatia, Amjad Khan, Adarsh Priyadarshi and Raghav Sharma. Justice Mittal observed each of the petitioner-prisoners was being confined to a separate cell for 22 hours a day. Such confinement was not strictly solitary, but could be called quasi-solitary as the inmate was deprived of human company for extended lengths of time. Such confinement was held to be extremely harsh and violative of basic human rights.Measures had been and were being enforced to maintain prison discipline and prevent crime syndicates from operating within the prisons. But security measures could be imposed only up to a limit “and this limit was placed by fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 19 and 21”, which were available even to the prisoners.Justice Mittal added the prisoners may not enjoy all rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Yet, basic rights and liberties were available to them. The court process restricted the liberty of prisoners. The same courts also had the duty to monitor that the liberty was not restricted beyond the bounds of law.

The CM reportedly told the participants it was not the right forum and the decision of the party high command on the issue would be the final word.Buzz over two state party presidentsParty leaders were quick to point out the timing of the demand being raised as the Chief Minister is learnt to have already opposed the move to appoint Sidhu as the PPCC chief. Party sources said it was difficult for the Congress to have two Jat Sikh leaders in prominent roles — one as a CM and the other as the PPCC chief.A majority of the leaders demanded fielding Hindu faces in urban Assembly segments such as Bathinda (Urban), Gurdaspur and Moga, where Jat faces had been fielded in the 2017 Assembly elections.They said by ignoring traditional congressmen families, party’s base among the Hindu voter was eroding. A general opinion was conveyed that for four-and-a-half years, no one in the government or party bothered to talk to traditional party leaders hailing from the Hindu or OBC community and now they were being called when elections were a few months away.Former Batala MLA Ashwani Sekhri, who was recently in the news for being in talks with the SAD, told the CM about the role played by a minister of the Majha brigade in trying to push him into political oblivion. He minced no words in telling the CM he had almost decided to change his party before being persuaded not to do so.Another leader, Anish Sidana, told the CM about the need for the MLAs to give due respect to the party rank and file in urban areas and involve them in development works. Raising the issue of OBC leaders, Sidana said the minority communities looked upon the CM to maintain peace and harmony.A former Moga MLA, Malti Thapar, complained about the need to rehabilitate the families of traditional congressmen and non-involvement of the PPCC in acting as a bridge between the workers and CM.Punjab Subordinate Service Selection Board chairman Raman Bahl complained about Hindu leadership being sidelined in the traditional Hindu belt of Gurdaspur.Party leader Pawan Dewan demanded due representation to urban leaders in boards and corporation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hindu-leaders-oppose-navjot-sidhu-as-pcc-chief-276874

He was booked for rioting and sedition by Delhi Police for Republic Day violence and has since been on the run. Police have announced a bounty of Rs 1 lakh to anyone who can provide information that could lead to his arrest.“I went with my friends to participate in the farm protest at Delhi borders only. On January 26, the farm unions communicated to conduct a march on the Ring Road only. There was no pre-planned programme to go to Lal Quila, but as everyone was in high spirits, I too went there with the flow of sangat,” he said.  He added that the fellow protesters who could not climb the flagpole to hoist the ‘Khalsa flag’ asked him (Jugraj) to climb the flagpole and then he agreed to do so. “Without considering its repercussions, I just did it out of ‘josh’. It was a bare pole with no flag on it, as was being wrongly projected earlier,” he said.When asked about Deep Sidhu who was charged as main conspirator, he said, “I had never heard about him or met him. We were a group of friends and were in high spirits then.”On June 30, SGPC awarded the family of Jugraj Singh.

Industrial units can now resume operations only after 2 pm on Saturday. Industrial units in these areas constitute 90 percent of the total units in the state.Unscheduled power cuts, ranging from two to six hours, have also been reported across the state, to meet the huge surge in demand in the agriculture sector.The move, say industrialists, will hit them hard, especially in the ongoing economic slowdown. “With two days’ cut, the loss in Mandi Gobindgarh alone would be Rs 150 crore. The government should have imposed a daily 12-hour cut rather than two compulsory weekly offs, so that the industry could be able to function everyday and retain labour,” said MahinderPal Gupta, president, Induction Furnace Association.Information received from the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited shows that the gap in demand and supply of power has reached almost 1500 MW today, owing to high demand for running tube wells for irrigating the paddy fields.Officials in the state power utilities said that other than relying on the short- and long-term power agreements, they are buying over 7000 MW of power from the power exchange.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/severe-power-shortage-shuts-industrial-units-for-2-days-in-parts-of-punjab-276748
