Lekhi, he said, had no right to defame the farmers in such manner. The Delhi Police should file a case and investigate the case to identify the accused, and the law should take its own course, he said, adding that the BJP had no right to condemn the farmers in such an outrageous manner over the incident.Pointing to the disparaging comments made by various BJP leaders against the farmers since their agitating started at the Delhi borders, he said the ruling party had been trying to malign the farmers and undermine their peaceful protests from the outset. He recalled that BJP leaders had even earlier tried to defame the farmers with slanderous descriptions like ‘terrorists’ and ‘urban Naxalites’.Having failed to deter the farmers, who had been braving the elements with many losing their lives in this fight for their rights, the BJP leadership was once again resorting to such shameful tactics out of sheer frustration, said the Chief Minister.From the enactment of the draconian laws to their apathetic attitude towards the farmers, without whom India would still have been begging to feed its people, the BJP-led central government had proved, time and again, that it was not interested in hearing the voice of the ‘annadaatas’, said the Chief Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/attack-on-journalist-condemnable-but-lekhi-has-no-right-to-defame-farmers-punjab-cm-286787

These hoardings are otherwise big enough to bear the pictures of AICC leaders, including Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and all local MLAs, but the sponsors perhaps deliberately chose not to put the pictures of the CM as a part of the exercise to appease Sidhu.The posters put by Jalandhar councillor Rohan Sehgal have a bold picture of Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh, whose patronage he enjoys. It bears a tag line, ‘Sirjange nawan Punjab (we will create a new Punjab), Team Navjot Singh Sidhu’.Another kind of hoarding in the city, put up by Youth Congress leader Ravinder Singh Laddi, even has the picture of PUNSUP chairman Tajinder Bittu and National Youth Congress Spokesperson Gautam Seth among the AICC and the state leaders, but not that of the CM.The party’s senior leaders today commented on the issue saying: “It is because of such workers who keep instigating one camp that the dividing lines between two factions in the party have deepened further. While it was a mistake or a failure of the party high command to have not called in both the fiercely fighting leaders, including the CM and the new PPCC chief together while making the announcement, the local workers were further instigating the matter and indulging in such actions that have been causing irritation to the rival camps”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-missing-in-navjot-sidhus-new-hoardings-in-jalandhar-286608

He recognised the support provided by NABARD for creation of irrigation and rural connectivity in Punjab. He said the support provided to milk processing plant at Bassi Pathana was going to benefit the farmers involved in dairy farming. He felt the need to diversify crop pattern in the state from monoculture of wheat and paddy to horticulture crops and commercialise seed production.In his welcome address, Dr Rajiv Siwach, CGM, NABARD, Punjab Regional Office, discussed about immense human suffering on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in spite of the disruptions in the agricultural value chain, the positive aspect has been that the agriculture sector had shown positive growth during 2020-21. Punjab, being the grain bowl of the country, made a record procurement of paddy and wheat during the year. He said NABARD had doubled infrastructure support in the state to the tune of Rs600 crore during last financial year. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/need-for-diversifying-crop-pattern-in-punjab-official-286520

Once considered to be Capt Amarinder Singh’s blue-eyed men, Cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa find themselves heading a separate entity. Both are dyed-in-the-wool Congressmen with their fathers remaining MLAs. So much so, they had spearheaded Amarinder’s fight back to wrest the PPCC when Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa was catapulted as its president in 2015.Amid all this factionalism, the bureaucracy is unsure of whom to follow — the CM’s orders or instructions of these ministers. As for now, if serpentine queues out the residences of Randhawa at his native village of Dharowali and in Bajwa’s home turf of Qadian are any indication, it is these ministers who are still calling the shots.Partap Bajwa is leading a splinter group in which Bhoa MLA Joginder Pal is playing a key role. The third group, popularly known as ‘Capt’s men’, comprises MLAs Fatehjang Bajwa and Balwinder Laddi. The fourth faction is being led by three-time Batala Ex MLA Ashwani Sekhri and comprises mainly of municipal councillors.Rising factionalism||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gurdaspur-congress-leaders-divided-over-navjot-sidhu-isuue-286401

The further investigation revealed that the Delta variant remained predominant even in the month of June this year.Even during the Covid review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, the new variants were a matter of concern. However, after two cases reported in the month of June, no new cases of the Delta-Plus variant have been reported so far.As per the genome sequencing data compiled by the state, the Alpha variant dominated the scene till March this year and there was no case of Delta variant till February.In February, 70 per cent cases of Alpha variant were found, which increased to 95 per cent in March. However, the variant started weakening after March and came down to 40 per cent in April and reduced to just 3.9 per cent in May.When Alpha was fading away, Delta variant was emerging on the scene. The first case of Delta was detected in the month of March. In March, it made just 0.5 per cent of the variants. And after that, it started dominating the scenario.

It will be a problem in remote areas because cryogenic oxygen production is energy intensive and will result in pressure on transport services.”Dr J Nagendra Babu, Assistant Prof (Chemistry), CUP, said: “These MOFs can be used as substitute for costly zeolites and molecular sieves that are being used commercially. These are easy to prepare in energy-efficient greener synthetic methods.

We vehemently condemn it. Who else is suppose to keep a record of deaths of farmers during the agitation if not the government?

22-07-2021||Aman Sood||Punjab power surplus as demand halves||Tribune News ServicePatiala, July 21From over 15,000 MW of peak demand, which the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) failed to meet almost 10 days back, the power demand has now dropped drastically to less than 7,000 MW. Punjab has already shut its state-owned thermal plant units as it is getting much cheaper power from the power exchange to meet its present demand of around 6,800 MW, following widespread rains.With restrictions on all categories of industry and consumers already lifted, the state is ‘under-drawing’ power, which means it has more power and the demand is low. However, Punjab is still unable to sell its power as the rates of power in the central exchange are much cheaper. Rains in the past week have ensured the demand drops to less than 50 per cent within 10 days.Last week, the maximum demand in the state touched over 15,500 MW while the PSPCL was able to supply only around 13,000 MW. “There are no power restrictions on any category since the past over a week and despite shutting our own thermal plant units, we have sufficient power with us. We are buying power at Rs 2 per unit, which is much cheaper,” said CMD PSPCL A Venu Prasad. “Almost 10 days back, the PSPCL had to buy power at over Rs 12 per unit to meet the demand,” he said.Interestingly, despite having surplus power now, the PSPCL is still unable to sell power in the exchange corridor as the rates of power produced in Punjab are much higher than the rates at which it is available in the exchange. While the state has its own generation of about 5,500 MW from various sources, including solar, it can import a maximum of 7,300 MW from the northern grid, with some temporary relief to draw more.A former chief engineer with the PSPCL said, “There are lessons to be learnt from this paddy season and the PSPCL needs to improve its infrastructure to get additional power from the national grid. It should review the private purchase agreements, which have failed to ensure uninterrupted power when we faced peak demand.”Punjab witnessed an all-time high power demand this paddy season. Due to a prolonged dry spell, increase in demand of power from the agricultural sector, reduced availability due to low reservoir levels/reduced generation from hydropower stations and outage of units at private thermal plants, the state faced power cuts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-power-surplus-as-demand-halves-286414

Many beneficiaries reportedly did not even have a land holding in their name, putting a question mark on whether they were farmers, while many of those who owned more than 5 acres and/ or were income-tax payees, too, got the benefit.The discrepancy regarding income tax-paying land owners came to light more than a year ago, as farmers had self-registered for the scheme. Since then, the Punjab Government had stopped enrolling more farmers and applications of almost seven lakh individuals are pending. Now, the state Agriculture and Revenue Departments are together developing a mechanism to match the land record details of those who have enrolled and those wanting to enrol, by integrating land records of all applicants with their forms and Aadhaar cards.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar had said 5,62,256 ineligible state farmers got Rs 437 crore benefit, which would be recovered. State officials questioned as to how the ineligible farmers were decided when the verification of beneficiaries had not been done by the state or any other agency.Farmers call it Centre’s threat||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pm-kisan-scheme-centre-says-32-beneficiaries-ineligible-punjab-disagrees-286415

Before leaving for the Golden Temple, the MLAs, on the intervention of Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat, unanimously decided to send a written request signed by all, including Sidhu, urging the CM to attend the installation ceremony of the new PCC chief.It was felt that Sidhu’s installation as the state party chief in the absence of the Chief Minister on Friday would send a wrong message. A senior party leader Kuljit Singh Nagra, who has been appointed one of the working presidents, would personally deliver the letter to the CM tomorrow. Rawat, besides some other senior leaders are expected to attend the installation ceremony.Concerted efforts are on for reconciliation between the two leaders. Some senior leaders, including Lal Singh, Rana KP Singh and Rana Gurmeet Sodhi met the CM today. Since the general mood today in the CM camp was to take the step that was not in defiance of the party’s high command, a senior minister close to the CM has been tasked to reach out to Sidhu.During the day, the voices of dissent rose against the CM for not calling an unconditional truce.“If the CM can meet Sukhpal Khaira, who has passed personal and damaging comments against him, and Partap Bajwa, what is the harm in meeting Sidhu,” Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said, reminding the CM that they did not allow the party to split when Bajwa was removed as the PCC chief to make way for Capt Amarinder.Randhawa said he, along with Tript Bajwa and Sukhbinder Sarkaria, had gone to the house of senior leader Lal Singh to convey that they, along with Sidhu, could walk up to the CM, if he agreed to show a large heart.Randhawa said instead of giving statement that he would not meet Sidhu till he settled his issue with the CM, Brahm Mohindra should have taken Sidhu along to meet the CM. He claimed Sidhu had even called up Mohindra to make a courtesy call, but the latter said he was not well.MLA Pargat Singh too questioned the CM’s firm stand on the apology at a time when people are giving a rousing welcome to Sidhu. Minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa said the CM should show a big heart and bury differences with Sidhu.Meanwhile, party’s state affairs in-charge Harish Rawat, who would attend Sidhu’s installation ceremony, is likely to hold discussions on the selection of other office-bearers of the state body. Poll strategist Prashant Kishor is in touch with the party for chalking out the roadmap for the 2022 Assembly elections.Voices of dissent grow louder No harm in meeting Sidhu"We all want unity and will not allow anyone, even Capt Amarinder Singh, to split the party.

He can forget Sidhu’s tweets as he has forgotten the letters and public remarks made against him by Partap Bajwa." —Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Cabinet MinisterEven CM should apologise"Why should Sidhu apologise?

Clearly, this is aimed at sending out the message that a majority of legislators are with Sidhu. Sidhu’s predecessor Jakhar, after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple, said: “It is wrong to call it a show of strength. We are here to seek the blessings of the Almighty for the prosperity and unity of Punjab.” On Captain seeking an apology from Sidhu, some MLAs, including Pargat Singh and Jalalpur, said there was no need for it. “Sidhu’s appointment was made by the high command after deliberations with all stakeholders, including the CM,” minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/show-of-strength-by-navjot-singh-sidhu-amid-growing-pressure-on-captain-amarinder-singh-286494
