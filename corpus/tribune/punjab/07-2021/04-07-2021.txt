04-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt’s announcement on PPA review delayed but necessary: Cong MP Bajwa||Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Sunday said Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s announcement that the state government will be reviewing the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during the SAD-BJP regime is extremely delayed but absolutely necessary.Bajwa, a strident critic of Singh, also said the state government has not yet fulfilled its promise of releasing a white paper on the PPAs.Read also: Sidhu for cancelling Akalis’ power purchase pact; ‘who stopped you for 4.5 years,’ asks SukhbirOn Saturday, Singh said his government will soon announce a legal strategy to counter the “ill-conceived” PPAs signed during the SAD-BJP rule which have put an “atrociously unnecessary” financial burden on the state.He said of the 139 power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during the SAD-BJP rule, 17 were enough to cater to the state’s full electricity demand. The remaining 122 PPAs for 1,314 MWs of expensive power were inexplicably signed.In a statement, Bajwa said, “The statement made by the Chief Minister of Punjab that the state government is reviewing the ill-conceived PPAs signed by the previous SAD-BJP government is extremely delayed but absolutely necessary.”“These PPAs have been an albatross hanging around Punjab’s neck, bleeding the state exchequer dry,” he said.“The government has had over four years to focus on this issue. A suitable conclusion must be reached to ensure that the people of Punjab are no longer cheated by these agreements,” Bajwa said.“I must further point out that the Government of Punjab had promised a white paper on the issue in March 2020. Nearly 16 months later, no such information has been released by the state,” he said.Notably, the Congress, before coming to power in 2017, had promised that it would renegotiate the existing PPAs to ensure low-cost power.Bajwa said the state government should also ensure 300 units of free power for every household.“It is well known that the state of Punjab provides over Rs 6,000 crore as power subsidy to the agriculture sector and Rs 4,000 crore to other sectors. Given the large social net covered by the present subsidies, to extend (300 units of free power) to every household across the state would be overall beneficial to the people of Punjab,” he said.The MP also sought action against the erring officials of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for the current power crisis in the state.“The PSPCL must be held accountable for it being chronically unprepared for the supply of uninterrupted power. Heads must roll and the government must take stern action against the erring officials,” he said.Punjab has been reeling under an unprecedented power shortage with urban and rural areas facing long hours of load shedding amid scorching heat.The Congress-led government has been under fire from the opposition for not being able to provide sufficient electricity to consumers, especially to paddy growers for sowing their crops.The PSPCL has blamed the failure of one unit of the Talwandi Sabo power plant and a prolonged dry spell for the power crisis in the state.

Of the 139 PPAs signed during by the SAD-BJP Government, 17 were enough to cater to the state’s power demand, he said, adding that the remaining 122 were "inexplicably" signed. He appealed to the people to use power judiciously and cooperate with the government in overcoming the "temporary" crisis, saying against a supply of 13,500 MW, the demand last week had touched an unprecedented 16,000 MW, propelling the PSPCL to purchase 7,400 MW from outside the state — 1,000 MW more than what was purchased last year.The CM blamed the present power crisis on the Talwandi Sabo Power Plant that has shut one of its units. A notice has already been issued to the plant. It has been warned of a heavy penalty.Earlier in the day, the police used a water cannon to disperse AAP workers forcing their way to "gherao" the CM's residence at Siswan to protest against the frequent power cuts across the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ill-conceived-badal-era-ppas-under-review-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-277861

A former chief engineer said just ahead of the paddy season, the PSPCL had claimed to have arranged ample power. “Now, it is blaming the high demand on delayed monsoon. It admitted that Punjab is seeing over 15,000 MW demand. Responsibility must be fixed for large variation in assessing demand,” he said.VK Gupta, spokesperson, All-India Power Engineers Federation, said, “Sidhu has rightly sought increased solar energy use. The PSPCL owns hundreds of acres which could be used to install solar plants.”Experts said the PSPCL had paid nearly Rs 20,000 crore as fixed charges to three private thermal plants installed during the SAD-BJP government. “There is no provision in the PPAs for any penalty even if these plants do not supply any power,” said the former chief engineer.A member of the PSEB Engineers Association said, “Owing to the faulty PPAs, Punjab is short of power during the peak paddy season and surplus for the remaining nine months.”The PSPCL said legal opinion was being sought on the issue of PPAs. A top official said, “The scenario with improve once it rains. The demand is exceptionally high due to delayed rains, shutdown of a unit and low water level in Bhakra canal.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/power-experts-back-sidhu-say-faulty-pacts-led-to-crisis-277875

Beneficiaries should make sure that their entry has been uploaded before leaving the vaccination centre. However, I will look into the matter.Now, he has been asked by the health officials to get himself registered on the Covid portal afresh although without getting a jab. Consequently, he, for no fault of his, will have to wait for the next three months to get the second dose of Covishield.The said beneficiaries, Ramanjot Singh (name changed), a student of Panjab University, said, “I had given the correct details during the vaccination. Initially, I was informed by the health officials that I will get a message soon. However, no vaccination message has been received so far.”He is not the only person who has been facing a dilemma.

However, in the previous week (June 19 to June 25), the number of doses administered was 6.47 lakh. However, after the decline, the state set a new record on Saturday.In a statement, Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the government for the first time received 6,84,240 doses of Covishield and 61,100 of Covaxin in a single installment late on Thursday evening. “After receiving the vaccine, the government prepared a roadmap of ‘Mega Vaccination Drive’ to cover a minimum of 5 lakh persons in one day,” he said.Sharing the district-wise data, Sidhu said Ludhiana led all districts by administering 82,667 doses, followed by Hoshiarpur (77,930) and Jalandhar (62,000).Pointing out the “disparity” while supplying the vaccine to states, the Health Minister said Punjab had been receiving less number of doses as compared to the neighboring states Haryana and Rajasthan, where the vaccination drive was in full swing.However, Punjab was running short of vaccine consecutively for three days. “Due to disparity in supply, some of the vaccination centres remained closed. The vaccination coverage of Punjab came down to just 16,000-17,000 from June 27 to July 2, but it swiftly moved up to 5 lakh after we received sufficient doses,” Sidhu said.Divulging details about the supply of vaccine last week, the Health Minister said Punjab received only 79,550 doses of Covishield on June 24, 79,540 on June 25 and 31,580 doses of Covaxin on June 29. The stock of Covishield remained almost nil from June 27 to July 1, which slowed down the vaccination drive. The number of Covid vaccination has been decreased from 1,14,655 on June 22 to 17,704 on July 1 in the state.Expressing concern over the third wave, Sidhu said the government had been preparing to cope up with any emergency, but less supply of vaccination from the Centre was hitting the drive hard.Currently, 4.8 per cent of Punjab’s eligible population was fully vaccinated. The state has administered 71.7 lakh doses of vaccine in the past four months. In break-up, 61.5 lakh people have been given the first dose and 10.2 lakh have been given both the doses.Among districts, Ludhiana tops the chart with 7.7 lakh doses, followed by Jalandhar (5.3 lakh), SAS Nagar (5.2 lakh), Hoshiarpur (4.3 lakh) and Amritsar (4.1 lakh).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-19-record-5-5l-jabbed-in-punjab-highest-in-a-day-277925

The arrests were made by multiple teams of the Cyber Cell and CIA-1 Ludhiana during raids in Mohali and New Delhi.Of these, nine were apprehended from a rented apartment in Kharar (Mohali), all from Gujarat, and included four key suspects Pratik, Peenak, Dhruv Mehta and Jigar. They were also running a fake call centre from their premises. The police also recovered 11 laptops, an iPad, 18 mobile phones, a Toyota Fortuner car, Rs 1 lakh cash and gold ornaments.Additional DCP (Crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, who busted the scam, said a similar modus operandi was being used at the Mohali-based fake call centre as well, whereby the suspects, posing as tax/insurance authorities, used to call unsuspecting citizens in other countries and committed financial frauds.The victims were asked to transfer money to bank accounts in their respective countries. The money was further transferred to India through hawala channels or cryptocurrency. Bitcoin wallets of the suspects were being confiscated and frozen.The ADCP said raids were conducted in the Chattarpur area of New Delhi, from where suspect Vaibhav Gupta was apprehended. He was the technical backbone of the module, providing software, server, call dialler, calling minute, troubleshooting support, etc. to the Ludhiana-based module.Gupta used to receive regular monthly payments for his services. “Since a majority of the payments by the suspects was made and received through hawala channels, raids were conducted in Ludhiana, leading to the arrest of Sachin Patel, hailing from Gujarat, from the Sham Nagar area and Rs 27 lakh in hawala money was recovered,” said ADCP Bhatti.Investigations in the case suggested the accused had bought multiple flats in posh localities of Ahmedabad from the proceeds of crime.Part of Ludhiana module||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/11-linked-to-fake-call-centre-case-nabbed-in-mohali-delhi-277924

The hooch tragedy had led to a massive outcry.Justice Gill asserted the greed of the accused was to earn money at the cost of lives of innocent and poor people. If anyone played havoc and committed brutality of killing people through passive modes for mere monetary benefits, the person did not deserve any leniency for snatching from others the right to live with dignity. The person was required to be dealt with an iron hand.Justice Gill added the petitioner was accused of a gruesome crime against society at large. The modus operandi and the mens rea behind preparation of spurious country made liquor with the objective of selling it to people from the underprivileged sections of society was a well-thought-out design. It had eaten into the very roots of society. One could not lose sight of such hooch tragedies reported in the recent past from different parts of the country, all leading to deaths of several persons from the marginalised sections of society.“As the people used to substance go berserk under the allurement of the liquor being cheap, none can speak of their prudence, at the dangling moment of addiction. It is this state of these hapless people, which is taken benefit of by the people like the petitioner,” Justice Gill asserted.Bail plea turned down||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hooch-tragedy-need-to-deal-with-bootleggers-firmly-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-277923

The anger may cost the party dear in the forthcoming Assembly elections.“I am not against any community, but since the formation of the Congress government, everyone is talking about Jat, Hindu and Dalit community leaders despite the fact that leaders of these communities have already been given due representation in the state government. No one is talking about Congress leaders belonging to the Backward Class community,” said Dhiman.In the letter, Dhiman alleged there was resentment among members of the community as they had not been given due respect by the Congress government.“During my recent meeting with senior Congress leaders in New Delhi, I had raised the issue of Backward Class leaders being sidelined. The anger among BC leaders may cost the party dear in the forthcoming Assembly elections,” he warned.Dhiman said the Congress had always taken care of all communities and he was hopeful the leadership would take a sympathetic view of his letter. “But if no action is taken, we will call a state-level meeting of leaders from the community in the coming days to take a call on our future course of action,” added Dhiman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bc-leaders-ignored-congress-mla-surjit-singh-dhiman-to-sonia-gandhi-277917

He said there were several attempts by some people to continue illegal mining, but the department acted swiftly against them.Alleging that Akalis looted the Punjab through sand mafia, Sarkaria said under the Badal regime, the state exchequer was receiving revenue to the tune of Rs 35 to 40 crore annually, which had now increased 10 fold.“Sukhbir knows that the transparency ensured by the Congress government in mining activities will become an issue in the Assembly poll,” said the minister, adding that Sukhbir was making “useless” visits just for “political” motives.Sarkaria said the Congress government had framed terms and conditions for contractors, who were earning good income besides supplying sand at affordable rates to people. A spokesperson of the Mining Department said the sites visited by Sukhbir had been allotted through e-auction to Prime Vision Industry Private Limited, 312, 3rd Floor, Vishal Chamber, P-1, Sector 18, Noida, and no illegal mining and machinery was found at the sites. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sites-auctioned-during-akali-regime-punjab-mining-minister-sukhbinder-singh-sarkaria-277882

The mafia is so brazen that they dug up trenches to ensure we could not reach the spot where illegal mining was being done,” Sukhbir alleged.The SAD president said it was shocking that even though rules permitted excavation till 10 feet, the sand mafia had done excavations till 200 feet which had resulted in the formation of a lake in the area with groundwater seeping up.Meanwhile, SAD workers staged a protest at Baghapurana town in Moga district against “illegal” mining being done in the area allegedly at the behest of Congress leaders. The SAD workers also blocked the highway for about 2 hours by raising slogans against Capt Amarinder Singh and local Congress MLA Darshan Singh Brar. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mining-mafia-hand-in-glove-with-state-govt-says-sukhbir-singh-badal-277881
04-07-2021||Jupinderjit Singh||Suspense over Parkash Singh Badal’s poll plans||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 3Though actively indulging in political alliances and staging protests against the government, the SAD is silent on whether it’s senior-most leader and five-time CM Parkash Singh Badal will contest the 2022 Assembly polls or not.Badal seems to be gearing up for the polls by remaining active via phone calls to the party cadre and supporters in the Lambi constituency, but the party has made no official announcement about it. Badal would probably be the oldest politician in the country if he contests elections. He would be 94 years and three months old if elections take place in February 2022. At 93 years and six months, he is still the most active politician.Party chief Sukhbir Badal has announced his candidature from the Jalalabad constituency. Party leaders say they understand him to be the CM face of the party. No formal announcement has been made in this regard. The party has also announced the deputy CM post for a Dalit candidate, which the BSP is eyeing after its alliance with the SAD.Later, Sukhbir also announced the party’s decision for candidature of Virsa Singh Valtoha from Khemkaran, NK Sharma from Dera Bassi, Amarpal Singh Ajnala from Ajnala, Gulzar Singh Ranike from Attari, Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra from Phillaur and a few others, but there is no word on the party patriarch.While The Tribune could not contact Badal, Harcharan Bains, principal political adviser to the SAD and close aide of Badal, said: “Badal sahib has kept his plans to himself. He is likely to contest the elections but the decision would be his. Though knowing Badal ji, he will go by the party’s decision.”Party insiders said Badal would lead the party campaign. SAD spokesman Daljeet Singh Cheema said: “The decision to contest or not would be his, but one thing is sure that he will lead the campaign.”Despite his age and ill health, Badal is reportedly active over the phone, talking not just to senior leaders, but also to their sons and even grandchildren. Besides, he recently got a list of Youth Akali Dal activists to talk about the party’s hopes from them.Badal’s name still seems to carry weight for the SAD’s fortunes. The party faced quite an embarrassment when its hoardings in Ludhiana did not include his photos. After criticism, the party is ensuring it uses Badal’s photo on all posters.May become oldest leader to contest||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/suspense-over-parkash-singh-badals-poll-plans-277874
04-07-2021||Bathinda/Muktsar||Light rain brings cheer to Malwa paddy growers||Cloudy weather and light rain on Saturday brought smiles on the faces of farmers, who had been worried as their crops had started drying up due to a long dry spell in the region. Showers decreased their dependency on tube wells to irrigate their fields.Reports indicated that various parts of the region were lashed with light to moderate rain today, giving farmers the hope of saving their kharif crops, especially paddy, cotton and green fodder, which were severely affected by the dry spell.Gurmeet Singh of Bathinda said: “Rain has come as a much-needed respite amid rising temperature. We hope our cotton fields will be saved now.”Farmers had been protesting the closure of canals and irregular power supply for the past few days. “We were facing trouble in irrigating the fields. Now, the rain has reduced our worries for at least two days. It will also help in the speedy growth of the paddy crop,” said Mukhtiar Singh, a farmer.Dr GS Romana of the Regional Research Centre of the Punjab Agricultural University said today’s rain would benefit all kharif crops.Residents also welcomed the sudden change in the weather. “In the past week, hardly anyone visited the market. Now, as the weather is pleasant, we hope to get some business for the next two-three days,” said a shopkeeper in Muktsar. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/light-rain-brings-cheer-to-malwa-paddy-growers-277855
04-07-2021||Ajay Joshi||Amid power cuts in Punjab, farmers reduce area under paddy cultivation||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, July 3Delayed monsoon, water shortage and poor power supply have added to the woes of farmers. Many have even reduced the area under paddy cultivation to avoid crisis.Sukhdev Singh Atwal (65), a farmer from Charke village in Bhogpur, has sown paddy in just 10 acres this year against 15-20 acres in the past.Charanjit Singh, FarmerHigh input cost a worryThe cost of running the generator is Rs 300 per hour. How would I have managed to irrigate all my fields? Reducing the area seemed to be the only option.“Our fields have started developing cracks. There isn’t enough water for irrigation. So, instead of increasing the area under paddy, I preferred to reduce it. Even the saplings already sown are on the risk of getting damaged if there isn’t enough water,” he said.He isn’t the only one to do so. The entire district has seen a dip in paddy plantation this year. As per the Agriculture Department, around this time last year, 1.75 lakh hectares were covered under paddy (including 22,000 basmati). However, due to electricity shortage, the area has been reduced to 1,31,800 lakh hectares.Sukhdev fears if he doesn’t get enough power to operate motor pumps, his crop may get damaged. “Since the beginning of the sowing season, we have been getting electricity for just four hours. It’s just for the past two days that we are receiving uninterrupted supply of six hours,” he said.Charanjit Singh (80) from Jandusingha has been farming for the past 40 years. He said: “This is for the first time that we are facing shortage of water to this extent.”Having brought down the paddy cultivation area to 20 acres from 25 acres, he said similar water deficiency was faced around five years ago. “The cost of running generator is also Rs 300 per hour. How would I have managed to irrigate all my fields? Reducing the area seemed to be the only option,” Charanjit said.Malkiat Singh (50) from Daulatpur village has also reduced the area to 25 acres. Last year, he sowed paddy in 40 acres. “The fields have already developed cracks. I fear that my 5-7 quintals of produce will either get damaged or will be of poor quality. Due to the fungus in the fields, there is high possibility of discolouration of the produce. We don’t even have enough water to irrigate maize and sugarcane,” he rued. Agriculture officer Naresh Gulati said most of the farmers were waiting for monsoon to sow the remaining paddy saplings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-power-cuts-in-punjab-farmers-reduce-area-under-paddy-cultivation-277854
04-07-2021||Chandigarh||PPAs signed under Badals’ rule under review, says Punjab CM Amarinder Singh||Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said his government would soon announce its legal strategy to counter the power purchase agreements signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government that had put “unnecessary” financial burden on the state.The Chief Minister, who chaired a meeting to review the power situation in the state, said later that a carefully charted legal course of action was being formulated to “save Punjab from further financial losses due to the ill-conceived PPAs signed by the Badals during their rule”, a press release said. “Of the 139 PPAs signed during by the SAD-BJP Government, 17 were enough to cater to the state’s full power demand,” he pointed out, adding that the remaining 122 for 1314 MWs of expensive power were inexplicably signed, putting unnecessary financial burden on the state.Even as he appealed to the people to use power judiciously and cooperate with the government in overcoming the temporary shortage of power, the Chief Minister said against the supply of 13500 MW, the demand last week touched an unprecedented 16000 MW. Immediately, PSPCL started purchasing 7400 MW of power from outside the state, he said, adding that this was 1000 MW more than what was purchased last year.  “Had the quantum of purchase not been promptly enhanced, the state would have faced an additional deficit of 1000 MW of power, further aggravating the crisis,” he pointed out.The Chief Minister said the present crisis was the result of failure of one unit of the Talwandi Sabo Power Plant, generating 660 MW of power. While a notice had already been issued to the plant by PSPCL for imposing a heavy penalty, the state government had, on its part, taken strong measures to address the power shortage, he added. These measures, he said, included three weekly days off for the industry, including rolling mills and induction furnaces, from July 1 to 7. Only essential services and continuous process industries have been exempted from these regulations, he added. Further, the state government offices have also been directed to function from 8 am to 2 pm till July 10, with use of air conditioners prohibited in these offices.    Asserting his government’s commitment to ensure that the situation is quickly eased, the Chief Minister said the power distribution system in the state had improved significantly over the past four years. He said  that 2 lakh new Distribution Transformers have been installed, taking the total figure to 11.50 Lakh.  Transformers have also been installed at the sub-stations to keep the supply stable, he added.Further, to improve the transmission system, he said that 17000 km of 11 kV and 1372 km of 66 KV transmission lines have been added. Seven 220 KV substations and thirty four 66 KV substations have been commissioned, enhancing the capacity by 8423 MVA. An additional 54 new 66 KV substations are expected to be completed by November 30.  In addition, three 33 kV substations have been upgraded to 66 kV and two 66 kV substations are being upgraded to 220 kV, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ppas-signed-under-badals-rule-under-review-says-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-277769
04-07-2021||Chandigarh||After surplus rains in early stages, monsoon over Punjab, Haryana, Himachal slips into the red||After having experienced surplus rains in the early stages of the season this year, the sought western monsoon over the region has slipped into the negative zone. Cumulative rain is less by 17 per cent in Himachal Pradesh, 12 per cent in Punjab, and 8 per cent in Haryana.According to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the hill state of Himachal received 96.1 mm rain from June 1 to July 3 against the normal of 115.5 mm for this period.The agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana received  54.3 mm and 52.2 mm rain, respectively for the aforementioned period as compared to the normal of 62 mm and 56.5 mm for these two states.The monsoon, which had arrived over northwest India about 15 days ahead of its normal date of onset, was surplus by 14 per cent in the region during the month of June. IMD data shows that the region had received 85.7 mm rain against the normal of 75.3 mm last month.Though monsoon had made good progress in its early phase, it later weakened. It has covered most of the country except parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, and IMD expects it will continue to elude the region for a few days more, although some areas in north India experienced light rains and storms over the past 24 hours.This has been attributed to the impact mid-latitude westerly winds and the absence of formation of low-pressure system over North Bay of Bengal as well as an unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), which is a major fluctuation in tropical weather due to an eastward-moving pulse of cloud and rainfall near the equator that typically recurs every 30 to 60 days.The IMD has said that spatial distribution suggests that below normal to normal rainfall is likely over many areas of northwest India during the month of July. Dry westerly and southwesterly winds from Pakistan to northwest India at lower levels can also bring in short spells of heatwave conditions over some parts of Haryana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-surplus-rains-in-early-stages-monsoon-over-punjab-haryana-himachal-slips-into-the-red-277740
