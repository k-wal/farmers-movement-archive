29-07-2021||New Delhi||‘Kisan Sansad’ discusses one of 3 agri laws, passes resolution demanding its repeal||The ‘Kisan Sansad’ being held by farmers at Jantar Mantar here on Thursday held discussions on one of the three agri laws against which they have been protesting for over eight months and demanded its repeal, terming it “unconstitutional”.On the sixth day of the ‘Kisan Sansad’, the farmers passed a resolution to repeal the Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act that was introduced last year, according to a statement by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions spearheading the protest.The protesters said the act was “unconstitutional and pro-corporates”.“The ‘sansad’ unanimously rejected the ‘Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020’ as being unconstitutional, anti-farmer and pro-corporate, and declared that the act stands repealed.“It was resolved that the act is meant for resource grabbing by corporates from farmers, and was in fact brought to promote corporate farming,” the SKM statement said.During the ‘sansad’, the farmers pointed out how various sections of the legislation showed that it exempted corporations from regulatory purview of various laws, while it did not provide any protective provisions to farmers who enter into contract farming.The ‘Kisan Sansad’ that is being held parallel to the Parliament’s Monsoon Session is part of the latest strategy of the farmers who have been protesting the Centre’s three contentious agri laws at multiple Delhi borders since November last year.The farmers have been protesting the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.The farmers have expressed fear over the laws which they say will eliminate the Minimum Support Price system, and leave them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.As part of these ‘Kisan Sansad’ sessions, 200 farmers from the protest sites participate in a mock Parliament session at Jantar Mantar during which issues concerning the farming community are discussed.The ‘Kisan Sansad’ also resolved and appealed to the President of India to ensure that “the supremacy of Parliament remains intact”.“The Narendra Modi-led BJP government has failed miserably to conduct the Parliament proceedings according to rules and constitutional provisions during this government’s tenure.“People’s anguish, pain and pressing issues, including of life and death matters, were not allowed to be discussed in both Houses of Parliament,” the SKM statement said.

Each department shall ensure transparency and accountability at all levels in the implementation of the SCSP.The efficacy of the legislation would be ensured by the systematic and exhaustive procedures on all aspects with respect to the formulation and implementation of SCSP in the state.Moreover, the departments implementing SCSP would become liable to implement it in its true spirit for the benefit of stakeholders i.e. Scheduled Castes population in the state.The new law would ensure transparency and accountability at all levels in the implementation of SCSP. There will also be a provision of incentives for commendable performance and penalties for wilful neglect of any rule under the law by a government functionary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-gives-go-ahead-to-put-new-punjab-sc-welfare-bill-before-cabinet-290085

The stamp of ex-post facto approval of the single bid was initiated with the signature of then ACS, Industries Department, and now Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan.”Demanded the resignation of the chief secretary, Kalia alleged, “It was her approval which set the ball rolling for this scam, the cancellation of auction and the CBI enquiry should also be made into the matter.”He further alleged, “When the plot of 31 acre was given on 99 years lease by Punjab Infotech, the payment of bid money should have been given to Punjab Infotech. Instead the GRG Developers, the bidder offered to make the payment directly to Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) and hence a suggestion was made by GRG developers to enter into a tripartite agreement which was accepted by the PSIEC in-principle and conveyed to ARCIL without involving Punjab Infotech. The bidder has no locus standi to offer a tripartite agreement to protect the interest of the PSIEC, when both Punjab Infotech and the PSIEC are State sponsored bodies.”He added, “The acceptance of single bid by Assets Reconstruction Company India Limited (ARCIL) in regard to auction of the plot of JCT Electronics raises a big question. When it is the general instruction from the government not to accept single bid in any auction/contract, why was a single bid in the aforesaid auction was accepted? Why was the said plot not re-auctioned?”Kalia demanded the dismissal of Industries Minister Sunder Sham Arora, S.

But now they can be seen examining patients in their respective OPDs. Earlier, they used to attend patients at parallel OPDs at the protest venue. Now, the business continues as usual after a few doctors hold a protest for half an hour in the morning.The doctors held protests and suspended OPDs initially after the Health Department transferred the Bathinda district president of the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA), the government doctors’ association spearheading the protests across the state.A source said: “Things have started subsiding now. The gradual shift in stance can be attributed to fear of official reprimand by the government, especially after a senior doctor and the PCMSA president was transferred from Bathinda amid the protests. Doctors first saw it as a pressure tactic to muzzle the protest and intensified their stir, but later thinking that one of them could be the next in line of fire, they have started falling in line now.”Another source said: “The government’s indifferent attitude and Health Minister Balbir Sidhu’s visit to inaugurate a hospital in Bathinda on Monday are also the possible factors that coerced doctors to resume regular OPDs from their respective cabins in the Civil Hospital now.”Dr Jagrup Singh, acting president of the Bathinda PCMSA, said: “During our state-level protest, the Health Minister had assured us that the government will take up our issue and resolve it on priority. So, we decided to conduct OPDs from our seats but patients are still being given prescription slips in the name of PCMSA and even medicines are being given for free.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bathinda-doctors-back-in-opds-stir-loses-steam-289647

The staff of the NRI Sabha said they asked him to show a letter from the government or the Department of NRI Affairs as per which he could occupy the seat but he told them that it was lying at his place and he forgot to bring it along.NRI Sabha in-charge Darshan Singh said he was not in the office on Wednesday when the incident took place. He said he too would have to take up the matter with higher officials tomorrow.Ex-president of the sabha Jasvir Singh Shergill said, “Narangpuri is cooking up a fake story. The sabha’s constitution does not allow any such arrangement. I have personally called up the minister and department officials to check if any such orders had been passed and they confirmed that no such decision had been taken.”He added that when he was the sabha’s chief in 2014, he had even started a move to cancel his membership as he could not produce the required documents to confirm his NRI status. So, he cannot in any way himself assume the charge as the sabha president.”Meanwhile, Narangpuri sent across a self-signed note mentioning that a meeting was held in the office of the NRI Sabha and that he had been appointed as the working president by the Department of NRI Affairs in place of Sahota. He said eight members — Jagjit Singh Sodhi, SK Chopra, Paramjit Singh, Amrik Singh, Sukhchain Singh, Jarnail Singh, Avtar Singh and Mohinder Singh — were present in the meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/members-protest-as-pritam-singh-narangpuri-declares-self-as-nri-sabha-punjab-chief-289865

29-07-2021||Saurabh Malik||Live-in relationship cases: Courts guardians of minor girls, says Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 28The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the courts were also the guardian of minor and other girls of tender age, who enticed by men, might end up filing protection petitions based on live-in relationships without knowing the consequences.Live-in relationship casesJustice Arvind Singh Sangwan also made it clear that the zeal and zest shown by the courts in disposing of protection petitions based on live-in relationship on the very first date without issuing notice to the parents of girls aged about 18, at times, resulted in deep trouble for them.Justice Sangwan observed it was but obvious for the court to issue a notice to the girl’s parents or issue directions to the illaqa magistrate to record her statement before disposing of petitions based on live-in relationship. This was where the girl was either a minor or of a tender age around 18. The intention was to find out whether she understood the consequence of filing a protection petition and whether she was capable of taking an independent decision.The directions came on a girl’s anticipatory bail petition in an FIR registered on June 9 for using as true a declaration knowing it to be false, cheating and other offences under Sections 420, 198, 199, 200, 120-B, IPC, at the Dinanagar police station in Gurdaspur district.The girl as a petitioner had filed two protection petitions, along with the co-accused, and was now facing criminal proceedings. The initial petition was dismissed as withdrawn. The couple filed another plea concealing the filing of the first. Her mother subsequently alleged that the co-accused was a married person with a living spouse. As such, the live-in relationship claim was apparently false.Her counsel submitted the petitioner was not aware about the marriage of the co-accused when she filed the two petitions. She was also unaware about concealment as the co-accused had engaged the counsel and filed the petition.Justice Sangwan asserted it was well-known that protection petitions based on live-in relationship were filed in a calculated manner just to create defence as girl’s parents filed rape and abduction case.“Needless to say, at the age, around 18 years, the primary concern of the a girl’s parents is to educate her properly and to build up her professional career and such decisions are consciously taken by the parents, whereas the protection petitions, based on live-in relationship, are filed by young persons based on emotional decisions taken from heart,” Justice Sangwan added.Granting interim bail to the girl, Justice Sangwan directed the Gurdaspur SSP to ensure the arrest of co-accused before the next date of hearing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/live-in-relationship-cases-courts-guardians-of-minor-girls-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-289634

The minister, however, denied the allegations, saying he was ready to face any probe.Arora is already facing the heat from the SAD and AAP, which are seeking a CBI probe and criminal case against him for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 400 crore to the exchequer due to the sale of 31 acres of prime land of the liquidated JCT Electronics in Mohali to a private realtor.Leader of Opposition and AAP senior leader Harpal Singh Cheema alleged the Punjab Vigilance was not properly investigating the disproportionate assets case against Dhoot. The naib tehsildar and the Industries Minister’s son had joint stakes in land at Hardo Khanpur and Brahmjit villages in Hoshiarpur. Cheema said: “The Punjab Vigilance Bureau had deliberately not included minister Sunder Sham Arora in the case, who has direct involvement with Dhoot in various businesses. The case should now be re-investigated by the CBI after including Arora in it”.SAD leader Bikram S Majithia said a CBI investigation or an inquiry monitored by the High Court into the scam should be done to bring out the truth.Meanwhile, SAD (Sanyukat) senior vice-president Bir Devinder Singh said after the AG’s legal opinion, the CBI must step in to probe the JCT land scam. He said it appeared a financial conspiracy was hatched against the vital fiscal interests of the state with brazen assurance by some corrupt bureaucrats at the helm, with the active participation of Arora.The issue comes close on the heels of the CBI starting a preliminary probe in the multi-crore scam in the disbursal of funds under the SC post-matric scholarship scheme. Even though Social Justice Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot has been given a clean chit by the government, the Opposition is demanding his dismissal from the Cabinet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-opposition-guns-for-punjab-industries-minister-sunder-sham-arora-289622

He has directed PSPCL to terminate/revisit all lopsided PPAs that are not beneficial to the state.The Chief Minister noted that PSPCL had signed 14 PPAs with thermal or hydro and 122 long-term PPAs with solar/biomass plants after 2007 to make the state power surplus with the generation capacity of around 13,800 MW. However, in this current paddy season, all three units of TSPL failed to generate power for few days during the peak paddy season. One unit of TSPL failed completely to operate from March 2021, and two units remained out of power generation for the last one month, he said. At present, only one unit of TSPL is operational, he said, adding that these factors have caused huge power shortage in the state.PSPCL has already issued notice to TSPL by imposing penalty. However, as the PPAs are one-sided, the penalty imposed will be very meagre in comparison to the losses caused by the failure of these thermal plants. Further, as per the provisions of the PPAs, at present, it is not compulsory for the IPPs to supply power during the peak summer/paddy period. Hence, taking advantage of the loopholes in PPAs, the IPPs are claiming full fixed charges from PSPCL by supplying power in the off-season when the state requires it the least.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-to-pspcl-cancel-or-revisit-lopsided-power-pacts-289625

The frontrunners are Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu and Amritsar Improvement Trust chairman Dinesh Bassi. Both have become active in the East as they are meeting residents and trying their bit to make their presence felt.Rintu said, “I have been regularly monitoring the works being done, especially in the ignored areas of the constituency. The outer periphery areas like Verka, Vallah and ward Nos. 20, 21, 22, 25, which were devoid of sewerage for long, have been revamped. Similarly, proper roads, street lights and safe drinking water supply have been ensured in these areas. Works worth Rs 50 crore were executed or are still under way in several pockets of the East constituency.”Bassi said, “I leave up to the party to decide, but I prefer to contest from the East constituency seat as I have been regularly associated with residents of the constituency and executed a number of civic projects.” Similarly, the contest will be interesting in the North, a Hindu-dominated seat and home turf of rebel BJP leader and two-time MLA Anil Joshi.Joshi, who was expelled from the party for the next six years, has announced to contest the elections independently from here. The contest gains significance as former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap from AAP also seems to start his political innings from here if regular meetings conducted by him are any indication.

However, according to the finance commission report tabled in the Assembly earlier this year, Punjab had not released any funds to local bodies for a decade, even though it had presented the explanatory memorandum and action taken report for the fourth and fifth finance commissions.The group pointed out that the total local body grants for five years amounted to Rs 8,174 crore, of which Rs 5,410 crore is for rural local bodies, Rs 2,024 crore for non-million cities and Rs 740 crore for the two million-plus population cities of Amritsar and Ludhiana.But these will be available to the state only if it also ensures that in the first and second year of the award period (2021-22 and 2022-23), at least 25 per cent of the rural local bodies have both their provisional accounts for the previous year and audited accounts for the year before the previous, available online in the public domain.From the third year (2023-24), the state will receive total grants due to the rural bodies having both provisional accounts of the previous year and audited accounts for the year before previous and making these available online.The group has also recommended property tax reforms and fixing the minimum floor for tax rates and ensuring consistent improvement in the collection of property taxes in proportion to the growth rate of GSDP as a condition for availing the local body grant.The report noted that in response to the recommendation of the 13th Finance Commission, the government had established the Property Tax Board in 2013, but it had not been made functional. “We recommend the government take measures to revive the Board,” it said. For rural and urban (non-millennium cities) local body grants, 40 per cent funds are given unconditionally and 30 per cent for strengthening drinking water, rainwater harvesting and water recycling and another 30 per cent for improvement in sanitation and ODF status.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/strengthen-local-bodies-allow-them-to-hike-taxes-montek-panel-289627

This has led to a new awakening to gender equality among the male-dominated mindset in the state amid the farmers’ protest.Women of all ages are out in open along with their families as well as alone, demanding repeal of the farm laws. For the past six months, they have stayed put despite Delhi’s bone-chilling winter and now sultry hot conditions. Even though they are faced with issues of lack of toilets, privacy and hygiene among others, they are holding their ground.At the forefront of the protest, these women continue to impress everyone with their oratory skills by singing rebellious songs, giving fiery speeches and raising anti-government slogans.Shingara Singh Mann, secretary, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) said: “We have always believed that women should be given equal opportunities. They are no less than men in any aspect, due to which our union has mobilised women in large numbers to participate in the protest.”Mohinder Kaur, 80, of Bahadurgarh Jandian in Bathinda, who hit the national headlines after Kangana Ranaut twitted her photo, said: “I went to Delhi to participate in the protest to save our land.” Paramjit Kaur of Bathinda, who along with his 10-year-old daughter is at the Tikri border: “For us, land is everything.

29-07-2021||Chandigarh||Speed up process to employ kin of farm stir, Amritsar train tragedy victims: Punjab govt||With elections to the Vidhan Sabha round the corner, the Capt Amarinder Singh government has gone into an overdrive to woo various sections of voters by providing them the elusive “sarkari naukri”.From kin of farmers who have died in the ongoing farmers’ agitation to the kin of those killed in the Amritsar train accident in 2018, the past weekend has seen a flurry of activity in the state, with the government asking officials concerned to immediately provide them jobs in Group “C” and “D” on the basis of their educational qualification.Letters have been sent out from the state government headquarters to all Deputy Commissioners for immediate action on these compassionate appointments.Interestingly, the government letters issued to all Deputy Commissioners recently mentions that these “compassionate appointments” are to be made through a special relaxation in the state’s Scheme for Compassionate Appointments, 2002. This policy allows for appointments on compassionate grounds only for dependent member of the family of a person killed or physically disabled in terrorist action; dependent family member of a government servant who died in harness; disabled ex-servicemen; or, dependent members of defensive service personnel killed in service in line of duty or those who are severely handicapped.It may be noted that 546 farmers and farm labourers have died in the ongoing protest against the three farm laws. “Most of the kin of farmers will get jobs in Group D where minimum required qualification is primary school education. Very few will qualify for Group C posts (clerks), where minimum qualification is graduation. The employment will be provided mostly in education, health and irrigation departments,” a senior government official told The Tribune.It may be noted that while the Centre has said in Parliament that it has no record of farmers’ deaths, the Capt Amarinder Singh government has already given compensation of Rs 5 lakh to families of almost 500 farmers and labourers who have died during the stir. With farmers being one of the biggest vote bank, especially in the all- important Malwa region having 69 Assembly seats, the Congress government wants to woo them hard.The move to immediately give jobs follows a widespread criticism of the state government on employment generation and the inability of the government to provide jobs for all (Ghar Ghar Rozgar), as promised in the Congress’ 2017 election manifesto. — TNSRTI reply exposes tall claims on jobs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/speed-up-process-to-employ-kin-of-farm-stir-amritsar-train-tragedy-victims-punjab-govt-289632

Noticing that some of the verdicts passed by the judicial officers in the subordinate courts were deficient in the art of writing orders, the Punjab and Haryana HC has asked the Chandigarh Judicial Academy director to look into the matter. He has been asked to educate the judicial officers.The directions by Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan came on a petition filed by Subhash Chand against Haryana and another respondent for cancellation of bail to an accused in a cheating case registered on June 30 at Pataudi police station.The counsel for the petitioner, Virendra Rana, argued that the FIR was registered on the premise that the description of the property was altered by changing a page of the agreement to sell after it was entered into between the petitioner and respondent-accused. A house, which was the only residence of the petitioner, was included in the same.The counsel alleged that the petitioner, along with the purchaser, signed all pages. But in the certified copy, only page number one and three were signed by the him. His signatures were not there on page number two, demonstrating that a fraud had been played.It was also submitted that the order passed by the Gurugram Additional Sessions Judge in the matter was totally non-speaking. In the entire order, not even a single line referred to the contents of the FIR. He added it was the basic requirement for forming an opinion regarding the grant of anticipatory bail to the accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/its-back-to-learning-for-judicial-officers-of-punjab-haryana-and-chandigarh-289698
