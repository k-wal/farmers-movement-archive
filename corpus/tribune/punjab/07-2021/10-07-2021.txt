Delhi govt wants Punjab’s lifeline, our thermal power plants, to shut down in the middle of a power crisis leaving Punjabis helpless in this simmering heat and our farmers to suffer in this paddy-sowing season,” the cricketer-turned-politician tweeted.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh lambasted Arvind Kejriwal for trying to shut down thermal power plants in Punjab on the pretext of saving Delhi.In a statement, he said Delhi Chief Minister Arvid Kejriwal had always been “plotting against the interests of Punjab” and now he was trying to “bring the state to ruin”.Chugh said at a time when Punjab is facing a power crisis, the Kejriwal government’s move could only be termed “heinous and criminal”.Shiromani Akali Dal’s senior leader Daljit Singh Cheema accused Kejriwal of “betraying” the people of Punjab by filing the petition.

Earlier, Amritsar Rural Police had unearthed two such modules, including one illicit small arms manufacturing unit in MP with the arrest of weapon smugglers, who were supplying weapons to gangsters, criminals and radicals in Punjab.Sharing details, DGP Dinkar Gupta said the development came 10 days after the Kapurthala Police in the vigorous follow-up operations led by SSP Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh had arrested four robbers after recovering 10 pistols and one rifle, along with ammunition, from their possession.He said that the arrested robbers revealed they were getting the supply of weapons from MP-based smuggler Sweety Singh and were hatching a conspiracy to carry our robberies and dacoities, snatch money from petrol pumps as well as farmers.The DGP said following these inputs, the Kapurthala police procured arrest warrants of Sweety Singh and a special police team from Kapurthala was despatched to Barwani district to arrest him after coordinating the operations with MP Police.“After vigorous efforts, the Punjab Police team, while working closely with MP Police, managed to arrest Sweety Singh, who unsuccessfully attempted to evade arrest by crossing the Narmada river to enter the Maharashtra border,” he said.The DGP also thanked the Madhya Pradesh Police for their enormous support to the Punjab Police in unearthing these illicit weapon manufacturing and supply units and modules.SSP Khakh said that Sweety had disclosed that he and his elder brother, Sumer Singh were into this weapons manufacturing and supply trade from many years and they used to upload videos of pistols on various social media platforms to lure their customers and this is how the present robber module of Punjab established contact with them. He said initial investigations found that Sweety was running a YouTube channel on name of ‘Azad Group Munger’ on which he used to flourish his illegal weapons business and when buyers ask about price, the group used to share their Whatsapp number.Sweety also revealed that of around 40-45 houses in their Umarti village, more than 20 were involved in the business of manufacturing and sale of illicit weapons, especially .30 bore and .32 bore pistols, Khakh added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-unearth-illicit-weapons-supply-network-operating-out-of-mp-281080

With two of its three units already shut, the plant is now completely non-functional.A Venu Prasad, CMD, PSPCL, said, “We have been repeatedly directing the plant authorities to ensure availability of all three units in the paddy season. But they have failed to do so. Due to the failure of its third unit, we are facing difficulties in meeting the demand.”Directing the plant authorities to make all-out efforts to restart generation at the earliest, the PSPCL has issued a notice, asking them to explain why capacity charges should not be deducted for the entire contract year (2021-22), considering non-availability of its units. All categories of consumers across the state are facing power cuts. In a respite, the PSPCL was able to purchase 350 MW power from the exchange at Rs 3.75 per unit and another 531 MW at Rs 3.21 per unit to meet the shortage.Earlier on Thursday, the corporation had purchased 400 MW from the open market at a staggering Rs 12.40 per unit, one of the highest rates in recent times.“A lot now depends on the rains.

They need a legally guaranteed remunerative price for their produce,” it said. The morcha asked the Modi government to “stop churning out ‘jumlas’ around three anti-farmer laws and repeal them immediately”.Farm leaders said, “Referring to the Rs 1 lakh crore fund is highly misleading because there has been no allocation of even some thousand crores by the government.”“It has merely created a new head under which loans can be accessed from banks. The government’s role is only to provide interest subvention of 3 per cent and some credit guarantee coverage,” they said.“The Centre has shown that it has no commitment to build and expand the public market and storage infrastructure for the benefit of small farmers, and has set upon facilitating Adanis, Walmart and Reliance to build private markets, storage and processing facilities,” they alleged.BKU’s Rakesh Tikait said the Centre could end the farmers’ protest “either with talks or force”.

If the CCL for the wheat remains unsettled by the end of this month, the state will not be able to get CCL for paddy that will be harvested in September.With this plea, the state government has been repeatedly knocking at the door of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. The decision to withhold the dues of the state comes after the Centre refused to pay the Rural Development Fund to the state, claimed as a statutory charge by the state for procuring foodgrain for the Centre. The state was allowed to charge just one per cent RDF, while two per cent was withheld by the Centre, leading to the state losing Rs 1,720 crore as RDF for 2020 paddy season and for 2021 wheat season.Many in the ruling Congress as well as the government believe that the two issues are directly linked to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws.Sources told The Tribune that the Centre has withheld Rs 1,300 crore, saying the direct transfer of MSP for wheat to farmers was not flawless. The commission paid to the lakhs of commission agents, too, has not been cleared by the Centre, though the state government has already paid this commission to the agents.Shortage of gunny bags looms again||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/as-punjabs-cash-credit-limit-deadline-nears-centre-dithers-on-paying-rs-1-300-cr-dues-280820

10-07-2021||Aman Sood||Malwa: AAP, SAD eye gains amid Cong turmoil||Tribune News ServicePatiala, July 9Whoever wins the ‘Panthic Malwa belt’ forms the government in Punjab, that’s the general belief. The visible ground support in 2017 had given the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) reasons to dream of pulling off an improbable victory. The party, however, had to satisfy itself with only 18 seats of the total 69 in the region and only two more elsewhere in the state. But that was enough to go ahead of the SAD-BJP, which won just eight seats. The Congress won 40 seats in Malwa alone.Going into the 2022 polls, anti-incumbency, high power prices, unfulfilled poll promises, farmers’ struggle at Delhi borders and rampant corruption are issues staring the ruling Congress in the face. The “mishandling” of the probe into the 2015 sacrilege incidents has dented the party’s image and the SAD and AAP are both eyeing gains.Protests by teachers, farmers, power corporation employees, forest department and water-sanitation staff have become a regular occurrence in front of the residences of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh in Patiala, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal in Bathinda and Education and PWD Minister Vijay Singla in Sangrur.Malwa has taken a particular note of the recent outburst of Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, since he was the first senior party leader to publicly criticise the Chief Minister after the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed the probe reports submitted by the state government’s special investigation team (SIT) into a police firing case in Kotkapura town in Malwa more than five years ago.The case dates back to October 14, 2015, during the SAD-BJP regime, when the state police opened fire at a crowd in Bargari village which had been protesting against incidents of sacrilege. Since June 1 that year, pages of copies of the Guru Granth Sahib that had been ripped off were found in different parts of the state. On October 12, when the same thing happened at Bargari, the villagers protested. By October 14, the protest had grown so huge that the police opened fire, resulting in the death of two persons.“This is an emotive issue and has exposed both the SAD and the Congress. People will vote against them. We are already getting feedback from the Malwa belt that people are still hurt,” says SAD (Democratic) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, 84, who had recently announced to launch a new political party — SAD (Sanyukt) — along with another former Akali leader, Ranjit Singh Brahmpura.SAD president Sukhbir Badal, however, says it is his party alone that represents the Panthic ideology and Sikh beliefs. “We were hurt when the incidents took place but the Congress and AAP in cahoots with their affiliated groups created an atmosphere of unrest and demanded a CBI probe. Now even the Congress-ordered probe for over four years has found nothing,” says Sukhbir. “The key issues are high-priced power and its shortage, besides unemployment and shortage of funds for the rural Malwa belt. We will take all this to the people and let them decide if they still want to vote for the Congress.”The Congress remains a divided house in Bathinda, where Amrinder Raja Warring and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal have usually been on opposite ends. Allegations have been levelled by local SAD leaders and a few Congressmen pertaining to ‘goonda tax’ collection near the Guru Gobind Singh refinery at the behest of Manpreet’s brother-in-law Jaijeet Singh Johal, who terms the charges baseless, saying he is a soft target. “Barring one leader, no one from the Congress has made a statement against us. Outside the constituency, it does not matter if anyone says anything,” he says.Villagers in Bathinda, Muktsar, Abohar, Fazilka, Mansa, Sangrur feel sidelined and recall the time when the Akalis ensured ample funds and development. “Roads are in a bad shape, villagesare getting limited funds and power cuts are back,” says a political analyst, who has covered the Malwa belt for over three decades.“I agree that the sacrilege, Bargari and rising power price issues have harmed our party, not only in Malwa but across Punjab. Our party is going through an inner turmoil due to this, but I am sure we will do justice with the probe and the guilty will face the music,” says Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, who is from the Malwa belt. “Another important factor in Malwa politics will be that of the agitation over agricultural laws, if the farmers decide to contest some seats. But I sincerely feel that the villages in Punjab in the past four years have seen major development,” Jakhar adds.AAP, meanwhile, is doing its best to find popular faces and attract youngsters, who are already questioning the Congress over jobs and other unfulfilled promises.“People have seen prominent faces like Sukhbir or Amarinder and what they have done to the state. We need a CM who is available for the state round the clock and AAP is committed to that. We believe in good governance and a ‘goonda-free’ government,” says Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/malwa-aap-sad-eye-gains-amid-cong-turmoil-280780

The then SAD-BJP government had handed over the investigation to the CBI on November 2, 2015.

Officials blame pressure from higher-ups to achieve the target and shortage of ground staff for this. In one such instance, none of the 23 contacts of a 25-year-old Patiala resident, who tested positive on April 12, was approached for testing. Most were acquaintances or neighbours whom the positive patient happened to know, and didn’t necessarily come in contact. In another case, even family members, who were high-risk contacts, were never tested.In some cases, officials listed names of contacts on their own without consulting the patient. A health official said: “Sometimes patients do not cooperate. So, we list names of people in the area.” The issue came to the fore when contacts of a recent Delta Plus variant were being checked for genome sequencing and only a few samples were found, while the list of contacts was exhaustive.Sources said as contacts of Delta Plus patients were not tested, the department had to take fresh samples of area residents. An officer said: “It is impossible to take samples of 30 contacts of a single patient. During the peak, 500 persons would test positive daily, so it was difficult to meet the target.”Dr GB Singh, director, Health and Family Welfare, said: “We will verify the contact list of positive cases randomly.”Dr Prince Sodhi, Civil Surgeon, said: “Our local medical officer, Asha workers and other staff visit contacts of positive patients. However, I will look into the matter.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/contact-tracing-being-done-only-on-paper-in-punjab-280770
