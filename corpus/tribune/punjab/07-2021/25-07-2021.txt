The credit goes to Sidhu whose earnest efforts made it possible. But, it was closed due to Covid-19 crisis from the Indian side preventing the Sikh sangat from India to pay obeisance at the holiest shrine.“We appeal to Sidhu that with the same zeal he should take up the matter of reopening the corridor from Indian side, as a priority. We hope that Sidhu would visit us through the Kartarpur corridor with Indian delegation soon”, he said.As a precautionary measure against the spread of Covid-19, the pilgrimage to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur, in Narowal district of Pakistan was closed from both sides on March 16, 2020.Though Pakistan had reopened the shrine since October 2, 2020, the Indian government had continuously suspended the pilgrimage registration to Kartarpur Gurdwara.In the past, SGPC as well as Akal Takht had been repeatedly demanding from the Centre to open the Kartarpur pilgrimage on the lines of the opening of the other religious shires across the nation.Claiming that the Covid-19 situation was under control in Pakistan, the PSGPC has extended an invitation to the SGPC, Akal Takht and Indian Sikh devotees to participate in the Jyoti Jot Purab which has been scheduled to be commemorated at Gurdwara Kartarpur Shaib on September 22.The PSGPC has already held preparatory meetings with the ETPB to review the progress of arrangements for the occasion.PSGPC president Satwant Singh said the Pakistan Sikhs were eagerly awaiting to welcome their Indian and Diaspora Sikh sangat for the occasion.“We will welcome them at ‘zero line’ to make a fresh beginning through this ‘corridor of peace’, as described by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pak-sikh-body%C2%A0congrats%C2%A0sidhu-for-being-punjab-cong-chief-hopes-it-will-help-re-open-kartarpur-corridor-288149
25-07-2021||New Delhi||Regional parties should form national front for 2024 Lok Sabha polls: Sukhbir Badal||Regional parties should come together and form a national front to take on the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Shriomani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said on Sunday and asserted that his party’s story with the saffron party was over.Underlining that issues of farmers are at the core of the SAD ideology, Badal said his party can never compromise on these and, therefore, severed its decades-old alliance with the BJP and moved out of the government at the Centre over three contentious farm laws.“SAD is a farmers’ party and their issues are core of our ideology. Whatever may happen and whatever cost we may have to pay, we wouldn’t let these laws be implemented in Punjab,” Badal told PTI in an interview.The Centre’s three farm laws have triggered a protest by farmers.In September last year, Badal’s wife Harsimrat Kaur quit as Union minister in protest against the legislations.The protesting farmers claim these laws will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.Talking about the SAD’s new alliance with the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Badal said the alliance between the two parties is permanent and that the Akali Dal’s story with the BJP was over.On the party’s future course of action, Badal said that the SAD is talking to various regional parties so that they all can come on one platform before the 2024 general elections.“There is a need for regional forces to get together. Regional forces are more connected to the ground and have better understanding of the people. We have been talking to various parties. Regional parties should come together and form a front before the 2024 general elections. And I am sure before 2024 this front will emerge as very strong force,” he said.Badal further said it would be a second front rather than a third front as the main opposition Congress is no more a pan-India party. The BJP will be the new front’s main target.In the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab, Badal said, farm laws will be the main issue for the Akali Dal and “if the party is voted to power, it will provide government job to a family member of all those farmers who lost their lives during the ongoing protest against the laws”.In addition, the government will provide free education to the children of the deceased farmers and pension to the parents of those who died young, Badal said.He also said the SAD will bet big on new and young faces and will try to field as many women as possible in the assembly elections slated for early next year.On a question about reports of alleged snooping on politicians, activists and journalists using Pegasus spyware, Badal termed it an attack on democracy and demanded establishment of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) headed by an opposition MP to probe the matter.“This entire snooping episode is an attack on the Constitution, democracy and rights of the people. It is completely unethical and a JPC should be formed headed by an opposition MP to investigate it,” Badal said.

The impact of the collision was so severe that the pole was uprooted completely. It seems the accused was driving at a very high speed."Meantime, the passerby blocked the road for 15- 20 minutes to protest against the police for their failure to take the dead who kept lying roadside.

Eating out had also decreased hence the cases of diarrhoea also fell. “The trend came as a surprise as the Covid virus predominantly affects respiratory system, but a sharp decline was observed in the cases related to asthma,” said Dr Gulati.“The number of children visiting the doctors has definitely decreased since the last year, but the exact reason behind it can only be found out after a detailed study is conducted on a larger population. Theoretically, as children are not going out much so they are less exposed to allergens. A drastic decrease was also observed in pollution levels during the lockdown,” said Dr Daljit Singh, Vice- Chancellor of Sri Guru Ram Das University of Health and Science, Amritsar.Another city-based paediatrician said it was mainly in schools that children catch viral infections as they sit in proximity with each other. Since most schools are shut, there has been a decrease in cases at paediatric clinics, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lockdown-kept-asthma-attacks-in-children-at-bay-say-doctors-287778

To keep pace with the change, new technology is required to be used to collect and compare evidence. “With the advancement of technology, the modes of communication are changing. To keep pace with the change, new technology is required to be used for collecting and comparing evidence. One method being tapping of devices, but after compliance with the procedure laid down,” Justice Jhingan asserted.The Bench was hearing a petition filed against the state of Punjab by Kamal Pal and another petitioner. They had challenged an order passed by a Nawanshahr Additional Sessions Judge allowing the Vigilance Bureau’s application for taking their voice samples.Justice Jhingan’s Bench was told that the petitioners’ mobiles were tapped after taking approval following receipt of information by the Vigilance Bureau.It was alleged that the petitioners, both typists at the Banga tehsil complex, were collecting money to get sale deeds registered from the tehsildar and other revenue officials. An FIR was registered after finding sufficient evidence. An application filed by the bureau for permission to take the petitioners’ voice samples was allowed, resulting in the petition before the HC. Among other things, the petitioner’s counsel argued that the impugned order was in violation of Article 20(3) and infringed upon the right to privacy. Article 20(3) says: “No person can be compelled to be a witness against himself.”Justice Jhingan said the issues raised by petitioners’ counsel were no longer res integra or questions not yet been determined or resolved. “The infringement of the right to privacy cannot be raised to create a bubble to scuttle the probe, nullifying the evidence collected by merely denying that the voice of the tapped calls is not of the petitioners and there being no comparables,” the judge added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tapping-of-devices-needed-to-collect-proof-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-287779

25-07-2021||Jupinderjit Singh||14 years ago, Shiromani Akali Dal refused Deputy CM post to ally BJP||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 24The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) seems to have a change of heart with the recent announcements on the Deputy Chief Minister’s post. The party had denied the post to the BJP, its former ally for two decades, but has now announced one for the Dalit community and another for the Hindu community.Madan Mohan Mittal, Ex-BJP MinisterOpportunistic moveThis is opportunistic politics. In 2007, we demanded the post of the Deputy CM from the SAD, but it was denied. We argued the BJP as well as the Hindu voters needed representation, but the post was never given.With this, the SAD aims to attract Dalits, which account for about 32 per cent, and Hindus, which are nearly 15 per cent. The party has clearly kept the post of Chief Minister for itself. As per the past tradition and the party’s base, a Jat-Sikh leader would hold the post if it comes to power in alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party. Though the party has not made an official announcement, leaders said it was a foregone conclusion that party president Sukhbir Singh Badal would be the CM.Daljeet Cheema, SAD SpokesmanWell thought outIt was not an overnight decision to have two Deputy Chief Ministers. In the party’s manifesto, we will have provisions for representation to minority communities like Muslims and Christians as well.Ex-BJP Minister Madan Mohan Mittal said in alliance with the BJP, the Akalis did not think about the Hindu votes. “But after our ties ended, it first tried to woo the Dalits by announcing the Deputy CM post for them. When it did not create much impact, it tried to woo Hindus with the post. But voters can see through such caste-based politics.”Akali Dal spokesperson Daljeet Singh Cheema defends the move. “It was not an overnight decision to have two Deputy Chief Ministers. We announced one for Dalits earlier and then after much deliberation, we announced the second post for a Hindu leader. In the party’s manifesto, we will have provisions for representation to minority communities like Muslims and Christians as well.”He reasoned that earlier the BJP represented the Hindu community in alliance with the SAD. “But after our ties ended, it became our responsibility to give due space to the Hindus.”The Akali Dal is the only party in Punjab to dangle the post of Deputy CM to voters of different communities. No other party in Punjab had these posts in the past or made fresh promises. The Congress does not have this post, but the BJP added a new dimension by questioning “why can’t there be a Mazhabi CM in Punjab?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/14-years-ago-shiromani-akali-dal-refused-deputy-cm-post-to-ally-bjp-287746

Sidhu’s other promises of raising firemen’s pay scale, offering them insurance besides other benefits still remain unmet.In 2018, Sidhu had announced that the blueprint of the first-of-its-kind multipurpose sports complex to be set up in the holy city would be completed in the next one-and-a-half years. Paramjit Singh, a hockey player, says: “My dream of practising in a world-class stadium is not likely to be met during my career as the civil work on it is yet to commence.”The brainchild of Sidhu, former CM Parkash Singh Badal and his deputy Sukhbir Badal, had laid its foundation stone on November 12, 2011. He had alleged the complex was deliberately scuttled during the SAD-BJP government by the Badals.Piyush Kapoor, manager of a hotel, said the multi-crore “urban haat” project, proposed to be developed on the lines of Lahore’s food street to attract tourists during the SAD-BJP regime, was yet to be opened for public. “Sidhu in his capacity as the Local Bodies Minister had promised a review of the projects, including urban haat, initiated by the previous SAD-BJP government, but nothing has been done so far,” he says.Prof Mohan Singh (retd) recalled that projects to upgrade Challih Khoo Park, which fell in Sidhu’s constituency, into an environmental park and another environmental park along the UBDC Canal here were yet to see the light of day.The solid waste management plant at Bhagtanwala garbage dump, which was planned in 2004, was rechristened garbage bioremediation and made operational. However, its service remained unsatisfactory.Balram Sharma, a local resident, recalled that Sidhu as the Amritsar MP had even threatened to sit on a fast-unto-death against the Badal government for not completing his pet projects. “Now, it is to be seen whether he will once again keenly work to complete his pet projects,” he added.Residents list unfinished worksCalls on Ludhiana MLAs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-saddle-navjot-singh-sidhu-has-some-promises-to-keep-287748

To keep pace with the change, new technology is required to be used for collecting and comparing evidence. One method being tapping of communication devices, but after compliance of the procedure laid down,” Justice Jhingan asserted.The Bench was hearing a petition filed against the State of Punjab by Kamal Pal and another petitioner. They had challenged an order dated April 27 passed by Nawanshahr Additional Sessions Judge allowing Vigilance Bureau’s application for taking their voice samples.Justice Jhingan’s Bench was told that the mobile used by the petitioners were tapped after taking approval following receipt of information by Punjab Vigilance Bureau.It was alleged that the petitioners, both typists at Banga tehsil complex, were collecting money for getting the sale deeds registered from the tehsildar and other revenue officials. An FIR was registered after finding sufficient evidence.An application filed by the vigilance bureau for permission to take the petitioners’ voice samples was allowed, resulting in the petition before the High Court. Among other things, the petitioner’s counsel argued that the impugned order was in violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution and infringed upon the right of privacy. Article 20(3) of the Constitution says “No person can be compelled to be a witness against himself”.Justice Jhingan asserted the issues raised by petitioners’ counsel were no longer res-integra or questions which have not yet been determined or resolved. “The infringement of the fundamental right to privacy cannot be raised to create a bubble to scuttle the investigation, nullifying the evidence collected by merely denying that the voice of the tapped phone calls is not of the petitioners and there being no comparables,” Justice Jhingan added.Dismissing the petition, Justice Jhingan upheld the impugned order and rejected the contentions raised by the counsel for the petitioners.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/new-tech-required-to-be-used-for-collecting-comparing-evidence-punjab-and-haryana-hc-287725

The well does not go to the thirsty. I today invite you (farmers). I want to meet you.”Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party took exception to the Sidhu’s remark and said it “smells of arrogance”.“It is a pity that on one hand Navjot Sidhu announced to kill his ego and on the other, to stand in favour of farmers, he also made a condition that the thirsty (farmers) have to come to the well (Sidhu) because the well does not go to the thirsty,” said AAP state farmers’ wing president and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan in a statement.Sandhwan appealed to Sidhu that he should immediately apologise for his remark as farmers are “annadatas” of the country.
