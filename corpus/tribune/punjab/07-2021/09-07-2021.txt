09-07-2021||New Delhi||Pollution: SC turns down Delhi Government's plea to shut down power plants in Punjab, Haryana, UP||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a petition filed by the Delhi government seeking closure of 10 thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh on the ground that they caused air pollution in the national capital.“It’s amusing that NCT of Delhi is coming up with a PIL against the Centre. We have got many questions to ask…It’s better you withdraw it,” a Bench led by Justice Navin Sinha told senior counsel Colin Gonsalves, representing the Delhi Government.It said if the Delhi Government wanted it can file an intervention application in the air pollution matter pending before the court.The Delhi government had urged the court to quash a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) order extending the deadline for installation of the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD)  thermal power plants. It also wanted the top court to direct the Centre to install FGD devices in 10 thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh contending that these power plants contributed to air pollution in Delhi."There are 30 power plants in a radius of 300 kilometres which bring particulate matter, major contributors for SO2 and other deadlier matters…These plants should be closed until they install FGD devices, Gonsalves submitted.However, the court wasn’t convinced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pollution-sc-turns-down-delhi-governments-plea-to-shut-down-power-plants-in-punjab-haryana-up-280598

This grenade, they said, was thrown there last month and was primarily meant to test the quality of their ammunition after their previous one did not detonate.Noopi, who’s one of the four people arrested recently in connection with police investigations into separatism, faces at least seven criminal cases, including murder. He and two other undertrial prisoners broke out of a jail in Patiala in April this year.The development comes after Noopi’s questioning lead to an unexploded grenade at the house of an NRI in Hedike village in Sangrur district.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-find-klfs-second-unexploded-hand-grenade-in-ropar-280559

For this reason, the medical colleges may admit up to 7.5 per cent of their permitted annual intake of MBBS seats applicable to that batch of interns to accommodate internships by foreign medical graduates.In a letter to the NMC, the BFUHS had termed the collection of the fee, up to Rs 3 lakh per student by some medical institutions in the state for allowing them internship in other medical colleges, as “fleecing” of students. The BFUHS had come across many cases where students from private institutions were forced to pay a heavy fee to shift to other institutions for their internship.To give “NOC” to these students for internships in other colleges, some parent colleges had forced students to pay up to Rs 3 lakh per student. These students were also made to pay Rs 60,000 for “NOC” to college where they want to join the internship.Allowing this shifting or migration of students for internship was against medical principles and rules,” said Dr Raj Bahadur, VC, BFUHS.Regarding stipend, the NMC has noted that all interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate fee fixation authority applicable to the Institution/university/ state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nmc-issues-new-guidelines-to-avoid-fleecing-of-mbbs-students-280522

Going into the 2022 polls, though, the ruling party is saddled with anti-incumbency, unfulfilled poll promises and dissension, exemplified by Amritsar (East) MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu’s open and relentless attacks against the Capt Amarinder Singh government.Rift blown out of proportion The Congress’ internal differences are being blown out of proportion, but I agree not fulfilling poll promises can backfire. Time is short and we need to make amends.— Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Cabinet MinisterAccording to the 2011 Census, Sikhs make up 68.94 per cent of the population of Amritsar district, and 93 per cent of Tarn Taran district. In 2017, the Congress rode to power on the back of rural and Panthic Sikh votes, as the electorate sided with it while shunning the Shiromani Akali Dal mainly over the controversial exoneration of the Dera Sacha Sauda chief, followed by the Bargari sacrilege and firing in 2015. The rural belt, which was once SAD’s main base, favoured the Congress, which won five of the six seats in Amritsar. Four seats with a large Sikh presence in Gurdaspur, too, had gone to the Congress. In Tarn Taran district, which has the highest Sikh population percentage in the state, all four seats went to the Congress.If there are rumblings of discontent within the Congress, unrest is brewing in SAD’s Tarn Taran unit, with heavyweights Virsa Singh Valtoha, a two-time former Khem Karan MLA, and party chief Sukhbir Badal’s brother-in-law Adesh Partap Singh Kairon, a four-time MLA from Patti, both eyeing the Khem Karan seat. Kairon, in fact, has staked claim from all four seats of Tarn Taran.Doors open for farmersThe BJP has opened its doors for negotiation on farm laws, made possible the Kartarpur corridor, and also ensured GST rebate on langar. People will give their approval to these steps.—Shwait Malik, BJP Rajya Sabha MemberIn Gurdaspur, the Congress stands on a slippery wicket in Fatehgarh Churian, won by Tript Rajinder Bajwa in 2017 with a slender margin of 1,200 votes. He has shifted his focus to Batala and got a mayor of his choice appointed. However, following former MLA Ashwani Sekhri expressing displeasure, it would be difficult for the Congress to ignore his claim for candidature from there.All eyes are also on former MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who may not be averse to contesting Assembly polls, perhaps from Gurdaspur. In Qadian, his brother Fatehjang Singh Bajwa is the sitting MLA.Fledgling panthic parties comprising the ‘rebel Taksali Akalis’ under the umbrella of SAD (United) are trying to forge an alliance, but Akali Dal’s breakaway factions led by former MP from Khadoor Sahib Ranjit Singh Brahmpura could at best make a dent in the parent party’s vote share.Questions are also being raised on how well alliance partner BSP could compensate the SAD with the Dalit votes, given the large numbers of Mazhabi Sikhs in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur. BSP’s vote share was a mere 5 per cent in 2017 and it has no base to talk about in Majha.BJP president Ashwani Sharma has announced that the party will contest all 117 seats, but its handling of the farmers’ protests could prove to be a big dampener. Adding to its problems, former minister Anil Joshi has been critical of the party’s “anti-Punjab” moves. “We could not address Punjabis’ grievances at an appropriate level. People will reply,” he says. He is believed to be at loggerheads with former state head Shwait Malik, who it is believed is keen on contesting from Joshi’s constituency. The Aam Aadmi Party, which could not open its account in Majha in 2017, is still struggling to establish a foothold. A notable addition to the ranks is former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who led the sacrilege investigations. AAP’s state joint secretary Ashok Talwar sees the Congress as the main opponent. Dr Jagroop Singh Sekhon, Head, Department of Political Science, Guru Nanak Dev University, says the Congress is at an advantageous position “as its main opponent SAD has been so discredited for manoeuvring issues for political gains during their tenure, that it would be difficult for them to bounce back”.Public welfare issues rather than Panthic matters are likely to affect the vote trend this time, attributed also to the pandemic’s fallout on the economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/peoples-pulse-majha-advantage-cong-but-far-from-done-deal-280207
09-07-2021||Aman Sood||400 MW bought by PSPCL at Rs 12.40/unit||Tribune News ServicePatiala, July 8As the power demand continued to surge across the state today, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) purchased 400 MW from the open market at a staggering Rs 12.40 per unit, one of the highest rates in recent times.Punjab has already purchased Rs 550 crore worth of electricity to meet a massive shortfall in supply to consumers, including industry and agriculture sector feeders.Senior PSPCL officials said the powercom was buying around Rs 12-25 crore worth of power every day from outside. “This means around 550 crore of power has already been purchased this season, but the demand is still more than the supply and the industrial sector is facing a forced power shutdown till July 11,” said an official.PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said the state was witnessing an all-time high power demand during the ongoing paddy season amid delayed arrival of monsoon.“Power availability is also on the lower side this season due to low dam reservoir levels, resulting in a drop in hydro-power generation by 600 MW. Already a unit of Talwandi Sabo Power Ltd (TSPL) has been shut due to a turbine breakdown, while another unit has developed a snag. Another is operating at half its capacity due to some technical issue. This has resulted in a shortfall of 2,200 MW,” he said. In addition to the existing arrangements, the PSPCL purchased 400 MW of extra power from the open market at Rs 12.40 per unit on July 8. “A total 1,400 MW power was purchased on Thursday at an exchange rate of 5.46 per unit,” said Prasad.In a relief, however, on the request of the state government, the National Load Dispatch Centre has agreed to enhance the transmission limit to 8,000/8,600 MW from 6 pm till 9 am due to the outage of TSPL units. Last year, the import limit was 6,500 MW. The PSPCL is utilising this limit by drawing maximum possible power to improve the supply.The installed capacity of the PSPCL from all sources is 13,845 MW, of which 9,000 MW is currently being generated. A key reason for lower generation was the failure of TSPL units.Rs 5,700 cr given to firms for no powerExperts differ||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/400-mw-bought-by-pspcl-at-rs-12-40-unit-280208

The Lehra Mohabbat unit, however, became functional late in the evening.But the 420 MW shortfall in generation for most part of the day (besides the shortfall in generation from Talwandi Sabo power plant) saw unscheduled power cuts being imposed on domestic urban and rural consumers, agriculture consumers and commercial consumers.

09-07-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Punjab Govt may scrap 5 of 122 Power Purchase Agreements||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 8The government has begun the process to terminate/ re-negotiate five Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) — two made by the previous Akali-BJP government with private entities and three with National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) supplying costly power to the state.The high cost of power supplied by private entities and other power trading entities to the now power-starved state has raised a political storm, with growing demand to scrap these agreements.Two PPAs being examined to be scrapped/ re-negotiated were signed with GVK Power and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) by the previous government. While the former project is supplying power at Rs 8 per unit, the latter is reportedly supplying at Rs 4.60 per unit.The previous government had signed as many as 122 PPAs, of which five PPAs are now caught in a political storm, with both the Congress and AAP demanding that these be scrapped.Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has also filed petitions with Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) for scrapping three other PPAs with the NTPC. The state was paying Rs 150 crore per annum to NTPC for getting power from its plants at Antia, Aurya and Dadri.The charges were being paid without getting any power from these plants for many years now as the per unit cost of power from these plants was very high. Confirming this, A Venu Prasad, Additional Chief Secretary, Power, said the scrapping of these three PPAs would be of huge benefit to the state.While two of these three PPAs were signed 25 years ago, the third was signed 24 years ago.A meeting to examine all legal angles, before the PPAs with GVK Power and DVC can be scrapped/ re-negotiated, was held today in the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO).Sources told The Tribune that after debating on how to proceed with the termination/re-negotiation of the five agreements, it was decided that the two PPAs with GVK and DVC be immediately sent for examination to the Advocate General’s Office, where the legal officers can then move forward to terminate/ re-negotiate the pacts.It may be mentioned that five of the 122 PPAs are at the heart of the controversy regarding buying of expensive power when cheaper alternatives are available, as the other 117 are related to buying of solar, wind, biomass power and power generating from cogeneration plants set up by sugar mills.Inked with pvt entities, NTPC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-may-scrap-5-of-122-power-purchase-agreements-280210

We parked our vehicles on roadsides without obstructing the traffic.” Ranjit Singh Swajpur, Patiala president of the BKU (Krantikari), said, “The central government, with legislation such as the three farm laws, is working in the interest of corporate houses. People are getting poor as they have been rendered jobless.” In Fatehgarh Sahib, farmers led by local SKM leaders protested by making human chains on the GT road in Sirhind, Mandi Gobindgarh, Amloh, Bassi Pathana and Khamano towns.Similar protests were held in Bathinda and Mansa districts. Farmers from the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) gathered at main roads in different locations on tractors, motorcycles, cars and jeeps and raised slogans against the Union Government.Harjinder Singh, a leader of the union, said, “With barely any control by the government, private companies are increasing the rates of petrol, diesel and gas cylinders time and again. Income sources of common man have shrunk after lockdowns were imposed but the government, instead of providing any relief, has resorted to hiking prices of petrol, diesel and other essential commodities thereby burdening people financially.” In Abohar, farm unions organised protests on the Abohar-Malout stretch of the NH-10 and Khuyiansarwer on NH-15 and slammed the central government for the unabated increase in the prices of LPG and other petroleum products. In Amritsar district, farmers parked their tractors, cars, two-wheelers, combine harvesters and other agricultural implements on roadsides at Rayya, Mehta, Mannawala, Nawa Pind, Kathunagal, Majitha, Attari, Ajnala, Chogawan, India Gate, Golden Gate and other places as a mark of protest. — TNSTwo debt-ridden farmers kill self||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protests-against-fuel-price-hike-across-punjab-280211

The Bench, on the previous date of hearing, was told only three out of 33 prosecution witnesses had been examined so far in a criminal matter.Taking up the matter, Justice Sehrawat had directed the prosecution to produce all witnesses summoned by the trial court. It was further ordered the trial court would issue warrant of arrest against the witnesses not produced in the trial court on the next date of hearing. The Commissioner of Police, Amritsar, was also directed to ensure the warrants of arrest, if any, against such witnesses were executed within a week from issuance by the trial court.As the case came up for resumed hearing, Thakur told the Bench the trial court had not issued warrants of arrest against the witnesses concerned, despite the HC order dated March 31. Instead of issuing warrants of arrest as directed, the presiding officer of the trial court had been issuing only summons to the witnesses concerned, the counsel submitted.Justice Sehrawat asserted this, prima facie, constituted a direct contempt regarding order passed by the High Court, for which, the presiding officer was liable to be punished. “Let a notice be served upon the presiding officer concerned to show cause as to why the proceedings for punishment for contempt of court should not be initiated against him,” Justice Sehrawat concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-puts-amritsar-based-judicial-officer-on-notice-280213

The Vigilance Bureau had booked 33 employees in 2016 for using unfair means. Of those, three quit service while the decision is pending in the case of the fourth employee.These employees had allegedly bought the paper through Guru Ji, alias Sanjay Srivastava, of Bihar. Srivastava was arrested by the Chandigarh Police in 2017. He was allegedly involved in recruitment scams across various states. He allegedly sold paper to several candidates for Punsup posts and organised special classes before the exam in Lucknow where candidates memorised the questions and answers.The issue had been hanging fire since 2017, when CM Capt Amarinder Singh first ordered ending of their services. Sources said the CM in his noting on the file of tainted employees in May 2017 ordered their services to be dispensed with after following due legal course. However, the legal course was not followed due to which the employees got a relief and managed to continue their services. The Tribune had exposed how the tainted employees even got plum postings in the department.They got field postings for wheat procurement, whereas the rules said they could only do office job till the inquiry was finalised. Following the reports, the plum postings were withdrawn. The Congress government has been drawing flak over inaction against alleged corruption in different departments during the SAD-BJP rule.Sources said Punsup managing director Dilraj Singh re-started the process of deciding the case of these employees in November last year. He issued the orders to dispense with the services of the employees today.In February 2016, the Vigilance Bureau began investigation in the case. Interestingly, then CM Parkash Singh Badal had ordered the Vigilance inquiry after a Malout-based man complained at a ‘sangat darshan’ that the exam paper for Punsup and other government departments was leaked for Rs 12 lakh.Tainted employees got plum postings||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punsup-paper-leak-18-inspectors-among-29-sacked-280214

In the post, it has been claimed that Manna was connected to the Lawrence Bishoi gang and was close to his Canada-based aide Goldy Brar, which annoyed Naruana.The victim supported a gang opposed to Manna over a land lease money issue and insulted the latter, leading to the killing, claims the post.The post reads: “I take responsibility for Kulbir Naruana’s murder. People are accusing me of backstabbing a friend. Every story has two sides and I am telling mine. Kulbir invited me to his house alone under a conspiracy and insulted me in front of 10 people, who were my rivals. I could have just walked away or fought for my honour. I choose to fight.”The post ends by saying: “I clarify that I am part of Lawrence Bishnoi group and have nothing to do with anyone else. I have killed Kulbir because of my personal enmity and not at the behest of anyone.” The police said Manna, who was admitted to the Faridkot Medical College, would be questioned about the post. The police initially claimed the post might have been written by one of Manna’s aides.SSP Bhupinderjeet Singh Virk said: “It is in our notice that a post from accused Manna Sandhu Talwandi’s account has been uploaded on the social media, but he is in our custody and is presently undergoing treatment at Faridkot Medical College. We are probing the matter.”The SSP said Manna was in touch with the Bisnhoi group and the police were probing the matter.

09-07-2021||Mumbai||With Dilip Kumar's demise, curtains on Bollywood's original 'Punjabi Troika'||With the passing of the legendary actor Mohammed Yusuf Khan—who ruled hearts as Dilip Kumar—the original 'Punjabi Troika of Indian film industry has faded into oblivion.The trio—Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor—all unmatched maestros in their art —symbolized what is regarded as the 'Golden Era' of the Hindi film industry.Hailing from Punjab in the undivided India, they opted for a career in the then fledgling Indian film industry in distant Bombay (now, Mumbai), and excelled, often par excellence… This was the strange, menacing, unforgiving, big, bad city called Bombay where another legend Dhundiraj Govind Phalke, revered now as 'Dadasaheb Phalke', sowed the first seeds of film making at a building in Dadar, in 1912.Later, Phalke scripted screen history with his first full-length black-and-white film, "Raja Harishchandra" (May 03, 2013) - heralding the birth of Indian Film Industry, which has blossomed into the biggest in the world, 77 years after his death (February 16, 1944), bagging even Oscars en route.It was in this very 'Mayanagri' that many dreamy-eyed youngsters – boys and girls – descended from all over, and continue to do so till date – for their 'tryst with filmy destiny'.Many trooped here harbouring ambitions to become heroes, heroines, villains, vamps, directors, producers, cameramen, singers, dancers, music-directors, or one of the many departments of film-making.Peshawar neighbourhood friends Dilip Kumar (b. 1922) and Raj Kapoor (b. 1924) also came here and even Dev Anand (b. 1923) from Gurdaspur followed suit—all three overcame huge hurdles before getting a toehold in the magical world of celluloid—splashing their own 'Punjabi tadka' to the Bollywood potboilers! Raj Kapoor started as a child star and then broke into big league with "Neelkamal" (1947), Dilip Kumar launched with "Jwar Bhata" (1944), and Dev Anand in "Hum Ek Hain" (1946) Â– all after the great Phalke had departed from the scene.After the initial hiccups, there was no looking back for the 'Troika' and generations around the country looked up to it for whipping up a feast of wholesome, memorable, musical entertainment.Between the 1950-1970s, they lorded over the film industry with their 'larger-than-life' images, their distinct personalities, characters they enacted, unique styles or mannerisms, their onscreen or even off-screen chemistry with many of the dream-girls of that era who rotated with them in different films, etc.Though they remained professional rivals, they were great pals full of camaraderie in their private lives, unknown to the masses.Each of them became immortal with their signature performances – Raj Kapoor ("Awara"– 1951), Dilip Kumar ("Mughal-e-Azam"-1960) and Dev Anand ("Guide"-1965) – though the trio has left behind a treasure chest of hundreds of other great films.Surprisingly, Dilip Kumar worked with both Raj Kapoor ("Andaz" - 1949) and Dev Anand ("Insaniyat" - 1955), though Kapoor-Anand never worked together, nor did the trio feature in any film jointly.Subsequently, there were others who carved a niche for themselves like Ashok Kumar, Manoj Kumar, Rajendra Kumar, Raaj Kumar, Balraj Sahni, Jeetendra Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmedra Deol, Vinod Khanna, Shatrughan Sinha, and more recently the Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan and many more.Nevertheless, the glowing legacy of Dilip Kumar (98), Dev Anand (88) and Raj Kapoor (63) will continue to inspire many future generations of actors and film-makers for centuries. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/with-dilip-kumars-demise-curtains-on-bollywoods-original-punjabi-troika-280060
