The way one leader is being rammed on us is unacceptable. Obviously, there are larger issues of whether this can be condoned,” said an MP from pro-Chief Minister Amarinder Singh camp.MP Manish Tewari last night tweeted, saying Partap Bajwa and CM would make a great team for the future.Tewari today said party’s internal issues will be raised on internal platforms.After Congress Punjab MPs conclude the meet, they said they will move adjournment notions in Parliament on farmers’ issues and had gathered to discuss Punjab related pressing issues, including farmers' agitation, Covid vaccine supplies, delayed GST compensation to the state.On Sidhu, Tewari said it’s an internal matter and will be raised at party platformsPartap Bajwa on Sidhu said, “Parties that are alive have differences. A dead party would not have differences.”The CM camp strategy now is to ask party chief Sonia Gandhi why Bajwa, a diehard Congressman, should not be made state chief if indeed a Jat Sikh leader like Sidhu is being considered for the role.“Sidhu’s appointment will rile a lot of people whose families have sacrificed their lives for the cause of sovereignty. No one can forget that Sidhu has warm ties with Pakistan PM Imran Khan and has publicly hugged Pakistan Army Chief when the Kartarpur corridor issue concluded. Pakistan has exported terror to Punjab. How will the Hindus react to Sidhus’s role? The party has to factor in this,” said another MP.MPs Ravneet Bittu and Gurjeet Aujla today asked why Bajwa can’t be the state chief.The MPs will now strategise about the way forward and many believe the party is in a very fragile state in Punjab over the way Sidhu’s appointment issue has been handled.The CM has conveyed his previous reservations on Sidhu’s appointment to Sonia and has left the decision to her saying what she says would be acceptable.But hours after he said this yesterday, CM met Bajwa and others at a meeting coordinated by Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana KP, in signs that the CM was in no mood to patch up with Sidhu.The situation on the Punjab Congress revamp remains fluid and uncertain with both camps exerting pressure on Sonia Gandhi.In a statement released on today, party leader Sukhpal Khaira, claiming support of 10 Congress MLAs, urged the party high command not to let down Capt Amarinder Singh “due to whose unrelenting efforts the party stands well entrenched in Punjab”.In a joint statement issued by Khaira, the MLAs said there was no doubt that the appointment of state PPCC chief was the prerogative of the party high command but at the same time, washing dirty linen in public has only decreased the party graph during the last couple of months.Meanwhile, Navjot Singh Sidhu, along with six other MLAs, including Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, arrived at the MLA Madanlal Jalalpur’s residence in Patiala on Sunday. A large number of their supporters and party workers were also present.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-congress-crisis-battle-lines-harden-party-mps-strategise-on-navjot-singh-sidhus-role-284990
18-07-2021||Rajmeet Singh||Will accept any decision by party prez: Capt Amarinder Singh||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 17Amid indications of the Congress high command having made up its mind to appoint Navjot Singh Sidhu as the next PPCC chief, Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday categorically told AICC general secretary Harish Rawat that he would not meet Navjot Singh Sidhu till he publicly apologised for the “derogatory” remarks on the social media and demanded that Sidhu deleted these posts. At the same time, he said he would accept any decision taken by the Congress high command.CM’s apprehensions...The CM is learnt to have handed over copies of Sidhu’s 150-odd tweets to Rawat, who arrived in Chandigarh to placate the CM with a peace formula. All this while, Sidhu remained busy meeting ministers and MLAs, a few kilometres from Captain’s Siswan farmhouse. The CM is learnt to have expressed his annoyance at the way things were being handled by the leadership without keeping him in the loop and over reports on Sidhu’s elevation in the media. Sources privy to the discussions said the CM wanted to make sure that the new PPCC chief was not allowed to undermine his role in party affairs and that he continued to have a free hand in Cabinet reshuffle. Rawat is learnt to have assured the CM of a say in the appointment of working presidents. “The CM wants the appointments should complement his efforts to retain power in the 2022 elections,” a source said.Later in the day, CM’s media adviser tweeted on CM’s behalf: “Had a fruitful meeting with @harishrawatcmuk. Reiterated that any decision of @INCIndia President will be acceptable to all. Raised certain issues which he said he’ll take up with @INCIndia president.” Rawat on his return to Delhi tweeted on Captain having said he would accept any decision that the party high command took. He dismissed certain media reports on the PPCC crisis as ‘baseless’.Significantly, former PPCC chief Partap Singh Bajwa, Speaker Rana KP Singh and minister Rana Gurmit Singh called on the CM, hours after the Rawat-Captain meeting. On Friday, Sidhu too had met Bajwa, who is said to be keen on returning to active politics. With the party high command yet to announce the new PPCC president, the CM is learnt to have already warned the leadership that Sidhu’s appointment could lead to resentment among the old guard, especially Hindu leaders. Sources said the crisis seemed far from over with the rival camps regrouping once again.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-accept-any-decision-by-party-prez-capt-amarinder-singh-284857

Notably, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India, after an order of the Supreme Court, had issued directions under Section 60 of the Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board (BOCW) Act, in 2016, to states and UTs that read: “Section 22 (h) does not allow diversion of BOCW cess-fund for any purpose other than for the welfare of the BOCW workers and their families exclusively.Centre’s nod takenWe have taken approval from the Centre. Therefore, we can carry out the remaining work. —VK Janjua, Principal secy, Labour deptHowever, the department, on the directions of the Labour Minister, has already constituted a committee to complete the work of all three skill centres.Defending the decision, VK Janjua, Labour Department principal secretary, said: “We have taken an approval from the Centre, therefore, we can carry out the remaining work. If we hadn’t taken the permission, crores of funds already been spent on the work would have gone down the drain.” On the directions issued by the Centre in 2016, he said: “We (Punjab Labour Department) had wrongly interpreted the directions then. The orders give exception to construct buildings exclusively for the construction workers and that is what we are doing.”Meanwhile, labour activist Vijay Walia said: “I will file a contempt of court against the chairman of the BOCW Board, Punjab, and other officials.

It’s high time that we adopt new strategies to pressure the government to accede to our demands. On SKM’s call, every farm union will be sending five representatives daily to protest outside Parliament.”Krishan Chauhan, another farm union leader, said, “The boycott of BJP leaders will continue and leaders of other parties will also be questioned.

18-07-2021||Aditi Tandon||Popular traction in poll year may clinch it for Sidhu||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 17Amritsar East MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu’s impending elevation as Punjab Congress president despite stiff opposition from CM Capt Amarinder Singh appears rooted in Congress leadership’s independent assessment of the ground situation in the state and the felt need to offset anti-incumbency sentiment.Internal surveys the party commissioned over recent months to judge the mood of the voters in poll-bound Punjab are learnt to have yielded results that have trumped all other considerations of caste and class when it comes to deciding on the next state unit chief.Sidhu’s popular traction is the single most important factor working to his favour so far, coupled with the former cricketer’s ability to galvanise people around emotional issues of faith and identity, with sacrilege leading the list besides drug abuse and Kartarpur Corridor.What may go in his favourThe surveys have indicated anti-incumbency of the Congress government and the urgency to ward off voter inertia with freshness. Ground exercises have also revealed Sidhu’s capacity to galvanise additional voters to the party’s advantage in an election year.Even going by the poll arithmetic, the Congress looks convinced that it needs to retain the Jat Sikh support. Of the 80 elected Congress MLAs in 2017, 32 belong to the community followed by 13 Hindus, 23 SCs, 10 OBCs and the rest others.Further, in a state with rare recent history of a sitting government returning to power (SAD had bucked the trend by repeating the government in 2012), the Congress feels it is necessary to infuse freshness in its top line of Punjab leadership and offer someone like Sidhu, a proven crowd puller, one chance.With Sidhu keen on only one role and no other, Congress president Sonia Gandhi is left with no choice but to yield in case she wants to retain the former sportsman at all costs, notwithstanding CM’s steady resistance.Sources privy to recent developments say most MLAs who met the AICC panel on Punjab, led by Mallikarjun Kharge, also told the party that Sidhu had a campaign appeal and must be retained, while the CM should continue and must be made accountable.The panel accordingly recommended that the CM should stay and Sidhu be given a “suitable role”. Sonia wants to retain both — Captain Amarinder in his current role and Sidhu in a principal role as someone with additional traction — a handy combination of experience and energy.“Sidhu has made it clear the only position acceptable to him is that of the state president. The party must therefore weigh all its options and decide to move along the lines it considers best. Sidhu’s expected installation as PCC chief is not intended to undermine the CM, whose authority has been repeatedly stressed. AICC general secretary Harish Rawat has clarified that the CM will lead the party to the 2022 elections,” a senior Congress leader said, adding the pressing concern of the Congress top brass was winning the next elections and taking every step to get there.This, the sources say, was the predominant urge right now given the party’s steady electoral decline and the fact that it is now limited to three states on its own — Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh.Insiders say the calculation of winning the 2022 state election and, to that end, betting on Sidhu’s appeal in larger party interest, appears prevalent over other calculations of community representation.“Elections are increasingly becoming personality driven. The value of every leader in politics is determined by the purpose he serves at a given point in time. Star value matters. How else would Sunny Deol, an outsider, enter Gurdaspur and defeat a veteran Congress man of many years in the 2019 LS polls?” said a leader, explaining why Sidhu is important to the Punjab Congress scheme of things at this juncture.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/popular-traction-in-poll-year-may-clinch-it-for-sidhu-284764
18-07-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu reaches out to party leaders||After apparently getting an indication that the party high command is likely to appoint him as the new PPCC president, Navjot Sidhu has stepped up his efforts to take on board former state party chiefs and other leaders.The move is being seen as a way to counter the regrouping of old guard by the CM’s camp. The cricketer-turned-politician met four ex-presidents — Partap Bajwa, Shamsher Dullo, Sunil Jakhar and Lal Singh — in the last two days. Talking to The Tribune, Bajwa said it was a courtesy call and nothing beyond it. Sources said during a recent meeting with party chief Sonia Gandhi, Sidhu had been categorically told that he should reach out to the party’s rank and file, besides meeting all important leaders.The CM’s camp is viewing it as a show of strength by Sidhu. “If the CM camp is regrouping to consolidate its position, Sidhu has also started meeting MLAs and leaders to counter the attack,” said a senior leader.As the CM met Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat at the former’s farmhouse, there was a flurry of activity as Sidhu met ministers Balbir Singh, Gurpreet Kangar, Sukhjinder Randhawa, besides meeting veteran party leader Lal Singh and a number of MLAs — Pargat Singh, Raja Warring, Davinder Ghubaya, Darshan Brar, Barindermeet Pahra, Kulbir Zira, Surjit Singh Dhiman, Pritam Kotbhai and Satkar Kaur. Calling the visit a welcome sign, Jakhar said the party had to put a united face for the 2022 Assembly elections. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sidhu-reaches-out-to-party-leaders-284769

The CM looked in no mood to call a truce with Sidhu even though he reiterated that Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s decision would be acceptable to all. The CM did not, however, give up his misgivings about Sidhu as state chief and repeated them to Rawat in his meeting, putting the ball in Sonia Gandhi’s court.CM-Bajwa will make good team ahead: TewariBy the evening, Rajya Sabha MP and former state chief Partap Bajwa, whom Sidhu met yesterday, was seen sitting with the CM and his close friends — Punjab Speaker Rana KP Singh, minister Rana Gurmit Sodhi and CM’s adviser BIS Chahal.Already, the CM has been meeting leaders over the past days in a show of strength while publicly maintaining he will defer to any decision Sonia took.SS Dullo, former Punjab Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP, when contacted today about his meeting with Sidhu, said: “I welcomed Sidhu because he said he wanted to see me. But frankly, the fact is he is yet to be appointed. We have seen in this party many appointments being reversed after being finalised. In politics, leaders ought to be patient.”Many other MPs part of the pro-CM group resistant to Sidhu as state chief remain in a wait-and-watch mode.With Sidhu having taken a very public stand against the CM in the recent past, senior leaders said he would need to make some conciliatory gestures to move forward now.“One would normally imagine that winning the 2022 election would bring leaders and MLAs together. But a lot would depend on how Sidhu conducts himself should he be elevated. He would need to show magnanimity and humility, change his working style and appear more accommodative and accessible to people. Any meaningful cohesion of hearts and purposes will only happen if genuine attempts are made. Otherwise, there is a lot of bad blood between the CM and Sidhu and it remains to be seen what happens next,” said a senior state leader.Although some Punjab Congress stalwarts believe that once Sidhu is appointed as state chief, everyone will fall in line, many strike notes of caution. “Having the two top people pulling in different directions would not be a happy sight in an election year. Sonia Gandhi will have to ensure meaningful truce. That won’t come with a formulation alone,” said an MLA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-proposed-peace-formula-beset-with-trouble-284750

He said the court has appointed District Collector, Mohali, as receiver with the direction to him to carry out the process of aforesaid attachment of the Saini’s house in Chandigarh and to receive the rent of the same at the agreed rate of Rs 2.5 lakh from Saini.It has been alleged that the said property was purchased using tainted money at the behest of Saini. The allegations were probed by the state vigilance department, after which the vigilance department had filed an application in court for attaching the property.As per the allegations a serving executive engineer (XEN) of Punjab Government Nimrat Deep Singh had obtained bribe and tainted money for Saini in the name of his father, Surinderjit Singh Jaspal who had allegedly bought the house using the same money. It has been alleged that Saini was shown to be living in the house after it was renovated in October 2018.It is pertinent to mention here that Saini is already facing a murder case in December 1991 disappearance of CITCO junior engineer Balwant Singh Multani, who was son of former IAS officer Darshan Singh Multani. On December 22, 2020, the Mohali police had filed a charge sheet against Saini him in connection with the murder case.The application by the Investigating officer (IO) of the Vigilance Department reads the house was meant for Saini and no money in the shape of rent had ever been received. Instead Rs 6.4 crore was paid by Saini to a man identified as Surinder G Singh Jaspal without any agreement to sell and later, a fabricated agreement to sell had been placed on record which was neither on stamp paper, nor attested by any witness and was signed only by Sumeet Singh Sani and Surinderjit Singh Jaspal.The IO in his application had further prayed for attaching the property under provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944, as per Section 18 A of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, as amended by the act of 2018.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/court-orders-provisional-attachment-of-punjab-ex-dgp-sumedh-sainis-house-in-chandigarh-284646

Reiterated that any decision of @INCIndia Presìdent will be acceptable to all. Raised certain issues which he said he’ll take up with @INCIndia president,” Thukral said quoting the CM..”Had a fruitful meeting with @harishrawatcmuk. Reiterated that any decision of @INCIndia Presìdent will be acceptable to all. Raised certain issues which he said he’ll take up with @INCIndia president”, @capt_amarinder pic.twitter.com/UGOrSbJbeR  Rawat said upon returning to Delhi that all talks regarding Punjab (reference the angry letter CM wrote to Sonia Gandhi) were baseless.“The CM repeated that Sonia ji’s decision regarding PCC president would be acceptable to him,” said Rawat as the long standing imbroglio appeared to near a resolution finally.मैं, @capt_amarinder जी से मिलकर अभी-अभी दिल्ली लौटा हूंँ। मुझे प्रसन्नता है कि बहुत सारी बातें जो बाहर चर्चा में हैं, वो बिल्कुल निर्मूल साबित हुई हैं और कैप्टन साहब ने फिर से अपने उस महत्वपूर्ण बयान को दोहराया है, 1/2 pic.twitter.com/bBSvCCbfV2  It remains to be seen as to how Sonia forges unity between the two warring leaders at the very top, now that the CM has set conditions of a public apology to meet Sidhu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pcc-revamp-soon-rawat-thanks-amarinder-for-being-on-board-cm-says-wont-meet-sidhu-until-he-apologises-for-derogatory-tweets-284599

18-07-2021||---||Amid talk of 'elevation', Navjot Singh Sidhu calls on PCC chief, ministers||Chandigarh, July 17Amid speculation over MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu being appointed the next PPCC president, the former cabinet minister arrived at the residence of Punjab unit chief Sunil Jakhar even as the AICC state affairs incharge Harish Rawat arrived in Chandigarh for a meeting with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.After meeting Jakhar, Sidhu visited Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa's house in Chandigarh.Apart from Randhawa, Sidhu met minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, senior leader Lal Singh, MLAs Raja Warring, Kulbir Zira, Darshan Brar and Barindermeet Singh Pahra.Sidhu is also said to have attended a meeting with the dissident ministers, including  Randhawa and others, in Sector 39, Chandigarh, last night.On Sidhu’s visit, Jakhar said it was a courtesy call.Also read: Signs of Sidhu’s elevation, bid to get Capt on boardAmarinder writes to Sonia, expresses reservation over Sidhu as Punjab Congress chief'Peace formula' to make Capt, Sidhu work together to be announced soon: Harish RawatDescribing the visit as a welcome sign, Jakhar said the party had to put a united face for the 2022 Assembly elections.Party sources said Sidhu landing up at Jakhar’s residence was being seen as a follow-up to the party high command's directive to the former minister to take all state leaders along before the anticipated announcement.The Punjab Congress is battling huge infighting with the high command struggling to implement its "peace formula", which seems to centre around Sidhu’s elevation as the PCC chief. His proposed elevation has not gone down well with the Chief Minister who has reportedly written a letter to the party president Sonia Gandhi claiming that the move would "split" the party in Punjab.Rawat coming to Chandigarh is being seen as a move by the high command to bring the CM on board before the announcement was made.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-talk-of-elevation-navjot-singh-sidhu-calls-on-pcc-chief-ministers-284534
