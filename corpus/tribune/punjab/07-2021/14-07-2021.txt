14-07-2021||New Delhi||Issued ‘peoples’ whip’ for MPs to raise farmers’ demand during parliament monsoon session: SKM||Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal on Wednesday said the umbrella body of farmers’ unions has issued a ‘peoples’ whip’ to all MPs to demand scrapping of farm laws and a legal guarantee on MSP in parliament during the monsoon session.The agitating farmers said their planned protests at the Parliament from July 22 till the end of the monsoon session will be peaceful.Asserting that their next target is to strengthen the stir in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, the protesters said meetings will be held in districts of these two states from August 1 to 25 followed by a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar on September 5.SKM suspends Charuni for one week over his statement of ‘Mission Punjab’At a press conference, Rajewal said the SKM has issued a ‘peoples’ whip’ that will be served on all MPs of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.“The People’s Whip directed the MPs to raise the demands of the agitating farmers—repeal of the three black farm laws and a legal guarantee of receiving minimum support price (MSP) -- in both Houses of Parliament and not allow either House to do any business till the union government gives assures of acceding to the demands,” he said.This will be complemented by farmers’ protests outside the parliament, Rajewal said, adding, “MPs and MLAs will raise the issue within the parliament and the farmers will raise it outside.”              While the farm leaders did not comment on whether they have received permission to hold demonstrations outside the Parliament, they maintained that the protests will be “peaceful”.“Every day from July 22 till the end of the monsoon session, 200 farmers will protest outside the parliament. If the government gets us arrested, it will, and if it does not, we will return to the borders in the evening only to go back the next day again,” another leader said.The leaders also urged their fellow protestors, particularly those who would be demonstrating at the parliament, to submit their identification details, including photographs and Aadhar cards to ensure a “peaceful protest”.A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agriculture laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.“We have asked the protestors for their details. If there is any wrongdoing on the part of any farmer, they will be punished accordingly,” a farmer leader told the press conference.According to an SKM statement, a special protest march outside parliament exclusively by women farmer leaders and volunteers will be organised on July 26 and August 9.“Women farmers have been at the forefront of this long and historic struggle of farmers for their livelihood and future. The special marches on these two days shall highlight the unique and memorable role that women have played,” it said.Announcing their strategy for the next few months, Rajewal said their upcoming move would be ‘Mission UP and Uttarakhand’.“Our next target is to strengthen our agitation in Uttarakhand and UP. From August 1-25, we will hold meetings across districts. On September 5, there will be a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar,” he said.It has been over seven months since the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations, began.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/issued-peoples-whip-for-mps-to-raise-farmers-demand-during-parliament-monsoon-session-skm-283142

He claimed unlike “illegal” donations made to these parties by shell companies, the funds provided to the Congress had nothing to do with the Punjab elections or the controversial power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the Akalis.Donations made in 2009, 2014Political donations by certain power companies were made not to the state Congress but to the AICC back in 2009 and 2014, with no link whatsoever to the incumbent government in the state, asserted the CM, slamming the Opposition for “spreading lies” to mislead people ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections.The PPAs in question were signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government, and these were legally binding on the incumbent Congress government. Rescinding the same without result in heavy penalties on the cash-strapped state, he added.The Congress government was exploring legal recourse to neutralise the impact of the PPAs without further burdening the state’s exchequer, the CM noted.In fact, he added, as per media reports, the Akalis had taken more than Rs 100 crore in political funds and declared a measly Rs 13 crore. As for the AAP, the donations taken by it during the 2014 elections were already under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate as, unlike the funds donated to the AICC by private power companies, these were neither accounted for nor declared, he said.The AAP seemed to be in collusion, choosing not to question the “anti-people” decisions of the previous SAD-BJP government, Capt Amarinder observed.The CM challenged the two parties to declare their political funding of the past 10 years to the people of Punjab. “Let the truth come out, and let the people decide who is or has cheated them with false allegations and accusations,” he remarked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sad-aap-lying-over-congress-funding-capt-amarinder-singh-282813

However, thousands of people had, reportedly, taken the vaccine — pretending to be a construction worker.VK Junjua, principal secretary, Labour Department, said they had requested for the utilisation certificate, which was a routine matter. “If we have given funds, we should get utilisation certificate.”When asked about fake beneficiaries getting the Covid vaccine as construction workers, he said, “Yes, many have got the jabs in this manner, however, we will only pay for the registered workers. Therefore, we have asked the Health Department to return the unutilised funds.”He said around 1.90 lakh registered construction workers had received the vaccine on priority, however, they had already paid for around 2.19 lakh persons. Notably, all this happened at a time when the state is jabbing people free of cost.Meanwhile, Sardara Singh, a registered construction worker, said, “We will be filing a case in the High Court over the misuse of labour funds meant for other schemes.

The assessment under Section 143(3) of Income Tax Act was completed by the assessment officer on December 21, 2018, at the assessed income of Rs 13,19,66,530 after making addition of Rs 3,53,38,067.Against the erroneous assessment, the petitioner expressly waived off his right to file appeal before Commissioner Income Tax (Appeal).He filed a revision petition under Section 264 of the Act after taking various grounds before income tax joint commissioner, Range 1, Amritsar.Instead of going into the merits of the revision, his focus was to seek an explanation on the reasons and circumstances behind Sidhu’s preference for revision under Section 264 of the Act, instead of appeal before the Commissioner Income Tax (Appeal).The petitioner stated it was an alternative available to him and reliance was laid on pronouncements by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. But the respondent, in complete disregard for the statutory provisions and legal pronouncements, and in an arbitrary manner, dismissed the revision petition vide order dated March 27.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-moves-court-in-income-tax-case-282821

The properties, at the option of the transferor, could be declared void by the maintenance tribunal set up under the Act.The Bench added Section 23 (1) of the Act attempted to provide a dignified existence to the elderly people. The Act was an enabling lifeline for the aged parents and senior citizens, who became a neglected lot, after their children refused to look after them.It asserted the Parliament enacted the maintenance Act to uphold an aged citizen’s dignity and respect. The state had serious concern about the challenge faced by the aged people. Besides physical vulnerabilities, they face emotional and psychological challenges and are totally dependent due to these frailties.The Bench added the moral law formulated through the legislation was necessary to rationalise the well-being of all in society. The moral values that prevailed in the society in the past were accepted as universal values. “The state in its wisdom, considering the acceptance of these values, seeks to promote the common good through the Senior Citizens Act. These values carried duties and obligations.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/children-expected-to-look-after-elderly-parents-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-282822

Now, when we were again called for meeting today, the government cancelled it one more time, said the activists.“This is just a way to harass us,” said one of the protesters. The cancelling of meetings forced us to assemble outside the CM’s residence and register our protest, the protester added.“Meetings are scheduled to just prompt us to wind up our protest… because they (meetings) never take place. To add to our agony, the meetings are cancelled at the very last moment,” said the protester.Sukhwinder Singh, a member of the Berozegar Sanjah Morcha, said, “Ever since the Congress government came into power in the state, the unemployed qualified youth of Punjab have been protesting for jobs. Instead of providing jobs to the youth, the government is out to file FIRs against them.”He said the unemployed youngsters had decided to “ban the entry of the Congress leaders” into their houses during the upcoming Assembly elections.“We will not allow Congress leaders to enter our houses for campaigning. They have betrayed the youngsters of Punjab,” said Sukhwinder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/berozegar-sanjha-morcha-activists-clash-with-punjabs-cm-security-in-patiala-detained-282757
14-07-2021||Pradeep Magazine||Gritty Ludhiana batsman Yashpal Sharma who shone at 1983 World Cup||Yashpal Sharma, who died after suffering a heart attack on Tuesday, was a firm, resolute, stubborn character. He was groomed in the crucible of India’s First-Class cricket, where most players spent their playing lives striving to be noticed. It is never easy to forge ahead, especially if you are playing for a state which is languishing somewhere at the bottom of the Ranji Trophy Championship.His best knocksYashpal played for Punjab in the 1970s, when many more talented and ambitious players from the state would migrate to Delhi for greater exposure and recognition. The boy from Punjab and India’s hosiery hub, Ludhiana, chose a lonely path, accepting the challenge of carving out a successful career without abandoning his home turf.The Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy consumed all his attention, where his batting flourished with a consistency that was difficult for the selectors to ignore. Soon enough, an India call came and he was on the flight to Pakistan in 1978, though a Test debut eluded him there. He was the backdoor boy who needed to prove himself, which he finally did on the tour of England in 1979. It was a tour on which his batting reflected all those gritty qualities needed to survive in a world that does not look kindly upon those who are not born to rule.He would address journalists of his age as ‘veerey’ (‘brother’ in Punjabi), and always remind them that playing for India is no mean feat, especially if you have to look over your shoulder all the time. Maybe it was hard for him to fit and melt into a mould that may have given his career the foundation and longevity which it eventually lacked.It was not that Yashpal was always a sticky batsman lacking in aggression or innovation. Far from it. It is just that we may have chosen to ignore in our memory some of his more adventurous displays. We remember and celebrate the 1983 World Cup win but forget that Yashpal was one of its key architects, with second-most runs in the team after Kapil Dev.He scored runs in all crucial games, be the opening game against West Indies or the semifinal against England. We remember the catch that Kapil Dev took running backwards to dismiss Viv Richards in the final but forget the audacious flick off a Bob Willis yorker over square-leg for a six by Yashpal in the semifinals. It was a breathtaking stroke.That shot was not an aberration as in a One-day match held in Jalandhar against England, he had smacked Ian Botham for a crucial six in the penultimate over as India romped to an unlikely win. His running between the wickets was exceptional and on the field he was a dashing mover, among the very best outfielders India has had.It is hard to imagine Yash being no more, snatched away so suddenly by death at age 66. He was a proud cricketer and a memory of his, which shows how much he valued playing for the country, has stayed with me. It is from the time when he was hoping to make a comeback: “Yashpal, 37 Tests,” that is how he would always introduce himself.Also read: A fine cricketer, and much more||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gritty-ludhiana-batsman-yashpal-sharma-who-shone-at-1983-world-cup-282807
14-07-2021||Chandigarh||‘AAP recognises my vision and work for Punjab’: Navjot Singh Sidhu’s tweet stirs rumours||Giving more fodder to rumour mongers, Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu today took to Twitter, saying the Aam Aadmi Party always “recognised his vision and work for Punjab”.He said, “Before the 2017 polls, I raised issues like sacrilege, drugs, farmers’ distress, corruption and power crisis. Now again I have presented the ‘Punjab model’. It is clear they (AAP) know who is really fighting for Punjab.”In another tweet, he said, “If the Opposition dares to question me, they can’t escape my pro-people agenda... This means they have resigned to their fate.” Sidhu’s statement came hours before Congress leader Rahul Gandhi held a meeting with Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat to discuss the peace formula for the state Congress.“Since there are reports of appointing Sidhu as PPCC chief despite resistance from the CM, the tweet can be interpreted in different ways,” said a senior leader.Sidhu was reacting to a statement by AAP state chief Bhagwant Mann, who challenged him to tweet on issue of two power companies allegedly funding the Congress. Mann said Sidhu, who always tweeted on PPAs, should respond to his challenge. Sidhu’s another tweet indicated that his posts were meant as sarcasm towards AAP and his detractors within the party. He said, “Our opposition singing about me and other loyal Congressmen, saying if you join AAP, then no issue, but if you remain in the Congress, then there is a problem.” In party circles, Sidhu’s tweet is being seen as veiled reminder to the high command about political options before him.Asked about Sidhu’s tweets on AAP, Congress general secretary Harish Rawat said, “Sidhu, Congress and the CM are on the same page as regards need for action on Bargari and drug issues. As far as Sidhu’s articulation goes, he has his own way of speaking. I am in no position to modify that. The CM and Sidhu are leaders of the same party. Our attempt is that both work together for the 2022 Assembly poll.”— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-recognises-my-vision-and-work-for-punjab-navjot-singh-sidhus-tweet-stirs-rumours-282794

Kishor’s presence nevertheless led to a speculation that Rahul might have sought his feedback on the state before finally announcing a truce formula for the Punjab unit.Kishor had met Amarinder Singh after the latter’s engagement with party chief Sonia Gandhi in the capital recently. The CM had then said that any decision taken by Sonia would be acceptable.The reshuffle exercise has, however, taken longer than expected due to lack of consensus on the formulation to accommodate Sidhu.Rawat has, meanwhile, officially stated that the state unit chief would be replaced. Talking to The Tribune, he said first the new state president would be announced and then there would be a Cabinet reshuffle. The incumbent chief is Sunil Jakhar and the CM has pitched for a Hindu, Dalit or OBC face in that role.Sources said the CM, who has been given a free hand as regards the Cabinet rejig, today put public engagements on hold. He was expected to introduce at least three new faces into the Cabinet—one each from Majha, Malwa and Doaba regions. One of the sitting ministers from Majha could be shown the door, and the Speaker could also be replaced, said a senior party leader. It remains to be seen what role Sidhu will get.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-reshuffle-buzz-harish-rawat-meets-rahul-gandhi-says-good-news-for-punjab-cong-in-3-4-days-282762

It had gone down to 8 per cent during the summer.While Pong is primarily rain-fed, inflows into Bhakra are primarily dependent on snow-melt.Last year the monsoon, as well as winter rains and snow in the dams’ catchment areas, were deficient. Unusual rains and cloudy weather over the mountains during early summer had also reduced snow-melt.“Despite poor inflows and low storage during the summer, we were able to meet the water requirements of our member states for irrigation and drinking,” Srivastava said.“We were releasing up to 42,000 cusecs of water during the sowing season,” he added. BBMB had earlier cautioned states about the low water levels and advised them to draw water judiciously.Last year, the reservoir at Bhakra had filled up to 85 per cent of its total capacity, even though rains and snow had been below normal.This year, its monsoon goes as per the weather department’s forecast, BBMB officials expect the storage deficiency to cover up and the dam to fill up to 90 per cent of its capacity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/widespread-rain-in-punjab-himachal-may-fill-up-to-90-pc-of-bhakra-and-pong-dams-282576

Both Amarinder Singh and Sidhu belong to the same community while the CM has argued for wider representation of dominant segments of Punjab society in the revamp.The role for Sidhu has remained a sticking point from the start of the deliberations on the issue.The party faces an uphill task of balancing all segments, placating Sidhu and keeping the CM on board on whatever it decides.A deliberation on possible permutation combinations is expected to have taken place at the meeting with Rahul Gandhi today.Rawat had last said the revamp would be announced by July 8 to 10.The state president would be replaced, Rawat has said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/good-news-for-punjab-cong-in-next-3-4-days-says-rawat-after-meeting-rahul-gandhi-282575
