The Committee had examined, in detail, the demands of various Employees Associations and had submitted its report. It found that certain demands raised by the employees were linked to the decisions of the Government prior to the year 2006 and were in no way connected with the report of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission. As such, these demands shall be considered separately, based on the recommendations of the concerned Administrative Departments, it was decided.The meeting further decided that certain demands linked with inta/inter departmental issues shall be addressed in consultation with the Departments of Personnel and Finance.It may be noted that some days back, acceding to a long-pending demand of the employees, the Punjab Government had decided to implement the recommendations of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission within a month of receipt of the report of the Commission. The implementation of the Pay Commission recommendations, with effect from 1st July 2021, has resulted in a financial outflow of Rs. 4692 crore to approximately 2.8 5 lakh employees and 3.07 lakh pensioners every year.On an average, it works out to Rs 79,250 per annum, over and above what they are getting at present.

Only a part of the interest remained to be paid. But the NRI commission again passed an order directing the SSP to submit a status report regarding investigation. Subsequently, an FIR was registered.Directing non-initiation of coercive action against the petitioner, Justice Sangwan observed state counsel did not dispute various orders passed by the NRI commission and that the petitioner by way of RTGS had made the payment to the complainant. He could not even dispute that opinion from District Attorney’s office was not obtained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-no-firs-in-commercial-disputes-sans-legal-opinion-288625

Until now, the state has already produced a total of 1,671 tonne biomedical waste (from March 2020 to June 2021) since the pandemic broke out.Following the experience of the first wave, all stakeholders were more economical in using the sources of Covid control during the second wave, say experts.According to the report prepared by the PPCB, Punjab produced the highest Covid waste (234 tonne) in the month of September — when the state witnessed the peak of the first wave. Similarly, the highest Covid waste (216.9 tonne) was generated in May during the peak of the second wave.However, many hospitals disregarded the biomedical disposal guidelines and threw biomedical waste in the open. Commenting on the flouting of guidelines, PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said: “We have been successful in collecting all the biomedical waste generated by Covid-dedicated health facilities. There could be some minor violations at some places, otherwise most facilities abided by the guidelines.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-produces-1-671-tonne-covid-waste-in-15-months-288628

He said based on the latest sero survey report, Punjab seemed to have more cases than reported.Giving details in a press statement, Sidhu said Punjab had been able to vaccinate 94,79,351 persons, of whom 77,16,433 had received the first dose, while 17,62,918 had completed their vaccination with two doses.He said the Fourth Sero Survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in four districts of Punjab suggested that 63.15 per cent of the state population had developed Covid antibodies. Among healthcare workers, 83.25 per cent had developed antibodies. Of the four districts, Ludhiana had the maximum positivity of 71 per cent in the general population.Sidhu further said the survey results pointed to the presence of Covid antibodies in the population surveyed, suggesting Punjab had much higher number of cases than the number reported.The figure of vaccination was low because Punjab received less supply of vaccine, he said, urging the central government to augment the vaccine supply so that the state could safeguard its population by vaccinating them with both doses. He said presently the figure of people with both doses of vaccine in Punjab stood at 5.35 per cent.“Therefore, to avoid the third wave apart and prevent pressure on the health infrastructure, vaccine supply needs to be ramped up by the Centre so that entire population can be covered,” he said.He, however, said the health department was equipped with handling an increased number of cases, which might be higher than the infections in the second wave. “Enough health infrastructure such as enhanced bed capacity, 9,000 oxygen concentrators, 75 PSA oxygen generation plants have been added in a short span,” he said.Case count may be higher: MinisterHealth Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the sero survey results pointed to the presence of Covid antibodies among 63.15% population surveyed, suggesting Punjab had much higher number of cases than the number reported||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ramp-up-covid-vaccine-supply-as-only-5-fully-vaccinated-punjab-urges-centre-288624

Only after this, the Lambi police had registered a case under Section 188, IPC, against Sukhbir, ex-MLA Harpreet Singh, SOI patron Bhim Waraich, SOI president and nearly 150 unidentified persons.Chander Shekhar, SHO, Lambi police station, said, “Sukhbir has not yet sought it.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/booked-for-covid-violation-sukhbir-singh-badal-yet-to-seek-bail-288618

It’s humiliating. I was told arrangements will be made. I waited in an unkempt spot, while other candidates were sent upstairs.Vivek Joshi (40), with 100 per cent cerebral palsy, was interviewed in an open passage of the building outside shops amidst a slumbering stray dog and parked cycles.Joshi had to be lifted up by his 67-year-old mother and a student to the ground floor passage, as there was no other way to access it. He also had to relieve himself in his car (in a disposable urination pot) in the absence of a bathroom.On Friday, Joshi had sent an email to the department informing it about his condition and seeking “suitable arrangement”.Vipul Ujjwal, Director, Social SecurityWill have better infraWe have written countless letters to get the lift fixed. We are also shifting to a new office with better accessibility. We are improving the infrastructure.Vivek said: “It is all about dignity. Interviews aren’t conducted on roads, there’s a dog here. It’s humiliating. I was told arrangements will be made. My mother and a student had to lift me up to access the passage. I waited in an unkempt spot, while other candidates were sent upstairs. I was finally interviewed for about 5 to 7 minutes.”Amarjit Singh Anand, state disability activist, said: “It’s an irony, a social security office isn’t accessible to the disabled that it claims to represent.

The Public Works Department has filed a civil suit for the recovery of land compensation taken twice.Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, Cabinet MinisterWon case in apex courtI have every right to claim genuine compensation for my ancestral property. I have won cases right up to the SC and have full faith in the legal system.The issue has surfaced at a time when hundreds of farmers are protesting to get compensation enhanced to Rs 70 lakh from Rs 45 lakh per acre for their prime land being acquired for the Delhi-Katra highway. Party leaders said not only were Opposition parties gunning for the minister in the run-up to the 2022 Assembly elections, but they would now question newly appointedPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu on the issue.An inter-departmental committee under the Chief Secretary had in 2020 indicted the minister for taking double compensation for land acquired at Mohan Ke Uttar village in Ferozepur during the previous SAD-BJP government in July 2014.The probe questioned the role of a PWD official as well as revenue department officials while dealing with the court cases as well as acquisition proceedings. Pointing out “intentional negligence” from each and every aspect, the committee had said the case had been “grossly mishandled” from the very start, resulting in government facing contempt proceedings. Talking to The Tribune, Sodhi said he could not comment on what the former PCC chief had written. “I am true to myself and to the state government. I have every right to claim genuine compensation for my ancestral property. I have won cases right up to the Supreme Court and have full faith in the legal system. After a miscellaneous application (MA) filed by the department has been dismissed, a review application has been filed by them. Moreover, the matter is sub judice.”Questioning the re-determined compensation rates submitted by the office of Guru Har Sahai SDM in 2019 under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, party leader privy to the case said the former PCC chief in his letter had pointed out that the present collector rate of agricultural land along the link road in the village was Rs 6.72 lakh per acre, whereas the total compensation for the land acquired had been pegged by the SDM at Rs 80 crore, which had not been paid yet.Land compensation taken twice||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-in-fix-over-sunil-jakhar-seeking-action-against-punjab-cabinet-minister-rana-gurmit-singh-sodhi-288616

While most of the protesters were stopped near the Chamkaur Sahib bus stand, nearly a dozen others reached the gurdwara entrance and tried to chase the car of VIPs as they left after paying obeisance.Some protesters were seen reaching close to the car waving black flags at Sidhu. Following the incident, the district police had booked four local residents, including members of the Kirti Kisan Morcha, and 45 unidentified persons under Sections 148, 149, 282, 323 and 341 of the IPC.

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Intake into IAF from Punjab, Haryana increases but dips in Army and Navy||Recruitment of airmen in the Air Force from Punjab and Haryana has witnessed an increase over the past three years while intake into the Army from these states has dipped.The number of airmen recruited from Haryana in 2018, 2019 and 2020 was 859, 1501 and 1719, respectively. Even the intake of sailors into the Navy from Haryana has seen a noticeable increase, with 637, 659 and 404 persons opting to join the maritime force over the aforementioned years.On the other hand, recruitment of personnel below officer rank from Haryana dipped from 4, 994 in 2018 to 3,859 in 2019 and 3,825 in 2020, according to figures placed by the Ministry of Defence in the Rajya Sabha on Monday.Haryana is among the top states in the country to contribute manpower for the defence services, both in the officer cadre as well as the ranks. The Infantry’s Jat Regiment predominately draws troops from this state.While recruitment of airmen from Punjab has also seen a consistent increase from 69 in 2018 to 78 in 2019 and 100 in 2020, intake into the other two services have declined.In 2018, the number of soldiers recruited from Punjab was 7.079. This fell to 5,117 in 2019 and then rose to 5,821 in 2020. The number of sailors joining the Navy from Punjab and Chandigarh was 115 in 2018, 133 in 2019 and 66 in 2020.Punjab, like neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, has a deep-rooted martial legacy and family tradition to join the defence forces. Besides forming a significant part of various arms and services, most troops in the Infantry’s Punjab Regiment, Sikh Regiment and Sikh Light Infantry hail from Punjab. The Dogra Regiment and a part of the Punjab Regiment draw troops from Himachal Pradesh.While the intake of soldiers in the Army from Himachal Pradesh rose from 3,266 in 2018 to 3,309 in 2019 and 3,571 in 2020, the numbers for the other two services have fallen. In 2018, 38 persons from the hill state joined the Air Force, which fell to 19 each in the succeeding two years. In the Navy, recruitment of sailors fell from 57 in 2018 to 50 in 2019 and 20 in 2020.Intake into the armed forces varies each year and depends upon retirements, premature release and attrition due to casualties and injuries. At present, as many 1,10,877 posts in the rank and file of the three services are lying vacant. According to MoD’s data, this includes 90,640 in the Army, 7,104 in the Air Force and 11,927 in the Navy besides another 1,206 in the medical stream.As far as the officer cadre is concerned, the total shortage is 10,849, which includes 7,912 in the Army, 610 in the Air Force and 1,190 in the Navy. In addition, the services are short of 444 medical and 693 military nursing officers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/intake-into-iaf-from-punjab-haryana-increases-but-dips-in-army-and-navy-288541
27-07-2021||New Delhi||Women farmers hold ‘Kisan Sansad’; pass resolution demanding 33 per cent representation in Parliament||Gender lines blurred and traditional roles reversed ever so often as men and women joined hands to share responsibilities in the farm, at home and at protest sites to keep up the prolonged fight against three agri laws, women farmers said here on Monday.Gathered for an all-woman Kisan Sansad (farmers' parliament), they demanded the repeal of the Essential Services Commodities Amendment Act, and stressed the seven-month agitation at multiple sites on Delhi's borders could be sustained because men and women -- whether husbands and wives or fathers and daughters -- were completely in sync.The Sansad passed the following resolutions were passed:Resolution 1:Even though women contribute quite significantly to our farming, they do not receive the dignity, recognition and status that they ought to in the country. Their labour, hard work, skills and knowledge and their vitality should be taken on board by people's movements and by our society. There should be well-thought-out measures adopted to increase the role and space for women in the Kisan Andolan.  Resolution 2:It is unanimously resolved in this Mahila Kisan Sansad that women be given 33% representation in Parliament and Assemblies on the pattern of local bodies like Panchayats and Municipal Committees. A Constitutional Amendment be made in this regard for giving due representation to women who constitute 50% of the population.Whether it was cooking at home to feed the children, ploughing the fields in the sun or relentlessly protesting for months, both men and women farmers, since November last year, have defied conventional gender roles to do it all, the women farmers, who travelled to Delhi from different states, said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pardesh, are demanding that the legislations be repealed and have been protesting against the laws at Delhi border points of Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri."Women are doing men's work and men are doing what women used to do. So what?" Kulwinder Kaur from Punjab's Tarn Taran district said at the Kisan Sansad, which is being held at Jantar Mantar near Parliament where the Monsoon Session is underway "Women are no longer the same. Kalpana Chawla went to space, we have only come to Delhi. If women can become prime ministers, why can't we fight our own battle," said Kaur, who was among the 200 women who participated in the farmers' parliament, which began on July 22.Kaur said that she along with several other women from her area have been protesting at the Singhu border for the last seven months, while their husbands and brothers, and brothers-in-law have been taking care of the household and the fields."I have been at Singhu with several other women from Tarn Taran for all these months to show that this is not just men's protest. Farmers are not just men. Women work on fields too…we are farmers too, she said.“And, while I am here, my husband is taking care of the kitchen and cooking,” Kaur said.Every day 200 farmers are participating in the Kisan Sansad, which is a part of their strategy to draw the government's as well as the opposition's attention to the issues that have been plaguing the farming community.According to Harinder Bindu, the farmers, while embarking on this journey, knew that their struggle was going to be a long one, and had prepared themselves for whatever might come.“We knew that the protest was going to continue for a long time, and we knew we wouldn't be able to sustain it alone," she said."Towards the beginning of the protest…in December last year, when men from most households had to be at the protest sites, women back home learnt how to drive tractors so that they could plough the fields, something that men used to do,” the farmer leader from Bhatinda in Punjab said.She added that similarly, as the protest continued, there were weeks and months during which women in several households were camping at Delhi's borders, and men were helping out back home.“When women come to the protest, men help out with the household chores. It is this cooperation, and collaboration among everybody that has strengthened the movement,” Bindu said.While both men and women work the fields, the roles have traditionally been gender specific.The ploughing is largely taken care of by the men, explained farmer leader Kiran Malik, and activities like cutting and trimming grass to feed cattle, irrigating and spraying insecticides in the field, making dung cakes for manure, among others fall into the women's share of responsibilities.“It is strange that the image of a farmer is by default a man, but it is the women who end up doing most of the farm work. Men have traditionally done the heavy lifting tasks, and then they are done. But since this protest began, the way of doing things has completely changed.“Now everything is done keeping in mind that it should help the movement in some way or the other,” Malik, who hails from Hisar in Haryana, said.She added that while her husband and other men in the family have been regularly traveling to Tikri, the women in her family have taken over the responsibilities in the fields completely, thanks to all the help that they receive from their neighbours.“Every single farmer's objective today is to fuel this movement, and all our actions are directed towards that one cause, and neighbours in our area have all been cooperating and helping out each other extensively,” Malik said.Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They claim that the laws will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.--with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/women-farmers-hold-kisan-sansad-pass-resolution-demanding-33-per-cent-representation-in-parliament-288538
