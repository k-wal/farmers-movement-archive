28-07-2021||Chandigarh||SAD accuses Centre of showing ‘utter insensitivity’ towards farmers’ issue||SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday accused the BJP-led Centre of showing “utter insensitivity” towards the “genuine” demands of the farmers who are protesting against three contentious farm laws.Badal said it was shocking that the union government was trying to “defame” the farmers by stating that they were not ready to hold talks on these laws when the issue was of repeal of the three “black laws”.“The entire farming community wants the three laws to be repealed. The government should do so and then hold talks on ways and means to give a further boost to the agricultural economy,” said Badal in a party statement here.The SAD president said the MPs of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party had shown solidarity with farmers by holding protest in Parliament on this issue.“We will continue our protest till the union government accepts the demands of the farmers,” said Badal.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year demanding that the three farm laws be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.However, the government has maintained the laws are pro-farmer.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over the three Central legislations.Meanwhile, Congress leader Darshan Lal Sharma joined the SAD in the presence of Badal here.Sharma was a secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Congress, besides being a block samiti member for 15 years, the SAD said in a statement.

28-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers discuss Contract Farming Act on Day 5 of Kisan Sansad||The fifth day of the Kisan Sansad that is running parallel to the Monsoon session of Parliament saw farmers deliberating on the Contract Farming Act, 2020, according to a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday.Saying that the act was brought in by the government in “an undemocratic and unconstitutional manner” last year, the umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions said, “This is a legal framework to facilitate corporate farming and resource grabbing.”There were a total of three Kisan Sansad sessions held through the day that were moderated by farmer leaders from different states.Among the major topics of discussion were threat to food security and environmental degradation caused by contract farming.“Several members shared their personal experiences of contract farming like rejection of produce by companies under one garb or the other after an entire season’s toil by the farmer.“They talked about how the central law is about facilitating corporate farming and resource-grabbing. The potential threat to food security from contract farming was highlighted, in addition to environmental degradation,” the SKM said.It added that the debate on the Contract Farming Act would continue the following day.The Kisan Sansad is part of the latest strategy of the farmers who have been protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws at multiple Delhi borders since November last year.The farmers have expressed fear over the laws eliminating the Minimum Support Price system, and leaving them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.As part of these Kisan Sansad sessions, 200 farmers from the protest sites participate in a mock Parliament session at Jantar Mantar during which issues concerning the farming community are discussed.The SKM also expressed its concerns over the Indian Marine Fisheries Bill, 2021 that is listed for tabling in Parliament in the current session.“Fisher unions are pointing out how the Bill facilitates the takeover of ocean’s fishing resources by corporates, and envisages a registration and licensing process extremely difficult for traditional fishing communities and impinges on their fundamental right to life and livelihood,” the SKM said.It added that the drafting of the Bill has been “non-participatory”, and “no traditional fishers were consulted or included in the process”.Hailing the farmers’ perseverance to continue their fight through the rains, the farm union body said that the protesters have been agitating at the Delhi borders as well as at Jantar Mantar “cheerfully and without complaints”.However, it added, uneven and inadequate showers at the onset of monsoon this year had led to “significant deficit sowing in several states in the country”, and claimed that farmers hadn’t received any aid from the government authorities.

28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM asks PSPCL to cancel and revisit all one-sided PPAs signed by SAD-BJP govt||Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday has ordered Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to cancel or revisit all the one-sided PPAs with private companies that are not contractually obligated to supply sufficient power to meet the state’s peak demand during the paddy sowing and summer season.Taking serious note of fiasco relating to Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL), Mansa – one of the largest private thermal plants in the state, which miserably failed to perform in the current paddy season, the Chief Minister has directed PSPCL to revoke its PPA, which is heavily biased in favour of the company.He has also asked PSPCL to examine all the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJPP government with the various Independent Power Producers (IPPs), which were established basically to meet the power demands of the State, especially during paddy sowing and summer season.He has directed PSPCL to terminate/revisit all the lopsided PPAs that are not beneficial to the state.The Chief Minister noted that PSPCL had signed 14 PPAs with Thermal/Hydro and 122 Long Term PPAs with Solar/Biomass Plants after 2007, to make the state power surplus with generation capacity of around 13800 MW. However, in this current paddy season, all three units of TSPL failed to generate power for few days during the peak paddy season.One unit of TSPL failed completely to operate from March 2021, and two units remained out of power generation for the last one month, he said. At present, only one unit of TSPL is operational, he said, adding that these factors have caused huge power shortage in the state.PSPCL has already issued notice to TSPL by imposing the penalty but as the PPAs are one-sided, the penalty imposed will be very meager in comparison to the losses caused by the failure of these thermal plants.Further, as per the provisions of the PPAs, at present, it is not compulsory for the IPPs to supply power during peak summer/paddy period. Hence, taking advantage of the loopholes in PPAs, the IPPs are claiming full fixed charges from PSPCL by supplying power in the off-season when the state requires it the least.The Chief Minister pointed out that to meet the deficit resulting from the failure of TSPL, with a capacity of 3x660MW (1980MW) to meet the state’s critical power requirement in the ongoing season, PSPCL had to purchase short-term power from the Power Exchange.PSPCL had procured 271 crore Units of power in the months of June and July by spending Rs 886 crore.It was also forced to utilise full power from the Central Sector Generating Stations so that the crops of the farmers could be saved, Captain Amarinder noted, adding that the state was also compelled to enforce power regulatory measures from 1st July to 11th July on Large Supply (LS) industry of to meet the rising demand of the farmers.This, he said, not only resulted in inconvenience to the various consumers of the state but also imposed additional financial burden on the financially crunched PSPCL.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-asks-pspcl-to-cancel-and-revisit-all-one-sided-ppas-signed-by-sad-bjp-govt-289554

The state police chief has been asked to furnish his “own” affidavit in the matter. Describing the fact as “disturbing”, the High Court also made it clear that the matter required a thorough probe.The case was brought to the notice of Justice Anil Kshetarpal’s Bench after Sukhdev Singh filed a petition against Punjab for the grant of anticipatory bail in an FIR registered on September 30, 2013, for cheating, criminal breach of trust and another offence under Sections 406, 420 and 34, IPC, at Dayalpura police station in Bathinda.Justice Kshetarpal asserted the prosecution’s case was that the petitioner was a partner in firm running a rice mill. There was shortage of 22,309 bags of paddy. The estimated value of the paddy, belonging to a PSU and assigned to the rice mill for de-husking, was Rs 1,36,00,000.Justice Kshetarpal took note of the contention by the petitioner’s counsel that the rice milled on receipt of the paddy had already been supplied and the shortfall, if any, was regarding the previous year. The petitioner was in custody in a case involving NDPS Act, 1985, on June 8, 2013. As such, the petitioner couldn’t be said to have caused the deficiency.As per the allegations, the public money was involved. Apparently, there was no reason for the investigating agency in not taking appropriate steps for completion of the probe during these eight years. As such, the explanation could only be given by the investigating agency.“Hence, the DGP is directed to verify the correct facts and file his own affidavit, explaining the reasons as to why the investigating agency dragged this matter for so long,” Justice Kshetarpal directed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-dgp-explain-why-cheating-case-pending-for-over-eight-years-289154

As per the health department, so far only 25 per cent people have been given the first dose of vaccine, while only 5.9 per cent the second one in the district.As per record, 2,51,483 persons have been given the first dose and 59,099 the second out of around 10 lakh people, who have to be vaccinated.The drive has come to a halt as the district ran out of stocks. Nobody was inoculated at the district hospital today. An official said the department had not received the fresh consignment, so they had to stop the drive. “The existing stock has been exhausted and we are awaiting fresh consignment. As soon as it reaches Fazilka, we will resume the process,” he added.NGO Naujawan Welfare Society president Sonu Maheshwari said: “We are facing a huge problem as earlier we motivated residents to come out to get jabbed by announcing gifts and creating awareness, but now when they have started coming out, we don’t have vaccine.”He said the stocks were limited but the number of people who wanted to get vaccinated was huge, which usually led to heated arguments many times. “Due to this many NGOs have even refused to hold camps,” he said.Teachers, employees of banks and other sectors are reportedly facing problems as they have to be vaccinated before rejoining work, but vaccines are not available. Civil Surgeon Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon said: “The pace of vaccination is slow as the supply is less. Whatever stocks we get from the state, we use it. In total, 3.10 lakh doses have been given to people so far in the district.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/low-supply-of-doses-hits-inoculation-in-bathinda-district-289159

The stamp duty collected by the district authorities from April to June was more than double the corresponding period of the last financial year.Sources said From 1 April to June 30, district authorities received Rs 32.21 crore as stamp duty. Last year in the same period, Rs 15.84 crore was collected. In 2019, authorities got Rs 20.81 crore and, in 2018, Rs 23.48 crore during the same period.Local real estate agents said fearing a slump in the market, many sold their properties including plots, commercial buildings and houses, at lower rates. They also confirmed distress sale as many businessmen and big shopkeepers, who suffered huge losses during Covid, sold their properties to arrange money to repay the loan they had taken from private money lenders and various banks.“When Covid was at its peak in May, good houses in posh colonies were sold at lower rates. Now the same houses are being sold at higher rates,” said Jaswinder Singh, a local dealer.For many, it’s surprising as the district was the worst hit by Covid. As till June 7, the district witnessed 796 Covid deaths, of which highest 121 were from Sangrur health block. While 604 deaths took place from January to June, 411 casualities happened in May alone.Sangrur DC Ramvir, who was monitoring the stamp duty collection on a daily basis, said during in the current financial year, they have collected Rs 32.21 crore from April to June.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-covid-sangrurs-stamp-duty-revenue-doubled-289162

He was hiding at the house of his relative Mahinder Singh in Chamiari village in Ajnala where he was surrounded by the police following a tip-off.The police recovered five country-made pistols and a double-barrel gun and ammunition besides three mobile phones from his possession. The police also held Nikku Khaduria from the spot while their accomplice Gurlal Singh was arrested from Tarn Taran. Even before his surrender and fearing his encounter, he uploaded a post on a social platform about his arrest.A joint team of the OCCU and police led by DSP Balbir Singh, DSP Gurinderpal Singh Nagra and ASP Abhimanyu Rana surrounded the house where Sekhon and his accomplices were hiding. The police teams repeatedly asked the gangster to surrender.Sekhon had become a headache for the Punjab Police due to his crime record. Recently, he along with his accomplices gunned down gangster Amandeep Singh, alias Aman Fauji, and SAD worker Prabhjit Singh, alias Pooran, at Patti in Tarn Taran on June 1.Sekhon was also a prime suspect in the killing of a bouncer Jagroop, alias Jagga, of Nangli Batha village in the Ranjit Avenue area in October 10 last year. — TNSExtortion callsIn a statement, DGP Dinkar Gupta said Preet Sekhon and his accomplices had been involved in making a large number of extortion and threat calls to a number of prominent businessmen and professionals, especially in the Amritsar area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/notorious-gangster-two-aides-arrested-in-amritsar-289163

This recommendation was also made in the group’s interim report submitted last year and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had then said the power subsidy would stay.It also recommends shutting down two thermal plants that produce power at much higher cost and Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) must plan in advance how to recover best price for assets and ensure smooth transition to other sources of power, after the Bathinda plant has already been shut.The recommendations have come at a time when the government is going all out to woo farmers and any decision to rationalise power subsidy can “politically hurt” the Congress. The government is also under pressure to scrap the controversial Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) made by the previous Akali-BJP government with the independent power producers. With the group recommending shutting down of thermal plants, scrapping PPAs would threaten the energy security of the state.The report, a copy of which is with The Tribune, also raises questions over the government’s claim of Rs 5 per unit power tariff to industry, saying effective tariff is much higher and the industry is reeling under rampant and unscheduled cuts. “Stop burdening the industry with subsidy of certain other groups of consumers. Subsidy should be borne transparently in the budget. Loading it on the industry or commercial sector has the consequence of reducing competitiveness of Punjab’s industry,” says the report.The recommendations made by the group in its interim report last year for the agriculture sector had hinted at bringing in corporatisation by recommending creation of a framework that allows land to be leased for 15-20 years for plantation and orchards, 5-10 years for other agriculture purposes on renewable terms. The final report now says they have not received any feedback from the government “as processing of recommendations will have to wait for the outcome of farmers’ protests”.The report says the recommendations, if implemented, would help the state reach its pre-eminent position and Punjab needs to grow at 8 per cent every year for revival of the state economy in the post-Covid-19 scenario.Other important recommendations HealthcareIndustrySocial Sector ReformsDigitisationPay govt employees on par with central staff||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rationalise-power-subsidy-in-punjab-montek-panel-289164

My constituency is free of these two menaces due to my personal intervention. A majority of those opposing me are Akali agents.Many senior leaders, including former and incumbent sarpanches, and zila parishad and block samiti members, of over 100 villages at a meeting here announced to oppose Jalalpur. They further demanded an independent probe into illegal liquor and mining cases in Ghanaur.Many of those present at the meeting claimed to be associated with the party for over three decades, including former sarpanch Karnail Singh, nagar panchayat member Mohan Singh, zila parishad member Palwinder Singh Lali and block samiti member Chatinder Vir Singh.“The MLA and his coterie have been shielding illegal mining mafia and liquor trade. The sole purpose to elect him as the MLA was to ensure development of the constituency, which has been completely lost,” they claimed.“Our fight is against corruption and illegal mafia taking control of our constituency. The sand tipper worth Rs 2,700 five years ago is now being sold for Rs 5,000, while majority of the sand from our constituency is being illegally smuggled outside the district,” said Karnail Singh and PS Lali.They further alleged that illegal liquor factories unearthed in the past had direct involvement of a Congress sarpanch close to Jalalpur but “no action was taken in that case as no money was recovered in the case despite liquor worth crores sold by them illegally”.“Only a faction of illegal liquor mafia is operational with direct backing, while all others have been told to shut operations or face FIRs,” said block samiti members Chatinder Vir Singh and former Ghanaur party president Sham Lal. The Congress workers say they will approach newly elected PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and Capt Amarinder Singh, urging them not to allot ticket to Jalalpur. Refuting the allegations, Jalalpur said these Congress leaders were “working against the party since 2017 and were involved in illegal liquor trade, which he ensured was raided and foiled”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-congress-leaders-revolt-against-own-mla-from-ghanaur-289128

The meeting happened after Sidhu had sought time from the CM.In political circles, the meeting is being seen as an effort by the party leadership to strike a conciliatory note between the two leaders, who apparently looked at unease at the recently held installation ceremony.However, the CM’s reply to Sidhu’s assertion demanding immediate action on the longstanding issues is being seen as a counter to the letter mentioning in the foot note that “nothing great was ever achieved without an act of decision. We request you to act immediately”.In the hour-long meeting, Sidhu was accompanied by his four working presidents — Kuljit Nagra, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Sukhwinder Danny and Pawan Goel.
