03-07-2021||Chandigarh/Hoshiarpur||Sukhbir Badal alleges illegal sand mining at Mukerian; desperate attempt, says Mining Minister Sarkaria||SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday alleged that illegal sand mining was being carried out at Mukerian in Hoshiarpur district.Badal made a surprise visit to Mukerian and while talking to reporters there, he alleged that there was a nexus between certain officials and Congress leaders behind the “illegal mining”.“Shocking state of mining mafia. After Beas, visited Mukerian & saw firsthand how mafia has extracted sand up to 200 feet. CM @capt_amarinder & minister @SarkariaTeam should tell Pbis (Punjabis) which law allows extraction of sand up to 200 feet? Officially the limit is 10 feet only,” Badal said in a tweet.“2 days back when we exposed illegal mining at Beas, Mining Secretary justified the same. I'm waiting how govt will justify illegal activity at Mukerian. We aren't afraid of cases. Cong govt can register 10 cases against me but I'll continue to safeguard interests of Punjabis,” said Badal in another tweet.On June 30, the Shiromani Akali Dal chief had made similar charges when he had visited the Beas river bank in Amritsar.Though at that time, the state mining department had trashed Badal's accusations and asserted that the site visited by the SAD chief near the Beas river was a legal one.On July 1, the Amritsar Police had booked Badal and two other Akali leaders under various sections, including 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act.''Desperate attempts'Punjab Mining Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria on Saturday lashed out at Sukhbir Singh Badal for what he called were “his desperate attempts to gain lost political ground in the state”.In a statement issued here Mining Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said that the sites visited by Sukhbir Badal in Hoshiarpur district were auctioned under the previous regime of Akalis. A press release quoted him as claiming that there were several attempts by some people to continue illegal mining but the department had acted swiftly and imposed heavy penalties. This was the only reason that Akalis went to their favorite mining sites and there was no machinery as well as illegal mining as claimed by the Akalis,” he said.He also claimed that the state exchequer under the Badal rule was receiving the revenue to the tune of Rs. 35 to 40 crore annually, which had now increased to 10 fold in the Congress Government.“Sukhbir Badal knows that the transparency ensured by the Congress Government in mining activities would become an issue in the upcoming assembly polls,” said the Minister. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sukhbir-badal-alleges-illegal-sand-mining-at-mukerian-desperate-attempt-says-mining-minister-sarkaria-277720

03-07-2021||New Delhi||Court extends interim protection given to Lakha Sidhana in R-Day violence case||Saying it would “not intervene in things where fundamental rights are involved”, a Delhi court on Saturday extended the interim protection given to alleged gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana in connection with the violence in Red Fort on Republic Day.Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau directed Delhi Police not to arrest Sidhana till July 20. The court said it did not want a ‘Jail Bharo Andolan’ to start.Sidhana, who was earlier granted protection till July 3, has been directed to join the probe.“We do not want Jail Bharo Andolan to start. These are political issues. If they (protesters) wanted to highlight the issue, are they wrong? I will not intervene in things where fundamental rights are involved,” the judge said while granting him relief.On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.Fearing arrest, Sidhana, through his advocates Jaspreet Singh Rai and Jasdeep Dhillon, moved Delhi's Tis Hazari court seeking anticipatory bail. His counsel asserted that he had no role to play in the incident.Public Prosecutor Pankaj Bhatia, representing the police, told the court that Sidhana had invited the protesters to the Red Fort and is one of the main conspirators in the case.The prosecutor said he stayed outside the fort area when the violence took place, to which the judge said, “If his presence is not there, then we cannot do anything about it. Interim protection extended till July 20.”Sidhana had earlier denied involvement in the Republic Day violence. According to the police, he has almost 20 cases registered against him, including that of robbery, murder, and assault on police.

The members of the organisation staged a mild protest too.Sometime back, the Golden Temple administrative officials had objected to his langar sewa, following which it was discontinued for some time but was later resumed.Today, the temporary arrangements such as shed and preparation infrastructure for the preparation of langar have been demolished by a ditch machine, says Gurpal Singh, a member of the organisation. “The land was under the management of PUDA.

03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Power outages spark protests across Punjab||Amid an unprecedented hike in demand for power, unscheduled cuts were reported from various parts of the state today.This despite the fact that the industry has been forced to shut down for two days to divert all available power to the agriculture sector, which too received just six-seven hour supply despite being promised eight hours. As a result, widespread protests by agriculture and domestic power consumers were reported today.Pvt plants meet 22% demandThe unscheduled cuts today, ranging from three to four hours, were reported more in Doaba and Majha regions, while Malwa region had some relief in the wake of protests against erratic supply in the past three days.The demand for power today was 13,600 MW. The government claims it could save almost 1,000 MW by imposing restrictions. “The supply to agriculture consumers today was about 5,500 MW, up by more than 1,000 MW yesterday. There were no scheduled power cuts in the state and if there were disruptions in supply, it could be because of local technical snags in transmission lines,” said PSPCL Chairman A Venu Prasad.While one unit of Talwandi Sabo plant continued to be shut because of a technical snag, the unit of the state-owned thermal plant at Ropar, which was shut down yesterday, became operational today. However, the other unit of Ropar power plant developed a snag. As a result, the state’s own thermal power generation today was 1,605 MW and its hydropower generation was 890 MW.Almost 7,591 MW was arranged from outside the state (from central sector through power banking and also purchasing power on the power exchange). Renewable energy contributed 400 MW to the surging demand today.Considering the rising power demand, Prasad said they had written to the Centre to increase their transmission capacity from the present 7,400 MW to 7,800-8,000 MW. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/power-outages-spark-protests-across-punjab-277271
03-07-2021||Punjab is witnessing not 13||‘Delayed rains, record surge in demand to blame for power crisis in Punjab’||It’s for the first time that any state faced such high demand in just a matter of few days. The delay in pre-monsoon and monsoon rains led to rise in power demand. We are facing a demand of over 15,000 MW, which may rise to 16,000 MW if rains are delayed further.Delayed rains and rising temperature forced us to resort to power cuts. Limited power is available from the BBMB as it has low water level. I assure that starting today, farmers will get eight-hour supply for tubewells, while domestic consumers won’t face long cuts.We have 172 PPAs. We are revisiting all old PPAs and taking it up with the Centre and the regulator. We have also formed a panel to review the three private thermal plants in the state. Even our legal experts are trying to find a solution to save crores being paid to them against surrendered power. For now, we have to abide by the signed PPAs. I am also trying to get legal opinion on whether independent power producers (IPPs) can be fined for not supplying during peak paddy season.Despite drawing maximum power from the national grid and using all available resources, we had to resort to power cuts and two-day weekly off for industry. We managed to save 800-1,000 MW, which has been diverted to agriculture and domestic consumers.We are working on improved grid stability and in the past year managed to get our grid supply from Centre enhanced from 6,400 MW to 7,400 MW. We are trying to have more sub-stations and grids to get better power supply.In Bathinda, we shut the plant due to high costs and less output. It was supplying 400 MW and even if it was working, we would have faced the same scenario.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/delayed-rains-record-surge-in-demand-to-blame-for-power-crisis-in-punjab-277296

03-07-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu may head Congress poll campaign committee||In the working formula being adopted by the Congress high command to bring CM Capt Amarinder Singh and his former Cabinet colleague Navjot Sidhu on the same page, the Amritsar MLA is learnt to have been offered the post of campaign committee chairman ahead of the Assembly polls.Why the delay?Sources say decision on related issues such as Cabinet reshuffle, reconstituting the PPCC balancing the caste and community matrix, addressing aspirations of dissident ministers and MLAs who had questioned the CM on unfulfilled poll promises and roadmap for Assembly elections is taking time. Balancing CM and Sidhu is one aspect of the exercise.An indication to this effect was made by AICC general secretary and Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat. “For the benefit of the party, the CM and Sidhu will work together. Like other leaders, Sidhu will be given a crucial role like campaign committee chairman to ensure the party returns to power. The high command has to decide on the issue,” he said, refusing to share further details.It is learnt in the last meeting between party leader Rahul Gandhi and Sidhu, the cricketer-turned-politician has been updated on the role(s) the party leadership is considering for him. The post of Deputy CM with departments of his choice may also be offered to him, subject to his consent. The party president will consult the CM before making any formal announcement.“After considering all options and inputs from veteran leaders, the leadership has zeroed in on Sidhu’s role, to which the CM will have no objection. Effort will be to give Sidhu a post where he can work independently and also be involved in other committees. Once the party returns to power, Sidhu may be at the helm. But for the moment, he has been told to exercise restraint,” said a veteran leader.It has been further pointed out that most of the issues mentioned in the 18-point agenda handed down to the CM had also been flagged by Sidhu. “If the CM has started addressing the issues pointed out by Sidhu, the latter should have no problem assuming the responsibility being offered,” said a leader from Punjab, who had also been consulted by the top brass to end the crisis.

Factually, the NPA is meant to make medicos desist from private practice.Doctors run clinicsIronically, some of the doctors doing private practice were the ones who participated in the protest on the hospital premises here on Thursday.In an investigation by The Tribune, it has been found that one of the doctors of the Rajindra hospital, who happens to be a head of the department, was treating patients at her residence. The Tribune found that one more doctor of the Orthopaedics Department was running a clinic at his residence at 7.03 pm as patients were seen waiting outside his home on Wednesday evening. The doctor does not use his name in the prescription slip. Around Rs 300 is charged from each patient for consultation.In the past, the Medical Education Minister, Principal Secretary and district administration have been apprised of private practice by doctors at the hospital. However, nothing concrete has been done in this regard.Dr Diwan Bhullar, general secretary, Punjab Medical and Dental Teachers’ Association, said, “There are black sheep in every profession. We strongly oppose these practices because they are getting the NPA. The doctors are sabotaging the cause of our agitation and we condemn it.”Dr Rajan Singla, Principal, Government Medical College, said, “If you have any proof, I will send it to the higher authorities for further action. I am not aware of any doctor indulging in private practice as of now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-row-over-doctors-perk-cut-practice-norms-flouted-277358

In all, just about 17 per cent of the total applicants succeeded in getting the senior tag.No less than 113 advocates had initially applied, but one of the candidates died during the process. The remaining 112 applications were scanned by the permanent committee for designation as senior advocates.The committee, comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha, Justice Jaswant Singh, Justice Rajan Gupta, Punjab Advocate-General Atul Nanda, Haryana Advocate-General BR Mahajan and Additional Solicitor-General Satya Pal Jain, also interacted with the candidates. It eventually came out with a list of 27 candidates, which was placed before the full court for approval.The list failed to find the full court’s ready approval. The judges not only voted upon the names of the 27 shortlisted candidates, but also ‘ticked’ against the names of left-out applicants they considered deserving. There was, however, no interaction with candidates mentioned in the left-out list.Eventually, advocate Baljit Kaur Mann’s name was included from the left-out candidates’ list after a majority of the judges favoured her designation as a senior. Nine other shortlisted applicants were excluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/senior-tag-for-19-advocates-challenged-in-supreme-court-277360

As per claims raised in a complaint filed with the office of the Chancellor, they failed to submit their research in stipulated time and some even failed to complete their research work.The university has now formed a committee led by the Dean (Academics) to probe the matter and submit a report. Following the compliance report sought by the Chancellor’s office, the university has also tightened rules to grant study leave.As per rules, the university can grant the teaching faculty leave of up to two years for research work leading to a doctorate degree with salary. Such employees are required to sign a bond to serve the university for five years on return.Officials on the campus said the university could penalise the individuals and collect the paid salary if the research work was not completed. They added there were many other teachers as well who availed study leave as per the given rules but did not comply with them.Vice Chancellor Prof Arvind said: “A committee led by the Dean (Academics) is preparing a report on the matter. It is an old case. Some teachers were not able to complete the research work in time. It is a serious matter if an individual fails to complete the research work at all, but the delay in completion is also being looked into. We will look into other cases as well.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/14-teachers-of-punjabi-university-under-lens-for-violating-study-leave-rules-277361

Sources said around 10 persons had been rounded up from the Mohali call centre and computers and other electronic equipment had been seized.They said Lakhan Abrol, the main suspect, had spread the roots of the fake call centre business across the country. So, there was a possibility that apart from these two centres, Abrol’s aides were running such centres in other parts of the country too.Sources said the police had also identified the kingpin facilitating hawala transactions in the UK, the US and India. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fake-call-centre-busted-in-mohali-10-detained-277362

However, residents are still living in fear as the health facilities have not been upgraded to prevent the third wave.“During the second wave, we heard tall claims of improvement of health facilities in district. However, as no more deaths are being reported, the government authorities have forgotten to ramp up the facilities to prevent more fatalities in case of a third wave,” said Ravinder Singh, a local.As per the latest report of the Health Department, as many as 859 persons have lost their lives to Covid in the district to date while there are 87 active cases. One more Covid patient died in Dhuri on Thursday night. Of the total deaths, 411 persons died in May alone.“Lack of much-needed health facilities is responsible for such a high number of Covid deaths in Sangrur,” said Satwinder Singh, another local.Before the elevation of Malerkotla as a district, Sangrur had two level-2 facilities at the Civil Hospital and the Dhuri hospital had dedicated facilities for pregnant women. But patients of many areas, including Khanauri,Moonak, Lehra, Kauhrian and Dirba, have to cover a long distance even for a level-2 facility.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-infra-push-to-thwart-3rd-covid-wave-sangrur-locals-277364

Chandigarh pays Rs 3.44 per unit. Punjab is paying Rs 5-8 per unit to the three private thermal plants because of its over-dependence on these plants, power purchase agreements (PPAs) with whom were signed by the SAD-BJP government. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid Rs 5,400 crore due to ‘faulty’ clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay Rs 65,000 crore as fixed charges,” Sidhu claimed.He said Punjab could buypower from the national grid at much cheaper rates.His pending Bill in Asr is Rs 8.74 lakhNavjot Sidhu’s pending bill for his Amritsar house is Rs 8.74 lakh. PSPCL Superintending Engineer GS Khaira said: “The bill has been pending for over eight months. Sidhu owed us Rs 17,62,742. He paid about Rs 10 lakh in March. He had some objections over the surcharge. The case is being reviewed.” Despite several attempts, Sidhu could not be contacted.

03-07-2021||Amritsar||Navjot Singh Sidhu has defaulted on power dues, alleges PSPCL||At a time when Congress MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was targeting his own government and the erstwhile Akali Dal over the ongoing power crisis in Punjab, he, himself, had forgotten to clear the power dues of his own house in Amritsar.Sidhu has on his name, an outstanding power bill of Rs 8.74 lakh pending for his house in Holy City locality for the past several months.Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) Superintending Engineer GS Khaira said, “It was the bill of over eight months which was to be paid. Sidhu owed us (PSPCL) Rs 17,62,742. But he had paid an amount close to Rs 10 lakh in March, when we conducted recovery drive. Later, he had some objections over the surcharge amount and kept it pending. His case is being reviewed,” he said.The Tribune has procured the electricity bill copy which testified to it. Ironically, the last date to pay the pending bill was today only, i.e,. July 2, 2021, but it was not paid.  The original bill amount was Rs 8,67,540 and after adding surcharge post due date, it stood at Rs 8,68,499.It is ironic that the common consumers with outstanding bill amount would face disconnection, but Sidhu enjoyed immunity as the PSPCL was unable to take action.Today, in a long Twitter thread, Sidhu suggested the Punjab government to bring a new legislation “to cap power purchase costs to prices available on the National Power Exchange at any given time...thus, saving people of Punjab’s money”, …..stop depending on private thermal plants and buy power from the national grid to reduce the cost of electricity in the state.Incidentally, when Sidhu was stripped of Local Bodies portfolio, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had offered him the charge of Power Ministry, which the former had refused and quit the Cabinet in 2019.Despite repeated attempts, Sidhu could not be reached as his phone was switched off and none of his staffer was available for comment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-has-defaulted-on-power-dues-alleges-pspcl-277247

This means that Jood will remain in prison till August 12, the next date of hearing.The issue has created ripples in Jood’s home state of Haryana where a social media campaign for his release has claimed that he was only trying to protect the Indian flag from being dishonoured by ‘Khalistanis’.At the time of his arrest, Jood was alleged to be living in Australia under an expired visa.Jood has been charged with three counts of affray, three counts of armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, two counts of destroying or damaging property, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of other(s).These offences carry separate jail terms ranging between two and ten years.Indian diplomats had met Jood in prison on June 17 but it is not known what transpired between them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/haryana-youngster-accused-of-assault-on-sikhs-in-australia-denied-bail-277244

By amending the law, these agreements will become null and void, he said.Truth of Power Costs, Cuts, Power Purchase Agreements & How to give Free & 24 hour Power to the People of Punjab:- 1.

If we Act in the right direction“Punjab is buying power at an average cost of Rs 4.54 per unit even as the national average is Rs 3.85 per unit & Chandigarh is paying Rs. 3.44 per unit. Punjab’s over-dependence on three private thermal plants at Rs 5-8 per unit makes Punjab pay more than other states. The power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the three plants were signed by the previous SAD-BJP government. Till 2020, Punjab has already paid Rs 5,400 crore due to faulty clauses in these agreements and is expected to pay Rs 65,000 crore just as fixed charges,” Sidhu claimed.He further said Punjab can purchase power from national grid at much cheaper rates.  "Punjab’s revenue per unit of consumption is one of the lowest in India due to gross mismanagement of the complete power purchase and supply system. PSPCL pays Rs 0.18 per unit extra on every unit supplied, even after receiving over Rs 9,000 crore in subsidy from the state," said Sidhu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/instead-of-cutting-power-to-industry-or-curtailing-office-timings-renegotiate-deal-with-private-thermal-plants-navjot-sidhu-tells-punjab-cm-277201
