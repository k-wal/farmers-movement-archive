Earlier, they had abstained from work on June 25 and 28. Health services, including outpatient department (OPD) services, elective surgeries and online consultations remained suspended, said protesting doctors.However, emergency and Covid-related services continued, they said. The call for the strike was given by the Joint Punjab Government Doctors’ Coordination Committee.The committee has members from the Punjab Civil Medical Services’ Association and is supported by the Punjab State Veterinary Officers’ Association, Rural Medical Officers’ Association, Punjab Dental Medical Officers’ Association and the Punjab Ayurveda Officers’ Association. Punjab Civil Medical Services’ Association president Dr Gagandeep Singh said they were upset with the Sixth Pay Commission, which recommended delinking non-practicing allowance (NPA) from the basic pay, which would adversely hit their salary and pension benefits.Protesting doctors said the commission had recommended reduction in the NPA from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.The Punjab government had announced to implement a majority of the recommendations of its Pay Commission with effect from January 1, 2016, a move that will benefit over five lakh serving and retired employees. However, several associations of government employees have been protesting against the recommendations.They were objecting to the formula used in the calculation of an increase in pay. The Punjab government had set up an oversight committee of ministers to resolve grievances of the state government employees.

01-07-2021||London||UK opens new post-study work visa route for international students||The UK Home Office on Thursday formally opened its new post-study work visa for international students, which would offer overseas graduates from India and other destinations the option to apply for the right to stay on for job experience at the end of their university courses.The Graduate route visa, announced last year by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, is now open for applications from this week and is expected to particularly benefit Indian students, who are known to choose their degree courses based on the prospect of work experience.The Graduate route is designed for international graduates who have been awarded their degree from a recognised UK university to stay on and look for work for at least two years.“To put it into some context, last year more than 56,000 Indian nationals were granted a student visa, that’s a 13 per cent increase on the previous year, and that is almost now a quarter of all student visas issued by the UK,” Patel told PTI.“When you think about those numbers, think about the totality in terms of how this route will benefit India, it’s a very, very big move. And, we will continue to work with the various academic institutions on making this route viable,” she said.For the new route, international graduates must have completed an eligible course at a UK higher education provider with a track record of compliance with the government’s immigration requirements.It is unsponsored, meaning applicants do not need a job offer to apply and crucially they can use a two-year period to stay on and look for a job. There are no minimum salary requirements or caps on numbers, allowing graduates on the route to work flexibly, switch jobs and develop their career as required.“As we build back better, it is vital that the UK continues to be a beacon for talented young people across the globe who want to make a difference. The new Graduate route does just that, giving the best and brightest graduates the opportunity to continue contributing to the UK’s prosperity and the freedom to kickstart their careers in the UK,” said Patel.A coronavirus concession on the date by which students must enter the UK to qualify for the route, if they started courses in 2020 and are unable to travel due to the pandemic, was recently extended.Applicants who began their studies in autumn 2020 or in spring 2021 will need to be in the UK on a student visa by September 27 this year. Students beginning their course later this year or early next year will need to be in the UK by April 6, 2022.This has been welcomed by Indian student groups in the UK, concerned about India’s categorisation under the red list of countries from where travel currently remains banned, making it compulsory for Indian students to quarantine at considerably additional expense.“Many other countries do not offer that microcosm, foundation of diaspora community, natural heritage, all the cultural links, all the values that we share between our two countries. That puts us in a very strong position, both for Indian students coming here and securing their future opportunities in the workplace,” Patel said.The new route, part of the post-Brexit points-based immigration system, is pegged as part of the UK’s Global Britain message of attracting the best talent from around the world and covers all parts of the United Kingdom.“International students are a vital part of our society, and those who graduate from our world-leading universities should have the opportunity to stay and build meaningful careers here in the UK,” said Universities Minister Michelle Donelan.“That is why we are introducing this new route for international graduates, enabling British businesses to attract and retain some of the brightest, most talented graduates across the globe, and helping this nation build back better from the pandemic,” she said.Anne Marie Graham, Chief Executive of UK Council for International Student Affairs, said: “We know that employability is a priority for international students coming to study in the UK.“International students who are able to access this route will have the flexibility to apply for work in any sector or role that fits their skills profile, including self-employment without the need for employer sponsorship.”               To apply under the new Graduate route, international students must have completed an eligible course at a recognised UK higher education provider at undergraduate or higher level. Students on the route will be able to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years for Doctoral PhD students.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU) was among the groups that actively lobbied the UK government for such a post-study visa route.“Genuine Indian applicants with demonstrable skills should considerably benefit,” it added.

He had a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head and was absconding for over five months.Delhi Police told Metropolitan Magistrate Shivli Talwar that the accused would be taken to Tarn Taran, about 500 km from Delhi, for investigation during the remand period.The police said it would also ascertain the source of funding of the alleged conspiracy, money flow to his bank accounts, probe social media accounts, recover mobile, and seize clothes he was wearing at the time of the incident.Besides, it said it would confront him with video clips and CCTV footage in order to identify co-accused who accompanied him from Singhu Border to the Red Fort to create mayhem and ransack the monument.“Considering the ground and fact that the accused has to be taken to Tarn Taran for investigation, the accused be remanded to PC for five days,” the judge said in an order passed on June 30.Investigating officer Inspector Pankaj Arora informed the court that Singh was part of the riotous mob which “attacked the police personnel, ransacked, sabotaged and robbed the government and public property and also the Red Fort”.He stated that in one of the videos, the accused was seen with co-accused - Gurjot Singh and Gurjant Singh - in which the duo was giving interview to the media after they hoisted a religious flag at the Flag Guard area.“During further investigation, it has also come on record that he, along with his other associate, was in touch with co-accused Iqbal Singh who is stated to be one of the main conspirators and instigators,” Inspector Arora submitted.Advocates Jasdeep S Dhillon and Gurumukh Singh, representing the accused, said that their client is being falsely implicated in the case and that there are no specific allegations against him.It was further submitted that the mere presence of Singh in the interview given to a media channel by the co-accused “does not reflect his complicity in the offence”.On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.An FIR was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, Epidemic Act, and Disaster Management Act.Actor-activist Deep Sidhu is accused of being the key conspirator of the violence and is currently out on bail.The court had recently taken cognizance of the charge sheet in the case and summoned all the accused on July 12.

While farmers in several parts of Malwa have been holding protests against the non-availability of power to irrigate fields, cities like Patiala, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Bathinda, Mohali and Jalandhar faced several unscheduled cuts today.The maximum power demand in the state has touched 14,225 MW this year, which is 1,425 MW short of the 12,800 MW that the PSPCL has been able to provide. The average shortfall during evening peak hours is 725 MW.While Punjab has its own generation of about 5,500 MW from various sources, including solar, it can import a maximum of 7,300 MW from the northern grid. “Under the present circumstances, Punjab can supply around 12,800 MW. The supply touched 13,000 MW for a short period on Tuesday,” said All-India Power Engineers Federation spokesperson VK Gupta.He claimed the excess amount (about Rs 6,000 crore) paid to the private thermal plants in lieu of power that wasn’t even consumed could have been diverted to improve the grid load capability, resulting which Punjab could have easily procured more power to meet its demand.PSPCL Chairman-cum-Managing Director A Venu Prasad said the demand had shot up due to the paddy transplantation season and the peak summer. “We have requested the Bhakra Beas Management Board to increase generation so that uninterrupted power can be supplied to all consumers,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-reels-under-long-unscheduled-power-cuts-276404

They are trying to get all quality refractions measured through machines instead of human analysis. The AI-based software is able to identify the refractions but has not reached acceptable levels of accuracy so far. Based on experience, they are working on improvements in the equipment for further testing during coming paddy procurement season,” they said.The current quality-testing is a time-consuming process and also has certain levels of subjectivity. “The FCI is working with start-ups for developing a simple and handy testing equipment which can be deployed in mandis operated by government agencies for foodgrain procurement,” they said.Pilot projectA pilot project was initiated during the wheat procurement season in some ‘mandis’ with an aim to ensure quality assessment of grains in a transparent manner without any scope for subjectivity or human intervention||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ai-based-grain-quality-check-in-punjab-haryana-mandis-276554

It can hit anywhere, including himself. He always remained a controversial figure.Within minutes of Sukhbir’s remarks, the cricketer-turned-politician hit back and tweeted, “Guided and aimed at you to destroy your corrupt businesses... Until your Sukh Vilas built on Punjab’s ruins is not turned into a Public School & Public Hospital to serve Punjab’s poor, I won’t relent !!”Sukhbir was in Amritsar today and after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple along with his wife Harsimrat Kaur Badal, he said Sidhu, like a misguided missile, could explode in any direction. “I fear that it could hit him too,” he said sarcastically while adding “right from a cricketer to a politician, he remained a controversial figure”.Navjot Singh Sidhu, Congress MLA Aimed at youGuided and aimed at you to destroy your corrupt businesses.

Among other things, the counsel for petitioners had contended that 40-point weightage was given to teachers on the basis of their performance. But less points were awarded to primary teachers teaching classes I to IV, compared to those teaching class V and onwards. As such, a clause in the policy on the issue was discriminatory in nature.HC BenchA perusal of the objective of the impugned (transfer) policy will show that it has been devised for distribution of human resources in an optimal manner to protect academic interest of the students and maximise job satisfaction. The Bench asserted a perusal of the objective of the impugned policy dated June 25, 2019, would show that it had been devised for distribution of human resources in an optimal manner to protect academic interest of the students and maximise job satisfaction amongst employee in a fair and transparent manner.For achieving the objective and to obviate any undue influence, marks, along with weightage to be given to the teachers, were set out by the education department. A teacher securing highest marks was rewarded with the option to choose the school or block of his liking.As far as grant of weightage was concerned, it was apparent that the respondent-department had a clear focus on uplifting the standard of education for the students in higher classes — Class V onwards as compared to the students studying in primary ones up to Class IV. This decision of awarding higher marks to the teachers from Class V onwards was based on reasonable classification and did not suffer from arbitrariness, irrationality or discrimination. “There is always a line that is drawn by the department at the time of implementation of any policy, which usually becomes a bone of contention. The department, maintaining the entire data viz. number of students studying, teachers available, and percentage of result secured etc., is in a better position to take a call. We, while exercising powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, cannot substitute our view on such decision,” the Bench asserted.Referring to the argument that posts shown as vacant were actually occupied, the Bench added it was for the department to verify the ground position and take a call. Dismissing the petition, the Bench added occasion did not arise for an employee to work on an unsanctioned post at a particular place in the absence of vacant posts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-bias-in-shifting-teachers-after-marks-calculation-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-276450
