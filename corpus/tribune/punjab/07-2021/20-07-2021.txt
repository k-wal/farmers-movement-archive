20-07-2021||Amritsar||Navjot Singh Sidhu receives warm welcome in Amritsar; several senior leaders conspicuous by their absence||The newly-appointed president of Punjab Congress, Navjot Singh Sidhu, was given an overwhelming welcome by the Amritsar unit of the party at the Golden Gate—the entrance of the holy city.However, a set of prominent Congress leaders, aligned to CM Capt. Amarinder Singh kept away from the reception.Sidhu’s supporters, the majority from the East constituency he represented as a lawmaker, eagerly awaited his arrival at 1 pm despite the inclement weather conditions till he finally arrived at around 3 pm.Also read: New PPCC chief Navjot Sidhu calls for ‘haq-sach di ladai’ at Khatkar KalanThe crowd surrounded his vehicle, raising slogans and danced on the dhol beats and burst firecrackers to celebrate his elevation. The scenes were reminiscent of 2004 when he arrived in the city from Lahore to kick start his maiden political innings for Parliament elections on a BJP ticket.Normal life was paralysed in the city for a while with a long traffic jam on the national highway as people stopped their vehicles to catch a glimpse of Sidhu. The BRTS route too remained disrupted for a few hours.Attired in a purple colour Pathani suit and supporting matching turban and scarf, Sidhu came out from the sunroof of his vehicle and waved at the crowd throughout his roadshow despite the fact that he injured his right foot thumbnail during a gathering at Khatkar Kalan. He got medical aid at Amandeep Hospital on the way only to continue his journey. He shook hands with supporters, accepting siropas, bouquets and garlands. Congress urban president Jatinder Sonia jumped over his car’s bonnet to greet him.Ironically, no local MLA was present at the Golden Gate to receive Sidhu. MLA South Inderbir Singh Bolaria and MLA Amritsar West Raj Kumar Verka joined Sidhu from Chandigarh to Amritsar. MLA North Sunil Dutti met Sidhu at his residence. too joined Sidhu’s journey but left midway.Before reaching Amritsar, Sidhu was welcomed by Jandiala Guru MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala, who is among the four working presidents of the PPCC. Fatehgarh MLA Kuljeet Nagra and Congress Youth president Birinder Singh Dhillon also accompanied Sidhu till Jandiala from where they returned.Others who participated in the occasion included and MLA Nawanshehr Angad Singh, MLA Khem Karan Sukhpal Singh Bhullar and Sukhjinder Raj Singh (Lalli Majithia).However, Amritsar Improvement Trust chairperson Dinesh Bassi and Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu missed the appointment for the day, yet senior deputy mayor Raman Bakshi had registered his presence for the occasion.Bassi and Rintu too were considered to be Capt. Amarinder’s loyalists. Ironically, their appointments were made without taking Sidhu, then holding Local Bodies charge, into confidence. Amidst a tiff between Capt and Sidhu, Rintu had also installed hoardings showing open solidarity in favour of Capt. Amarinder. Both could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Another prominent leader and Cabinet minister OP Soni were also conspicuous by his absence. Insiders said that friction between Sidhu and Soni still prevailed though they had reached a compromise after changed political equations.Congress rural president Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachchar said that the Majha leaders would join Sidhu while together they would pay obeisance at the Golden Temple, Durgiana Mandir and Ram Tirath Asthan tomorrow.Nonetheless, Sidhu’s cavalcade culminated at his home located in the posh Holy City locality of Amritsar. Sidhu along with his wife Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu had shifted to their Patiala residence for the past several months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/navjot-singh-sidhu-receives-warm-welcome-in-amritsar-several-senior-leaders-conspicuous-by-their-absence-285909

The court said the offences, allegedly committed by the accused, are punishable for imprisonment for a maximum term of five years, so given the existing situation due to the pandemic, the trial in the case was not going to conclude anytime soon. So they are released on bail, ordered the court.The accused claimed that they were falsely implicated in the case and they were not named initially in the FIR."We were nominated as accused in the case by the SIT simply on the basis of alleged disclosure statement made by one Mahinderpal @ Bittu (since deceased) in the custody of the police. No evidence against the accused were found in the last three years", they claimed.SIT file charge sheet in sacrilege caseA day after Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissed a petition by an accused in a sacrilege-related case, in which he had opposed sending his handwriting samples for comparison with those on some derogatory posters pasted outside a gurdwara in Bargari in September 2015, the SIT filed its charge-sheet in this case in the court of JMIC here.The charge sheet pertains to September 2015 when some posters containing derogatory remarks were found posted outside a gurdwara at Bargari. It is alleged that these posters were prepared and pasted by Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola, Baljit Singh, Nishan Singh and Pardeep Singh.Last week, the SIT had filed another charge sheet in connection with another sacrilege case against these accused. In that case, torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were found near a gurdwara in the Bargari village of Faridkot. These pages were allegedly part of the ‘bir’ which was stolen from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village on June 1, 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sit-files-another-charge-sheet-in-sacrilege-cases-court-grants-bail-to-3-accused-285899

20-07-2021||New Delhi||Govt always open to talks with farmers' unions to resolve issues over three new laws: Agriculture Minister Tomar||The government on Tuesday said it will remain open to discussions with protesting farmers' unions to resolve issues over three new agriculture laws passed by Parliament in September last year.In written replies to Lok Sabha on several questions related to farmers' protest, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government had so far held 11 rounds of negotiations talks with agitating farmers' unions to resolve the issues."The government has been engaged in serious, sensitive and active discussions with the farmers' unions to resolve the issues. During various rounds of discussions, government continuously requested the farmers' unions to discuss the provisions of the farm laws, so that if there is an objection to any provision, the advancement can be made towards a resolution of those," the minister said.But the farmers' unions insisted only on the repeal of the farm laws, he added."Government is always open to discussion with farmers' unions and will remain open to discussion with agitating farmers to resolve the issue," Tomar said.In all the rounds of discussions with the farmers' unions, the minister said the government had stressed that instead of insisting on the demand for the repeal of the laws, the unions should discuss their concerns on the clauses of farm Acts so that their concerns can be resolved.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than seven months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP (Minimum Support Price).Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions.During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders.The farmers' unions have been agitating against the three laws -- 'The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020', 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020' and 'The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The demands of agitating farmers' unions are repealing the three farm laws, keeping farmers outside the penalty provision on straw burning under Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020, withdrawing the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and issues-related to procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP)."Giving top priority to the interest of farmers, government vide letter dated 9th December 2020 addressed to farmers' unions, explained point by point, how the concerns expressed by the farmers were being taken care of in the proposal of the Government of India."Government also proposed to constitute a small group consisting of representative of farmers' unions, who can deliberate on farm laws clause-wise in a time-bound manner and can also consider other issues related to farmers, which representatives of farmers' unions have not agreed. However, farmers' unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws except for demanding their repeal," Tomar said.The minister said these laws are intended to provide an ecosystem where the farmers can enjoy the freedom of choice relating to the sale of farmers' produce which facilitates remunerative prices to farmers through competitive alternative channels for selling their produce."These farm Acts will facilitate direct buying from farmers in trade area by traders, processors, exporters, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agriculture co-operative societies etc., so as to facilitate farmers with better price realisation due to reduction in supply chain and marketing cost to enhance their income," he added.

While the 1st dose has been administered to 75 lakh people, 15 lakh had got the second dose too.The Centre needs to arrange for immediate delivery to the state to meet the shortfall and enable inoculation of all those needing the second dose, while continuing with the vaccination of other eligible persons, said the Chief Minister.Pointing out that the doses being supplied to private hospitals were getting wasted as people preferred to go to government hospitals for free inoculation, Health Secretary Hussan Lal informed the meeting that the state has sought diversion of the stocks from the private hospitals but had not received any response so far from the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-asks-centre-for-40-lakh-vaccine-doses-to-inoculate-states-eligible-population-285862

The Chief Minister also ordered establishment of a paediatric unit in each district and one Centre of Excellence in Paediatrics for the State.The government, he further announced, will also establish LMO storage tanks in every district to ensure 24X7 availability of medical grade oxygen. Medical gas pipeline systems will also be set up at each District, Sub-division and CHC level, he disclosed, also announcing the establishment of 17 additional RTPCR labs that shall be established. ICU beds in Government Hospitals shall also be increased to 142, and a hub & scope model for telemedicine and teleconsultation shall also be established, said Captain Amarinder.The Chief Minister said the outcomes of the 3rd Sentinel sero-surveillance survey will be utilised to determine further localised restrictions as the state prepares for the third wave. GIS based surveillance and prevention tools will be used with an auto trigger mechanism for localised restrictions, he disclosed.Dr KK Talwar disclosed, in response to a query from the Chief Minister, that in the first and second wave, 10% of those infected were under 18, and while there was no concrete data to support such a projection, the state was preparing to handle more cases of children in the third wave.Health Secretary Hussan Lal apprised the Chief Minister that the process of modifications in COVA had started for capturing of required parameters, linked to sample collection and reporting system outside ICMR system. The same was likely to be functional in a week.The Chief Minister asked the Health Department to expedite recruitments for all posts for which Cabinet approval has already been taken. He noted that an advertisement for 481 Specialists had already been issued by the Health Department for walk-in interviews on 31st July. The Medical Education and Research Department has also begun the process of filling up its vacancies in the coming month, he added.Captain Amarinder expressed satisfaction over the strategy for preparation of the third wave, pointing out that testing has been maintained at around 40,000- 45,000 a day, with special focus on high density areas and vulnerable population. Contact tracing has also been maintained at 18 per positive patient.He said he was happy to note that data cells have been activated in each District. The newly recruited Community Medicine Specialists posted in each district must be immediately given charge of these Data Cells, he ordered.The Chief Minister directed that the Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Lab at GMCH Patiala, coming up with the support of PATH, should become functional this month. The equipment was likely to be received by 25th July and operations were expected to commence by the end of the month, he was informed. The meeting was further informed that the concerned Staff from VRDL Patiala has gone to NEERI, Nasik for hands-on training for 3 days for WGS testing.Health Minister Balbir Sidhu and Medical Education & Research Minister OP Soni briefed the Chief Minister on the situation in hospitals etc.Dr KK Talwar informed the meeting that Punjab was currently in a comfortable situation, though the fear of a third wave continued, with ICMR predicting it by end of August or start of September. The situation may not be as bad as in the second wave unless a new variant comes before that, he noted. He, however, stressed the need for extreme caution with crowds building up even as cases were on the rise in some states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-amarinder-announces-another-rs-331-crore-to-prepare-for-3rd-covid-wave-285860
20-07-2021||Ropar||IIT Ropar develops nation’s first of its kind oxygen rationing device||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Ropar) scientists have claimed to develop the country’s first of its kind oxygen rationing device "AMLEX” which will increase the life of an oxygen cylinder by three times.IIT Ropar’s assistant professor Dr Ashish Sahani—who led the team that developed the device comprising PhD students of Biomedical Engineering Department Mohit Kumar, Ravinder Kumar and Amanpreet Chander—said that the new device would not only help in coming over situations similar to the second wave of Covid-19 when patients had a tough time in hospitals due to shortage of oxygen, it would also save a lot of money for patients as well as hospitals.The demand for liquid medical oxygen increased four times to 2,800 TPD. Further, with the second wave, the demand gone up more than seven times—5,000 tonnes per day against the pre-Covid 19 level of 700 TPD, he added.Story Highlights• Will increase the life of the oxygen cylinder by three times.• It utilizes a sensor that senses and successfully detects inhalation and exhalation of the user in any environmental condition.• The inhalation and exhalation process are sensed using a sensor via the contactless method.• Works with any commercially available oxygen therapy masks with multiple openings for airflow.• The device can operate on both portable power supply (battery) as well as line supply (220V-50Hz).So far, during exhalation, the oxygen in the oxygen cylinder/pipe is pushed out along with the exhaled CO2 by the user.This leads to the wastage of a large volume of oxygen in the long run.In addition to this, a large volume of oxygen escapes from the openings of the mask to the environment in the resting period (Between inhalation and exhalation) due to the continuous flow of oxygen in the mask, he added."AMLEX", on the other hand, was a system developed specifically for oxygen cylinders synchronising the flow of oxygen with inhalation and exhalation of the patient, thus conserving a large amount of oxygen in the reservoir for a long-lasting operation.As “AMLEX” supplies a required volume of oxygen to the patient during inhalation and trips when the patient exhales CO2, it saves the flow of oxygen at that time, said Dr Sahani.The innovators of "AMLEX" claimed that the patient’s experience was relaxing and non-suffocating, as the device was fully able to work with commercially available oxygen masks with multiple openings to the environment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/iit-ropar-develops-nations-first-of-its-kind-oxygen-rationing-device-285849

20-07-2021||Amritsar||International passengers in a fix, changing Covid protocols to blame||Passengers intending to board international flights at Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport are perturbed over different Covid-19 protocols being followed by various countries around the world.The operation of regular international flights is yet to resume but passengers are availing flights under Vande Bharat Mission and Air bubble agreement.Parminder Singh in late 60s has been preparing to travel to the UK. “I have to take assistance of a travel agency to ensure that I do not miss out on any document or test during the current phase guided by Covid-19 protocols.”Numbers increasingThere is a surge in the number of international passengers at the airport after the state government lifted the night curfew and started the unlocking process. A month ago, the strength of passengers, both arrival and departure, used to remain between 30 and 40 per cent. The strength has now reached between 60 and 70 per cent.Randhir Singh Bhullar, who arrived from the US on July 15, said he had given samples a day before boarding the flight and received a report hours before the flight took off. Back in Amritsar, he said the procedure was also simple and smooth, when he had left from here in April. He blamed agents for misleading the public outside the airport for getting them an RT-PCR report without explaining about the exact procedure.Officials of airlines at the local international airport said each international destination has a different set of rules regarding Covid-19 and these change so frequently that it gives them a tough time to intimate prospective passengers.The RT-PCR test should be conducted within 72 hours prior to undertaking the journey to the UK and the US and for those travelling to Doha, the test should be conducted 48 hours before boarding the flight. Similarly, the quarantine period of each country differs after one alights there.Ashwani Kumar Gupta, a travel agent, said travel expenses of passengers had increased manifold, as they have to quarantine in hotels. In case of UK, the quarantine period is of 10 days. He said a majority of passengers from the region heading abroad are students. On the way to Canada, they stop at Belgrade for a three-day quarantine. However, Canadian government recently increased the quarantine period to seven days.Travel agents are expecting a good season ahead as Air Canada will resume Delhi to Toronto flight from August 1 and Delhi-Vancouver from August 15. A majority of the international passengers from the local airport fly via Delhi, so with these flights they would have choices to make.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/international-passengers-in-a-fix-changing-covid-protocols-to-blame-285745

After reciting the holy hukamnama, Giani Jagtar Singh shared the history of Miri Piri Diwas and encouraged the sangat to follow the path shown by the Guru.Giani Harpreet Singh apprised the gathering about the doctrine of Miri Piri (Sikh doctrine of close relationship between temporal power and spirituality) which is a combination of spirituality and temporal power in the Sikh community, having great importance in the Sikh religious history.“The path through Miri Piri shown by the sixth Guru connects the community with spirituality as well as to protect the oppressed. The voice of Miri Piri from Akal Takht resisted the tyranny of the oppressive government. Akal Takht has always been challenged by the rulers/governments,” he said.The jathedar appealed to the Sikh community to adhere to this honourable doctrine of the Guru and adopt Bani and Baana (Gurbani and traditional Sikh attire) and to uphold Gurmat (teachings of Sikh gurus) traditions and customs.During the function, the historical Miri and Piri kirpans (swords) adorned by Guru Hargobind Sahib at Akal Takht were also shown to the sangat.Prominent personalities were honoured with siropas (robe of honours).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/miri-piri-diwas-of-patshahi-chhevin-celebrated-in-amritsar-285763

20-07-2021||---||PCC appointments: Eye on polls, Congress infuses young blood||Chandigarh, July 19By infusing young blood into the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, party leader Rahul Gandhi has sent out a clear message that the party will go into the 2022 Assembly elections with a mix of experience and freshness. The other appointments in the state party units will be around the same thinking.Working presidents — The chosen fourKuljit Singh NagraAge: 55Education: PostgraduateCommunity: Jat SikhRegion: Fatehgarh Sahib (Malwa)Considered close to Rahul Gandhi, Nagra is known for staying in touch with people of his constituency. He joined the party after years of heading the Panjab University Students Union. Expressing anguish over the passage of farm Bills in Lok Sabha, Nagra in September last year quit as legislator. Nagra had tweeted: “Deeply saddened by the passage of farm Bills by the BJP-Akali govt. I hereby tender my resignation as the MLA of Fatehgarh Sahib in support of the farmers’ cause.”Sukhwinder Singh dannyAge: 43Education: MBACommunity: SCRegion: Jandiala Guru (Majha)Popularly known as ‘Danny’, he grabbed Rahul Gandhi’s attention with his ability to convince people through simple facts during an address at a Youth Congress event in 2008. He served as vice-president of the Youth Congress from 2005 to 2014. His proximity to Rahul got him the ticket in the 2009 LS poll, which he contested unsuccessfully. He managed election of his father, former Cabinet minister Sardool Singh Bandala, who represented Jandiala Guru seat twice. He is known for easy accessibility to his people.Pawan GoelAge: 59Education: LLBCommunity: Hindu (Baniya)Region: Jaito, Faridkot (Malwa)Son of former Punjab Food and Supplies Minister Bhagwan Dass, Goel is known for his soft-spoken and calm demeanour. He was earlier president of the district Congress and is currently the Chairman, District Planning Board. He has four siblings — two brothers and two sisters. After the assassination of his father by militants in 1987, Goel had taken the reins of his father’s political lineage. The leader enjoys a clean reputation.Sangat Singh GilzianAge: 67Education: Class VIIICommunity: Lubana (BC)Region: Urmar (Doaba)Having got elected to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha for three consecutive terms, Gilzian had remained upset till the recent past for being ignored by the party. He had served as the Director, Punjab Land Use and Waste Board, and remained a member of the Vidhan Sabha committee working for the betterment of the downtrodden. He started his career as the sarpanch of his native Gilzian village. He is an agriculturist and a commission agent by profession.With four new working presidents — at least two (Kuljit Nagra and Sukhwinder Danny) from Rahul’s young brigade — party’s keenness on slowly tweaking the hold of the old guard is evident.Party leaders privy to the discussions ahead of the recast of the state unit suggest the experiment of infusing young blood or first-timers will be replicated in the Assembly elections. The recently held Assembly elections in West Bengal saw first-timers yielding positive results for Mamata Banerjee’s TMC.At the same time, caste and regional balance has been maintained in appointing the four presidents.Minister Charanjit Singh Channi said the party high command was adopting the model of social engineering while adding freshness to the political arena in the state politics.With political strategist Prashant Kishor in tow, especially amid the upheaval in the Punjab Congress, the next Assembly election could see at least 25 per cent new faces. This may sound the end of political journey for many veterans in the state party unit.Sources said given the anti-incumbency against the government and surveys indicating a dip in the popularity chart of the Chief Minister, the political strategist is learnt to have categorically told the party high command there was an urgent need to infuse freshness in the government as well as the state party unit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pcc-appointments-eye-on-polls-congress-infuses-young-blood-285604

He also congratulated the newly appointed four working presidents.Congress leaders and workers also distributed sweets at his office here to celebrate Sidhu’s elevation. Hoardings of Congress leaders congratulating Sidhu have already come up in the city.During the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign, it was in Bathinda that Sidhu first took pot-shots at Captain Amarinder with his “75-25” jibe, bringing their rivalry to the fore. Various groups within the party, that had been feeling ignored and sidelined earlier, have heaved a sigh of relief with the announcement of the new president and now hope they would be adjusted in the impending revamp of the PCC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fm-manpreet-badal-greets-navjot-sidhu-his-deputies-285607

It may boomerang on the Congress. - Dr Ram Lal Jassi, Dalit Congress LeaderCapt must apologiseOn Capt Amarinder Singh seeking an apology from Navjot Singh Sidhu over his tweets, Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh on Monday said the CM should instead apologise to the people. “It will be better if things are worked out cordially. There is a need to work for the state,” he said.The leaders are feeling let down by the party as they were expecting the president’s post from the community. The community leaders were expecting Jalandhar MP Chaudhary Santokh Singh’s appointment as working president.Members of the community are peeved especially at a time when almost all parties have been luring the Dalits by assuring plum posts to leaders from the community.While the BJP has announced the CM’s post from the community, the SAD has promised a Deputy CM from among them. The Akali Dal has also forged an alliance with the BSP so as to attract the Dalit vote bank in the forthcoming Assembly elections. But Doaba’s Dalits feel the Congress has neither made any such commitment to the community nor has it adjusted them at any top position.Dr Ram Lal Jassi, a veteran Dalit leader of the party, says: “Though the party has adjusted Sukhwinder Singh Danny, an SC leader, he represents the Mazhabi community of Malwa. Sangat Singh Gilzian hails from the Lubana BC community. In this scenario, the Ravidassia community of Doaba, which represents 43 per cent of the population in this region, are feeling ignored. There is so much anguish that it can boomerang on the Congress. A revolt can’t be ruled out and the party may have to pay the price for this.”During the 2002-07 Congress tenure, Chaudhary Jagjit Singh, his brother Chaudhary Santokh Singh and MS Kaypee had represented the community as ministers from the region. Asked if he felt bad at being left out and his community getting no representation, Chaudhary Santokh Singh said: “We cannot question the decision of the high command. Whatever our AICC leaders have decided is acceptable to us.”Dalit leader and Jalandhar West MLA Sushil Rinku too said the workers were feeling deflated. “The party should focus on consolidating its Dalit vote bank at a time when all parties are eyeing them.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-in-new-team-doabas-ravidassias-feel-let-down-285609

Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat is learnt to be touch with Punjab leaders, seeking softening of stand by both sides.Sources said though the Chief Minister is yet to speak his mind on meeting Sidhu, leaders close to him want him to bury the hatchet. “But the nuances of the compromise formula have to be worked out. There is a difference of opinion on who takes the first step, Sidhu or the CM. Otherwise, the two leaders would be seen pulling apart,” said a senior leader.Sidhu’s announcement was made last night after the party leadership sensed trouble as there were efforts to scuttle a meeting of MLAs called by outgoing PCC president Sunil Jakhar on passing a resolution stating that the decision taken by the party president would be acceptable to all.Congress president Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have talked to party MPs, after a meeting held at Partap Singh Bajwa’s Delhi residence to discuss Punjab Congress issues.Amid tension, Sidhu presence on the ground got louder with him meeting nearly 60 party MLAs. Sidhu visited the house of outgoing PCC chief Sunil Jakhar, former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, Speaker Rana KP Singh, Ministers Razia Sultana, Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Punjab Youth Congress president Barinder Dhillon, besides other MLAs.On the other hand, the CM tweeted pictures of a number of party MLAs calling on him at his residence. Besides, the CM chaired a meeting of some MLAs and two ministers — Brahm Mohindra and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot — to review development works in Patiala, as the media adviser to CM denied reports of the CM inviting MPs and MLAs for lunch of July 21. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/efforts-on-to-broker-truce-between-capt-amarinder-singh-navjot-singh-sidhu-285610

However, SARS CoV-2 sero surveys on adults have already been conducted many times in the state.Nodal officers to facilitate the survey have already been appointed and the sample collection across districts began on Monday. The health department says around 92 samples will be collected from each district.Dr Rajesh Bhasker, state nodal officer, said the sample collection would be completed in a week. “The samples will be tested for SARS CoV-2 antibodies to check the prevalence of Covid among children. The survey will also help us prepare for the third wave, which is likely to affect children more.”He said they would strategise their preparedness for the possible third wave on the basis of the results of the sero survey.It has been learned that health officials have been told to complete the survey by July 30. However, the samples in some districts might not be collected owing to the ongoing protests of the PCMS doctors across the state over cut in their Non-Practicing Allowance in the 6th Pay Commission report.The state nodal officer said: “In some districts, the doctors’ ongoing protest may affect the sample collection process.

As the case came up for resumed hearing before the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh, senior advocate Sumeet Goel referred to the SC order dated September 16, 2020.Goel pointed out that the SC had asked the Chief Justices of all High Courts to forthwith list all pending criminal cases involving sitting/former MPs and MLAs, particularly matters where stay had been granted, before appropriate Benches comprising the Chief Justice and/or designates.The SC had added the court, taking up the matters, would first decide whether stay granted, if any, should continue, keeping in view the principles regarding the grant of stay enshrined in its judgment in the case of “Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency Private Limited vs CBI”.If stay was considered necessary, the court was required to hear the matter on a day-to-day basis and dispose it of preferably within two months, without any unnecessary adjournment. “It goes without saying that the Covid-19 condition should not be an impediment to the compliance of this direction, as these matters could be conveniently heard through videoconferencing,” the court had added.The Bench also took note of amicus curiae Rupinder S Khosla’s reference to the SC order, stating that stay order would stand vacated on expiry of six months where matters remained pending for longer period, unless extension was granted by a speaking order. As such, the trial courts would proceed with the trial, notwithstanding any stay granted by the HC unless fresh order was passed extending the stay by recording reasons. The Bench asked the Registrar (General) to examine its earlier orders and report “whether all concerned are abiding by the directions given by SC in letter and spirit”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-check-if-sc-order-in-mps-cases-followed-285627

We have been protesting for the past two months, but to no avail. Today, to express our resentment, we burnt an effigy of the Finance Minister, who had promised us adequate compensation.”“The administration has paid Rs 15 to Rs 20 lakh for the land that has a market value between Rs 80 lakh and Rs 1 crore per acre,” he rued.The protesters alleged few people with a political clout managed to get adequate compensation while majority of residents were coerced to sell their land on low rates. “A pick-and-choose approach has been used while acquiring land and putting it in different categories, so that few influential persons get adequate compensation. Most of the beneficiaries are being overlooked,” said a leader of the sangharsh committee.Chak Ruldu Singwala, Pathrala, Gehri Buttar, Jodhpur Romana, Sangat Kalan and Jassi are among 10 villages where land was acquired for the project.The protesters warned that if they were not paid adequate compensation, they would intensify their stir. They said if the administration could not ensure adequate relief, it must at least provide them government land lying vacant near AIIMS-Bathinda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/highway-widening-residents-allege-bias-in-land-relief-protest-285638

This place will be utilised solely for devotees' convenience and there should not be any hue and cry over it.- Giani Harpreet Singh, Akal Takht officiating jathedar He said the family that used to live there, claiming to be the ancestors of former priest of Golden Temple Sant Singh, got adequately compensated to vacate the land, which was developed as “galliara”. He said the place would now be utilised for devotees’ convenience.“This private property was vacated by the family after being compensated by the government. Nobody objected when its four storeys were demolished during the ‘galliara’ beautification project. Now, the issue was being politicised when its basement with a couple of rooms surfaced during excavation,” he said.He said the place located on the Akal Takht secretariat side of the complex, would be utilised for “joda ghar” and “gathri ghar” (where devotees could store belongings).“Besides, a two-wheeler parking will be created for the convenience of local devotees. This place will be utilised solely for devotees’ convenience and there should not be any hue and cry over it,” he said.The building had a unique architecture spread over 1,200 square yard with some rooms.

20-07-2021||---||Golden Temple complex excavation: Experts concerned over handling of ruins||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 19Experts have expressed concern over the handling of a heritage structure discovered during a digging operation by the SGPC on the Golden Temple complex.In a statement, Davinder Pal Singh of Panjab Digital Library and Prof Harpal Singh said the location and the nature of the excavated site suggested there was every likelihood it was part of the historic Sarkar-e-Khalsa Ranjit Singh’s ‘bunga’, which was demolished by the British to construct a grand clock tower after the Punjab was annexed in 1849.“Nearly 250 years ago, a variety of buildings were constructed in the periphery of the shrine. These buildings were called ‘bungas’. They were, of course, subsequently demolished during the widening of the ‘parkarma’ around 1944,” said the statement.The scholars said the clock tower had been standing there for more than half a century when that too was demolished after the SGPC gained management rights of the historical gurdwaras following the enactment of Gurdwara Act in 1925. Available historical evidence suggests that during the demolition of the clock tower, stairs and a passageway were found, which were used by the Maharaja to visit Sri Harmandir Sahib. The SGPC demolished these stairs despite resistance from prominent Sikhs, said the statement.“The place is a heritage site of immense significance and must not be harmed any further. Any digging around this place should stop forthwith till the extensive archaeological investigation is conducted to establish its historical identity. The Directorate of Cultural Affairs Archaeology and Archives of the Punjab Government should intervene,” the statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/golden-temple-complex-excavation-experts-concerned-over-handling-of-ruins-285632

TNSJustice Harnaresh Singh Gill’s Bench, during the course of hearing, was told the investigation of all three cases related to the matter was initially handed over to the CBI. But in August 2018, the Punjab Assembly resolved to withdraw the investigations. It was alleged in one of the FIRs that some posters containing derogatory remarks were found posted outside an Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee-managed gurdwara at Bargari village on September 24-25, 2015.Justice Gill’s Bench was also told it was not open to the police/SIT sending handwriting samples for comparison with those on the alleged posters, once the CBI got petitioner Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny’s, handwriting samples compared from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) and found it to be different.Referring to the arguments by Punjab deputy advocate-general Gaurav Garg Dhuriwala, Justice Gill added the petitioner’s counsel could not show prejudice caused to his rights by objecting to his handwriting samples and sending them for comparison.

Harsimrat’s notice was also signed by DMK, BSP, CPM and RLP leaders.Every party flagged the farmers’ stir, the deaths of protesters and the urgency to address the cause."The three black laws were pushed through the House in utter disregard of the opposition by farmers, farm labourers and farm traders. The House has not even paid obituary references to several hundreds of farmers who sacrificed their lives during this struggle. The Lok Sabha must include names of martyrs of the farmers' movement and pay them tributes," Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal said in her notice.Tewari's notice said the farm laws had been opposed on the grounds that these would make the farmers vulnerable to exploitation by the corporate sector. “The government has failed to assuage the concerns of the farmers or present any viable alternative to these Acts,” he said. Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann said farmers had been protesting on Delhi borders for over eight months. “Hundreds of ‘annadatas’ have been martyred. We must take up the matter on priority,” Mann said.

20-07-2021||A Amarender Reddy||Boost price stabilisation fund for pulses, oilseeds||INDIA’s foodgrain production is estimated to achieve a new record of 305.43 million tonnes in the crop year 2020-21 on the basis of better output of rice and wheat. The export of agricultural and allied products grew 17.34 per cent to $41.25 billion. The procurement of paddy and wheat touched an all-time high of 129.8 million tonnes.However, in spite of this rosy picture, farmers’ incomes are not increasing as expected and there is widespread distress. Although MSP is announced for 23 commodities, procurement is negligible for most crops, except paddy and wheat. Pulses’ procurement was just 9.8 lakh tonnes in 2020-21, which is neither sufficient to support prices above MSP for farmers nor adequate to distribute through the Public Distribution System (PDS) for the poorest of the poor. The procurement of oilseeds such as groundnut and sunflower is negligible. A free market alone does not lead to a higher farm income. Many a time, it will expose small and marginal farmers to high volatility in prices.Many farmers of pulses, oilseeds and millets, exposed to market vagaries, have sold their produce at 20-30% below MSP year after year. Since the past 20 years, India imports nearly 70% of domestic consumption of edible oils by spending about Rs 70,000 crore per year. The retail prices of some edible oils are hovering above Rs 200/kg, hurting consumers. Farmers of fruits and vegetables are more vulnerable to price fluctuations; some vegetable farmers did not harvest their tomatoes and onions as market prices didn’t even cover picking and transport costs, but at the same time prices in urban centres are higher, mostly captured by market intermediaries rather than farmers.In addition to the marketing and post-harvest bottlenecks, farmers’ distress is aggravated by labour shortage, increasing cost of production, low investments in land development and low productivity.‘Ad hocism’ in the trade policy, such as frequent on-off of export bans and the imposition of stock limits, restricts farmers from taking advantage of higher global prices. This results in farmers being exposed to price falls, but not able to sell in international markets when the prices are higher. This has happened time and again in the cases of onions, pulses and edible oils. These decisions are mostly categorised as ‘consumer-friendly’ rather than ‘farmer-friendly’ so as to supply essential food items to consumers at cheaper rates with consequent low income to farmers.Open-ended procurement of paddy and wheat is hurting food economy, with the government spending a huge amount of money on maintaining excessive buffer stocks of 2-3 times the stipulated norm, with the subsequent shortage of funds to procure crops like pulses and oilseeds. The government is allocating about Rs 2.5 lakh crore for paddy and wheat procurement operations of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), whereas the allocation for the price stabilisation fund (used to procure onion and pulses) is just Rs 2,700 crore in 2021-22. This imbalance needs to be corrected.Enhance crop yieldThe need of the hour is to enhance yield in pulses and oilseeds through MSP procurement, especially in aspirational districts, not only to increase the production of these crops but also to increase farmers’ incomes. Hence, there should be rationalisation of the budget allocation to balance the procurement of paddy, wheat, pulses and oilseeds.Farmers are generally risk-averse. Although Punjab is endowed with highly fertile land suitable for high-returns crops like plantation crops, fruits and vegetables with some private investment, it is trapped in medium returns from no-risk crops like paddy and wheat. Meanwhile, states such as Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have diversified their cropping pattern towards high-value plantation crops and are reaping 2-3 times returns per hectare compared to Punjab’s monocropping. This is the reason why Punjab’s farm growth has plummeted to 1.9 per cent per year since 2005-06, while that of the rest of the country is 3.5 per cent.Instead of allocating larger budgets under MSP operations of paddy and wheat, strengthening the price stabilisation fund, especially for pulses, oilseeds and onions, is needed for rapid growth of farmers’ incomes. Currently, growers of pulses, oilseeds and other commercial crops are exposed to more risks, both in terms of yield and prices, although these are high-returns crops. If the government reduces the price risk, they can expand the area and invest in fertilisers, irrigation and seeds, which will result in increased yield and incomes.In the case of pulses, market prices were higher than the MSP in most of the years up to 2006; later, pulses’ production picked up, especially in the case of chickpeas with the adoption of high-yielding varieties, supported by increased MSP. A similar experience was observed in the case of oilseeds, when the government introduced the Technology Mission on Oilseeds in 1986; coupled with price support, oilseed production steeply increased and India became self-sufficient. But with the withdrawal of price support after the 1990s due to WTO agreements, India became a major importer.MSP without procurement is not effective for any crop. In recent years, Telangana’s fine paddy varieties were sold below MSP compared to common paddy varieties as the latter is procured at MSP. Millets are procured in very few states: bajra in Haryana and ragi in Odisha. Whenever the government procures in sufficient quantities, say 20-30% of the production, consistently, it will impact technology adoption, yields and open market prices of that crop.Pulses and edible oils have been a source of food inflation over the past two decades. The anomaly can be corrected if we are able to increase domestic production by incentivising technological adoption, expanding the area under irrigation and the adoption of improved varieties. Recent inflation data released by the government indicates that pulses’ inflation is 10% and that of oils & fats is 35%. This high food inflation is in spite of surplus foodgrain stocks.Cost factorGovernment data shows that the estimated economic cost (including logistic & storage costs) of wheat was Rs 29.93/kg, while MSP was 19.25 per kg in 2021-22, which indicates that about one-third of the cost incurred is spent on handling charges and not going to farmers or consumers. This expenditure needs to be brought down by reducing excess procurement of foodgrains and diverting funds for the procurement of other high-value crops.India’s grain stocks with the FCI are rising. Offloading excess foodgrains is beyond the capacity of the government. The increase in wheat and rice production is attributed to assured procurement at MSP. The increased production of cotton is attributed to both Bt cotton technology and procurement by the Cotton Corporation of India. The success stories of maize, bajra and chickpeas are due to technological breakthroughs, although increased market prices played a role. Crops like basmati benefited from improved varieties like PB 1121, which helped in fetching higher prices in export markets.Overall, price incentives have played a key role in increasing the production of paddy and wheat, but now they are in excess supply. It’s time to support crops like pulses and oilseeds through procurement at MSP.The author is Principal Scientist (Agri Economics), ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, HyderabadSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/boost-price-stabilisation-fund-for-pulses-oilseeds-285149
20-07-2021||Dubai||Dubai's Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara continued to serve humanity even during pandemic||The imposing double-storied Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara, the first building as soon as one enters what is now known as the Religious City of Dubai, wears a forlorn look on a Wednesday morning.Apart from the gurdwara, there are seven churches in the vicinity, and a temple that is in the final stages of construction. In normal times, the place would be teeming with the faithful.But this is the 'new normal'.The strict UAE government's Covid-19 guidelines mean that people can only come in for half-hour 'paaths' in the morning and evening.The Gurunanak Darbar community kitchen, or langar, which fed almost 1,500 people on a usual day and up to 50,000 on special days, has been stopped ever since the country went into the first lockdown in April 2020.But there has been no rest for Surender Singh Kandhari, and his men at the gurudwara. His thinking is simple - if the devotees can't come to the gurdwara, the gurdwara will go to the devotees."When the first lockdown in the UAE was announced and we could not have our langar, we went to labour camps in different Emirates and distributed 150,000 kilos of raw food. There were many blue-collared workers desperate to get back, so we organised 15 chartered flights to India free of cost," says the 78-year-old Kandhari, a resident of Dubai since 1976."When vaccination started, we managed to source it and conducted a camp in February this year to inoculate 5,000 people. This was inclusive and open to all: people from all religions and social strata were vaccinated free of charge."The gurdwara became even more active when the deadly second wave hit India."We wanted to do something useful, and everyone told us that we should do something with oxygen, given the paucity back home. Using my business connections in China, we managed to procure a total of 770 concentrators and shipped them to various parts of India. We sent them to Punjab, Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand," adds Kandhari."We sent them to various gurudwaras. There were places where we did not have a connection to any gurdwara. In Bengaluru, I tied up with a church, and in Chennai, we sent 25 concentrators to Loyola College, my alma mater, and requested the Principal to give it to those who needed it." Kandhari, who now has a sprawling business empire of tyres and batteries in over 65 countries, has slowly handed over the reins to his two sons, and spends a majority of time in his capacity as chairman of the gurdwara.His wife of 53 years, Bubbles, is the vice-chairman and equally involved in social work."I always saw this place as a centre of humanity and not just as a temple for the Sikh. I was guided by the one thought of Guru Nanak Dev ji that we need to promote humanity. We can only be the best Sikh, or Hindu, or Muslim, if we are the best human being," says Kandhari, who has also been a popular member of various UAE government delegates in promoting inter-faith harmony and tolerance in conferences around the world.Every year since it was established in 2012, to 2019, the gurdwara has hosted iftar throughout the holy month of Ramadan."We put up separate partitions for men and women inside the gurdwara. We have a Maulvi and hundreds of people break their fast after he leads the prayers. We could not do it the last two Ramadans because of the pandemic and so many people wrote to me how much they missed it," adds Kandhari.In a city known for its glitzy malls and numerous things to do for tourists, Gurunanak Darbar has its own power of attracting people."We are probably the most popular gurdwara outside India. Every year, we have more than a million visitors. Off these, nearly 30 per cent are visitors to the UAE. We have had over 300 marriages, most of them coming from places like India and the UK," says Kandhari.The land for the gurdwara is given free by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.The total construction area is 120,000 square feet, spread over a 25,400 square feet plot in Jebel Ali.When completed, the total cost was 65 million dirhams (Rs 13.23 crore)."The year 2008 was probably a bad year to start the construction as the world faced a severe economic downturn. Even though people were extremely generous in their offering, it took four years to be completed," recalls Kandhari."People would ask me how I'd get it built and if we should reconsider the size. I had read a story of Mother Teresa's when she started building the Missionaries of Charities in Kolkata. It seems she had no money and would tell others: 'It's not my house. It's God's house. He will make sure it is completed'."It's remarkable how we got the funds. People were so generous across religions and nationalities. I once had a Pakistani friend who visited the construction site. When he found out that we were struggling for funds, he immediately gave me a cheque of 100,000 dirhams."We have been extremely blessed with the generosity of people. Now, we are just trying to pay it forward." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dubais-guru-nanak-darbar-gurdwara-continued-to-serve-humanity-even-during-pandemic-279519
