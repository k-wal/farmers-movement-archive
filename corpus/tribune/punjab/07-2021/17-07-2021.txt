He was trying to flee to Paris when he was arrested, the ED said in an official statement.Pabbi was later produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mohali that remanded him to the ED custody till July 23, the agency informed.The ED alleged, “Pabbi, who became a Dutch national in 1984, committed cheating and forgery in the Netherlands through fraudulent documents prepared in connivance with his Indian associates.”“Pabbi ran an underground banking /banking without permit/hawala business in the Netherlands under the garb of trading in readymade garments. The proceeds of crime generated by him were laundered through Pakistani individuals based in Dubai, who transferred the money to him and his brother’s NRE accounts in Phagwara,” the ED alleged.The proceeds of crime were invested in the development and construction of Mayfair Resorts and Cabbana Resort and Spa situated in Phagwara on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana highway, the ED said, adding that the facility, spread over several acres, is a renowned venue known mainly for hosting luxurious weddings, corporate events and other events.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ed-arrests-phagwara-origin-dutch-national-from-igi-airport-in-money-laundering-case-284658
17-07-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati slams Amarinder over letter to PM Modi regarding farmers’ protest||BSP president Mayawati on Saturday targeted Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh over his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the ongoing farmers’ agitation.“The letter written by the Congress CM of Punjab to the PM, expressing various apprehensions about the farmers’ agitation is a conspiracy to defame the movement of the farmers, who are sacrificing their lives to get the new agricultural laws repealed, and pursue electoral politics under its guise. This is most unfair,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Taking the Centre’s cooperation on challenges faced by the government of a border state is not unreasonable, but pursuing selfish electoral politics under its garb and defaming the farmers’ movement are something the public understands well, Mayawati added.“The Congress is not going to reap any benefit by doing this,” she said.Singh had on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately resume talks with agitating farmers, sending him a letter that cited “cross-border threat” by ISI-backed groups ahead of the state assembly polls.In the letter, the chief minister cited “heightened cross-border threat and increased drone and other terrorist activities by ISI-backed groups, including plans by Khalistani outfits to target certain farmer leaders”.He warned that powers across the border “may try to play upon the charged emotions of our proud, sincere, and hardworking farmers” of Punjab.

It is learnt that Sidhu has already been told to seek cooperation and take everyone along, as his upcoming assignment demands.Read alsoSources privy to the discussion said as per the peace formula, the CM would be given free hand in cabinet rejig – as per his requirement. An assurance of say in the appointment of working presidents under the PPCC President is learnt to have been conveyed to CM by Rawat.

Rawat after reaching Delhi would be taking up the issue and apprehension raised by CM with the Congress President. The party leadership was hopeful that working solution between the CM and Sidhu would be found soon. “The CM wants that appointment should complement the efforts of the CM in returning the party to power in the 2022 assembly elections’, said sources. With the aim to make him acceptable and give the due respect to the old guard, Sidhu after getting apparent signal from party high command on his elevation has since yesterday called upon four former PPCC Presidents Shamsher Singh Dullo, Lal Singh, Partap Singh Bajwa and Sunil Jakhar. Sidhu today also ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa, Balbir Sidhu, Gupreet Kangar, besides MLAs in sector 39 here, Describing the visit as a welcome sign, Jakhar said the party had to put a united face for the 2022 Assembly elections.  Sidhu landing up at Jakhar’s residence was being seen as a follow-up to the party high command's directive to the former minister to take all state leaders along before the anticipated announcement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-seeks-pre-eminence-in-party-inside-track-on-capt-rawat-meeting-284614

This led to an altercation between the two groups and the activists of the Dal went live on social media to highlight the issue.

Let’s see who gives the CM post to a leader of the SC community. —RP Singh, BJP spokerspersonSingh countered him saying perhaps it was time for a Dalit CM in Punjab. Notably, while the Shiromani Akali Dal promised to pick a person from the community as deputy CM if voted to power, the BJP went a step ahead when it pitched for a Dalit CM for Punjab. However, after national general secretary Tarun Chugh said this, state party leaders claimed no such decision had been formalised on the issue. “The BJP is the only party which could give respect to the Dalits. The decision to make a Dalit CM has not yet been taken,” they said, apparently after apprehensions were raised that such an announcement could backfire with the core voter base — upper-caste Hindus — drifting away.However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pitch for Dalit and OBC leaders in his rebooted Council of Ministers has again brought into focus BJP’s efforts towards a shift from its “upper caste” image.However, it remains to be seen whether the BJP will field a Dalit face as its CM candidate. While according to Tewari, there are 31.94 per cent Dalits, both Hindus and Sikh, BJP leaders add along with Other Backward Classes, the two communities can form a formidable contrast to Jat Sikhs and upper-caste Hindus/Sikhs in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-cant-dalit-be-punjab-cm-bjp-asks-cong-284202

Naman also helped the other accused obtain foreign WhatsApp numbers that were used to carry out the fraud, said Police Commissioner Rakesh Agrawal.The cops have a challenging task of listening to over 10 lakh recorded calls as the victims belonged to foreign countries such as the UK, USA, Canada and no one had so far approached the police.The accused had access to a robotic calls software, which they used to make 30,000 calls at once. Those falling prey were transferred by the software to fake call centres and connected to persons in India.“The police need at least some complainants to make a strong case against the accused. We have seized record of more than 10 lakh calls from the software. All calls are being screened to identify the victims,” said a senior police official probing the scam.“The Ludhiana police will write to the Punjab Police, which through the Home Department will communicate with the Ministry of External Affairs to reach out to the countries to get written statements of the victims. We will do this once we corroborate the technical and physical evidence seized here,” said an officer.Additional DCP Crime Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, who busted the racket, said having foreign complainants on record would surely boost the probe, but the police had enough technical and physical evidence to ensure early conviction of the accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhiana-key-accused-in-call-centre-scam-nabbed-from-gujarat-284206

The assertion came as a Division Bench of the High Court granted interim bail to 74-year-old Chunni Lal Gaba in a related money laundering case.The government, at one point of time, had claimed to have “broken the back of the drug trade” in the state, while calling for fast-tracking the extradition of accused in the case by taking up the matter with the Ministry of External Affairs.As the matter came up for resumed hearing, the Special Division Bench of Rajan Gupta and Justice Ajay Tewari asserted: “We are conscious of the fact that the trial of the case has not made much headway as some of the accused are still absconding. The stand of the investigating agency before us is that stepsare being taken to apprehend the said accused.”The Bench observed it had, on a previous date of hearing, asked the Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement, and other respondents, to explain why petitioner Gaba was neither arrested for a long period during the investigation nor were his production warrants ever sought. This despite him being in judicial custody in the case registered under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The Bench added the stand now taken in the affidavit dated July 13 was that the petitioner was a senior citizen of 74 years and cooperating during the course of investigation. As such, neither was he arrested nor his production warrants sought, while he was in custody in the predicate offence case.Keeping in view the peculiar facts of the case, the Bench asserted it felt that at the current stage, the petitioner was required to be enlarged on interim bail. He would appear before the trial court on July 27 as undertaken by his counsel. He would also surrender his passport before the trial court within a week and visit the local police station at least once a fortnight.The case will now come up on August 20. The matter pertains to the seizure of 25 kg of intoxicant powder from a factory premises. The Bench had earlier made it clear that the state on three occasions since February had failed to file its response to the bail plea.‘Why production warrants not sought’The Bench observed it had, on a previous date of hearing, asked the Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement, and other respondents, to explain why petitioner Gaba was neither arrested for a long period during the investigation nor were his production warrants ever sought.

With this, people would not have to visit private centres for paying hefty charges.Sidhu clarified all other tests that were already being conducted free of cost in government laboratories would be available as earlier. He said a process had been started to meet the necessity of people as well as provide all tests with fixed rates across the state.

The unions, which have been on an indefinite sit-in outside the local residence of the minister and DC office, oppose the minister during his majority of visits to the city to press for their demand for jobs.“Minister Singla is projecting the distribution of 2,527 appointment letters to newly recruited teachers as his big achievement, but his government is doing nothing for thousands of unemployed like us, who have been protesting across the state.

17-07-2021||Chandigarh||Centre lowers PSPCL’s rating from A+ to A||Punjab State Power Corporation Limited’s (PSPCL) rating has been lowered by the Union Ministry of Power, in the just released Ninth Integrated Rating Booklet. The state power utility’s rating has been lowered from A + to A.Though the state’s rating is good at the all-India level, the ranking has fallen from No. 4 to No. 7 now. The areas of concern listed for the state in this year’s rating are the state’s absolute subsidy dependence, which remains high, given the subsidised nature of tariff, particularly towards agriculture consumers, coupled with delay in receipt of subsidy. The state’s high cost of power purchase and low cost efficiency on account of high employee cost is also listed as a key concern in the report.The increase in unpaid bills of government departments amounting to Rs 2,100 crore is another reason for reduced collection efficiency and, hence, lower rating. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-lowers-pspcls-rating-from-a-to-a-284221

We did not take back the case. You must check the date. The case was withdrawn when the election code had been imposed. There were just two days left for voting.”He asserted: “Let me clarify no case against the Sirsa dera chief was taken back during our tenure. In fact, the Congress government was expected to return to power at the time. There seems to be a wrong perception created on the matter.”Poll code was in place thenWe did not take back the case. It was withdrawn when the poll code had been imposed.

17-07-2021||Chandigarh/new Delhi||Signs of Sidhu’s elevation, bid to get Capt on board||Amidst the imbroglio over a new PPCC chief, AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat will be arriving in Chandigarh on Saturday for a meeting with CM Capt Amarinder Singh on the PPCC and Cabinet revamp. Earlier scheduled for Friday, the meeting was cancelled after party president Sonia Gandhi called Rawat and MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu to Delhi.Ahead of Sidhu’s meeting with Sonia, Narinder Bhambri, OSD to the Punjab CM, was seen at 10 Janpath reportedly carrying a note by Capt Amarinder Singh expressing apprehension over the likely appointment of Sidhu, a Jat Sikh, to the PPCC chief’s post, arguing that it could have an adverse impact on party’s poll prospects. There was no official confirmation by the CMO. Rawat, who was present at the meeting along with party leader Rahul Gandhi, said no final decision on the PPCC reorganisation had been made and Sonia Gandhi was yet to take the final call.Speaking to Rawat on the phone, Captain reportedly complained about the meeting that dissident ministers and MLAs held at the residence of minister Sukhjinder Randhawa where Sidhu too was present. Party sources said several MLAs had urged the high command to hold a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting so that there was no confusion regarding their stand.Meanwhile, a message in media groups sent by an office-bearer of the Punjab Youth Congress, saying celebrations were to be held at the Congress Bhawan in Chandigarh on Sidhu’s ‘elevation’, created quite a flutter. A similar message was flashed regarding a function at Amritsar. But sources close to Sidhu said they were not aware of any such messages. A fake letter on the AICC letterhead declaring Sidhu as the new PPCC chief raised many an eyebrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/signs-of-sidhus-elevation-bid-to-get-capt-on-board-284236

17-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: AAP govt rejects Delhi Police's panel of lawyers; ball now in L-G's court||The AAP government on Friday rejected the Delhi Police's proposal to set up a panel of public prosecutors to argue cases related to violence during a tractor rally by farmers on January 26, setting the stage for a fresh round of confrontation with the Centre and the L-G office.Sources, however, said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is likely to invoke special powers granted to him in the Constitution and approve a panel of lawyers chosen by the Delhi Police.At an online press conference, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the appointment of lawyers comes entirely under the purview of the Delhi government and the L-G can only use his veto power in the rarest of rare cases.He also alleged that the lieutenant governor has been using veto power even in routine matters, terming it as a "murder of democracy" and violation of the Supreme Court's orders.The Delhi Cabinet on Friday observed that letting police's lawyers appear in the case of farmers who have been protesting the three farm laws would seriously hamper legal parity and would not be fair to the accused peasants who bear a right to go through an unbiased trial, the government said in a statement.It also said the cabinet affirmed that prosecutors are meant to be independent and cannot be according to the choice of the police.The cabinet, while deliberating upon the proposal of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their preference, was of the view that as held by various judgments of the Supreme Court, the role of the public prosecutor is not to act as a spokesperson of the police force but to discharge an independent statutory role, presenting to the court the correct picture, the government said.After his cabinet's decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said it is the duty of every citizen of India to support farmers and that the Delhi government has not done any favour to them."We have only done our duty towards the farmers of the nation. A farmer is not a criminal or a terrorist, but our 'annadata'," he tweeted.Sisodia also claimed that it is very unfortunate that the BJP-led Central government has been interfering in the functioning of the AAP dispensation through the L-G."The Supreme Court has defined the use of this veto power by the L-G on transferred subjects. Doorstep delivery of ration and court matters related to farmers' protests are not the rarest of rare cases."This power cannot be used left, right and centre every day. This is a murder of democracy and violation of the Supreme Court's orders," the deputy chief minister said during the press conference.The cabinet also observed that the demand of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their choice in the case was baseless and unwarranted and that it could not allow the same to happen."The cabinet was satisfied with the performance of the government's present public prosecutors and noted that there were no complaints made against their functioning," it also said.In July last year, Lt Governor Baijal had overturned the AAP government's decision to reject the Delhi Police's panel of lawyers to argue the 2020 northeast Delhi riot cases in the high court and the Supreme Court.According to a Delhi government official, the cabinet's decision to reject the city police's proposal to argue the farmers' protest cases will be conveyed to the L-G."It was decided that the Delhi government's lawyers will be public prosecutors in court matters related to the farmers' agitation," the official said.However, sources said the L-G is likely to invoke his special power under the Constitution and refer the dispute to the President of India.On Thursday, the Delhi government had alleged that it was being pressured by the BJP-ruled Centre to replace its prosecutors appearing in cases related to the anti-farm laws stir, with those of the Delhi Police.The issue pertained to a request made by the Delhi Police for the appointment of special public prosecutors for cases related to violence, disrespect of the national flag and blatant disregard of the rule of law on Republic Day during the tractor rally taken out by the protesting farmers in the national capital."It has nothing to do with the farmers' protest as it is being deliberately made out with ulterior motives," a source claimed.On Thursday, the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), in a statement, had said Baijal "rejected" the panel of Delhi government lawyers appearing in cases against the farmers protesting against the Centre's three new farm laws at the city's borders."The Delhi Police investigating the cases, however, wants the appointment of its own panel of lawyers. Law Minister Satyendar Jain had rejected the Delhi Police proposal but now, the LG has put pressure on the Delhi government to call its cabinet meeting for a decision on the Delhi Police panel," the statement said.It also claimed that the LG, at a virtual meeting with Jain, had "admitted" that the public prosecutors of the Delhi government were doing a "good" job and fighting the cases efficiently.The Delhi Police had registered over 40 cases in connection with the Republic Day violence and vandalism in the national capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-protest-aap-govt-rejects-delhi-polices-panel-of-lawyers-ball-now-in-l-gs-court-284172

We will go into elections under the CM. As for Sidhu, a formulation is being drafted.

Please read my statement very carefully and try and understand my words and their meaning.”On Sidhu’s elevation as party chief Rawat had said yesterday, “A decision would be around those lines, nearer to those lines.
