18-09-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farm legislations: The tussle between farmers, Centre and Opposition||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 18Every story has two sides but the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture-related legislations has more than that with farmers, middlemen or ‘arthiyas’, States and the Centre forming the various facets. Interestingly as agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar points, sides traditionally at odds (farmers and arthiyas) are together in this one-on-one against the BJP-led Centre aided by Opposition parties, farmers’ organisations and activists.Perhaps the real issue is too technical and the threat of new ecosystem rendering MSP irrelevant more impacting. The Tribune talked to different sides to understand the dynamics of the evolving agitation in the light of the contentious legislations which the Narendra Modi government calls “pro-farmers and revolutionary” but still forced an unprecedented reaction from its cornered ally, the Akali DalThis is what BKU General Secretary Yudhvir Singh said after Prime Minister Modi on Friday accused the Opposition, primarily the Congress, of “misleading farmers with disinformation campaign”, “spreading lies” and “supporting middlemen”: “The Prime Minister is trying to suppress realities with these allegations.”“Farmers’ virodh (opposition) has not happened for the first time, we have fought several battles against the government, including in the regime of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh," he said. "The Akali Dal (Harsimrat Kaur Badal) was forced to resign from the government, otherwise it would not have been able to enter Punjab, this is the situation today,” said Yudhvir Singh, adding that if ‘mandis’ cease to exist so will the MSP. This despite the government’s repeated claim that “MSP will remain now and forever”. “The system of MSP exists in ‘mandi’ and ‘mandi’ is governed by the APMC Act. Yes, farmers are exploited by ‘arthiyas’ but the aim should have been to fix that lacuna in the system,” says the BKU leader.  “Procurement at the MSP is only for a limited period and farmers who are not able to sell during the period are forced to sell at lower prices to ‘arthiyas’, but the same group will step in case the system changes. The government is acting at the behest of WTO, World Bank and IMF and using Covid-limitations to push in legislations that will destroy farmers,” he said. Meanwhile, upset with PM’s attempt to “eliminate middleman”, 'arthiyas' say they are the “facilitators” and "integral part of the food grain procurement network system working for benefit of both farmers and government agencies.Ravinder Singh Cheema, president of the Punjab Aarhtia Association, says: “These legislations will ruin the agriculture marketing infrastructure network created in the past five decades. ‘Aarhtias’ work like bridge, take the responsibility of quality and quantity of the government stock up to 45 days in procurement season and protect farmers against officials trying to shortchange them with objections about moisture content, quality of the grain etc.” "Big companies will also purchase grain through agent/ distributor,” he said, also rejecting the observation that they were trying to fire from the shoulders of farmers."The movement is led by young educated farmers who know what is right. If the government does not change the decision, the central agency will not be allowed to purchase a single grain from Punjab and Haryana, all movement will be blocked. It is because of strong ‘mandi’ system that Punjab and Haryana farmers are able to get 100% MSP whereas in states like UP, Gujarat and MP they are exploited by officials."The BJP, which is accusing the Congress of “misleading, lying and double-speak" on the "revolutionary agri-reform steps that will change the face of the farming sector and state of farmers in the country" also points to its poll' promise in 2019 to repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act in 2019.BJP president JP Nadda says: “UPA between 2013-14 de-notified fruits and vegetables from the APMC Act in its states, including Haryana, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Karnataka.”“The Congress in its 2019 Lok Sabha elections manifesto made it clear it will  repeal the Agricultural Produce Market Committees Act and make trade in agricultural produce, including exports and inter-state trade, free from all,” he said.“Not just this the Congress in paragraph 21 stated: ‘The Essential Commodities Act 1955, belongs to the age of controls. Congress promises to replace the Act by an enabling law that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies’." Not just Nadda and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, PM Modi has also specified that “MSP in 'mandis' and APMC Act  will not be impacted by the legislations".  “Farmers who do not want to sell in ‘mandis' can sell outside, it should be their choice.  MSP is limited to ‘mandis’ and available for limited period. These agri-reforms are dedicated to farmers, giving them choice and freedom to cross barriers, helping them increase produce and investment in the sector," he saysHowever, agriculture expert Panwar believes implementation of new agriculture legislations will be difficult. There are many reasons but most important is “lack of consultations with stakeholders”.“Punjab and Haryana will be affected the most because of loss of ‘mandi’ tax, which is a good source of revenue. While ‘arthiyas’ will also lose their commissions and traditional business, farmers are apprehensive about the functioning of new land contract system and agriculture market.”“What is proposed in the ordinances/legislations appear to have strong biases either towards corporate or uncertainties. Therefore, much depends upon how new system face challenges in the field and evolves,” he says.

We feel that with this Bill, trader can make purchase anywhere without paying any fee to the state and if government does not get this revenue, then how state government generate revenue for expenditure like maintenance of 65,000 km long rural roads”.He also accused the central government was trying to abolish Minimum Support Prices for unlimited produce through the Bills.Badal wondered why Harmsimrat Kaur, a former union minister for Food Processing Industries, chose to time her resignation with the intensifying protests by farmers across Punjab instead of doing it when the ordinances were first introduced and approved by the Cabinet in June.Badal also accused Harsmirat Kaur’s party Shiromani Akali Dal of “spreading lies” that the finance minister had given his approval for the ordinances at a high-power committee meeting.He also asked for altering the parameters of the crop insurance scheme to suit Punjab.Harsimrat Kaur resigned from the union cabinet hours after Lok Sabha passed two of the three controversial bills---the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020’ and the ‘Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020’.The Bills follow three ordinances of similar nature that were approved by the Cabinet at a meeting in June.
18-09-2020||---||New farm laws part of SAD-backed Central govt’s ‘Kisan maaru, Punjab maaru’ conspiracy: Capt Amarinder||Chandigarh, September 18Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday slammed the farm legislations passed in the Rajya Sabha and described it as part of the ‘Kisan maaru, Punjab maaru’ (Destroy Farmers, Destroy Punjab) conspiracy of the BJP-led NDA, a press release by the state government said.“I don’t know what enmity the BJP and the Akalis have with Punjab and why they are out to destroy us,” said the Chief Minister while launching the Virtual Kisan Mela of Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana. The launch was held with virtual connectivity at 100 locations and participated by farmers, farmer representatives and other stakeholders, including ministers, MLAs and PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar.Warning again that the legislations would lead to growing angst among the people in the border state, thus giving Pakistan the opportunity to stoke more fires, Captain Amarinder said the anti-farmer move would spoil the ‘abo hawa’ (environment) of Punjab.Also read: Sunny Deol says agricultural ordinances will help farmers get better priceNavjot Sidhu breaks Twitter silence; says attack on Punjab's soul won’t be toleratedDelhi has to rethink on this issue, he stressed, adding that the legislations would undo the sacrifices made by Punjab and its farmers over 65 years to make India self-sufficient in food.Accusing the Akalis of playing their own political games in this entire affair, the Chief Minister asked the Badals why the SAD had failed to stand with the Punjab government on these Bills and even on the critical water issue.“Did you not think even once what will happen to Punjab without agriculture and without water?” he asked the Akalis, pointing out that with the SYL issue hanging over the state, the situation was perilous and the SAD had only contributed to the crisis by supporting the farm ordinances.The Chief Minister said notwithstanding the Centre’s denials, these new laws would eventually pave the way for the elimination of the MSP regime and end of the FCI, leaving the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, as recommended by the Shanta Kumar committee.Strongly opposing the legislations, the Chief Minister also trashed the Centre’s guarantee of the MSP not being tampered with, saying it was a Constitutional guarantee given by the Parliament, which, in fact, the government at the Centre was trying to destroy with their brute majority.Even the MSP already announced on items such as Maize was not being given to farmers, he noted, questioning the sincerity of the Government of India.Categorically rejecting claims by the BJP and the SAD that Punjab was on board with the farm ordinances, the Chief Minister made it clear that the issue of any such ordinances or new laws on agriculture was never discussed at any of the meetings in which his government was represented at the high-powered committee set up by the Centre on agricultural reforms, the press release further read.Politicians should not lie on such grave issues with serious implications for our future generations, said Captain Amarinder, in reference to the false and misleading claims of Union Minister Raosaheb Patil Danve and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal.Politics aside, this was an issue concerning the future of our children, he added.The high-powered committee was clearly an eyewash, the Chief Minister said, waving the draft report shared with Punjab, which made no mention whatsoever of the ordinances. His government’s response to the draft report had, in fact, clearly listed its stand on any reforms, he added.It was shameful that despite knowing these facts as part of the ruling coalition, the Akalis continued to side with the Central Government and did not oppose the ordinances during the all-party meeting convened by him and did not even come to the Assembly to vote for the resolution against them, Captain Amarinder said.Taking a dig at Harsimrat Badal’s remarks of standing with her `farmer brethren’ by resigning from the Union Cabinet, Captain Amarinder asked why she forgot that farmers were her brothers when the Centre brought in the ordinances. “Had the SAD stood with his government from the outset and put pressure on their ally, the BJP, the current situation may not have arisen,” he added.Pointing out that it was Punjab and its farmers, who toiled with blood and sweat to make the nation food surplus, Captain Amarinder said despite being a small state, Punjab saved the nation from going hungry through the years.“Even during the COVID pandemic, all foodgrain distributed to the poor around the country came from Punjab’s godowns,” he noted.
18-09-2020||Amritsar||Akal Takht punishes SGPC executive for negligence that led to misappropriation of 'saroops'||Akal Takht’s officiating Jathedar, Giani Harpreet Singh, in the presence of five High Priests, on Friday, snubbed the SGPC executive body for negligence which led to the gross misappropriation of 328 Guru Granth Sahib ‘saroops’ by its officials and staff of the publication department, who were authorized to print and manage the holy scriptures.Admitting to administrative carelessness, SGPC executive body president Gobind Singh Longowal submitted a public apology and volunteered to appear before the Akal Takht for atonement. Longowal said that though they were not being called up, yet they unanimously decided to seek pardon for the lapse in managing the saroops.Abiding by the strong-worded directions of Giani Harpreet Singh, they did ‘parikrama’ of Golden Temple while reciting ‘waheguru jaap’ with folded hands.As revealed in the probe report, Longowal apologized while admitting that the officials and staff members issued the saroops without putting them on record and pocketed the ‘bheta’ (the amount charged at the time of issuing saroops).Giani Harpreet Singh emphasized that it was ‘shameful’ that SGPC staff members misappropriated the saroops under the nose of the SGPC and no efforts were undertaken to check the ledgers.Pronouncing punishment from the podium of highest Sikh Temporal Seat, the SGPC executive was barred from participating in any religious programme or making a public address for one month i.e till October 17. However, they could attend the annual budget session which has been scheduled for September 28.Taking cognizance of SGPC’s much-criticised U-turn on initiating criminal proceedings against the guilty officials and staff members for embezzlement, Giani Harpreet Singh cautioned the SGPC against taking pre-mature and ill-conceived decisions that end up making the ‘mockery’ of the state of affairs. The SGPC was directed to take Sikh intellectuals or organisations in the loop before zeroing in on any decision.SGPC executive members were also directed to sweep the street leading to the Golden Temple Deori from Gurdwara Saragarhi Niwas, around a km-long passage, for one hour for three days.About skipping the ‘pashchatap path’ (remorse prayers) following the May 2016 fire incident at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib that left several saroops destroyed, Giani Harpreet Singh termed it as "bajjar galti” (serious misdeed).The then SGPC executive members, sans former president Avtar Singh Makkar and chief secretary Harcharan Singh, both dead, appeared for penance. All of them submitted a ‘public apology’.In the absence of Makkar, the then senior vice president Raghujit Singh Virk was questioned for the lapse of not performing remorse prayers. Virk told that all executive members had requested Makkar repeatedly to get it performed, but he did not respond. Shunning the system, Giani Harpreet Singh said that all efforts would be made to grab positions, but when it comes to complying with the ‘maryada’ less enthusiasm was witnessed among the office-bearers.They were directed not to occupy any position in the SGPC for next one year, considered from today, and the SGPC executive was directed for compliance of the directions. They were also directed to listen to the ‘sehaj path’ and perform ‘sewa’ at local gurdwara as per their physical capacity.The existing SGPC executive was also directed to conduct one session of sehaj path prayers at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib, where this incident had occurred, and another one at Akal Takht.

18-09-2020||Sanjeev Singh Bariana||Face-saving by Akalis||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 17The resignation of Union Cabinet Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal is clearly a face-saving attempt by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), given the fact that Harsimrat was part of the Cabinet that cleared the farm Bills and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal did not oppose these Bills then.The SAD took a U-turn after Punjab farmers, the party’s core base, took to the streets opposing the Bills.Having lost ground in the battle of public perception, the party had no choice but to pull out of the NDA government. Farmers believe that the Bills are aimed at dismantling the MSP regime as well as the mandis. Senior party leader PS Chandumajra was among the first to warn the party on the issue. Later, in a strong message to the party leadership, former state minister Sikander Singh Maluka hinted at a “vertical split” in the party.The SAD received a ‘very negative’ feedback during its ‘Pind Jagao’ campaign in August. It cannot risk another drubbing in the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections.The party performed dismally during the 2017 elections, winning just 15 of the total 117 seats. The incumbent Congress government is losing sheen for not having honoured its poll promises so far and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is trying to recover lost ground by highlighting issues of public interest. The SAD will need to start from ground zero to win the people’s trust.
18-09-2020||KV Prasad||Sena first, and now SAD||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 17The SAD tonight pulled out its lone representative in the Union Cabinet, signalling a fissure in its three-decade-old ties with the BJP. That Harsimrat Kaur Badal referred to it in her resignation letter reflects that ties forged by BJP veterans Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani may have lost the sheen the partnership mutually benefited since 1996.Weakening tiesIronical it may seem that during the past one year, BJP’s relations with two of its oldest and staunch supporters — the Shiv Sena and SAD — have slided down.Ironical it may seem that during the past one year, BJP’s relations with two of its oldest and staunch supporters – the Shiv Sena and SAD- have slided down. While the Sena moving away could be attributed to a political compulsion of forming government in Maharasthra, there is no such apparent pressure on the Akalis. The elections to the state Assembly is still a good 17-odd months away. The SAD has stopped short of a clean break from the BJP. Now that the three farm Bills the SAD is opposed to are on course to get Parliament’s nod, the Akalis may have to work on its political calculations on maintaining its alliance with the national party. Yet, it chose to step out of the Modi government on a day the BJP celebrated the birthday of the Prime Minister.

They raised slogans against the Central and state governments for their “anti-farmer” policies and “failure in addressing genuine issues of the farming community”.Cops foil AAP bid to protest in Badal villageMuktsar: AAP activists, who took out a tractor march on Thursday, were not allowed to enter Badal village by the police. Hence, they lodged a protest against the Centre’s farm Bills on the outskirts of Kaljharani and Badal villages in Bathinda and Muktsar districts, respectively. TNSThe Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) held a protest march, blocking traffic in the city. “We were deceived by both state and Central Governments. They have left us with no option but to organise protests across the country,” said senior farmer leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan.A leader of protesting farmers said the Central Government was hell-bent to hand over the entire farming sector to big multi-national chains, which would eventually destroy shopkeepers, arhtiyas and farmers.Meanwhile, even though Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal today resigned as a Union Minister, farmers protesting near her Badal village residence termed it a “drama” and said their six-day protest would continue till September 20.Speaking over the phone, Shingara Singh Mann, state secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), said, “The SAD has taken this step just to befool farmers. Our protest will not just continue outside the residence of Badals, we will also intensify it. She (Harsimrat) has just resigned as a Union Minister, but the SAD will continue its support to the BJP-led NDA. We will consider them our sympathisers only when they quit the NDA and take back their support from the Modi government. Nothing has changed with her resignation at this moment.”

The Centre might have thought 10 times before introducing the ordinances and pushing the anti-farmer legislations in Parliament,” he added.Even now, the only reason for the SAD’s decision to pull their sole minister out of the Union Cabinet was motivated not by any concern for the farmers, but to save their political fortunes, the Chief Minister said.It was angst of the farmers and the pressure mounted by the state’s farmer organisations that had compelled the Badals to change their stance on the ordinances, said Captain Amarinder.Meanwhile, Partap Bajwa, Congress MP, said, “Harsimrat has resigned from the Cabinet yet the SAD remains a member of the NDA. The resignation is not one on principle, but an attempt to hoodwink the public.”

Though the decision could have been taken some days ago as well, we can understand that many things have to be kept in mind if you are an alliance partner. A majority of us are also farmers and we are happy with the party’s stand.”Earlier, launching a counter-attack on the Congress, the SAD asked Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to issue a white paper on his as well as his government’s “participation”, which led to the framing of the three farm Bills.

This came to light after the Department of Personnel, Punjab, sought a report from the Sangrur Deputy Commission (DC) and initiate action against the officials concerned, who changed the nature of land illegally.Despite the verification of land price at Rs 53.01 crore in violation of the norms, not a single official has faced any action yet. Interestingly, the file has gone missing from the office of the Sangrur ADC (General), located at the SAC, after Sangrur DC Ramvir directed him to study the matter thoroughly and prepare a report. Some officials involved in the process of land acquisition are still posted here.“We are verifying if someone has deliberately hidden the file. I cannot share more details as an inquiry is going on,” DC Ramvir said.Sources said the Central Government had issued a notification under the National Highway Act on June 23, 2015, to acquire land in 25 villages — from Kalajhar village on the Sangrur-Patiala road to Dugga village on the Sangrur-Barnala road. On December 11, 2015, the authorities had issued a 3-D notification under the Act to acquire the land. The first meeting of the district price fixation committee was organised on April 6, 2016. Later, officials analysed the average rate of the land, which was acquired from 2012 to 2015.“But during the process, the officials of various departments changed the nature of the land from agricultural to commercial in violation of norms. Some owners were shocked when they got to know that the nature of their land was changed after the officials refused to pay commission,” a resident, whose land was also acquired, said.After an appeal by residents in September 2018, the then Patiala Divisional Commissioner-cum-Arbitrator set aside the change of nature of land done in violation of norms after the issuance of the 3-D notification under the National Highway Act.
18-09-2020|| ---||Prashant Kishor’s presence in Chandigarh fans rumours||Chandigarh, September 17 The presence of political strategist Prashant Kishor in Chandigarh for the past three days has fuelled a speculation of him being given some important role to facilitate the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in playing another innings. Party sources confirmed that Kishor was in Chandigarh but did not confirm him meeting the Chief Minister. However, a close associate of Kishor termed the reports speculative. “The association was never hidden. If and when there is any decision, there will be a formal announcement. Until then, people are free to speculate. There is nothing to hide,” he said. With the fast changing political situation and Akali minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigning from the Union Cabinet, political analysts are now debating the role of the BJP in the event of a break-up of the BJP- SAD alliance. The party could pose a serious challenge to the Congress and Kishor’s role could be important. Currently engaged by the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress dispensation, Kishor’s political strategist firm Indian-Political Action Committee (I-PAC) has been conducting assessment surveys in West Bengal. A similar exercise had been carried out in the state as he is learnt to have told the Congress government to fulfil the nine key promises made ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections. In the past, the Chief Minister had hinted at hiring Kishor for the 2022 elections and the party MLAs’opinion had also been sought on it.

The meeting was attended by Principal Secretary Hussan Lal, Secretary (Health) Kumar Rahul, Director (Health Services) Dr Avneet Kaur and various other senior officials.HEALTH WORKERS GIVEN SAMPLING TARGETS Punjab is probably the only state in the country where wild rumours regarding Covid-19 were spread. The report observed that to increase Covid testing, the state government gave sampling targets to field health officials. Following this, health officials at some places went overboard to meet the targets and started collection of samples. Such steps led to spread of rumours.Apart from that, the report found that Punjab’s case fatality rate (CFR) was very high because of the high load of non-communicable disease, like hypertension, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. Because of lack of trust in state’s healthcare infrastructure, people were preferring self-medication at home and reaching the hospitals late.Besides, there were reports that state’s contact tracing was very poor. In certain districts, it was not being carried out at all. The team also pointed out the poor management of containment or micro-containment zones.

Most importantly, it nowhere showed it was posted on the social media by the actor.“Thus, the facts and circumstances do not indicate commission of any cognizable offence by the respondent,” Justice Bajaj added after hearing the counsel.The matter was brought to the HC’s notice after Ludhiana resident Navneet Gopi filed a petition for protection and directions to the state to conduct an inquiry on his representations/complaints and to take legal action against Kangana.Gopi’s counsel drew the court’s attention to the posts on the social media before submitting the contents had hurt the religious feelings of a particular section of society and it amounted to commission of offence punishable under the penal laws.The counsel added the petitioner gave two representations on August 5 and August 20 to the Haibowal Station House Officer and Ludhiana Commissioner of Police for registration of an FIR under the provisions of Punjab Prohibition of Cow Slaughter Act, Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. But action was not taken.Referring to prayer for protecting life and liberty, Justice Bajaj asserted it was not based on genuine apprehension as details of persons or organisations behind the threats were not mentioned in the petition. Even the complaints and representations lacked particulars, as averments regarding threat to him and his family had not been pleaded. “It has not at all been described as to how and in what manner the alleged threat was extended.Dismissing the petition, Justice Bajaj asserted: “The court has no hesitation in holding that the petition is vague and misconceived. Therefore, this court is not inclined to exercise the inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC.”

The theatres have been lying closed since the lockdown was imposed, but the PSPCL is issuing electricity bills on the average of last year. Is it possible for someone to pay the hefty bill and that too when everything is lying closed? I was recently handed out a bill of Rs 4.25 lakh for my cinema hall. The state government should think about it.”“The Centre should allow us to open the cinema halls with some conditions. When everything else is open in the market then why is the government not allowing the cinemas to operate?” he added.Another cinema hall owner said: “We are suffering huge losses and the government seems to be unwilling to save the dying industry. If no compensation is allowed soon, it will also affect Pollywood.
