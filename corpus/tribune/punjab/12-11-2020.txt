12-11-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Finally, Punjab excise revenue goes up||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 11Having seen its tax and non-tax revenues drop sharply in wake of the Covid-induced lockdown, the rise in excise revenue has given the much-needed relief to the cash-strapped state.The increase was not organic, rather it was achieved by the state government by strictly controlling liquor smuggling and illicit liquor manufacturing, the Excise Department claimed. This comes in the aftermath of the spurious liquor tragedy that claimed over 120 lives and the government crackdown on illegal distilleries that had cropped up across the state.Operation Red Rose, launched against the distillers and brewers to prevent unaccounted for liquor sales, has also helped control smuggling, increase licit liquor sales and subsequently, the excise collections.The year-on-year increase in excise revenue has been 20 per cent in October alone (It is Rs 501 crore this year against Rs 419 crore in October 2019). The overall increase in revenue from liquor sales, from mid-May (after vends were allowed to reopen after the lockdown) till October is nine per cent. The excise revenue between April and October 2019 was Rs 2,735 crore as against the revenue of Rs 2,984 crore realised this fiscal.Financial Commissioner, Excise and Taxation, A Venu Prasad told The Tribune that after a long hiatus, the government was looking at an increase in its excise revenue by 20 per cent by March 2021. ‚ÄúAs against the revised target of Rs 4,700 crore, we are looking at a revenue touch between Rs 5,800 to Rs 6,000 crore. This year, licit liquor sales have also gone up. The liquor quota had to be increased by five per cent in August and by another five per cent in November. We have got an additional Rs 250 crore in revenue,‚Äù he said.Almost 50 per cent of the licit liquor (Indian Made Foreign Liquor) seized in the state during the past five months is of a brand made by a distillery in Haryana, while the remaining seizures of licit liquor affected in the past over four months, are of two country-made liquor brands distilled in Chandigarh. Figures available with The Tribune show that 1.20 lakh litres of licit liquor being sold in the market here, mostly smuggled but also pilfered from distilleries in Punjab without excise duty being paid, has been seized by officials between May 17 and September 30.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/finally-punjab-excise-revenue-goes-up-169399

12-11-2020||Chandigarh||All unions across nation urged to observe ‚Äòsolidarity day‚Äô today||Strongly condemning the economic blockade of Punjab by the Central Government, farmer unions across the country have pledged their support to the protesting farmers in the state.A national call has been given to all farmer and farm worker unions for observing ‚Äúsolidarity day‚Äù on November 12 for their struggling brethren in Punjab. The unions, under the aegis of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), condemned the suspension of goods trains which was preventing the supply of fertilisers, coal and other essential goods. They alleged the intention was to blackmail the people of Punjab and unleash repression on the peasant struggle.Addressing mediapersons, AIKSCC organising secretary Avik Shah alleged the BJP-led Central Government at the behest of agri-business corporations brought in the three farm Acts, which would end up demolishing the market system. ‚ÄúThese laws have not guaranteed the MSP and procurement, which is the key demand of farmers of the country for several years now. AIKSCC has formulated a law on the subject but it has been ignored by the government,‚Äù he said.Farmer leaders also condemned the Delhi Police for denying the permission to them for their proposed protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on November 26-27.They said all political parties were supporting farmers‚Äô struggle and even BJP‚Äôs own farmers‚Äô wing was supporting the farmers. ‚Äî TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/all-unions-across-nation-urged-to-observe-solidarity-day-today-169401
