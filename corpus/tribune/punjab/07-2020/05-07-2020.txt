ASHA workers, who are the foot soldiers in the fight against Covid-19, are the worst affected.Sources say many workers are under extreme mental pressure. A medical officer says: “We are completely exhausted — mentally and physically. However, the mental stress is bothering us more. From contact tracing to shifting the patients to isolation wards in the middle of the night, we are doing it all. Amid all this, we have to make that sure we follow all the precautions to save ourselves from getting infected. We are running out of energy.”An ASHA worker, who has been a victim of abuse during contact tracing, says: “We have been working continuously for over three months now. There is no motivation.

It is becoming difficult with each passing day to maintain a balance between family and work.”An Ayurvedic medical officer, who has been actively performing Covid duty, says, “It is very demoralising when we see a health worker, who is out to save the people, himself gets infected with the virus.
