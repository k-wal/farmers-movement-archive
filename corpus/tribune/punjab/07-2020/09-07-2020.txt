09-07-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 pandemic: Punjab Government to set up plasma bank||The Punjab Government will set up a plasma bank to facilitate plasma therapy treatment in the state.The approval for the same was given by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, while chairing a review meeting here via video-conferencing of the COVID-19 situation in the state, on Thursday. He approved the establishment of the plasma bank under the supervision and guidance of Neelam Marwaha, former Head of Blood Bank and Transfusion Medicine.The plasma bank would serve as a ready inventory source for seriously ill patients or those at risk of severe diseases, and thus will enable a wider range of adults to be treated with convalescent plasma.Plasma therapy is already being carried out as an ICMR trial project in the state’s government hospitals.“Fifteen patients have been selected for the trial, of whom eight were given plasma treatment. Five patients have recovered completely and shall be discharged soon,” an official spokesperson said. A total of 11 donors have donated plasma so far of the 300 recovered patients, the CM was informed in the meeting. Meanwhile, the chief minister expressed concern over increasing violations of safety norms in the state, many of them by political parties.He said he will write to the presidents of all registered political parties to seek their cooperation in checking large gatherings amid the pandemic.Raising the same issue, Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said the police had registered cases against some of the political parties for violation of COVID-19 safety norms, and that his department was also planning to write to the political outfits not to indulge in such acts.Notably, the Shiromani Akali Dal had on July 7 held a state-wide protest while several dissident Akalis organised a convention at Ludhiana.With 11 Punjab Civil Services (PCS) and other senior officers, civil surgeon of Sangrur, judges among others, infected by the disease so far, the chief minister stressed on the need to raise the guard further. Singh asked state Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to issue standard operating procedures for government officers’ meetings and visits to other offices, making it clear that the spread of infection among critical manpower due to casual attitude was not acceptable.Underlining the need for stricter enforcement of the safety rules, he directed the DGP not go soft on challans against violators. The chief minister was informed that as many as 4,882 challans were issued on Wednesday alone, mostly for not wearing safety masks. DGP Gupta informed the meeting that in view of an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the state, directions for sample testing in prisons had been issued.Home Secretary Satish Chandra apprised the CM that the process of cancellation of FIRs registered against migrant workers for lockdown violation, as ruled by the Supreme Court, has begun in the state. Sharing details of the rapid antigen testing set to start in the state for early detection and management of COVID-19 infections, Advisor (Health, Medical Education and Research) K K Talwar said Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali and Patiala districts have been identified for the pilot. Principal Secretary D K Tiwari, who also attended the meeting, said the state’s mortality rate was currently 2.6 per cent as against the country’s 2.8 per cent. He said 70.8 per cent of coronavirus patients in the state were asymptomatic, 14.7 per cent mild, 8.8 per cent moderate and 5.6 per cent severe.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-19-pandemic-punjab-government-to-set-up-plasma-bank-110628

It was formed in 1920 and had played an important role in the Independence of India.Also read: Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa proclaims himself as SAD chief“Unfortunately with due course of time the party which had such a glorious history and sacrifices was captured by a family and used for personal gains and made huge fortunes from the party by acquiring power for many decades,” he alleged.Meanwhile, Sikh organisations urged Lt Governor GC Murmu to hold District Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (DGPC) elections and also conduct an audit of expenses by the DGPC Jammu.They was also demanded that a committee, headed by a retired judge of the High Court, should be formed to probe “misuse” of funds by the DGPC.Mohinder Singh, chief organiser, Bhai Kanhaiya Nishkam Sewa Society, appealed to the J&K administration to appoint one Sikh member to the recently constituted JKPSC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/j-k-sikh-organisations-support-dhindsas-akali-dal-110611
09-07-2020||Amritsar||I invite Brahmpura to come and guide us, says Dhindsa||A couple of days after forming a ‘parallel’ Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa on Thursday paid obeisance at the Golden Temple with his supporters.Accompanied by former SAD ‘Taksali’ secretary-general, Sewa Singh Sekhwan, son Parminder Singh Dhindsa, he said that they aim to fight for Panthic as well as core Punjab issues by allying with ‘like-minded’ parties.He, however, shied away from elaborating over his differences with SAD (Taksali) head Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and said: “He is a very respectable pal. I still ask him to come and guide us but he appears to be adamant to carry on with his party, unmindful of anyone leaving him.”He said that they were compelled to quit SAD (Sukhbir-led) after it deviated from the core issues related to the Panth and inappropriately used the SGPC platform for “vested political interests”.“SAD (Badal) abandoned its objectives and misused SGPC, which also deviated from its path. Whatever misdeeds being committed in SGPC was an open secret now. Before 2017 polls, series of sacrilege incidents occurred and now the mysterious disappearance of 267 saroops of Guru Granth Sahib surfaced. It all carried on in a secretive manner for political gains and the SGPC too remained mute without bothering to conduct even ‘pashchatap’ (mourning prayers) against saroops which got damaged in 2016 fire incident. Scores of ‘Pathis’ and ‘dhadis’ got out of the job due to corona and SGPC looked the other way. I promise the people of Punjab that if we were entrusted with the responsibility of ‘sewa’, we will punish every everyone responsible for such acts. I warn SGPC officials to beware,” he said.Sekhwan clarifies stance on BrahmpuraSekhwan said that Brahmpura’s leadership was not acceptable among the ‘quom’ (community). He said that he (Brahmpura) had wrongly been stating that he was betrayed and not aware of floating new outfit. “Prior to our joining Dhindsa’s group, we discussed with Brahmpura numerous times, trying to convince him to merge the ‘taksali’ party and vacate chair for new leader as the quom was not accepting him to lead the party, but he remained obstinate,” he said.Sekhhwan added: “So, we switched over to Dhindsa’s side. We still stand by the resolution that we vowed to follow during the christening of SAD (Taksali) party from Akal Takht in 2018, but a fresh beginning was the need of the hour.”Sekhwan told that the party (Dhindsa group) has chalked out its mission in three phases-first one, to bring the Panthic-mind parties on one platform, second, to approach those who prioritize Punjab-issues and third, to set a common minimum interest programme with political parties like the AAP and the Bahujan Samaj Party.On Dr Rattan Singh Ajnala, one of the founding members of SAD (Taksali), he said, “The day his son (Boney Ajnala) jumped back to Badal Dal, he got incommunicado”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/i-invite-brahmpura-to-come-and-guide-us-says-dhindsa-110594

He was not paid his dues despite the fact that he was legally employed and whatever he had saved was spent on medicines after he slipped into depression.“Just before Covid outbreak, nearly 25 per cent of the earth moving and allied construction equipment of the world was deployed in Dubai. Such was the hectic pace of construction activity. However, in the first week of March, as the Covid scare grew in magnitude, work came to a grinding halt. We were told by officials that they could no longer pay us and subsequently we were fired. We slept on empty stomachs for days together before somebody asked us to get in touch with businessman Surinder Pal Singh Oberoi. Unfortunately, he was in India, trapped in the lockdown, but nevertheless, he told us to get in touch with his office in Dubai. His charitable organisation — Sarbat-Da-Bhala — chartered a flight, which finally brought us back to India. Not even a single rupee was taken from us,” Jugraj said.Peter Masih Sidhu and Deepak Kumar, too, had similar tales to tell.The flight touched down at Chandigarh airport late last night. The boys were received by Oberoi and his brother Gurjit Singh Oberoi. No officials were present.“This is the first of the four flights chartered by my organisation. Three more flights will be arriving on July 13 (Amritsar), July 19 (Chandigarh) and July 25 (Amritsar), respectively. Each flight costs around Rs40 lakh. We will keep on chartering planes till the last of the stranded men reach home, irrespective of the fact whether they are Punjabis or not. All 177 people who returned yesterday were made to undergo Covid tests at Dubai itself. Each test cost 40 Drihams (Rs800 approximately) and the total expenditure incurred by us totaled nearly Rs1.41 lakh,” said Oberoi.“In Dubai, when the lockdown was introduced, the construction sector was deemed to be a vital sector, exempting it from government restrictions. Construction sites were permitted to remain operational and workers continued to commute to and from the site, subject to obtaining a permit from the Dubai Municipality and the Permanent Committee for Labour Affairs. However, later, all activity was stopped as things on the Corona front got from bad to worse. Thousands of labourers were stripped off their jobs,” said Oberoi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/given-pink-slips-in-dubai-gurdaspur-boys-back-home-110481
09-07-2020||Avneet Kaur||Mission Fateh Punjab: Rules meant for common people only?||Jalandhar, July 8With the message of resilience, resolve and discipline to defeat the coronavirus and save Punjab, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, a month ago launched ‘Mission Fateh’. A large number of awareness drives were routinely carried out under the initiative by several political leaders, officials of the Municipal Corporations and district administrations, schools and colleges urging people to remain vigilant and follow social-distancing norms.Moreover, to ensure that people do not violate the directives of the Punjab Government and follow all norms, including wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, the Jalandhar Commissionerate on a daily basis have been issuing challans on willful defaulters.Two cases were registered at Choti Baradari here and one at Rama Mandi police station on Tuesday against those who failed to maintain social distancing during protests. Even today, a case was registered against an organisation for the same reason. Law is the same for everyone and is being applied in the same manner to all, — Arun Saini, DCP, HeadquartersThe district police till July 7 have issued 14,742 challans for not wearing masks and collected a fine worth Rs67.16 lakh from violators. Besides, a fine worth Rs2, 88,000 has been imposed on 144 people for violating social-distancing norms.But the question arises whether the ‘Mission Fateh’ is just for the common public? Are elected representatives, who seem to be the brand ambassadors of the programme, barred from following any of its directives? Why no check on the violations of social distancing during mask-distribution drives, political meets, protests, public work gatherings and among other such events?Recently, SAD leaders at Football Chowk held a protest against their alliance partner at the Centre and the Congress for increasing fuel prices, but social distancing was nowhere to be seen. Likewise, Congress leaders a few days ago held a protest against the Modi-led-BJP government outside the DC office for hiking fuel prices and on June 26 gathered at the War Memorial to pay tributes to the martyrs of Galwan Valley, but were found blatantly flouting social-distancing norms.Moreover, a huge protest was organised on Ladowali Road near the DC office by the activists of ‘Anti-Fascist Attacks Front’ and the road was completely jam-packed. Protesters in large numbers without giving a thought about social distancing were protesting against the ill-policies of the state and Central governments.ResidentspeakCall it fear of challans or scare of Covid-19, people, especially shopkeepers, are trying their best to ensure social distancing at their places. But if you visit government offices, social distancing is nowhere to be seen. Gaurav Arora, owner of a cosmetics shopMaintaining social distancing in a country like India is really tough. You go to a market and you’ll hardly see anyone maintaining distance. The CM, during his #AskCaptain programme, has been asking people to follow all norms, but his own party workers seem unaware of the dangers of Covid-19. Harbans Lal, a general store owner at Saidan GateOfficialspeak Yes, we failed to follow social distancing norms during some party meets and other events. But, we will make sure this doesn’t happen again and we appeal to our party workers as well as the public to be more cautious and follow all guidelines. Jagdish Raja, MayorWe try our best to maintain social distancing during awareness drives, political or non-political meets, but sometimes a lot of people join us and it becomes difficult to manage them. However, it’s been over three months since we are dealing with Covid-19, so people, including leaders, should understand the importance of wearing masks and physical distancing by now.

The case revolves around the counting of the petitioner’s ad hoc service for the purpose of seniority and other consequential benefits.As her petition came up for hearing before Justice Sudip Ahluwalia, the state counsel sought an adjournment. Fixing the case for July last week, Justice Ahluwalia made it clear that the opportunity for filing reply being granted was the last.Middha had moved the High Court last year seeking the quashing of an order dated September 21, 2018, passed by Punjab Secretary, Department of Higher Education, whereby she was denied the benefit of counting of ad hoc service for the purpose of seniority and other consequential benefits.Allowing her writ petition in November last year, Justice Arun Monga ordered the setting aside of the impugned order, while directing the respondents to count the period of ad hoc service rendered by the petitioner and accord her all consequential benefits arising there from”.Acting on another petition filed by Middha, the High Court earlier this month directed the Punjab Government to finalise the tentative seniority list of government college teachers. Justice Deepak Sibal also directed that promotion to the posts of principal, if any, would not be declared.Issuing notice of motion for July 22, Justice Sibal asserted: “In the meanwhile, the final decision taken in pursuance of the departmental promotion committee, if any, for promotion to the posts of principal shall be kept in a sealed cover. The respondent-state shall also finalise the tentative seniority list of the government college teachers circulated on May 15.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-ias-officer-submit-reply-or-appear-personally-110258

The funds expected from the Centre in the first quarter had not come, thus leaving the state government struggling to cope with the situation,he pointed out.On this, the Chief Minister said he would hold monthly review meetings to take stock of the fiscal situation in the state, taking into account the routine expenses, such as salaries, power subsidies, social welfare pensions, etc.Earlier, highlighting the grim fiscal situation prevailing in the state, Principal Secretary (Finance) KAP Sinha informed the Cabinet that the share of Central taxes for Punjab had gone down by 32 per cent. The grant-in-aid from the Centre for the March-June period showed an increase of 38 per cent, but that was mainly on account of GST receipt of Rs 3,070 crore in April, which included Rs 2,366.46 crore against the pending arrears for FY 2019-20.While the state’s own tax revenue fell by 51 per cent, the first quarter decline in the non-tax revenue stood at 68 per cent, the Finance Secretary informed the Cabinet, seeking more prudent measures to survive the current crisis.‘Need prudent steps’While the state’s own tax revenue fell by 51 per cent, the first quarter decline in the non-tax revenue stood at 68 per cent, the Finance Secretary informed the Cabinet, seeking more prudent measures to survive the current crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/revenue-dips-21-punjab-cm-calls-for-regular-review-110244

They have broken the vows taken at Akal Takht at the time of forming the SAD (Taksali),” he said. Terming Dhindsa’s move “technically invalid”, Brahmpura said the SAD was a registered party, which was led by Sukhbir Singh Badal. “Dhindsa’s claim of toppling Sukhbir and occupying the post of the SAD chief will not stand the legal test. I had volunteered to step down and offered him to lead the SAD (Taksali), but I didn’t have any inkling of what was cooking up. They kept me in the dark over the matter,” he said. Brahmpura said a party meeting would be scheduled shortly.Respect democracy, SAD tells rebel leaderChandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday asked rebel Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa to “respect democratic norms and abstain from making false claims, which would only lower his stature”, even as it castigated him for “humiliating” SAD (Taksali) president Ranjit Singh Brahmpura.

The prices of fuel in India were now among the highest in the world, he claimed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/quit-nda-over-hike-in-fuel-price-punjab-cm-dares-sukhbir-110251
