The youth Congress raised the issue of delay in fulfilling the party’s poll promise of distributing free smartphones to youths.Singh had on June 29 said his government would check the “involvement” of China in an Indian firm selected to deliver these smartphones.An official release quoting Singh said Tuesday, “The Chief Minister said the first batch of 50,000 smartphones had arrived from the company, which had now clarified that it had no connection with China.”These devices would be distributed first among Class 11 and 12 girl students of government schools, with priority to those who do not have smartphones so that their online learning can be facilitated during the coronavirus lockdown, the release said.Amid India-China border tensions, Singh had said on June 29, “We will check what is China’s involvement in this (company) and to what extent.

28-07-2020||New Delhi||On way to India, 5 Rafales re-fuelled mid-air by French tanker||On their way to India from France, five Rafale jets were refulled mid-air from a French tanker at a height of 30,000 feet, according to photos released on Tuesday by the Indian Embassy in France.The jets took off from the Merignac airbase in French port city of Bordeaux on Monday, and will be arriving in India on Wednesday afternoon after covering a distance of nearly 7,000 km.“Indian Air Force appreciates the support provided by French Air Force for our Rafale journey back home,” the IAF tweeted.On Monday evening, the Rafales landed at Al Dhafra airbase in the UAE after flying for over seven hours, officials said adding it was the only stopover by the jets while flying from France to India.“Few shots from 30,000 feet! Mid air refuelling of #RafaleJets on their way to #India,” the Indian Embassy in France tweeted along with a number of pictures of the jets being refuelled mid-air.The fleet, comprising three single-seater and two twin-seater aircraft, is arriving at Ambala airbase on Wednesday afternoon where they will be officially inducted into the IAF as part of its No 17 Squadron, also known as the ‘Golden Arrows’, said one of the officials.                            The aircraft are expected to significantly boost the IAF’s combat capabilities at a time when India is locked in a tense border row with China in eastern Ladakh.The IAF has already deployed all its frontline fighter jets in key airbases along the Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between India and China.India had inked a Rs 59,000 crore deal on September 23, 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets from French aerospace major Dassault Aviation.The first Rafale jet was handed over to the IAF in October last year during a visit to France by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.The first squadron of the Rafale jets will be stationed at Ambala air base.Official sources said the Rafale jets are likely to be deployed in the Ladakh sector as part of IAF’s efforts to enhance its operational capabilities along Line of Actual Control with China in view of the border row with the country.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.                Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.The Meteor is powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power for much longer than any other missile, said an official.The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop required infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.           Out of 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||40 Punjab police personnel, who beat COVID-19, offer to donate plasma||Responding to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's appeal, 40 Punjab Police personnel who recently recovered from Covid-19 have offered to donate their blood plasma to save the lives of others infected with the deadly virus, officials said on Tuesday.A majority of them are from Jalandhar (Rural), with Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal himself leading the way after recovering from the infection, said Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta, who has personally reached out to his convalescent officers and men to donate plasma after their mandatory two-week recovery period ends.Gupta said within 24 hours of the SSP Jalandhar Rural coming forward to commit to plasma donation, 40 other police personnel had also volunteered, followed by more.The blood plasma of two cops—Ram Lal and Lakhwinder Singh—has already been taken.All the 33 personnel recovered from Covid-19 in Jalandhar Rural had committed to plasma donation, said the DGP, adding that an increasing number of plasma donors were also coming in from the police department in other districts too.In Batala too, both the cops who have recovered have volunteered to donate plasma while in Gurdaspur, of the two personnel infected, one has recovered and has offered to give his plasma.Kapurthala has seen 10 of the 14 infected cops recovered and three of them are listed as volunteers while the remaining seven had to be excluded as they were found to have co-morbid conditions.Jalandhar (Rural) currently has seven active cases and Batala has four.A special link has been created by Punjab Police for volunteers to donate plasma to help out other patients who were struggling with the disease, said Gupta.He said a special campaign had been launched to create awareness among the cured police personnel to come out for this noble cause.With most of the volunteers asymptomatic, their inherent immunity was higher, according to experts.The DGP said with many other cops still under treatment for Covid-19, he expected to see more donors coming forward over the next few days.As of Tuesday, 831 Punjab Police personnel had tested Covid positive, of whom 336 had recovered.Of these 303 had recovered till about two weeks ago, indicating that the number of plasma donors could go up significantly in the next few days.Currently, the department has 495 active cases and as more and more cops get cured, the number of volunteers was expected to see a sharp rise, added Gupta.

28-07-2020||Satya Prakash||Negotiate SYL issue at political level, SC tells CMs of Punjab and Haryana||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 28The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Chief Ministers of Punjab and Haryana to attempt a negotiated settlement of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue that has defied any solution for decades despite several rounds of litigation.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said talks should be held between the two states at the highest political level.Stating that the Centre had been trying to facilitate talks between the two sides, Attorney General KK Venugopal requested the top court to give more time for the purpose.Punjab was represented by a team of lawyers led by senior advocate RS Suri while senior advocate Shyam Divan led the battery of lawyers who appeared on behalf of Haryana.The Bench, which wanted the two states to clearly tell it if they could solve it through negotiations or not, indicated the matter would be taken up in the third week of August.Punjab has been demanding a negotiated settlement between the two states with the help of the Centre while Haryana maintained it can’t be made to wait indefinitely despite having a decree in its favour.The Union Jal Shakti Ministry has already convened several meetings — attended by Chief Secretaries of the two states — which remained inconclusive.The Supreme Court had earlier told the Centre, Punjab and Haryana to conclude their talks on the construction of the SYL canal “as soon as it can be”. Else, it would proceed to decide the matter, it had said.At the root of the problem is the controversial 1981 water-sharing agreement after Haryana was carved out of Punjab in 1966. For effective allocation of water, the SYL canal was to be constructed and the two states were required to construct their portions within their territories.While Haryana constructed its portion of SYL canal, after the initial phase, Punjab stopped the work, leading to multiple cases.In 2004, the Congress government in Punjab came out with the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act to terminate the 1981 agreement and all other pacts relating to sharing waters of the Ravi and the Beas rivers.In 2002, the Supreme Court had decreed Haryana’s suit and ordered Punjab to honour its commitments on water sharing.Punjab filed an original suit that was rejected in 2004 by the Supreme Court which asked the Centre to take over the remaining infrastructure work of the SYL canal project.In November 2016, the Supreme Court had declared the law passed by the Punjab Assembly in 2004, terminating the SYL canal water-sharing agreement with neighbouring states, as unconstitutional. It had answered in the negative all four questions referred to it in a Presidential Reference.But in early 2017, Punjab returned the land — on which canal was to be constructed — to the landowners.The top court has said repeatedly it didn’t intend to revisit the facts and issues already adjudicated upon. The decree already passed has to be executed and it should not be treated as a paper decree, it had said.Haryana maintains that it cannot be made to wait long for construction of the canal. Any further delay in execution of the top court’s decree passed in 2002 would lead to people losing faith in the judicial system, it has said.On the other hand, Punjab says the decree was not executable and the state required time to argue its case. It has told the Supreme Court that the canal land returned to the landowners could not be recovered.Punjab has contended that there were difficulties in implementation of the court’s decree. The decree was premised on the fact that there was enough water in the river. But now there is not much water flow, making it impossible to give effect to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/negotiate-syl-issue-at-political-level-sc-tells-cms-of-punjab-and-haryana-119057

Working to the last of his reserves as a construction worker — as of now — Jora Singh, who is father to four children, is a man on a mission. His quest? A smart phone, which he wants to buy for his wards so they could study online.He has until now saved Rs 1,500 and has vowed to fight tooth and nail to save more for the cell, even if its a pre-owned one, which could cost him around Rs 4,500-Rs 5,000.Singh has three daughters and a son studying in Government School, Jhandi Peer, Kadiana, in Phillaur. His elder son, Simranjit Singh, wants to be a teacher, while daughters Navjot Kaur and Prabhjot Kaur aspire to join police. For the time being, they all are studying jointly with their cousin, who has a smartphone.“My son always tells me that he wanted to be a great teacher. But for that, he needs to get a good education. My son and daughters really enjoy going to school and their teacher is a good one,” he shares. But the pandemic has turned things on their head and most of education has gone online. “Because of online education, there is a need for the phone and I’ll arrange it for sure, no matter what,” a resolute Singh says.A resident of Kadiana village in Phillaur, he owns a small boat and ferries pilgrims from Ludhiana to Jahndi Peer – his means of livelihood for family for last 16 years. But past four months, after the outbreak reared it’s head, there has been no work. So, he had taken up construction work.At a time when meeting of basic needs is a much of task, the smartphone is almost like a distant star to him, Singh says, “Ghar da guzara vaise hi mushkil hai, te phone da te hor vi zyada aukha lagda (Already it’s a hard to subsist and in this situation purchasing a smartphone doesn’t seem a cakewalk).But this doesn’t sag his spirits for the single-minded goal. “Their education is my priority. I cannot see them suffer in their studies,” the father says.Jagjit Singh Randhawa, the school teacher, was all in praise for the former ferryman’s children. He said that all of these students are so obedient, intelligent and have a beautiful handwriting. “They have good general knowledge. If given opportunities, they will reach heights. Also, as per the guidelines of the Education Department, we are providing the students with every material, and are making sure that no student gets devoid of receiving education,” the teacher says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-father-works-hard-wants-a-smart-phone-for-kids-online-studies-118710

The road is frequently used by the Union Minister, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. It was constructed by the Public Works Department (PWD) at a cost of Rs 26 crore from the Central Road Fund.Harsimrat claimed that four stretches in her parliamentary constituency — the 25-km Bathinda-Ghudda-Badal road, 9.5-km Ratia-Sardulgarh road, 19.51-km Sardulgarh-Sirsa road and 18-km Nathana-Baghapurana road — were in a dilapidated state and needed immediate repairs.A PWD (B&R) official said the work on the road was listed under a central scheme in 2019-20, but they hadn’t received any update so far. During the SAD-BJP regime, Badal village was the only one in the state to have a four-lane road dotted by palm trees, solar lighting and an array of buildings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/road-to-badal-village-a-shadow-of-its-past-118772

Jiwanwal, Dhamia Kalan, Kullian, Badhan and Deval villages are the worst affected.OfficialspeakThe department has issued recovery notices and if any mining activity comes to the fore, the SDO can flag the issue. — Ajay Pandey, JE of mining departmentIn these villages, several people have given their farmland to crusher owners in the garb of levelling it. At many places, the gorges caused by mining are posing threat to the adjoining fields. Surinder Kaur, Sarpanch of Kullian village, said: “Seven acres of my land are adjoining one such illegal quarry, dug more than 60-feet deep. We have lost four kanals due to soil erosion. Four months ago, we filed a complaint. The BDO came and checked the ongoing mining and it stopped for a few days. But it has resumed now and no one listens to us.”Badhan village panch Jagdish Singh said: “Large-scale mining is being done in Jeewanwal village.”However, Sarpanch of Jeewanwal village, Kashmir Kaur, denies it. “Some mining was done a few years ago but not now. Some villagers have got their farmlands levelled and some stone/ soil has been lifted from there, nothing else,” Kashmir Kaur said.Khanan Roko Zameen Bachao Sangharsh Committee’s representative Dharminder Singh said: “Illegal mining is turning farmlands into rubble. At some places, the upper layer of soil has vanished and the white sand has come up. There are atleast nine such quarries in Hajipur-Talwara area of Mukerian subdivision, more than 50-70 feet deep, threatening to erode the adjoining farmlands.”Ajay Pandey, JE of the Mining Department, said only Taggar Kalan quarry was auctioned but it was not functional. The department has issued recovery notices and if any mining activity comes to the fore, the SDO can infrom the department about it.SDO Rajiv Kumar said: “The places which have been referred to as illegal mining are old quarries which have been auctioned 4-5 times. No unauthorised mining is going on.” Asked about the notices issued in the recent past, he said: “I don’t have the numbers but several notices were issued, some of them last week. I am in field and no mining is going on anywhere in the area today.”‘Farmlands turning into rubble’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mukerian-farmers-fret-over-illegal-mining-department-in-denial-118691

For Group ‘B’ employees, the allowance has been reduced from Rs 300 per month to Rs 175. For Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ staff, the allowance has been trimmed down from Rs 250 to Rs 150 per month.The new cellphone allowance package will be implemented from August 1. In October 2011, the state government had fixed cellphone allowance of 3.15 lakh employees, which used to cost around Rs 101 crore to the state exchequer.Prem Chawla, senior vice-president, Government School Teachers’ Union, said: “At a time when the state government is pressing schoolteachers and other employees to teach online and provide virtual services, the reduction in cellphone allowance is contrary to its position.”A senior official of the Finance Department said, “Cellphone tariffs have reduced drastically in the past three to four years. Many companies are offering voice call facility along with data and SMS service in a monthly pack ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 250 per month.”In the past five years, the department has not revised the allowance, but as the state battles cash crunch, it’s important to save every single penny, said the official.Cost-cutting||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cellphone-allowance-to-punjab-govt-staff-cut-by-50-118692
28-07-2020||Vishav Bharti||‘Fake’ police encounter that shook Punjab five decades ago||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 27On the morning of July 28, 1970, the Jalandhar police flashed the information that they had “successfully” averted a plot to assassinate some top political leaders. But the theory soon snowballed into a major controversy as the man who fell to police bullets the previous night was too old to fit into the plot.The man was Baba Bujha Singh, an 82-year-old freedom fighter-turned-Naxalite, who was allegedly picked up by the police at Nagar village near Phillaur and was killed in a fake encounter.Monday marks 50 years of the “controversial encounter”, the echo of which was heard in the Vidhan Sabha and even shook the conscience of poets.Bujha Singh, who hailed from Chak Maidas village near Banga, became active in the Ghadar Movement in 1930, along with Bhagat Singh’s uncle Ajit Singh and other prominent leaders. Since then, he remained active in the freedom movement and later formed the Kirti Party. When the British government banned the party, he, along with several other leaders, joined the Congress in the mid 1930s. In his later years, Bujha Singh remained active in the Communist movement and was the force behind establishing Desh Bhagat Yadgar Hall in Jalandhar.When the Naxalite movement started in the late 1960s, he joined them and would hold classes on Marxist philosophy for youngsters. “On July 27, 1970, he was on his way to a village near Phillaur on his bicycle to hold a class. He was unarmed and wasn’t even carrying a bag, just a few books wrapped in a khadi cloth. The cops apprehended him near Nagar village,” said Nawanshahr-based writer Ajmer Sidhu, author of the book Bujha Singh: An Untold Story.He said Bujha Singh was taken to the Banga Police Station, where he was tortured and killed. “Later, his body was thrown on a canal bridge near Nai Majra village in Nawanshahr and the theory of the encounter was floated.”However, people didn’t accept the police theory. The incident rattled the Vidhan Sabha too. As per the House proceedings, Communist leaders Satpal Dang and Dalip Singh Tapiala put the then government in dock.Later, a commission headed by Justice VM Tarkunde termed the encounter fake.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fake-police-encounter-that-shook-punjab-five-decades-ago-118693

The High Court has since then been hearing cases through video-conferencing.The matter has its genesis in a pending petition filed before the High Court last year by Jaswinder Singh against the Vidhan Sabha Secretariat and other respondents. Taking up the petition, Justice Augustine George Masih had stayed the petitioner’s demotion from the principal chief reporter’s post, while observing that Jaswinder Singh for the last 27 years had been shown senior to a private respondent.The High Court had also ordered that the petitioner’s demotion vide impugned order dated November 13, 2019, would remain stayed till the next date of hearing. Appearing on his behalf during the hearing of the contempt plea, senior counsel Patwalia submitted that the petitioner, to his utter shock, was demoted as chief reporter on March 4.Issuing a show-cause notice on the contempt petition, Justice Jaishree Thakur ruled that there was prima facie deliberate, intentional and flagrant violation of High Court order passed on January 7.As the case came up for resumed hearing this morning, Justice Sudhir Mittal recorded in his order that the contemnors were present in the court before accepting the unconditional apology submitted on behalf of the contemnors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/assembly-secretary-tenders-apology-118695

Patiently waiting for over an year for these works to start, repeatedly enquiring from the DC and various departments, but these works exist only on paper.”He had complained that the Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) had sanctioned various developmental works in his constituency and allotted Rs 13 crore, but these were “stalled” without informing him.Defying the claim, AIT’s Dinesh Bassi said: “I think Sidhu saheb seldom visits his constituency personally and relies more on the erroneous feedback he receives. I have mailed his office the status of development works of his constituency.”Following Sidhu’s complaint letter, Bassi was called by the Secretary, Local Bodies, to inquire about the projects going on in the Amritsar East constituency. He said works worth Rs 13 crore were executed with endorsement from the area councillors concerned.“I submitted the details about the extension of Bhandari Bridge with a parallel additional bridge, which is under progress. Similarly, the 9.5-m Vallah road overbridge is 40 per cent complete and the deadline has been set for March 2021. For the road under bridge project on Joda Phatak, the total payment of Rs 25.44 crore has already been made to the Railway Department. I have scheduled a meeting with the Railway Ministry shortly. The work on 22-No phatak, worth Rs 255.83 crore, is also being done. The only hitch is for another flyover on SSSS chowk, as the Archeological Survey of India has denied permission due to its close proximity to the historic Company Bagh,” Bassi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-civic-body-counters-navjot-singh-sidhus-claim-118698
28-07-2020||Tribune Reporters||Despite curbs, farmers hold statewide protest in Punjab||Chandigarh, July 27Farmers held tractor rallies across Punjab today to protest the three farm ordinances mooted by the BJP-led NDA government. They marched on their tractors, following social distancing norms, towards houses of SAD and BJP MLAs and ministers.The protest was held by 12 agrarian organisations under the aegis of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Committee.The farmers are upset with The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, which allows bypassing of the existing Agriculture Produce Market Committees and paves way for selling produce to private players outside the mandis. Farmers believe that this would encourage privatisation in mandis, putting them at the mercy of the corporates.Bathinda: Farmers, under the banner of BKU Ekta Ugrahan, protested outside the office of Union Minister and MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal today. Also, BKU (Krantikari) activists took out a tractor march outside the house of former minister Sikander Singh Maluka at Maluka village in the Rampura area of the district. Moga: Farm organisations began the tractor march from various locations in the city and culminated it outside the residence of Tota Singh, seeking a rollback of the farm ordinances and the Electricity Act. They said the SAD was a part of the Union Government, therefore, they were equally responsible for bringing these anti-farmer acts and ordinances.The farmers rejected the assurances of the Union Government that the MSP of crops would not be abolished. They alleged that Sukhbir Badal was misleading the farmers to save his wife’s berth in the Union Cabinet.Muktsar: As the police had sealed all entry points to Badal village, the farmers could not reach Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s residence to lodge their protest. Later, they handed over a memorandum to a delegation of SAD leaders, which had gone to meet them at Kheowali village.Patiala: The farmers opposed the Electricity Act brought by the Centre and demanded a rollback of the fuel price hike, besides opposing the three farm ordinances. In a release, the protesters said the ordinances were aimed at handing over procurement of crops to corporates.Mandi Ahmedgarh: Office-bearers and activists of 13 outfits held dharnas and rallies in the town. At some places, the protesters cared two hoots for the orders banning gathering of more than five persons. Kisan Morcha president Bikramjit Singh Cheema received memoranda and charters of demands from various places in the region.Sangrur: A tractor march was organised in the city as well. Bhupinder Longowal, state committee member of Kirti Kisan Union, led the protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/despite-curbs-farmers-hold-statewide-protest-in-punjab-118678

We will try our best for the construction of memorial at the earliest,” said Ramvir, DC.Since the end of the Kargil war in 1999, villagers have written many letters to the authorities for the construction of a memorial so that the coming generations come to know about the supreme sacrifice of Naik Bahadur Singh, but to no avail.After passing Class X in 1987, Bahadur Singh had joined the Army in 1988. He attained martyrdom in 1999.“Today a team of officials visited the local stadium, where we have demarcated the land for the construction of a memorial.

This happened even after the government had managed to break the monopoly, roped in three suppliers and bought the gypsum at almost half the price than previous year.Till date, only 3,000 metric tonnes of gypsum has been supplied. The state had placed an order to procure 25,000 metric tonnes of gypsum. A sum of Rs 5 crore had been advanced to the Punjab Agro Industries Corporation (PAIC) in March.Of 120 samples of the gypsum tested so far, 70 samples have failed as they had less than 70 per cent calcium sulphate. Most samples reportedly had 62 per cent to 64 per cent calcium sulphate. In some cases, it was as low as 40 per cent, said Sutantar Kumar Airi, Director, Agriculture.As a result, the state government has stopped all payments to the three suppliers. Further consignments of gypsum have been stopped.The PAIC officials said last year, gypsum was procured for Rs 6,700 per metric tonnes and there was only one supplier. “In order to break the monopoly, we selected three bidders to supply the material at Rs 3,700 per metric tonnes,” said a senior PAIC official.Till last year, gypsum was checked at the point of source, but this year onwards, we made it mandatory to check each consignment of gypsum, the PAIC official said.“As the material started arriving, random sampling was done by the Agriculture Department and the PAIC. We found the material substandard. We have not released any payment to the suppliers,” said Manjit Singh Brar, Managing Director, PAIC.He said they have asked the gypsum (with less than prescribed calcium sulphate limit) to be distributed free of cost to farmers.Gypsum is a source of calcium and sulphur. It improves acid soils and treats aluminium toxicity. Besides it improves soil structure, water infiltration and reduces run off and erosion of soil. Interestingly, it is used more in Amritsar, Barnala, Patiala and Sangrur, but it is required before sowing paddy.SACK OFFICIAL: SAD The SAD on Monday asked CM Capt Amarinder Singh to sack Joginder Singh Mann, chairman, Punjab Agro Corporation, and sought a probe into the gypsum scam. Former minister Sikandar Singh Maluka said the CM should get a case registered for supplying substandard gypsum at exorbitant rates and stop further payment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-agriculture-department-supplied-inferior-gypsum-probe-demanded-118680

They threatened our children of killing the families if they did not covert to Islam. Worse, they attacked our gurdwaras, kidnapped our daughters and killed many,” said septuagenarian Balwant Kaur while describing the sufferings at the hands of the Islamic forces in Afghanistan.‘Don’t have documents’ Along with several others, I ran away from Afghanistan four years ago. No one has got citizenship so far. The government needs many documents to process our case, but we do not have those. — Kuldeep Singh, Afghan returnee Hounded and persecuted for long yet putting up a brave fight for decades against the Islamic forces in Afghanistan, now Sikhs and Hindus want the Government of India to provide them citizenship immediately.On a day when the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) assured a delegation of Afghanistan Sikhs and Hindus led by Delhi Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (DSGMC) chief and ex-BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa of providing short-term visas to 600 more Sikhs and Hindus stuck in the war-ravaged country, those who have returned hoped that they would get Indian citizenship.Kuldeep Singh, whose nine family members, including a 14-year-old girl who was kidnapped earlier, returned on Sunday, said the Government of India had extended full assistance, but it was yet to provide them citizenship.Nine more relatives of Kuldeep landed in Delhi on Sunday. “The DSGMC is our saviour, but we don’t know how our kids will study and how we will earn our bread and butter here,” said Balwant Kaur.“In Afghanistan, we were practically staying indoors since our gurdwara was attacked on March 24 by terrorists. My two brothers were among those killed in a gunfire,” said Kuldeep Singh whose ancestors lived there for more than three centuries.Sirsa said the Sikhs and Hindus were living in appalling condition in Afghanistan. “Our government is helping the Afghanistan government in many ways, but it has failed to protect Indians,” he said.Sirsa along with the affected families met JP Singh, Joint Secretary, who is handling the Pakistan-Afghanistan desk in the MEA, on Monday.“We have been assured that India will issue visas to another 600 Hindu and Sikhs as soon as possible,” he said, adding that those left out would get it at the earliest after filing applications.He said the ministry had also assured to issue long-term visas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/back-from-afghanistan-sikhs-pin-hopes-on-getting-indian-citizenship-118681

The officials in the department said the admissions, this year, could be done on the basis of the recently declared Class XII result.Notification likely within a weekWe will hopefully issue the notification within a week. We have formed committees, and are looking for feedback on various issues cropping up regarding admissions. — Anurag Verma, Principal SecretaryThe is so, because the JEE-Main examination has been pushed far behind its schedule and there remains uncertainty on whether it would be held on stipulated dates between September 1 and 6, owing to the Covid-19 spread. All private universities, including Lovely Professional University, Chandigarh University and Chitkara University have already started their admissions on the basis of Class XII result. Even Thapar Institute has decided to go ahead Class XII result for admission to BTech courses, giving a little edge to those, who had appeared in the JEE-Main in January.This has caused panic among the Class XII (non-medical) passouts and their parents, who feel that they cannot be indecisive at this time and want to clinch a seat to be on the safe side. At the same time, even the state universities, government engineering colleges and the affiliated colleges, which have been seeing a fall in the BTech admissions in the past few years are pressing upon the government to take a final call on the admission criteria. They want the government to quickly release the notification for admission, so that the colleges could satisfy the students’ queries and start admission at the earliest.Anshu Kataria, chief, Punjab Unaided Colleges Association, and Chairman, Aryans Group of Colleges, said, “We are getting a lot of queries regarding BTech admissions, as there is a demand for engineering courses in Chandigarh.

The accused — Randip Singh alias Neela, Ranjit Singh alias Bhola, Baljit Singh, Nishan Singh and Narinder Sharma — were arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Punjab Police on July 4.The accused had pleaded before the court that they were innocent and the SIT charge was “highly improbable as there was no evidence against them to connect with the crime”.They pleaded that none of them was named in the FIR registered in June 2015. The case was handed over to the CBI, which, during its investigation, had arrested dera followers Shakti Singh, Sukhjinder Singh and Mohinder Pal Bittu in 2018. They were later granted bail by the Special CBI court on September 6, 2018. On July 4, 2019, the CBI submitted its final report in the court, declaring the case as untraced, they pleaded.However, pending the CBI court decision on the final report submitted by the CBI, the Punjab Government ordered a parallel investigation by the SIT, they claimed, adding that in its hasty investigation, the SIT mainly relied upon the confessional statement of Bittu. The latter had purportedly given his statement in a case of 2011 in Moga district. He had levelled accusations against many persons for their involvement in the sacrilege acts at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and Bargari villages in 2015. Bittu was killed in a Nabha jail last year.The public prosecutor, on behalf of the SIT, opposed the grant of bail to the accused. He said four more accused in this case were absconding. The court, however, observed that the judicial custody of the accused was not required. “Keeping them in jail is a burden on the public exchequer. Moreover, keeping in the mind prevailing situation due to Covid-19, it is not good to keep the accused behind bars for long as conclusion of the trial shall take sufficient time,” observed Suresh Kumar, Judicial Magistrate (First Class).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/arrested-in-sacrilege-case-5-dera-men-granted-bail-118686
