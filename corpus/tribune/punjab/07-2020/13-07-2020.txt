However, as per the CBI investigation, the accused had nothing to do with this case,” Singh told reporters here.“We are being victimised,” he said, alleging that the Dera followers could never think of indulging in sacrilege of the Sikhs’ holy book.The claims of Dera representatives came days after their sect head Gurmeet Ram Rahim and three others were named in a case relating to the theft of the Guru Granth Sahib. Dera chief was named in the case after the arrest of seven Dera followers.Gurmeet Ram Rahim was named as a conspirator by the Special Investigation Team of Punjab police, which was probing the 2015 sacrilege incidents.The case pertaining to the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of the Guru Granth Sahib from a Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara on June 1, 2015 was registered at the Bajakhana police station in Faridkot.Dera committee member Harcharan Singh on Monday claimed that ‘Sangat’ (Dera followers) had supported Shiromani Akali Dal in 2017 assembly polls.“We did not commit any sin. There is nothing to hide. We had supported the Akali Dal in 2017 (elections). We feel we are being targeted possibly for that (extending support to the Akali Dal) because the order and everything was to be done by the government of the day,” he said.To a question, he said Dera had supported the Congress in 2007 assembly polls.He said the Dera had been at the receiving end since 2007.“We had faced victimisation in 2007 by the then government and now by the government of the day,” he alleged.The dera chief, who is currently lodged in the Rohtak jail, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for raping two women.The Punjab police SIT has the mandate to probe three sacrilege cases. The cases are the theft of a “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara in Faridkot, putting up hand-written sacrilegious posters in Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on September 25 and recovery of torn pages of the holy book from Bargari on October 12, 2015 in Faridkot.The sacrilege of religious scriptures had taken place during the previous SAD-BJP regime. The Akali government had handed over the probe to the CBI.Amarinder Singh-led government withdrew these cases from the central investigating agency and gave it to the Punjab police SIT. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/being-targeted-for-supporting-akali-dal-in-2017-assembly-polls-dera-panel-112453

The potholed road also reflects badly on the district administration and the civic authorities. Besides, the road is encroached upon by parked vehicles, making commuting/driving along the road a risky affair. It seems that the authorities are hardly concerned to take serious note of the prevalent conditions.Pebbles, which have come off at places on the elevated road, make driving a dangerous affair, especially for those travelling on two wheelers. Owing to the pebbles scattered all over the elevated road, it becomes difficult for two-wheelers to stick to the road during driving.“This is the only stretch that leads the pilgrims and tourists coming from outside the city in their vehicles to the Saragarhi parking. The bad condition of the road exposes the apathetic attitude of the authorities concerned,” said Paramjit Singh, a daily visitor to the Golden Temple. “How can the authorities be so negligent and irresponsible,” he questioned.As per a rough estimate, over 1 lakh devotees and tourists, including foreign nationals, visit the Golden Temple daily. The road below the elevated one that also leads to the Golden Temple from the Ghee Mandi and Shera Wala Gate side is encroached upon by truckers and horse carts. Some time ago, there were big potholes on this stretch, but these have been filled by the authorities, said Sikander, a shopkeeper.There are also inadequate street lights on the elevated road and no one has ever seen any worker clearing the pebbles from the elevated road, said Gurinder, another resident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/potholes-on-road-leading-to-golden-temple-112166

Instead of using a table and chair to study or work, they rather prefer sitting on sofa, couch or bed in order to work amid the comforts of home.Dr Navjot Dahiya, a city-based Orthopedic Doctor, said, “With all the stay-at-home activities, our screen time has increased exponentially. Our online activities have also increased. But there is a dire need to understand its flip side. It is having a detrimental effect on our eyes and is also affecting our overall health.”He said making use of bed or sofa for a long time while watching TV, working or studying, weakens and tightens muscles, stiffening the back, shoulders and neck. The cases of cervical, backache and neck pain have increased manifolds these days, owing to the sedentary lifestyle of people.Tanishtha Kaura, a social media marketer, who has been working from home these days, said it has become difficult to handle work from home considering the impact it has on our health. “I developed severe back and neck pain after working from my bed and constantly looking down at the laptop for long hours.

However, farmers alleged that this was due to the lack of timely repair and cleaning of the river.‘CM must look into matter’ Farmers carried out the repair and cleaning work by pooling in money. We do not know where the sanctioned amount has been used. The CM should look into the matter. —  Narinder Singh, farmer“For the past more than three months, we have been meeting the authorities regarding the repair and strengthening of the Ghaggar, but to no avail. A few hours of rain has created a flood-like situation as there is erosion in around 50-ft embankment,” said Jasvir Singh Kudni, AAP Lehra halqa incharge.Sources said the government had sanctioned Rs 1.10 crore under MGNREGA for cleaning and strengthening of the river. The Punjab Drainage Department had sanctioned Rs 40 lakh for the purpose last week. However, area residents alleged that the sanctioned amount had been misappropriated by officials. Chetan Roy Gupta, SDO, Drainage Department, said a few farmers had laid pipes to drain out rainwater from their fields, but those pipes got blocked. “Due to this, when farmers released water, the pipes got damaged. Since these were laid beneath the embankment, it led to erosion in the area. We are working to prevent erosion, but farmers are adamant on releasing more water into the Ghaggar,” he said.Moonak SDM Suba Singh said they had stopped the release of water into the Ghaggar from the fields. “The situation is under control and our teams are working to plug in the eroded part,” he added.Poles uprooted in MuktsarMuktsar: High speed winds and rain in the past 24 hours led to uprooting of trees and electricity poles in the district. There were reports of a roof collapse as well. At Lubanianwali village, winds damaged solar panels. Numerous streets also got waterlogged.

It is an under-construction road and it caved in as we had not used proper material on it. — Pardeep Singla, SDO, PWD (NH)Bhinder Singh, a resident of the area, said: “When the road was being constructed, some area residents had asked the contractor to use proper material and also informed the officials concerned about the issue, but in vain. Now, after a short spell of rain last night, the road has caved in. The Chief Minister should order a high-level inquiry and get a case registered against all officials as they have misused government money”.Some other residents alleged that officials had not checked the quality of material used by the contractor. “A fatal accident could have taken place had it happened during normal days as it is a busy road.

But this issue was not of just people’s perception but that of completing the investigative and judicial process, they said.They alleged that the Modi government, by using the CBI to block a probe by the Punjab Police that had made a lot of progress in investigation and arrested those involved in the heinous crime, would only reinforce the public perception against the Badals. They further alleged that using the CBI was a “preposterous” attempt to save the Badals and revive their political fortunes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-using-cbi-to-protect-badals-cong-112139

The candidate gets an ‘ok’ message to know that the process has been completed. In case of any discrepancy in papers, he gets the message seeking a correction.Reacting to the situation arising due to reduced manpower in offices amid the Covid-19 crisis, the Punjab School Education Board and Education Department have attempted a major innovation by cutting on the number of dealing hands involved in the administrative process of selected activities.Following the introduction of the e-filing process recently, there has been a significant reduction in the time taken for completion of works. For example, it took not less than 30 working days for students to get the ‘second copy of certificate’. Under the revised guidelines, students are being issued these within three days.Process simplification has been introduced in 10 facilities of the PSEB and 15 of the Education Department.Earlier, the process for issuing the ‘second copy of certificate’ involved 37 steps. A candidate had to first download the form, get it attested from the school principal, submit the form and fee at the district sub-office, get the documents checked from the dealing manager, scan the fee receipt and the form before it went to the superintendent. The superintendent sent the form to the assistant secretary who forwarded it to the deputy secretary concerned. The papers came down to the student the same way they had gone up.Now, the candidate fills his form and fee online and sends it to the dealing manager, who completes the process. The candidate gets an ‘ok’ message to know that the process has been completed. In case of any discrepancy in papers, he gets the message seeking a correction. Similarly, the process for sanction of leave (49 steps), confirmation of probation (39 steps) and compassionate appointments (61 steps) has been reduced to just four steps. Providing ‘no objection certificate’, which earlier involved 42 steps, now takes just four.Secretary, School Education, Krishan Kumar said “For speedy disposal of intra-office work, the e-filing system has been introduced in all offices of the Secretary, DPE (Secondary Education), DPE (Elementary Education), Director General School Education and State Council of Educational Research and Training.” A senior official handling the system said, “There is an apprehension among officials of their seniors being left out of the clearance process. This could raise objections. However, there is a big section of employees who are happy with the online system. This will be helpful in allowing people to work from home. Also, each student or employee will be able to track the current status of his case online.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-covid-crisis-e-filing-system-comes-to-students-aid-in-punjab-112140

The government order said empanelled private hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 1,800 per day for bed in general ward, Rs 2,700 in high dependency unit, Rs 3,600 for ICU bed without ventilator and Rs 4,500 for ICU bed with ventilator.All empanelled private hospitals under the insurance scheme are mandated to provide cashless treatment to the beneficiaries of the scheme having severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)/Covid-19.The order also said the Covid-19 beneficiary patients were to be admitted under any of the packages listed under the scheme in accordance with the requirement of the patient. It is mandatory to upload Covid-19 test report while submitting online discharge of the patient on the TMS portal, failing which the claim of the package shall not be entertained by the insurance company.The state government, in exercise of the powers bestowed under Section 2 of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, has directed that no empanelled hospital under the scheme shall charge any amount in excess of what is prescribed in the scheme packages.The empanelled hospitals have been directed to ensure hassle-free cashless medical services to the beneficiary patients and facilitate their admission/treatment/discharge etc. without any delay or denial of services or charging any additional payment and without compromising on the standards of treatment or care of the patient.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-caps-covid-treatment-charges-112143

However, active surveillance and containment measures, including the implementation of the four Ts — tracing, tracking, testing and treating — coupled with isolation of positive patients and suspects, led to a fall in the number of new cases.On July 2, when 19 fresh cases were reported in Dera Baba Nanak, in addition to the one already tested positive, officials went into a tizzy. The situation was serious, with so many cases being reported for a town having a population of just 6,000.A high-level meeting of health and police officials was convened, where it was decided to close down the entire city. Batala SSP Opinderjit Singh Ghuman, Civil Surgeon Dr Kishen Chand and SDM Gursimran Singh Dhillon, too, were actively involved. About 1,000 tests were done by 10 teams during this period.

13-07-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Farm labourers’ debt up by 61 per cent in 30 years in Punjab: Study||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 12The amount of debt of an agricultural labour household in Punjab has increased by 61.36 per cent in the past 30 years.Most of the debt taken by agricultural labourers is from non-institutional sources, mainly because they do not have access to institutional sources of finance. These labourers are paying an interest of 20.6 per cent on these loans, taken from their respective landlords or employers. This interest rate is double the rate charged by the institutional sources of finance, such as banks (10.2 per cent).‘Money lenders charging double interest’The rate of interest charged by institutional sources of finance declined from 13.75 per cent to 10.2 per cent in the study period. The interest charged by private money lenders and landlords is as high as 20.6 per cent. — Sukhpal Singh, Agro-Economist from PAU, LudhianaThis vulnerability of farm labourers to financial exploitation and misery is pointed out in a study “Punjab’s Agricultural Labourers in Transition”, conducted by agro-economist Sukhpal Singh, from the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, and Shruti Bhogal, from Centres for International Projects Trust, New Delhi. The study, spanning three decades (from 1987-88 to 2018-19), is significant, considering high suicide rate among farm labourers.Sukhpal was among the handful of economists who had earlier recorded the suicides by farmers and farm labourers in Punjab because of high indebtedness. During 2000-18, of 7,300 suicides by farm labourers recorded in Punjab, 5,765 suicides (78.97 per cent) were because of high indebtedness. Among these, 14 per cent labourers were female, as compared to 8 per cent of women victims among farmers.The study points out how, in spite of the proportion of indebted households declining from 89 per cent (1986-87) to 81 per cent (2018-19), because of shift of workforce from farm to non-farm, the amount of debt increased from Rs 5,769 to Rs 10,096 per farm labourer household. It also points out that debt from non-institutional sources (mainly landlords or employers) has increased from 72.4 per cent in 1987-88, to 89.89 per cent in 2018-19.Sukhpal said: “Over the time, government intervention in providing financial and physical assistance through schemes like Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labourers Scheme and Training of Rural Youth for Self Employment, has declined, leading to their dependence on non-institutional sources of credit. The rate of interest charged by institutional sources of finance declined from 13.75 per cent to 10.2 per cent in the 30-year study period, and that charged by the private money lenders and landlords declined from 24.9 to 20.6 per cent. But it is still double than what is charged by banks.”Interestingly, the government has doubled the credit to the farm sector since 2005, but labourers are still deprived of loans from institutional sources. “This points to the vulnerability to financial exploitation and misery, which is vicious in nature. Loans taken by labourers are mainly for consumption purposes (food, daily expenses, health care and socio- religious celebrations). Though there has been a transition in labourers’ work — from farm to non-farm activities — these families could not come out of the debt trap,” the study says.The study also points out how a sizeable portion of farm labourer has shifted to non-farm activities between 1987-88 and 2018-19 (14.92 per cent towards industrial labour, 9.39 per cent to construction and 9.94 per cent towards shops).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-labourers-debt-up-by-61-per-cent-in-30-years-in-punjab-study-112147

The recoveries are significant because the banned items were found from two barracks where inmates in terror-related cases were lodged.A case was registered against 21 jail inmates, a majority of them facing charges under the Unlawful Activities and Explosives Act. The police are investigating how the alleged terrorists got access to the internet and mobiles, that too, smartphones.A joint search operation by the police and jail officials on July 9 led to the recovery of eight smartphones, four keypad phones, three internet dongles, two mobile batteries, seven earphones and 14 mobile chargers, which were hidden at various places inside and near the barracks by digging the floor or making gaps inside walls.Many of the inmates from whose barracks the mobiles were recovered were already on a fast demanding that the fellow inmates, who were transferred from the jail following intelligence inputs last month, be shifted back. “The inmates were shifted following specific inputs about their indulgence in unlawful activities from the prison. When they were shifted, their fellow mates resorted to a hunger strike,” said Jail Superintendent Ramandeep Bhangoo.Sources said many of these inmates were already in touch with their handlers. “Now, the question is to find out how such terrorists managed to smuggle, hide and use these phones from the high-security prison,” said a top official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mobile-seizures-from-nabha-jail-raise-alarm-112148

So, he had ordered not only to blacklist the firm for any future business but also freeze of bank guarantees and securities of Rs 10 lakh submitted to the board by the firm.Significantly, The Tribune had highlighted how a computer that should have cost just around Rs 40,000 in the market had been purchased for Rs 82,000. On several items, the supplier had charged 28 per cent GST against the prescribed rate of 18 per cent.Amit Gupta, owner of Amit Traders, said he was yet to receive any official intimation in this regard. “We have already been given a clean chit by the GST authorities.

The NGT order dated July 10 pertains to the illegal mining reported at Swarha, Baihara and Harsa Bela sites.The order comes in response to the report submitted by the Punjab state Mining Department to the NGT highlighting illegal mining at the sites under question. The order came in the wake of a complaint lodged by RTI activist Dinesh Chadha.Illegal mining till 2018 In November 2017, residents of Baihara village, accompanied by Dinesh Chadha, had lodged a complaint with the then Deputy Commissioner Gurneet Tej, alleging that a contractor was digging the riverbed using heavy machinery. On inspection, it was found that the riverbed was dug up 18 feet against the permissible 10 feet.In another inspection on February 8, 2018, at Swarha and Harsa Bela, senior officials, including then ADC Lakhmir Singh and Ropar SDM Ruhi Dugg, found that the riverbed was dug up 40 ft deep, but digging was also carried out outside the allotted quarry area.After Chadha moved the NGT in 2018 to seek action against the offenders, the tribunal asked a joint committee of the Central Pollution Control Board, Director (Mining) and the Punjab Pollution Control Board to take necessary measures to stop illegal mining.That time too the NGT had directed the committee to take action against the erring officials within two months, but nothing has been done in the matter till now.BOXIllegal mining till 2018Site Illegal diggingSwarha 91.4 lakh MTBaihara 32.6 lakh MTHarsa Bela 40,000 MT||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ngt-crackdown-on-illegal-mining-in-ropar-orders-rs-315-cr-recovery-112112
