However, there is a shortage of requisite staff for supervising these convicts.The paucity of staff is being felt more acutely since the Nabha jailbreak incident of November 27, 2016, and needs to be beefed up to check recurrence of such incidents, the Cabinet felt.The high-powered committee constituted to probe the Nabha jailbreak incident had also identified a shortage of staff in the jails as a major cause of the incident.Meanwhile, the Cabinet also approved the Annual Administrative Report of the Home Affairs & Justice Department for the year 2017.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/305-warders-to-be-recruited-directly-for-jails-through-punjab-police-recruitment-board-116425
22-07-2020||Chandigarh||GMADA land pooling policy made more attractive for residential sector: Punjab govt||To make the Land Pooling Policy more attractive for those giving up their property voluntarily for development projects, the Punjab Government has decided to give additional land as compensation to such persons, while coming out with a similar new policy for the industrial sector.The Punjab Cabinet led by the Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday approved an amendment to the Land Pooling Policy in respect of Residential Sector and its extension to theIndustrial Sector in the jurisdiction of the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA).The move comes as GMADA gets ready to acquire 1680 acres of land in the first phase for the development of the Aerotropolis estate. The policy change will also facilitate the development of industrial estate in Sectors 101 and 103 in SAS Nagar (Mohali) by easing the process of acquisition of land for timely execution of development projects.Under the amended Land Pooling Policy of GMADA,1000 Sq. yards of developed residential plots and 200 Sq. yards of a commercial plot, excluding parking, will be given instead of cash compensation for every 1 acre of land to be acquired from landowners for the upcoming Aerotropolis Residential Estate.Introduced for industrial sector development for the first time, the Land Pooling Policy will, in this case, provide that for every 1 acre of land, landowners will get 1100 Sq. yards of industrial plots and 200 Sq. yards of a developed commercial plot, excluding parking, instead of cash compensation.Further, as per the new policy, the validity of the ‘Sahuliyat Certificate’, given to the landowners opting for land pooling policy and providing certain benefits to them during the purchase of equivalent value of land, would be counted from the date of allotment of plot to the landowner. The earlier validity was 2 years from the date of announcement of the award. The certificate entitles a landowner to get an exemption from Stamp Duty, besides certain other benefits/privileges when he purchases agricultural land with the sale proceeds from the developed plots that he gets under land pooling.The move is in response to the demand of landowners that the validity be applied from the the date they are offered physical possession of the plots on the ground that only when basic infrastructure has been laid does a plot fetch its potential value.GMADA has acquired 4484 acres of land from 2001 to 2017. Of this, 2145 acres have been acquired, to date, through the land pooling policy which was introduced in the State in the year 2008 and amended from time to time.The rationale behind introducing the land pooling policy was to ensure prompt land acquisition and reduce the financial burden on GMADA, as the acquisition of land through cash compensation mode is fraught with the risk of enhancement of compensation by the courts apart from being a cumbersome and time-consuming process. GMADA is currently already facing the risk of paying enhanced compensation of nearly Rs. 9,700 crore as per the decisions of the first reference appeal in the courts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gmada-land-pooling-policy-made-more-attractive-for-residential-sector-punjab-govt-116422

In Ludhiana, the land has been identified near village Rampur and the acquisition through negotiation is in progress.No additional land requirement is envisaged for transmission network as alignment is to be along roads and right of way from the WTP to Overhead Service Reservoirs (OHSRs).The OHSRs/Under Ground Service Reservoirs (UGSRs) shall be constructed in the available public land belong to Municipal Corporation and other Government agencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-approves-world-bank-supported-us-286-million-canal-water-supply-project-for-amritsar-ludhiana-116419

It demanded immediate withdrawal of the decision.In a statement here, former minister Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said it was shocking that the Congress government had struck off 70,000 aged persons from the old-age pension list. He said the sole reason for doing this was that it did not want to increase the outlay under the scheme after raising the pension by Rs 200 per month.AAP core committee chief Principal Budh Ram and MLA Aman Arora said such decisions were untimely and absurd amid the pandemic. They said instead of increasing pension to Rs 2,500, the government was finding faults with the eligible pensioners. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/opposition-flays-pruning-of-pension-list-in-punjab-116055

The Bench also made it clear that such a direction had the capacity of putting their safety at risk.The assertion comes at a time when no less than 7,06,477 cases are pending before the subordinate courts in Punjab. Another 9,42,590 cases are awaiting decision before the lower court in Haryana and 51,491 in Chandigarh. It is suspected that many litigants in these cases are no more there to pursue their grievances. When some of these cases are suddenly listed, the counsels are often at a loss in the absence of complete records or instructions.Even though the HC has been making concerted efforts to bring down the pendency before it and the lower courts, the number of cases has been piling up progressively. With the Covid lockdown and shortage of judges, the pendency is unlikely to come down easily.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-cant-direct-expeditious-hearing-amid-pandemic-116056

The other group, which had tried to enter the village from Kheowali side, was first stopped at the entrance of the village, but later they too managed to sneak in. A number of Youth Akali Dal (YAD) workers stood guard outside the SAD president’s house.The protesters also clashed with the police. Some of them sustained injuries. The protest lasted for nearly six hours. They relented only after a delegation of six farmers was allowed to meet Sukhbir and Harsimrat at their camp office.Sukhbir even met the protesters outside his residence and offered to lead a delegation of farm organisations to seek any clarification needed by them on the ordinances from Union Agriculture Minister NS Tomar.He told them that the SAD would stand by the farmers and never allow tinkering with the MSP regime or assured marketing of foodgrain.Jaswinder Singh, vice-president, Punjab Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, said: “The anti-farmer ordinances must be scrapped as soon as possible. We came here today to lodge our protest against the Union Government and to show our resentment to the local MPs. The SAD has always claimed to be a party of farmers, but its support to the ordinances has exposed the real face of the party leadership.”A senior police officer said a case would be registered against the protesters for violating the social distancing and other safety norms in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Earlier on Monday, the Malout (City) police had booked some farmers for allegedly lodging a protest on tractors in the town.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-clash-with-cops-outside-badals-house-116128
