25-10-2020||Ottawa||Turbaned Sikh among 8 Indo-Canadian winners in British Columbia assembly polls||Eight Indo-Canadians, including a turbaned Sikh, have won elections in Canada’s British Columbia province as the ruling New Democratic Party (NDP) returned to power with a majority in the snap polls.The NDP, led by Jagmeet Singh, the first Indo-Canadian to lead a major federal party in Canada, increased its 41-seat minority into a 55-seat majority in the 87-member assembly, according to preliminary results on Saturday night, which did not include more than 5,00,000 mail-in ballots.It is the largest NDP victory in British Columbia history, the Vancouver Sun newspaper reported.Also read: 8 Punjabi-origin NRIs elected to British Columbia Assembly in Canada“While we wait for that final count to happen, I want to assure people that I’m going to keep the focus right where it belongs — on helping people get through this pandemic and making sure that they have the services that they need,” Premier John Horgan, who had called a snap election during the COVID-19 pandemic, said while addressing a victory rally in Vancouver.Aman Singh, a turbaned Sikh, defeated Jas Johal of the opposition Liberal Party in Richmond-Queensborough.“Thank you to the amazing residents of Richmond-Queensborough, with whom I was able to connect with during this campaign. It has been a true honour to stand before you and hear about the issues impacting you and your families. I’m grateful to the team of volunteers who helped our team effort,” Singh tweeted.Other prominent Indo-Canadian winners are Deputy Speaker Raj Chouhan, Labour Minister Harry Bains, Jagrup Brar and Ravi Kahlon. All are from the ruling party.Three Indo-Canadian women — former minister Jinny Sims, Niki Sharma and Rachna Singh — all from the ruling NDP — emerged winners in the polls.“I thank you to all volunteers and everyone who have worked so hard to make my campaign possible. Thank you for your support, phone calls, donations and all the kind messages. I have met so many local residents — listening to many stories and learning about what matters to you,” tweeted Chouhan, who secured victory in the Burnaby-Edmonds constituency.Bains, who won from Surrey Newton, also thanked people for his victory in the elections.“So incredibly grateful, humbled, and honoured — thank you to the amazing constituents of Surrey-Newton for trusting me to be your MLA and to all of my friends and family for their unwavering support — we’ll keep BC moving forward for everyone!” he tweeted.Sims, who served as minister of citizens services in Horgan’s government but resigned in October 2019, defeated her fellow Punjabi Dr Gulzar Cheema. Sims, who emigrated to England from Punjab at the age of nine, and her husband moved to Canada in 1975.“Congratulations and thank you to all who ran for office and to all who voted. Special shout out to all our volunteers. My heartfelt thanks to my constituents in Surrey Panorama,” she tweeted.NDP leaders Kahlon and Brar won from Delta North and Surrey-Fleetwood constituency, respectively.

25-10-2020||Amritsar||SGPC gets Sikh activists booked after clash inside Golden Temple complex that left 15 injured||Amid allegations and counter allegations, a day after the clash between the SGPC task force and members of Sikh organisations protesting over missing saroops inside the Golden Temple complex, the SGPC has got registered an FIR against 50-60 Sikh activists.Following this altercation that left at least 15 persons from both the sides injured, protestors were disbursed and the site of protest, opposite to Teja Singh Samundri Hall, was barricaded amid heavy deployment of police in plain clothes.This was the second brawl between the protesting Sikhs and the SGPC task force. On September 15, an ugly clash had occurred when some Sikh activists and Nihang organisations which were to join the agitation outside Teja Singh Samundri Hall were intercepted by the SGPC task force.Declaring to put a ‘blanket ban’ on holding any protest inside the Golden Temple complex in future, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal blamed that it had happened under the patronage of Congress leadership which intend to vitiate the atmosphere.He said that armed with kirpan and sticks, they attacked our staff members, including a ‘dharmi fauji’ and Sukhdev Singh Bhoora Kuna, additional secretary, and damaged his vehicle.Those booked under Section 307,452, 148,149 of the IPC included Sukhjit Singh Khosa, Dilbagh Singh, Manjit Singh Jhabbal , Baljit Singh Muchhal,  Manjit Kaur, Lakhbir Singh and 50 others.These were the members of various Sikh outfits, including Guru Granth Sahib Satkar Committee, staged sit-in outside Teja Singh Samundri Hall since September 14.Terming it as a ‘biased’ action, Balbir Singh Muchchal, head of satkar committee, said that the SGPC management has manipulated the clash episode in its favour, yet they would continue to contest the SGPC for concealing the whereabouts of missing 328 saroops.“The police took no time to lodge FIR against us, but never bothered to reach our members who were lying injured in the hospital,” said Muchchal.On the other hand, Longowal blamed that some of them attempted to disrupt the traditional ‘maryada’ of Golden Temple, loitered in Shrine complex in inebriated condition, locked the entrance gates of Teja Singh Samundri Hall. He believed that the satkar committee members were patronised by Congress to divert the attention from the farmers’ protest against farm laws.“Ever since these so called Sikh sympathisers sat on protest, SGPC has been providing them ‘langar’ and spared rooms to accommodate them. Our officials also initiated talks with them several times, but they never inclined to reach any conclusion and had repeatedly been indulging in brawl with our staff members and officials,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-gets-sikh-activists-booked-after-clash-inside-golden-temple-complex-that-left-15-injured-160998
25-10-2020||Patiala||Punjab govt acted swiftly in Hoshiarpur case in contrast to UP govt in Hathras incident: Amarinder Singh||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday asserted that his government had taken swift action in the Hoshiarpur rape-murder case in sharp contrast to the Uttar Pradesh government's response to the Hathras incident.He said the challan in this case will be presented in court this week.The chief minister pointed out that prompt action had been taken by the Punjab Police and the accused had been caught without delay, unlike in the Hathras incident."That was why Rahul Gandhi had to rush to Hathras, to secure justice for the victim's family, and did not need to visit Hoshiarpur," he said while interacting informally with media persons here.On Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's remarks on "selective outrage", he reiterated that had the Punjab government or police failed to respond with swiftness in the Hoshiarpur case, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and others would have reacted the same way as they did in the case of Hathras.The CM on Saturday had hit out at BJP leaders Nirmala Sitharaman and Prakash Javadekar for their comments over the Hoshiarpur rape-murder case, dubbing their remarks as "political puffery" with no substance or basis to support their criticism.The BJP had attacked the Congress on Saturday over alleged rape and killing of a six-year-old girl in Hoshiarpur, as it asked opposition party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra why had they not paid a visit to the family of the victim yet.A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire. Her half-burnt body was found at a house in a village in Tanda in Hoshiarpur on Wednesday.Gurpreet Singh and his grandfather Surjit Singh were arrested on charges of murder, rape and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, police had said on Thursday.Replying to a question, the CM denied that Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu has been sidelined in Punjab Congress.On the Enforcement Department (ED) summoning his son Raninder Singh in an alleged foreign exchange violations case, Amarinder Singh said it was not the first time the agency had issued summons to his family.Ridiculing the Akali allegations of him being hand in glove with the central government on the farm laws issue, the chief minister said "everyone knows who is colluding with whom"."It is the Akalis who are mixed up with the BJP, they quit NDA under pressure but are still working together," he alleged.Bathinda MP Harsimrat Badal was "clearly involved" in the introduction of the "anti-farmer" ordinances and was a cabinet minister at the time these were brought in by the Union government."What did the Akalis do? My government brought the resolution/bills in Vidhan Sabha to reject the central laws," he added.Pointing out that the fight was with the central government, Amarinder Singh reiterated his appeal to the farmers to stage 'dharnas' in Delhi and not in Punjab, where economic activity was being threatened by their blockade.His ministers were in talks with farmer unions to resolve the problem, he said, pointing to the fact that only one day's coal stocks and 10 per cent urea were available with the state.The option to buy power from the national grid did not exist since the state had no money, he said.To a question on the status of resolutions on farm laws in other states, the CM said there were 11 non-BJP state governments in the country and the Congress was in power in four states.All Congress governments would move similar resolutions against the central rules, he said, expressing hope that other non-BJP governments like that of West Bengal would also follow suit.On the 2018 Dussehra rail tragedy in Amritsar, Amarinder Singh said his government had provided immediate monetary relief but the matter now rested with the Railways, who would be giving the remaining relief to the victims and their families.To a question on the financial crisis in Punjabi University, the chief minister said the previous regime had indulged in haphazard recruitment, but assured that his government will find solutions.

25-10-2020||Jasvinder Kaur||When kameez got a collar: Trends from colonial Punjab||During the entire British period, the traditional dress of women in Punjab did not undergo many changes. Their ensemble of salwar, kameez and dupatta — commonly called ‘suit’— saw little structural changes during this period. As men had a closer interaction with their European rulers, their dressing style was influenced by them. Women, on the other hand, practised purdah and therefore had limited interaction with the outside world. Due to this practice their dressing style, by and large, did not change much.However, European influences did bring in some changes like the fusion of several western elements into women’s traditional clothes, the manner of tying a saree, and above all, the use of cosmetics and accessories. This is evident in old photographs of that period. At first glance, Punjabi women did look dressed in their traditional clothes. However, a closer look will reveal the presence of quite a few Western elements in many garments and accessories supplementing the basic Indian dress, mostly in upper-class women.Borrowing from men’s clothesIn Europe, women’s dressing as well as their lifestyle had changed dramatically after World War I. Women had to lead more active lives, filling in the jobs that had once been the domain of men. This necessitated a new way of dressing that gave them the comfort and freedom to perform these new jobs with ease. Many women began wearing clothes similar to those worn by men.In this post-war period, military influences were evident in the cut and colour of women’s garments. Jackets, waistcoats, ties, military collars, cuffs and boots became part of their wardrobes. According to newspapers of the era, it was difficult to make out the difference between men and women as they seemed to have similar silhouettes. Famous designer Coco Chanel, in the early part of her career in the 1920s, rode on this trend — as well as gave impetus to it. She started designing comfortable clothes for women that were inspired by menswear. One of her well-known outfits was based on the Englishman’s tweed suit.Punjabi women’s clothes were also impacted by western styles as they also started adding collars and cuffs, found in men’s shirts, to their kameez/kurtas. Some district gazetteers mention women using European-style collars and cuffs on ordinary kurtas. Even the back of the kameez was now being styled like men’s shirt with a cross-back and a pleat below the collar. This style remained popular throughout Punjab till shortly after Independence. Even when its popularity waned, older women continued to wear this style for a long time.However, this style has survived in Haryana (part of undivided Punjab) and Western UP. One can spot this trend in a recent Hindi film Saand Ki Aankh where Haryanvi women are seen wearing short shirts with men-style collars and cuffs. This style is also evident in old photographs and was replicated even in formal wear.Vaskat or waistcoatA garment like the men’s waistcoat entered Punjabi women’s wardrobe around the end of 19th century. This was called the vaskat. The 1888-89 Gazetteer of Ludhiana district mentions that Jat women wore kurtas with a waistcoat as was worn by men. This was worn over their kurta or kameez with a dupatta draped over it. It became part of their formal attire worn at fairs and festive events. The word vaskat itself was a distortion of the word waistcoat, similar to English waistcoat.The waistcoat had evolved in men’s dress by the early 20th century. The man behind evolution of its finer details was Prince Albert of Wales (later King Edward VII), who also brought changes in men’s fashion that are evident even today. Being a trendsetter, his wardrobe was copied all over the world. When Bertie (as he was known), went on vacation, tailors from all over Europe followed him, making notes and taking pictures. Edward decided to alter the waistcoat by lowering its height to reveal more shirt-front. Some say the change was done as the earlier version was more prone to food stains while some claim it was less constricting for the prince as he felt bloated during a meal and undid the bottom button of the waistcoat. This norm is followed till today.Vaskat had many similarities to its parent garment — the waistcoat. The U-shaped neck, plain straight back, pointed lapels, use of European-style buttons — are all indicative of its origin. Some of these even had turned-over pockets like the men’s overcoats worn in England.Cosmetics and accessoriesThe lifestyle changes that took place in Europe in the 1920s encouraged women to come out to work, as well as socialise. With the freedom to dress also came the freedom to use cosmetics, earlier associated with women of ill repute.A container of Coty’s loose powder and (right) surme daani and surmchu. photosby the writerCosmetics became popular in Europe. Lipstick, contained in a round, metal tube, had been invented in 1915. Commonly called ‘make-up’, cosmetics now became essential for a woman’s appearance. Hollywood movies of the 1920s and 1930s feature women carrying a distinctive look: red cupid-bow lips, dark rouge on the cheeks, kohl-rimmed eyes, plucked eyebrows, and wavy hair, generally with a shingle bob cut. They had typical mask-like appearance, achieved by using loose powder on the face.During that time, hardly any women in rural Punjab used western cosmetics. These were neither available nor affordable. However, there were some traditional ingredients that could give similar results. Bark of Sakk tree (walnut tree) came in bags from the hills. Chewed upon for dental health and hygiene, it would also leave behind a bright orange lip stain, giving the appearance of lipstick. Women, both rural and urban, commonly used this more for cosmetic purposes than dental hygiene. There were surma and kajal for the eyes. Surma was available in rock form (galena stone) even in small village shops. Ground twice after soaking in gulab jal (rose water), it was then applied inside the eyelids with the help of a surmchu , a kind of a large, blunt needle, part of surme-daani (container in which surma was kept). Kajal was the soot gathered from the flame of the diya (wick-flame lamp). A drop of desi ghee or butter was used to moisten it and make it into paste/kajal. It was then applied on the outside of eyelids as well as on the eyelashes. Besides these, henna paste was used as a mask for hair, either for colour, tinting or as a conditioner.As some stylish, upper-class women in Punjab, who followed European trends, took to using make-up, cosmetics started becoming available in bigger towns. Use of loose face powder became quite popular in early 20th-century Europe. Coty, a beauty products company, became popular and its loose powder was widely available in Punjab. It came in a round, small cardboard box with a ‘Made in England’ stamp at the back. Whether women used any other cosmetics or not, they did use the face powder and Coty’s face powder became a must for almost every urban woman. Other make-up products, as well as perfumes, became available in Punjab to a limited extent, and were advertised by shops in newspapers and magazines.Many publications started publishing tips on how to use make-up. Sister Susie, in 1935, wrote about using mascara, lipstick, rouge and nail polish. Women at that time were not cosmetic conscious.Along with make-up, wealthy women of Punjab also became aware of the latest hair grooming trends. Curling was as popular in Punjab as it was in Europe, and women used curling irons to create waves in their hair, a popular style in Europe of the 1920s and 1930s. This wavy style is evident in many photographs of the period, even if the women’s heads are covered, as was the norm in Punjab. There were shops in Lahore and Amritsar selling curling irons, and they often advertised them in magazines and newspapers like The Tribune.Photographs of Punjabi women from the 1920s and 1930s show them wearing mostly Indian clothes, but with some western accessories. The most common and visible of these accessories was the brooch. The typical image of a woman from a well-to-do family has her with a covered head, wavy hair, and wearing a saree or a dupatta, held in place at the shoulder with a brooch.After Independence, women’s dressing style changed as many of the above-mentioned styles faded away. However, as availability of things increased, more and more people started using cosmetics. It has become a huge multi-billion dollar industry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/when-kameez-got-a-collar-trends-from-colonial-punjab-160868
25-10-2020||Until quite recently||The little-known artists from region||— WG Archer, Paintings of the Sikhs. 1966Historians of art have generally evaded coming to terms with painting in the nineteenth century Punjab: they have drawn near to it but, almost as if they were examining a thorny branch, touched it gingerly. No serious student of Indian art has been able entirely to ignore it and yet a close look at it has frequently been cast with reluctance, if not distaste.— Oriental Art, Spring 1969I was not exactly looking for it — it just turned up in the sheaf of images I keep ferreting away somewhere in my folders — but it did two things, this sketch. It brought a quick smile to my lips, and, at the same time, introduced me to a Punjabi ‘artist’ whose name seems to have got lost in the whorls of time. It was a sketch, recording/celebrating? virtually the first coming of railways to our part of the world, somewhere in the early sixties of the 19th century, and the painter/draugtsman seems to have drawn it — on a sheet picked up from a discarded sarkari register perhaps — at the asking of a lithographic press, the Chashma-e Noor, at Amritsar. In the lower part of the sketch is a complete scene: at the extreme left three persons, one of them a Muslim, at the ticket window, with a large clock on the wall dutifully recording the time as 12.50; the train having just steamed away, two and a half carriages are seen, one of them occupied completely by women — a zenana dibba, to be sure — but all desis, with the words, in English letters, ‘THRD CLASS’ — the artist evidently not being on good terms with vowels — and, in Urdu letters, ‘darjasoyam’, meaning ‘Third Class’, emblazoned outside. In another carriage are seen hatted gentlemen — British or Anglicised — the three sporting superior airs. Right in front of course is the engine, the driver, a hatted figure, busy at work, obviously employed by Northern Railways, for the words ‘NR’ are painted on the door of his cubicle. However, the ‘artist’ does not forget to claim credit, and adds — clearly establishing his knowledge of English — the words ‘HURNAM SINGH’: his own name. Sadly, we — at least I — am not aware of any other work by this artist. But it would have been nice, considering the delightful vignette that he boldly brings in at the top of the sketch: a rag-tag party of four musicians and three soldiers following their leader, an English ‘sahib’ on horseback with a whip, which looks more like a morchhal than a whip, hurrying, having perhaps just performed with elan the ceremonial task of celebrating the arrival of railways.One would be entitled to wonder where all this is leading, if anywhere, especially when I open with what many would be inclined to dismiss as a negligible work of art. It is not that I am unaware, as far as the plains of the Punjab are concerned, of more substantial names — apart of course from those of painters from the Punjab Hills, Pahari in other words, who were working at different courts including that of Lahore or in the Malwa states, or, again, artists from Jaipur/Alwar working at Patiala — who were active in the 19thcentury. But I am greatly interested in seeing if we are missing out on some names. To that purpose, I am aiming at exploring collections, in the hope of making some discoveries.Private collection.I am encouraged in this endeavour by the initial flush of success I have had, while working with the great collection of paintings in the Chandigarh Museum. There are, for instance, two Punjab portraits here, each quite accomplished, of personages that one surely does not know much about: one, a simply dressed elderly Sikh of gentle bearing, sitting cross-legged, hands resting in lap, on a finely woven durrie spread out in front of a half-open door. There is a gravity of air about the figure, reflectiveness written all over it, and the colouring — shades of brown — deftly handled. On verso is a pencilled note in English, identifying the person as “Chaudri Sadhu Singh, Member MC (?) Jhang” — Jhang being the name of a town and district now in Pakistan, and associated in the Punjabi mind with the immortal love story of ‘Heer’ — and stating that is is “by Pir Bakhsh of Jhang”. Interestingly, there is another portrait by Pir Bakhsh also in the collection: a fierce looking person identified by the pencilled inscription at the back as ‘Nawab Mohammed Ismaeel Khan Tial’. Not having ever heard of Pir Bakhsh, I searched for him only to discover that he was also a painter of monuments, and in the collection of the V&A Museum in London, there is an attractive study of the Mausoleum of Hazrat Burhan Shah at Chiniot, that town having been once a tehsil headquarters of the district of Jhang. More than this we do not know anything, at least at the moment, about Pir Bakhsh.Nor do we seem to know much about the painter ‘Ganga Ram’ who seems to have been active at Patiala or some Phulkian state in the 19th century. There is a portrait by him of ‘Hakim Sadr Din’ — Sadruddin surely — : a noble-looking figure seated in a chair who, judging from the finely designed chogha he wears and the expensive looking carpet on which the chair is placed, might well have been a royal physician, and thus part of high nobility attached to a court. Patiala perhaps? The figure is clearly identified by an inscription in Gurmukhi on the top margin which says it is a ‘tasveer’ baqalam — that is in the hand of — Ganga Ram. More about the painter we do not seem to know.Finally, it is time to turn attention — in this very collection — to the engaging work of Sardul Singh whom one knows a bit about, as being the son of Kapur Singh, well-known painter, and thus grandson of the celebrated Kishan Singh. Active around 1900, Sardul Singh — based as a painter and photographer in Amritsar — turned out series on the lives and deeds of the great Sikh gurus. Of uncommon interest is a folio in the collection — painted in the style that we easily associate with 19th century Punjab — showing how the Janamsakhi of Bhai Bala came to be written. Bhai Bala is seen narrating the events of Guru Nanak Dev’s life to Guru Angad, while, seated in a corner, Baba Buddha ji, is reducing everything to writing. Boldly lettered inscriptions in Gurmukhi describe everything, including the painter’s name who speaks of himself as the ‘das’ — humble servant — of the great Gurus.As for my endeavours, not too bad for a beginning?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/the-little-known-artists-from-region-160869
25-10-2020||Sarika Sharma||In support of farmers, theatre of protest||In the last three weeks, Ludhiana-based Harkesh Chaudhary has taken his play to 25 locations across Punjab. From Jagraon railway station to Sudhar toll plaza, from Romana Albel Singh near Jaito to Mehal Kalan in Barnala, Rampura Phul and Lehra Bega in Bathinda, Bareta in Mansa, Ferozepur Cantt, among others. His hour-long play Utthan da Vela, which translates as ‘Time to Rise’, is his way of showing solidarity with Punjab farmers, protesting against Centre’s farm laws. And not just him, there are several theatre groups, big and small, which have come up with productions on farmers’ issues.The venues are the least ideal — railway stations, petrol pumps and toll plazas. The stage is as basic as it could get. But that doesn’t deter these theatre actors and directors who know their art is not, and cannot be, for art’s sake alone today. The idea is to entertain the protesters, often running into several thousands, but never entertainment alone. They identify with the cause of their audience — colourful and spirited.Amritsar-based Kewal Dhaliwal’s Manch Rangmanch has revived Joginder Baharla’s Punjabi opera Harian Saunnian and has been performing it at toll plazas and petrol pumps across Bathinda, Barnala, Sangrur and Mansa districts. A member of Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA), Bahrala had written the play in 1950. Seventy years later, it is as relevant. Based on a conversation between the crops and the farmers, where the crops wonder why does the farmer, who works so hard to make them grow and fruit, remain poor. The message of the half-an-hour show is simple: “Our fields. Our crop. Our soil. We sow. Our right.” An opera, the production has been appreciated by the audience, says Dhaliwal. “It is a colourful play, full of dance and song. It makes an immediate connect with people who feel so happy their lives are being understood that they shower Rs10 notes on us.”The energy at the protest sites is the greatest reward, says Satpal Banga from Patiala-based People’s Art. “People cry, raise slogans, applaud,” he says. Banga has revived Gursharan Singh’s 1980 play Eh Zameen Saaddi Hai. Originally written against the Punjab government’s decision to take away the barren land small farmers had been cultivating for years, it has now been tweaked as per the present times. However, a play isn’t where their activism ends. Banga’s team has been going to villages, speaking to people and telling them why the farmers and farm organisations are opposing the laws.Activism in theatre is what the late thespian Gursharan Singh, the man who inspires various theatrepersons spread across Punjab today, practised. This is why it isn’t surprising that he is often evoked at the protest sites.Amolak Singh, president of Punjab Lok Sabhyacharak (PULS) Manch, says this is the ideal coming together of theatre, people and farming community. “Artistes are performing at around 120 protest sites and each is alive with art and activism. This is something that has happened after a long time,” he says.Play list||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-support-of-farmers-theatre-of-protest-160871
25-10-2020||Nonika Singh||Reflection of Mira Nair’s Punjabiyat||Internationally feted, New York-based filmmaker Mira Nair right now riding on the buzz generated by her BBC series A Suitable Boy, currently streaming on Netflix, is a true blue Punjabi. She laughs easily, doesn’t take herself too seriously or her work pompously, loves Urdu ghazals and Punjabi folk music and is an eternal optimist. Even in the face of adversity, she looks at the upside rather than the downswing. Currently busy creating a biopic on renowned artist Amrita Sher-Gil, in a freewheeling interaction, the filmmaker, who has given us some timeless cinema from Salaam Bombay to The Namesake to The Reluctant Fundamentalist, talks about how beyond aesthetics, beauty and emotions, her cinema is about life.If you think she deliberately sets out to adapt literary works, she says, “I don’t have a checklist of books which I hope to or intend to adapt. Even though right now I am sitting in my library, it isn’t as if I am going to make a movie out of each one. The Namesake was like a solace to me after I had buried my mother-in-law in New York and could instantly relate to Jhumpa Lahiri’s longing and yearning of immigrants.” Similarly, Mohsin Hamid’s The Reluctant Fundamentalist spoke to her for having been married into a Muslim family she could instantly empathise with the outsider tag and being marked for who you are. As for Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy, it was the book’s relevance, the contemporariness of the novel written way back in 1993 and the nostalgia for the period (1950s), it details that did the trick for her.Can her series that bats for syncretism and harmony, despite the obvious divide, change perceptions in the polarised times we live in? “Well, I don’t think of my work that grandly. But yes, I do hope it can initiate a dialogue.” As her cinema talks about serious issues, yet is bereft of melancholy, we wonder if that is by conscious design. “I don’t want my cinema to be like boring homework; come and take this message. Somewhere deep down, the celebratory aspect of it is also a reflection of my Punjabiyat.”Often the stories she tells, especially like the classic Monsoon Wedding, are also a means to touch base with the Punjabi in her. Indeed, characters inhabiting two worlds too fascinate her. That could be one of the reasons why she has chosen the 20th century artist Amrita Sher-Gil as a subject for her next film. She says, “Yes she came from the West to the East and settled here in Punjab, while my journey has been in the reverse direction.” Interestingly, Amrita has captured her imagination ever since ever. The fact that here was an extraordinary artist who died so young before she could be truly recognised pains her no end. Can we hope to love Nair’s Amrita? “I don’t create work to earn your love. But yes, I am sure it can inspire others, especially the young, for here was a flame.”No doubt, work on Amrita’s biopic is a huge challenge but it has begun in earnest. Research has taken her to Amrita’s letters, her photographs, paintings and, of course, the two books penned by Amrita’s nephew Vivan Sundaram, who has given the go ahead to the film. While she already has two screenplay writers on board, the hunt for reel Amrita, too, is on. Refusing to reveal any names, she admits, “there are several in my head.”Casting may not be half the work done but she agrees is very important as miscasting can mess things up. Her latest A Suitable Boy appears to be a showcase of the very best (name any actor worth his salt and he/she is there), that Indian film industry has to offer.In hindsight, could she have taken more fresh faces? She takes a slight affront, “But every actor fit the part.” Besides, hasn’t she been always unafraid to try people who have had no intention of ever becoming an actor. If you remember Salaam Bombay and bunch of child actors who came through workshops, she reminds us of Kamini Khanna (Monsoon Wedding) whom she discovered in a park in New Delhi. She is mighty proud of her two latest discoveries, the female lead Lata played by Tanya Maniktala, whom she describes as ‘dewdrop in motion’, and Joyeeta Dutta (Tasneem), who she is positive is going to be a star.Blending stars with new talent is a process she truly enjoys, even as one star seems to be a clear favourite. She shares, “No doubt Tabu is a dear friend. But I cast her for only she could distil Saeeda Bai. with just one ada.” And Nair can suffuse her work with such riches.Much of what we see in A Suitable Boy is poetic, so visually sumptuous and aesthetic. Do women directors have a distinct signature? “I would hate to generalise. Men can be as sensitive. But having said that I must say I will never portray woman as whimpering or not standing up for herself. In my films, she will always be a beating heart.”So those of you who are marvelling at Lata’s choice of the suitable boy and reading it as an endorsement of arranged marriage, she begs to differ rather vociferously, “Without naming him, I would say he represents the real spirit of modern India.” Dare we say Nair herself represents cross cultural cinema rather is often hailed as the diva of the same? She smiles, “Well, titles are for you to give…”All she knows is she has the rhythm of amalgamation and her works are a counter to the western eye. Also when she gets into the specifics of culture, “Local becomes universal.”As it did with Salaam Bombay from which she draws till date and, of course, the quintessential Monsoon Wedding whose musical adaptation for stage will soon premiere in India. Perhaps, it will come to City Beautiful too. Till then she tells her Punjabi admirers, “Keep the spirit of largess, the world so needs today, alive.”A Musical journeyIf Monsoon Wedding figures as one of your favourite films, here is good news for you. Its musical stage adaptation with fresh songs composed by none other than Vishal Bhardwaj is all set to premiere in India. Guess what, Nair is not only keen to bring the musical to City Beautiful, she even has a story around Chandigarh in her mind. But for now, it’s Amrita that her creative energies are channelled towards. On whether Amrita’s art or the colourful persona take precedence, she says, “Artist makes the art.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/reflection-of-mira-nairs-punjabiyat-160878
25-10-2020||---||Farmers, petrol dealers to meet on Oct 28||Bathinda, October 24All farm unions of the state will meet at Bathinda on October 28 to decide on their ongoing protests outside private petrol pumps.Private petrol dealers today held a meeting with leaders of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) at Teachers’ Home in Bathinda over the discontinuation of oil supply since October 1 amid protests against the new agri-marketing laws.Dealers RS Pathania, Harnek Singh held discussions with Shingara Singh Mann, leader of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan). Briefing mediapersons after discussions, Mann said a meeting of farm unions of Punjab would be convened at Teachers’ Home in Bathinda on October 28, where the problem being faced by private petrol dealers would be discussed. He urged all farm organisations to attend the meeting.‘What’s our fault?’We totally oppose the three laws and support farmers on the issue. But what is our fault? We are only facing losses due to protests outside our petrol pumps. —Petrol dealerThe sales at private petrol pumps across the state have either come to a halt or dropped by 50 per cent. Dispensing units have largely closed, with farm activists barricading almost all petrol pumps run by private companies.Expressing support to the protests, dealers and employees of private petrol pumps have been sharing video messages on social media, pleading farmers not to target them. Talking to The Tribune, a private petrol dealer said, “We oppose the farm laws and support farmers on the issue. But what is our fault? We are only facing losses due to protests outside our business establishments. My petrol pump has been lying closed for over a month.”Sit-in for relief, job continuesSangrur: Protests under the banner of the BKU (Ugrahan) continued in front of the Sangrur DC’s office for the third day on Saturday. Farmers have been demanding compensation and a government job for the family of farmer Meghraj Nagri, who died during a protest on October 9. “We would not lift our protest without getting adequate compensation and a government job for Nagri’s family,” said Gobinder Singh, a BKU (Ugrahan) leader.

With nearly 60 per cent cut down on wedding extravagance and shifting to contactless service, the hotels are adopting safety guidelines in their business model while organising any social event. There is now no more self-service of food. Rather disposable cutlery and sanitisation tunnels have become the new must-haves during a wedding event.“The pandemic has changed quite a lot as far as organising social and wedding events are concerned. Most of the services are now being offered by hotels through contactless methods, especially during food service. The buffet system, which works on the basis of guests serving themselves, has been replaced by contactless food service through a single person.“The cutlery, used during wedding events, is now sanitised and wrapped in sheets and handed over to guests just before the food service opens. We also distribute masks to guests on arrival in case they come without wearing them. Masks and gloves are mandatory for the service and other staff during any event. The number of guests attending any event is also decided upon beforehand and strictly adhered to,” said Tarsem Singh, VP, Best Western Merrion.Besides cutting down on wedding services that otherwise used to be a lavish affair before the Covid-19 period, a limited menu is offered to guests to minimise wastage. According to Ravindra Das of Holiday Inn, almost all wedding events these days have limited guests and people prefer simple arrangements. So, there has been seen a big cut in décor and flower arrangements and food choices too have changed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/extravagant-weddings-become-thing-of-past-160850

They need to be trained to transform their farms into production-cum- processing centres. Prosperity to farmers can be ensured by making farming a profitable preposition,” he added.He urged urge all concerned stakeholders to put in concerted efforts to bring in place a mechanism that catapults the prospects for Indian agriculture sector. This will not only lead to inclusive growth but will also provide employment opportunities for numerous landless labourers, small and marginal farmers. “Research in our institutes should be oriented to address the critical issues that hinder the development of rural businesses,” said the Governor.Ajay S Shriram, chairman, CII Agro and Food Tech 2020, said, “In the virtual arena, CII Agro and Food Tech has made its mark and presence felt across the globe.

25-10-2020|| Deepkamal Kaur||Agya Pal Singh Randhawa had no looking back after his short film on legendary singer Surinder Kaur won national award||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, October 24Having won a national award from Doordarshan for his documentary on legendary singer Surinder Kaur and accolades for producing a string of videos on Punjab Armed Police, Denmark-based Punjabi singer Anita Lerche, hockey Olympian Pargat Singh and global warming, Programme Executive of Doordarshan Agya Pal Singh Randhawa (65) has been a name to reckon with.Agya Pal Singh Randhawa It took me three years to complete my documentary on Surinder Kaur, interviewing her and her daughter Dolly Gulleria on several occasions, recording her music clips, taking points from her on how ex-PM IK Gujral intervened to save her house in Delhi from being demolished during a metro project, taking video shots on her from the PM, and even Capt Amarinder Singh in 2004 when he was the CM. Now retired after having served for additional five years on extension, Randhawa cherishes the good old days with the public service broadcaster. At his house in Adarsh Nagar here, he has maintained a nice rack of all awards and trophies that he won during his 30 years of service with the DD. He has preserved all his certificates and citations well in a folder and has also preserved some records of videos of his work.Randhwa shared: “Though I started working casually with the DD in 1977-78, my regular innings started in 1991 after I cleared my UPSC examinations. My initial training was as the sports producer for which I took sessions from NIS Patiala, learning about sports and its jargon to make a good commentary. My first big assignment was the coverage of 1982 Asian Games, after which I covered Commonwealth Games, Afro-Asian Games and international hockey tournaments on several occasions and got a chance to travel a lot with the DD teams.” He went on: “But my ultimate desire always remained to be a news reader. There was a slot but I missed that chance and it hurt me a lot. Then I took upon myself to achieve something bigger and finally got an opportunity to serve as the news producer. For over 20 years, it was I who decided the agenda for the following day and prepared rosters for the news readers. My name kept appearing as producer with most news bulletins”.Having achieved one target, he set his eyes on another. “I got the desire to produce entertainment programmes too and finally got associated with one of the most popular music shows ‘Lishkara’, which I produced from 2002-06. The programme got the maximum TRP and all singers, including Hans Raj Hans, Malkiat Singh and Diljit Dosanjh, used to come to my channel. Having a background in economics, I put up a suggestion to make the show remunerative and from then on, every singer had to pay Rs 22,000 to the DD for getting his 3-minute music video recorded on the channel.”Randhawa was also seen on the screen in the DD’s monopoly days as the anchor of shows including ‘Sajri Swer’, ‘Khaas khabar ik nazar’ and ‘Gallan te geet’. He also got a video album, titled ‘Sadke Punjab ton’, readied for Danish singer Anita Lerche. “It was a sheer chance that I came in contact with her through a Hoshiarpur-based friend. She was so quick at learning Punjabi that she began singing ‘Heer’ so well. She even took lessons in Punjabi from my wife, a Punjabi lecturer, and became a close family friend,” he recalled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/agya-pal-singh-randhawa-had-no-looking-back-after-his-short-film-on-legendary-singer-surinder-kaur-won-national-award-160683

Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh dubbed their remarks as “political puffery” with no substance or basis to support the criticism. He said contrary to what these leaders were claiming, there was no comparison between the Hoshiarpur and Hathras cases. He pointed out in the latter instance, the UP Government and the police not only failed to initiate stern action, but also seemingly tried to cover up the matter. This, he said, was in sharp contrast to the “prompt action” taken by the Punjab Police, which immediately arrested the accused and were preparing to file the challan within a week. A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire at a village in Hoshiarpur on Wednesday.Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Ministerwhy are Gandhis mum?Rahul and Priyanka have not said a word on the Hoshiarpur incident. Does this kind of selective outrage suit their party?“Had the BJP government in UP responded as effectively and speedily as we did in Punjab, neither the Congress and the Gandhis, nor scores of NGOs and human rights activists would have been forced to take to streets to fight for the victim,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-selective-outrage-asks-bjp-capt-trashes-charge-as-baseless-160786

A deputation led by Youth Akali Dal district president Harbinder Singh Harry met Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Jaspal Singh Brar and submitted a memorandum criticising the BDPO for not distributing the free ration kits.

The Health Department, prior to the recent Vidhan Sabha session, had instructed the civil surgeons to get all 117 MLAs tested.At a press conference today, Pal claimed on October 17, Civil Surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore told him he had tested positive. Sensing something fishy, the MLA got himself tested a day later, this time from a private lab, which gave him a negative report.“It is clear somebody in Chandigarh wanted me to go into isolation and subsequently miss the session. Some politicians, inimical towards my boss Partap Singh Bajwa, had instructed the Civil Surgeon (CS) to fudge records and hand me a positive report,” he alleged. Pal said a day after he received the private lab report, government doctors again got him tested. “Again, they told me I was positive. This indicates they were adamant on declaring me Covid-positive, while actually I was not. Based on the first report, I was forced to miss the Assembly session. All this happened because I am a supporter of a politician who is at daggers drawn with the CM,” he maintained.Dr Kishore said he had got the second test conducted because doubts had surfaced in the first one. “As for the negative report given by the private lab, he must have been carrying a lower viral load that day,” said the CS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/declared-covid-ve-intentionally-claims-bajwa-loyalist-mla-joginder-pal-160625

The Hoshiarpur police are investigating various aspects and are set to submit a challan in the court within a week. As the two-day police remand of the accused ended today, the two were produced in the court, which extended their custody by three days.Family worked for accusedThe police have retrieved the CCTV footage from the village purportedly showing Surpreet carrying the victim. Surpreet was accused of taking the victim from her home on the pretext of giving her biscuits. The victim’s father has told the police around 5 pm on the day of the crime, when the victim’s family was looking for her, Surjit came to them claiming her body was lying in his cattle shed and that she was set on fire. When the family reached the scene, they found the charred body on a hayrack.The victim’s sister claimed Surpreet frequented their house on one pretext or the other. They had objected to this, but to no avail. On the day of the crime, Surpreet had visited their house in the morning, saying he wanted to meet the girl. Her parents asked him to leave and went off to work. On returning home in the evening, they failed to find her. The victim’s sibling told them that Surpreet had taken her away.Amid anger among villagers, the family of the accused has left the house. Sukhwinder Singh, a resident, told The Tribune the accused’s family had been claiming earlier that Surpreet was not mentally stable and that he was undergoing treatment for the same. The victim’s father, however, rejected the claim, saying had Surpreet been mentally unstable, he would have harmed his own family first. Sukhwinder said the victim’s father and his elder daughters used to work for the accused two-three years ago, but they left work a year-and-a-half ago. SSP Navjot Singh Mahal said the police were preparing the challan, which was expected to be presented in the court within a week.Meanwhile, Minister for Industries and Commerce Sunder Sham Arora met the victim’s family this evening. He handed over five fixed deposits worth Rs 50,000 each to the father in the name of his five daughters. He also announced a five marla residential plot for the family in the village besides promising funds for the construction of a house. Union Minister of State for Industries Som Parkash also visited the family and promised all help by the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/girls-body-in-my-house-accused-told-victims-kin-160626

25-10-2020||  ||Task force formed to check paddy inflow eyewash: AAP||‘Ensure MSP on all crops’  Chandigarh: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has urged Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to guarantee procurement of all crops at the minimum support price (MSP) or step down from his post. Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, party MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said, “There is no denying the fact that the sham laws brought in by the Amarinder Singh government in collusion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi are nothing but a ‘jumla’ to take the people of Punjab for a ride,” he said. TNS  25 trucks return to UP    Amritsar: Farmers staging protests against the farm laws on the national highway near Amritsar today released 25 paddy-laden trucks to Uttar Pradesh (UP). The police and Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department officials were present there. One truck was impounded, as the driver did not have the necessary documents.The paddy had arrived illegally from Aligarh, Bulandshahr and Sitarganj of UP on October 22. The trucks were then impounded by agitating farmers near the Nijjarpura toll plaza. The grain was ordered by rice shellers of Amritsar and Tarn Taran.    Tribune News Service  Bathinda, October 24  The state Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) today termed the special task force set up by the Punjab Government to curb the inflow of paddy from other states, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, for sale in Punjab mandis mere eyewash.  It alleged that Congress top leaders, MLAs and ministers were involved in the dubious deal and demanded resignation of Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.  Senior party leader and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said an interstate market mafia involving top Congress leaders, MLAs and ministers of the Punjab Government was being run in a well organised manner. He claimed that the WhatsApp chat between those behind the deal and the district manager of Punsup (Patiala) confirmed the involvement of top Congress leadership in the “loot”.  “Almost half the season has passed, but the government is yet to take note of the open loot of farmers by the mafia active in the state. The government is receiving hefty commissions from the mafia. Now that farmers have started checking the the illegal inflow of paddy on their own, the government is enacting dramas by setting up sham district-level task forces,” said the AAP leader.  He said it was unfortunate that due to the incompetence and mismanagement of the Centre and state governments ruling the roost for a long time, farmers of UP and Bihar were being subjected to exploitation by middlemen in cahoots with the ruling party leaders. He said the paddy procured from UP and Bihar at half the price and its sale in Punjab mandis at the MSP was harming the interest of state farmers.  Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh should immediately dismiss Ashu and order a CBI inquiry under the supervision of the High Court, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/task-force-formed-to-check-paddy-inflow-eyewash-aap-160639
