The district also reported the highest deaths of the day at seven. Patiala and Jalandhar reported five deaths, Sangrur, Gurdaspur, and Fatehgarh Sahib each reported one.   Besides Ludhiana, Amritsar (39), Jalandhar (34), Patiala (19), Sangrur (36), SAS Nagar (11), Hoshiarpur (5), Gurdaspur (10),  Ferozepur (14), Pathankot (15), Tarn Taran (1), Bathinda (14), Fatehgarh Sahib (13), Moga (6), SBS Nagar (2), Faridkot 3), Kapurthala (10), Ropar (5), Barnala (13), and Mansa (15) all reported new cases, the bulletin said.Forty-nine of Ludhiana’s 222 new cases were contacts of previously diagnosed cases. Thirty-six were classified as ILI (influenza-like illness).

While the WHO recommends 140 tests a day per million people India’s average is 479 while 28 states have an average of more than 140 tests a day per million. Among the states performing high number of tests, Punjab, Rajasthan, MP and UP have already reached a case positivity rate less than 5 per cent,” Bhushan said today.Punjab is among states conducting a large number of tests. While India’s tests per million average is 15,119, the data for Punjab is 20,221.The following states have case positivity rate less than 10 per cent—Haryana (5.40 pc), Assam (6.10 pc), West Bengal (9 pc) and Karnataka 9.80 pc.Tests per million in Haryana are 24,914, much higher than the national average.India today crossed the milestone of conducting more than 2 crore cumulative COVID tests with a record 6.60 lakh tests in 24 hours.Recovered cases -- 12, 30, 509 are now more than double of the active cases 586296.Case fatality rate in the country dropped to 2.10 pc at the lowest level since the first lock down.Meanwhile, the government also shared mortality analysis today saying 68 per cent of all 38,938 COVID deaths in India as of today have involved men and the rest women.Even today, 87 pc of deaths are happening in the age group 45 to 60 plus years with half of all deaths among 60 plus people and 37 pc of all deaths in 45 to 60 year olds.Age groups below 17 years and 18 to 25 years both make up one per cent each of overall deaths.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-posts-lowest-covid-positivity-rate-of-3-1-pc-in-india-national-average-8-89-pc-122066
04-08-2020||---||Hooch deaths are 'murder', no one complicit will be spared: Capt Amarinder||Chandigarh, August 4Asserting that he would finish the liquor mafia in the state, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said no one, whether politician or public servant, would be spared if found complicit in the hooch deaths.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said nobody would be allowed to get away with killing people with spurious liquor, adding that he had put the entire force of the Punjab police to crack down on the mafia, said Captain Amarinder.“Some unscrupulous elements took advantage of the police focus on battling the COVID-19 pandemic to satiate their greed at the cost of the lives of Punjabis,” said the Chief Minister.Also read: Will write to Sonia Gandhi to seek strict action against back-stabbing Bajwa, Dullo: Sunil JakharTwo more arrested in hooch tragedyWhile the state government was busy battling COVID-19, which has claimed 449 lives in the state so far, the liquor mafia seized the opportunity to play with the lives of our people, he added.This is sheer murder and the killers would not get away with it, Captain Amarinder said, referring to the death of 111 people (83 from Tarn Taran, 15 from Amritsar and 13 from Batala) due to the spurious liquor.“They knew this could kill and yet they supplied/sold the poison to innocent people. They deserve no mercy,” said Captain Amarinder, adding that his government stood with the families of the deceased in their hour of grief and would leave no stone unturned to ensure justice for them.Castigating the opposition for exploiting the tragedy for their petty political interests, the Chief Minister said this was not the time to play politics but to stand by the government in its efforts to eliminate the mafia that was indulging in such acts.He flayed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over its ‘dharnas’ against the hooch tragedy and asked how this would help in battling the mafia or supporting the bereaved families.“The Chief Minister pointed out that such tragedies have been taking place through the years across states, under different political dispensations. Mafias and criminals do not have any political affiliation, their only interest is to earn money by hook or by crook,” he said, noting that 2019 had seen three hooch tragedies, all in the BJP-ruled states of Assam, UP and Uttarakhand, claiming 168, 97 and 30 lives, respectively.In 2016, 16 people had died in the Janata Dal ruled Bihar while in 2015, the BJP-led Maharashtra had lost 102 lives to hooch in Mumbai and under the Trinamool Congress rule in West Bengal, as many as 167 people had similarly died due to consumption of spurious liquor.Almost every year, India sees some or the other hooch tragedy, which has nothing to do with who is in power in the affected state, said Captain Amarinder, urging the opposition parties to stop playing politics over the lives of innocent Punjabis.“Our people don’t care which party is ruling the state, all they want is justice for their loved ones, who fell victim to the greed of the liquor mafia,” he said, pointing out that Punjab had also witnessed similar tragedies under the SAD-BJP regime.The Chief Minister urged the opposition to rise, for once, above their petty political interests, to fight for justice for the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hooch-deaths-are-murder-no-one-complicit-will-be-spared-capt-amarinder-122047
04-08-2020||---||Will write to Sonia Gandhi to seek strict action against back-stabbing Bajwa, Dullo: Sunil Jakhar||Chandigarh, August 4Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday said he would be writing to party president Sonia Gandhi to seek action against the brazen indiscipline of the two Rajya Sabha MPs Pratap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, who had chosen to attack their own government.The Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief extended his sympathies to the families of those who had lost their lives in the horrific incident but said such tragedies did not give license to any individual to indulge in indiscipline.“It was time to stem the rot and save the Congress from the petty machinations of the likes of Bajwa and Dullo, who had no shame in biting the hand that feeds them,” stressed Jakhar, adding: “Ye jis thali mein khatey hain ussi mein chhed kartey hain! (They are betraying the one who is helping them)”He said he would seek strict action against the two MPs who were disgracefully exploiting a tragedy to further their own political ambitions and interests.Asserting that the actions of Bajwa and Dullo could not be tolerated any longer, the Punjab Congress chief said men like these, who did not have even the courage to face elections, were no asset to the party. “Such back-stabbing members should be shown the door before they can cause any serious damage,” said Jakhar, adding that enough was enough now and he was going to clearly demand serious action against them from the party president.Jakhar described the action of the two MPs, who had yesterday approached the Governor to demand CBI and Enforcement Department (ED) probe into the liquor deaths, as a manifestation of their desperate desire to grab the high seat of power by hook or by crook.“How many times in all these years did they ask for expediting the CBI inquiry into the sacrilege cases (which has since been taken over by Punjab Police) or the ED probe into drugs, launched during the erstwhile SAD-BJP government?” he asked.Pointing out that Bajwa and Dullo had been engaging in such anti-party activities for quite some time by talking against their own party and targeting the Congress government in Punjab, Jakhar said their attacks had increased after Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh announced his decision to contest the 2022 elections.Having probably seen the 2022 polls as their last chance to make it big in the corridors of power, the duo saw their hopes shattered and, out of sheer frustration, were knocking at all possible doors to sneak their way to the top echelons of power, he added, citing rumours of the two MPs being in touch with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Jakhar described the attack of the two MPs on their own government as a ‘copy-paste job’ of what happened in Rajasthan in January, in the wake of 107 infant deaths over which Sachin Pilot had flayed his own government. “Had action been taken against Pilot then itself, what was happening today in Rajasthan could have been avoided,” he said, adding that he would bring to Sonia’s notice the dangers of letting Bajwa and Dullo get away with their detestable act of expressing their dissent/concern not in the party or government forum but in public.The gross indiscipline of the two men had shown that there was no guarantee that they would stand with the party in the Rajya Sabha on key issues, Jahkahr said. The PPCC president pointed out that that the two MPs were surviving politically only due to the largesse of the Congress high command, which had nominated them to the Rajya Sabha since they had run scared from contesting Assembly or parliamentary elections.In fact, he recalled that Rahul Gandhi had helped Bajwa by making him the PCC president in the face of opposition but his betrayal of Rahul’s and the party’s trust had exposed his petty political ambitions which he was bent on pursuing to the detriment of the Congress itself.Dismissing as completely hollow the concerns expressed by Bajwa and Dullo, Jakhar rejected their claim of giving voice to the people of Punjab by taking the issue of the hooch tragedy to the Governor.The two had not once raised any issue of Punjab’s interest at any forum worth mentioning, he said, pointing out that they were sent to the Rajya Sabha to represent Punjab and its people but had, till date, not spoken there on a single issue of the state’s concern.“From SYL to Grant for Punjab, GST refunds, COVID-19 aid and the most recent anti-farmer ordinances, the two MPs had studiously chosen to keep quiet in the Upper House on every matter of importance to Punjab,” he said. In fact, even on national issues such as Article 370 and the CAA, these two had failed to deliver on the expectations of the people who they were supposed to represent and whose interests they now claim to be protecting, Jakhar added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/will-write-to-sonia-gandhi-to-seek-strict-action-against-back-stabbing-bajwa-dullo-sunil-jakhar-122038
04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Punjabi music industry limping back amid COVID-19 pandemic||With the Punjabi music industry facing major cash flow challenges with live performances and recordings being hit the most by the coronavirus pandemic, the industry—with longer delays being even more devastating—is limping back with ways to monetize music consumption.For Punjabi music video director Navi Lubana, the  ban on mass gatherings and live streaming is unlikely to be reversed until 2021. So it's time to go back to business amid health protocols to engage the fans digitally.He launched his 25th directorial four-and-a-half minute song 'Giddha' featuring Canada-based Elly Mangat and Afsana Khan on July 18 that attracted nearly 3.3 million live viewers."The Punjabi music and film industry is facing insolvency. Job losses have been reported on a mass scale with small-time artistes and part-time shooting crew the worst hit," he said."The 'Giddha' song was recorded in a day with the minimum crew in a heritage property in Ropar. The present norms are limited only to indoor shooting and the scenes are to be adjusted within the new circumstances," he said.In the pre-Covid days, the crew strength was usually 75 to 100. "Now we have to limit less than 50." Lubana, 29, earlier directed songs featuring singers like Shehnaz Gill and Sultan.Chandigarh-based Punjabi film critic Sapan Manchanda told IANS that the industry with an annual turnover of Rs 300-Rs 400 crore was the worst hit by the pandemic.Contrary to the single-track videos, he said  films were very badly hit."On an average 40-45 Punjabi films are produced in a year. The working schedule of a Punjabi film is from March to December owing to foggy weather in the plains in the winter. This year only two films were released in March and after that there was no release. There was no shooting of a film," he said."With cinema halls shut, the coronavirus has threatened the box office numbers of upcoming releases that were shot before the pandemic with a budget that can go up to Rs 5 crore," he said.Music venues have been closed since mid-March, and the government has not allowed the return of live performances.Trade insiders say at least 70 per cent of the technical crew in the Punjabi film industry are daily wagers, and they have been badly affected.To help the industry tide over the grim period of zero revenue during the lockdown, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on July 23 approved detailed guidelines for shooting of films and music videos during Unlock 2.0, with a restriction of 50 people at the shooting venue.Singer Ranjit Bawa and actors Gippy Grewal and Gurpreet Ghuggi have thanked the Chief Minister for accepting their request."No film has so far announced its shooting schedule. But a few music video directors have come forward with the fresh state guidelines and started shooting songs," a trade insider told IANS.Upbeat over the government's decision, energetic Lubana, who started his career in showbiz by walking on a ramp while studying at California State University, said he has plans to direct two music videos this month at locations across Punjab.He said in the absence of Punjabi films output, fans are playing song videos.State Special Chief Secretary (Home) Satish Chandra said the state has issued comprehensive guidelines granting permission to shoot films and music videos, subject to certain conditions.The guidelines stipulate that the duration of shooting should be restricted to the minimum possible time and not more than 50 people should be present.Shooting would commence only after all persons involved are thermally scanned and cleared.In order to avoid crowding, adequate number of view-cutters and enforcement of crowd control by private security personnel should be ensured.

Bodies of dead COVID patients lay for hours now at the isolation ward of the hospital.Three dead bodies remained unattended at the isolation ward the entire Sunday night because there was no space in the mortuary.The bodies were shifted to the mortuary on Monday morning, according to sources.The lapse sent officials, including those of the district administration, into a tizzy. After senior officials came to know of the incident, bodies were immediately shifted to the mortuary.Critical patients from nearby districts are referred to the Government Rajindra Hospital, a tertiary healthcare institution, leading to more deaths at the hospital. The mortuary, however, only has a capacity for eight dead bodies.Experts said that if the government didn't make arrangements soon, the hospital might plunge into a big crisis.An official at the Rajindra Hospital, pleading anonymity, said, “Now, it was only three dead bodies which were unattended, however, these numbers will rise in the coming days if the arrangements are not made immediately. Around six people died at isolation ward at Rajindra on Sunday.”When asked about the lapse, Dr Harjinder Singh, Principal, Government Medical College Patiala, said, “We are holding a meeting over this issue. We are planning to make in house arrangements or buying new cold chambers.

04-08-2020||Patiala||2 Patiala towns’ link to liquor deaths||Dhabas along highways, godowns and residential premises in villages are allegedly used to trade, store, supply and manufacture spurious liquor.How do they do itMonthly bribes to policemen, botched up investigations and deliberate efforts “not to recover cash” or seize assets of smugglers in cases registered under the Excise Act allegedly help this trade flourish.The recent deaths in Punjab due to the consumption of spurious liquor have once again brought to light how extra neutral alcohol (ENA) or ethanol transported from distilleries to paint and pharmaceutical units and other factories is deliberately allowed to be smuggled.“In Ghanaur and Rajpura areas, distilleries and truckers hold the key, courtesy political patronage. Truck drivers are not paid any salary, with a basic understanding between truckers and owners that they will pilfer one drum of ENA per round,” said a liquor contractor. “The driver will then tie up with some dhaba owners or smugglers, who will pay him Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per drum,” said a police officer.Smugglers generally store the ENA so procured in godowns, houses and roadside dhabas from where they supply it to every nook and corner of the state.“Illegal distillery owners buy ENA from smugglers, use it to make fake brands and then sell these to pocket huge profits. For every round of chemicals exchanging hands, cops and excise officials get their cut,” said an insider.“In connivance with the ENA mafia and distillery owners, liquor worth Rs 700 crore was manufactured and sold during the lockdown in Punjab. Despite high demand, it was the only state where no queues were witnessed at liquor vends when these opened after almost three months, as supply of illegal liquor had never been interrupted,” said a top ED official.“Recently, when accused in the illegal Ghanaur distillery case were grilled, they named many senior police officers who were allegedly paid monthly bribe. But that fact was never made part of the investigation report,” sources said.Principal Secretary (Excise and Taxation) A Venu Prasad, meanwhile, said their department had already launched a special drive to check ENA pilferage and use of chemicals to manufacture spurious liquor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2-patiala-towns-link-to-liquor-deaths-121756

The monthly salary bill of the state government is Rs 2,303.26 crore.Since pension (Rs 1,022 crore per month) and interest payments are kept in a separate head by the Reserve Bank of India, these two committed expenses of the state have reportedly been met. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation, which hasn’t been released by the Centre for the past four months (April to July), and the state’s own tax and non-tax revenues falling drastically because of the lockdown, have left the government with no resources to meet the committed liabilities. Even the share of the state in Central taxes (Rs850 crore per month) has not been released by the Centre.Just two days back, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal had written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, objecting to the submission of the Centre before a parliamentary panel that it was in no position to release GST compensation to the states. He said this would hit Punjab hard as GST was the largest component of its revenue. Over the past one month, the state has also cut down its expenses on mobile phone bills and fuel.A senior Finance Department official said: “We are floating a state development loan of Rs 1,500 crore on Tuesday, which might help us borrow money from the market to meet our committed liabilities.” He said in case the interest rate offered in the auction of the state development loans was high, they would raise Rs 1,000 crore from the sale of state bonds. This would be enough to meet all committed expenses, he added.No help from centreThe Goods and Services Tax compensation, which hasn’t been released by the Centre for the past four months (April to July), and the state’s own tax and non-tax revenues falling drastically because of the lockdown, have left the government with no resources to meet the committed liabilities.

Attempt to murder and two other offences were added later in Sections 307, 382 and 325 of the IPC.“Cases of assault or use of criminal force to obstruct/prevent public servants from discharging their duties are on the increase. Such cases have to be sternly dealt with to curb the tendency of assaulting or using criminal force to public servants and the protective shield of law has to be extended to such public servants to enable them to effectively discharge their duties without any fear,” Justice Tyagi said.Referring to the allegations, Justice Tyagi observed that public servants visited a village on June 8 at noon to persuade the accused not to plant paddy crop before the date notified in the government instructions.Two of the accused allegedly abused, chased and obstructed the public servants in discharge of their duties and damaged their vehicle. One of them allegedly caused injuries to the public servants, including a woman officer, who was a part of the team. Dismissing the petition, Justice Tyagi asserted the arrest of petitioner would be a part of the process of investigation intended to secure several purposes. The petitioner was to be questioned in detail regarding various facets of the crime.His custodial interrogation may provide information leading to discovery of material facts. Curtailing his freedom was necessary to enable the investigation to proceed without hindrance and to protect witnesses, Justice Tyagi concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protective-shield-of-law-has-to-be-extended-to-public-servants-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-121766

The notices, under Section 195 of the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911, had been issued to builders for illegally raising independent floors without getting the building plans approved as per the building bylaws. The offences include non-compoundable violations, including common stairs and not leaving requisite setback at the front and rear.  The Director, Local Government, in July last year, had pointed out that some builders, after getting a licence from the competent authority for a colony in the form of plotted development, constructed stilt plus three (S+3) and ground plus three (G+3) structures in violation of the municipal building bylaws. In some cases, developers got plans sanctioned for arrow of contagious units by showing each as a separate unit whereas they were part of a larger project. “Now, the government has clarified that building plans of independent floors can be cleared subject to no violation of the building bylaws. This means notices have to be withdrawn and non-compoundable violations need to be removed,” said a senior official. Recently, Local Government Director Bhupinder Pal Singh had allowed the department to approve building plans for G+2, G+3, S+3 and S+4 independent floors under the Punjab Municipal Building Bylaws, 2018, and subsequent amendments, which provide for independent floors, but there should be no violation of the building bylaws. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/approval-to-build-separate-floors-has-officials-in-a-fix-121768

||Cong MPs meet Governor, demand CBI investigation||Chandigarh, August 3 Two Congress Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo today met Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore and demanded a probe by the CBI or the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the spurious liquor tragedy. They said they had no faith in the probe being conducted by the state agencies. The MPs said the Governor had assured them that he would forward their request to the Centre, while seeking report from the state government. The MPs said apart from meeting party president Sonia Gandhi on the issue of “total administrative failure” of the state government on various issues, they, along with other MPs, would be meeting the Prime Minister and the Home Minister on the issue of investigations into the tragedy. They said it was not a mere accident, but cold-blooded murders committed out of greed. The complicity of the police, excise officials and politicians in power could not be ruled out, they alleged. They said there had been losses to the state exchequer due to smuggling of liquor by licensed distilleries during lockdown, functioning of illegal distilleries and production of spurious liquor in Punjab, but no action had ever been taken against the culprits.  Slamming Capt Amarinder Singh, the MPs, in their representation to the Governor, said the Chief Minister had failed to rein in the racket of illegal distilleries. They said the Chief Minister was even unaware of what was going on in his own district. The first illegal distillery was found at Khanna, the second at Rajpura and the third at Ghanaur. Rajpura and Ghanaur are both part of Patiala, the home district of the Chief Minister and the Parliamentary constituency of his wife.  The excise and police authorities had chosen to ignore the liquor mafia, they claimed, adding that hurdles were being created in the probe being conducted by the ED against illegal distilleries as the big fish remained unmasked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cong-mps-meet-governor-demand-cbi-investigation-121772

The “home delivery” of Haryana-made liquor is allegedly available at cheaper rates in the border district.

The Bir Talab Basti area in the district has earned the notoriety for being the hub of illicit liquor trade.Many people are involved in this trade. The area has become a hub in the region where country made liquor is prepared and sold illegally. The liquor is supplied in plastic packets.The price of this liquor is Rs 100 per bottle and it comes in a pack of two bottles, whereas the price of genuine country made liquor is around Rs 250 per bottle.A youth at Bir Talab village said many people from the city and nearby villages come daily to purchase illicit liquor. He said there was a demand, so people prepare and sell it.It seems that despite more than 100 persons were killed after consuming spurious liquor, no major action has been initiated against this illegal trade in the district.Jaskaran Singh, IGP, Bathinda Range, said, “This issue is in my notice and there is zero tolerance towards illicit liquor. We have identified pockets, which include the Bir Talab area, where this practice is going on and the police are regularly keeping tabs and conducting raids.”On Saturday, the Bathinda police arrested accused Manpreet Singh and Jagsir Singh of Bir Talab Basti in two separate incidents and seized 400 litre and 200 litre ‘lahan’ from their house.Villagers alleged that despite lodging complaints against this illicit trade, no major action had been taken.Prof Dr Vitull K Gupta, a health activist, said all kinds of alcohol carried health risk, but country made liquor could be much more hazardous because it might involve multiple distillation process, often poorly regulated, improper equipment leading to production of different concentration of alcohol (ethanol), harmful impurities such as fusel alcohols, lead from plumbing solder and methanol.He said spurious liquor was made by adulteration of country made liquor with methyl alcohol or methanol or ammonium nitrate to sweeten it, decrease cost and increase its intoxicating potency. The intake of ammonium nitrate might cause headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting, heart problems, convulsions, collapse and even death.High demand in rural areas||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/illicit-trade-flourishing-in-bathinda-villages-121776
