30-11-2020||London||Road in London to be renamed after Guru Nanak: Official||A west London council said it had been agreed to rename a road in its heavily Punjabi suburb of Southall as Guru Nanak Road, with the announcement coinciding with Guru Nanak’s 551st birth anniversary being marked as Gurpurab across the world on Monday.The proposal to rename Havelock Road after the founder of the Sikh faith came to the fore in the wake of London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm to review the UK capital’s landmarks in response to the Black Lives Matter protests, which have targeted memorials to historical figures with links to slavery and colonialism.Havelock Road is named after Major General Sir Henry Havelock, the British general behind quashing the Indian rebellion against the East India Company in 1857, referred to as the first war of Indian independence.Ealing Council said the part of Havelock Road to be renamed lies between King Street and Merrick Road, and includes the location of the Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall, one of the UK’s most well-known and largest gurdwaras.Havelock Road in Southall - London's 'Little India' - is finally to be renamed Guru Nanak Road. This is a big deal. Havelock Rd was named after the colonial British general who fought in the Sikh wars & later suppressed the 1857 Uprising. It is home to London's largest gurudwara. pic.twitter.com/ZaOvl7EcCY  The name change will come into effect in early 2021 as the council is in the process of writing to households, businesses and organisations impacted in advance of the change.“I welcome this change. Ealing’s diversity is our strength and we have to make sure that the places we live reflect that diversity through our street names and buildings,” said Councillor Kamaljit Dhindsa, Ealing Council’s cabinet member for business and community services.The local Ealing Council Leader, Councillor Julian Bell, welcomed the London Mayor’s review and said he had launched a parallel action within the borough of Ealing – which covers Southall.“The decision to rename one of Ealing’s roads reflects the importance of celebrating the borough’s diversity and is a timely celebration of Guru Nanak’s birthday on November 30,” said Bell.“Ealing’s independent equality commission will explore what residents and businesses believe can be done to reduce inequality while improving outcomes. It will look at education, employment, crime and justice, health and housing, among others,” he said.Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall moved to its current location at Havelock Road, soon to be Guru Nanak Road, in 1997 and was inaugurated by Prince Charles. Its langar, or free kitchen, offers thousands of free meals seven days a week to local residents in need.The road naming decision follows a consultation process launched in June and the council said it has been taken in accordance with the Street Naming Protocol, which confirms that any change proposal should “respect and balance cultural and historical identities, sensitivities, and heritage”.It comes as the UK’s Opposition Labour Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, issued a letter to every gurdwara in the country to express his “heartfelt best wishes” to the British Sikh community on Gurupurb.“We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Sikh community in exemplifying the core teachings of Guru Nanak. The sewa of Sikhs during the pandemic is a shining example of their community spirit,” he writes.The Labour Leader praised gurdwaras for their activities during the coronavirus lockdown, when volunteers continued to deliver free warm meals for people in the community and many British Sikhs took to the frontline as key workers.“I appreciate that due to COVID-19 restrictions, Gurupurb celebrations will not be the same. I know how incredibly difficult and upsetting this will be for families and communities, who won’t be able to come together as they normally would. However, Guru Nanak’s teachings of selfless service and perseverance will continue to be an inspiration to us all,” he added.The founder of Sikhism and the first guru of Sikhs was born in 1469 in Nankana Sahib, now in Pakistan.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Punjab farmers at Singhu border pray, light diyas on Guru Nanak Jayanti||Thousands of farmers from Punjab agitating at Singhu borders of New Delhi offered prayers, lit ‘diyas’ (earthen lamps), exchanged sweets as well as greeted each other on Guru Nanak Jayanti on Monday as they took a pledge to continue their fight against the Centre’s new agri laws.Many among the thousands of farmers said for them, Guru Nanak Jayanti meant facing difficulties together and staying positive even during the toughest times.Gurpal Singh (25), who has come all the way from Patiala along with his 85-year-old grandfather, Ajaib Singh, was among the thousands of others who have stayed put at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth consecutive day here to protest the farm laws.He said Guru Nanak Jayanti was of the biggest festival for Sikhs and but even staying away from their homes on this day had not deterred their spirits.“This is the biggest festival for Sikhs. In the morning, prayers were held. We lit candles in the evening and greeted each other,” he said.Thousands of farmers continued to protest at the Delhi-Haryana border even as the police enhanced security measures at the border points of the national capital.The farmers started their day remembering Guru Nanak Dev and greeted each other on this occasion.Jaspreet Singh, a student of Panjab University in Patiala, said this was the first time he was away from his home.“We pray for the well being of everyone. People who have come here from Punjab will light ‘diyas’ on their tractors and road. We are obviously missing our family. I spoke to my family in the morning to greet them,” he said.For 56-year-old Jasmer Singh, who has come here from Mohali in Punjab, Guru Nanak Jayanti meant facing difficulties together and staying positive even during the toughest times.“In the morning, we prepared ‘kheer’ and distributed it to everyone. We also made ‘parathas’ and ‘daal’. We are on the road, but Punjabis are those people who manage to be happy and celebrate even in the difficult situations,” he said.The Singhu border was lit up with ‘diyas’ and candles and ‘kirtans’ were sung as farmers pledged to continue their fight against the new farm laws.Romanpreet Singh (24), a resident of Patiala in Punjab said “Jatha has come from Delhi who are performing ‘ardas’ and ‘paath’. In the morning, they performed ‘akhand kirtan’, following which ‘kada parshad’ was distributed among the protesters and police personnel. Kirtans were also performed in the evening and sweets were distributed.” PTI
30-11-2020||---||Lakhs of people sign petitions on Change.org seeking justice for farmers||New Delhi, November 30The cyberspace is abuzz with links for protests petitions being shared not just here but in the UK, Canada, Australia and the US in favour of the farmers’ agitation against three recently passed farm laws.Over the last two days, over two lakh people have signed petitions demanding justice for the farmers. The rapidly growing petitions have in fact been started by Indian nationals living in the UK, Canada and the US.A large part of Indian diaspora in these countries comprises Sikhs from India’s Punjab province, which also happens to be the hotbed of the ongoing farmers’ agitation.The biggest petition among these was started by the American Sikh Council, and has been signed by over 50,000 people over the last three days. Similarly, a petition by Prabhjot Bath, a resident of the UK, has received over 50,000 signatures.Another rapidly growing petition, titled ‘Justice for farmers of India’, was started by Canada-based Gina Takhar on Saturday. “My grandfather used to say that once in your life you need a doctor, a lawyer, a policemen and a preacher, but everyday, three times a day, you need a farmer,’’ she said quoting motivational speaker Brenda Schoepp.Mindy Athwal’s petition, started from Wolverhampton in the UK, has been signed by over 30,000 people, while a similar number of people have signed another petition by Parminder Brar, a resident of Canada.A petition by Ravinder Uppal from Birmingham in the UK has been signed by almost 10,000 citizens, while another one started by US-based Kiran Badesha has received over 4000 signatures.“The backbone, sweat and tears of our farmers have fed millions and raised generations of Indians. Without whom, millions would have starved and generations would have never left the country. We need them, and they need us more than ever, today,” says Kiran in the petition.While most of these petitions are addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, some are appealing to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar as well.Most petitions seek a rollback or rethink on the new farm laws. However, some like Chandigarh resident, Shubh Karman wants Navdeep Singh, the son of a farmer to be acquitted in his petition. Navdeep shot to fame on Friday after images of him climbing atop a water cannon being used on the farmers to turn off the tap went viral. Navdeep was charged with attempt to murder. Shubh writes, “Authorities could have avoided all this through a peaceful dialogue which is being demanded by the protesting farmers from the very first day. Please sign my petition to bring the government’s attention towards the much needed peaceful dialogue, establishment of grievance redressal mechanism along with the inclusion of the MSP clause in writing by the government. Also, all farmers forcefully arrested and booked should be released and acquitted.”Another Chandigarh resident, Harman Singh Siddhu has petitioned the PM, raising several concerns via his petition.“This has shaken the national consciousness. Let us raise our voices in support of these farmers so that it reaches the top echelons so they do not mistreat our hardworking farmers instead agree to their genuine demand,” says Siddhu.Nida Hasan, country director of Change.org, hoped the situation would be resolved soon.“Change.org as a people’s platform consistently reflects concerns of citizens, which is true of the farmer’s stir as well. I really hope that the standoff is resolved peacefully through mutual dialogue,” she said.

What I want to tell them is that now work is being done with intentions as pure as Ganga and not lies. If some still have some doubt, the government is making all efforts to dispel them.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre gives in, willing to hold ‘unqualified’ talks with farmers||The BJP-led central government has conveyed its willingness to hold unconditional talks with farmers, sources in the party said on Monday--- a development that comes a day after farmers rejected the Centre’s qualified offer to advance talks.Some leaders from farmers' unions also confirmed the development.The Centre’s willingness to soften its stand comes in the wake of an ongoing meeting that Home Minister Amit Shah’s holding with senior leaders of his party at his residence. Among the several BJP leaders present at the meeting is Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar.Also read: PM defending Farm Bills shows govt’s complete opposition to solving demands of farmers: Farmers’ unionPM defends farm laws, assures farmers intentions of govt ‘as pure as Ganga’Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protestNo social distancing at protest, farmer leaders says new laws bigger threat than coronavirusBoth farmers and the central government are holding a series of internal strategic talks, sources said. Some leaders from farmers’ unions were in touch with BJP leaders, sources said, and they had agreed to more talks with the central government. This assent to hold more parleys comes after a promise from Shah to hold unconditional talks with farmers. They have also been allowed to continue their protest at their current location on Delhi's borders. Sources said they could be invited for talks as soon as Tuesday.The development comes as farmers continued to hold protests at Delhi's borders for the fourth day over the controversial agriculture reforms that Parliament had passed in September.Farmers mainly from Punjab have been holding protests spearheaded by 32 farmers’ unions since, and earlier this month, announced a march to Delhi called ‘Delhi Chalo’. Amit Shah had issued a statement two days ago that his government was scheduled to hold talks with farmers on December 3, but that those talks could be advanced if protesters cleared roads and moved to a site the Centre had designated for them - a ground at Delhi’s Burari.Protesters, however, rejected the offer, opting to stay put and asking for unconditional talks.The central government says that the laws are meant for farmers’ welfare---a view that farmers contend. Farmers fear that the laws will weaken the APMC system, leaving them vulnerable to corporate interests.  'You are being misled'Prime Minister Narendra Modi meanwhile repeated once again that the laws would benefit farmers.As protests refused to die down, Modi repeated his government’s stand: that the laws were aimed at farmers’ welfare and would help augment their income. He also claimed that the farmers were being “mislead”---a claim several leaders of the BJP---including the prime minister himself---have repeatedly made in the past, much to protesters’ criticism.  Also read: Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protest“If some farmers are feeling doubtful of the government's intentions it is because of lies fed to them through decades,” he claimed in a series of tweets on Monday.

He however did not say much to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent speech that his government was firm on the laws.   The city is expected to play host to 10 lakh pilgrims. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is also scheduled to inaugurate six projects on the same day. The celebrations come in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic raging across the world.  Punjab's pushing 1.5 lakh cases and 5,000 deaths.
30-11-2020||New Delhi||Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protest||Thousands of farmers continued their stir against the Centre's new farm laws at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day, even as the number of those protesting at the Ghazipur border swelled on Monday, leading police to place concrete barriers and enhancing security at the border point connecting with UP.Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital.Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported for the last two days, but the numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more their counterparts from the state joining them.Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers protesting at all Delhi border points said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and have called a meeting to discuss their next course of action later in the day.Farmers, who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, continued their protest there. A Delhi Police officer said the situation at the Ghazipur border near UP Gate remained peaceful.He said, "Cement jersey barriers have been placed to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the national capital."The protestors do not wish to go to Burari ground and want to carry out their protest at Jantar Mantar," he said.However, the Delhi-Ghaziabad border has not been sealed, police said.Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers will continue to protest at the Delhi borders as they don't want to go to Burari ground --- a designated protest site identified for the demonstration."We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said.He said that they are ready for talks with the Centre, but if they do not find solutions despite talks, they will block all the ways leading towards Delhi."We will not leave from here (Tikri Border) unless their demands are met. We are ready to face cold weather, we are ready to face every challenge ahead," Singh said.A medical camp has also been set up at Singhu border, which is being run by two individual doctors.Dr Sarika Verma, who has come from Gurgaon, said, "We have come here today. We are helping farmers at our own level. We have blood pressure medicine, PCM, crocin and other medicines.""The farmers are not so much aware about COVID-19. Many of them are not wearing masks, which poses a threat to human lives. We are distributing masks especially to those who have cough and the elderly here," Verma said.Another doctor Karan Juneja said that he has distributed basic medicines to 300 farmers, adding that there is a need to conduct the COVID-19 test at the protest site.Traffic continued to be disrupted in the national capital due to the protests.Taking to twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday alerted commuters to take an alternate route since Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed."Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road.Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu borders," it tweeted.In another tweet, it said, "Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala Jhatikera, Badusari, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders." Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.A meeting of over 30 farmer groups was held to discuss Shah's offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 once they move to Burari in the city, but the thousands of protesters had refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points.Their representatives had said that Shah's condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail".Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla in a letter to 32 farmers organisations sent on Saturday cited the cold conditions and the COVID-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burari ground where adequate facilities have been made for them."As soon as you shift to the ground at Burari, the very next day a high-level committee of union ministers will hold talks at Vigyan Bhavan with the representatives of all farmers unions, with whom dialogue had taken place earlier,” he had said in the letter.

Now, Khattar is making irresponsible statements against the farmers.

30-11-2020||---||Capt Amarinder Singh trashes Haryana CM Khattar’s call records||Chandigarh, November 29Trashing the call records released by his Haryana counterpart, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday said if ML Khattar really wanted to connect to him, he could have used official channels or called up on the mobile phone.Why would i not talk to him?If I can talk to Central leaders, including the Prime Minister, on the issue of the farmers’ protest, why would I try to wriggle out of talking to Khattar? - Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister“If at all someone from his office called my residence, why were the calls made to an attendant? Why were official channels not used to get in touch with me?” asked the Punjab Chief Minister.“Top officials from the Principal Secretary to DGP have been in touch with each other on the farmers’ issue for past several days, yet none conveyed Khattar’s desire to talk to me at any point in time,” the CM said.“How many times in the past has Khattar used the attendant channel to get in touch with me?” he asked the Haryana CM. Captain Amarinder further said: “I have an attendant to receive calls at my residence from 9 am to 5 pm. Khattar could simply have picked up the phone and called me on my mobile phone.”Captain Amarinder lambasted the Haryana CM, saying he was out to suppress the farmers and had no serious intent of discussing their protests with him. The Chief Minister also lashed out at Khattar over his remarks that “Amarinder would be responsible if Covid spreads now due to the farmers’ protest.”“If he (Khattar) was so concerned about farmers spreading Covid in Haryana, whose track record in the pandemic remains extremely poor, he should not have stopped them within the state, but should have allowed them to move quickly through to Delhi,” said the Punjab CM.On Khattar’s remark that farmers should not block Haryana’s borders, Captain Amarinder pointed out that it was Khattar’s government and police that had been blocking the borders for the past three days by forcibly stopping the farmers from proceeding.Captain Amarinder alleged Khattar’s lies on the issue had been exposed by the Haryana farmers themselves, as they had not only rejected their CM’s claims that no farmer from his state had joined the march but had shown their ID cards, duly issued by the Haryana government.

Since the protest began, BKU Ugrahan has spent around Rs 7 crore, of which around Rs 4 crore only on vehicles.Accounts maintainedWe maintain complete transparency in records and anyone can check it. Since November 15, we’ve spent around Rs7 crore. We have never faced a financial crunch as there is generous support for us. - Joginder S Ugrahan, BKU  (ugrahan) ChiefSuch a huge amount has come through donations from farmers, their families and even other residents.“Two days back, Sanjeev Kumar from Rohtak gave Rs 45,000 to our organisations and it all came without any demand. Since we have been fighting for the rights of farmers, residents are contributing on their own,” said Jagtar Kalajhar, a BKU Ugrahan leader.The BKU has formed committees at the village, block, district and state levels to manage separate account books and arrange funds. Apart from it, the BKU has also formed committees to regularly conduct audit of financial transactions at all levels. These committees have been maintaining the day-wise details of every penny they have collected from farmers and various expenses.

The closure of New Zealand’s border on March 19 was applicable to anyone who was not a citizen or resident of the country. In June, New Zealand declared itself Covid-19 free, but the borders remain closed for foreigners, except for essential workers or for medical reasons.This leaves more than 600-700 Indian families, who had come to India just before the borders were closed, in a fix.They had approached the New Zealand Commission, but no conclusive response was received.Prabhjot Singh said they were work visa holders who had no clarity about their future. “Visas of some of us are going to expire. We want the government to put our visas on hold and extend the expiry date as it was an unpredictable situation due to the pandemic,” he said.Many of them had gathered in New Delhi to hold a protest in front of the High Commission at Chanakyapuri, but were not allowed to do so. “Therefore, we protested at Jantar Mantar, but neither any diplomat nor anyone from the External Affairs Ministry took cognisance of it. We decided to raise our voice through Akal Takht. We were given assurance by the Jathedar that he will take up the matter with Sikh societies in New Zealand and the embassy,” he said.

Reason: the impact of Covid-induced lockdown and cascading effect thereof on family income. Hardik’s father, who works as a security guard at Bhado Majra village, said they had to bear the brunt of economic fallout of Covid.The Punjab School Education Board has directed students to pay fee, the last date of which is November 30.Hardik said, “The monthly salary of my father is around Rs 8,000 while my elder brother and sister are already pursuing BSc. Therefore, my father does not have money to pay my fee.”Similarly, Prabhjot Kaur, a bright student of the same school, is also unable to pay her fee for class X examination because her mother lost work due to Covid. Her mother, the only breadwinner in the family.The Tribune has learned that there were many such children who were unable to pay the board examination fee.School principals, along with school staff, are either paying the fee of needy kids by themselves or making arrangements to pay it, said sources.Meanwhile, teacher unions have demanded waiver of the board examination fee. Vikram Dev, senior vice-president, Democratic Teacher Front, said, “At this pandemic time, students have been asked to deposit board examination fee which is impossible for poor parents who are struggling for their livelihood.”District Education Officer Harinder Kaur said, “All students have to pay board examination fee, except those from the SC category. Until now, there is no provision to waive the fee for poor students.”

The deceased has been identified as Simranjit Kaur. DSP Harjinder Singh Gill said, “These girls were going to appear for the ETT exam in Mohali.” The police have seized the truck. TNS Death to injury ratio 4 times higher than national averageThe study on the economic burden of road accidents conducted by Balveer Singh Sidhu, under the supervision of Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, has found that the average cost of treatment per patient, who died a few days after accident, was Rs 3.47 lakh. Similarly, spending on the treatment of those who suffered permanent disability was Rs 6 lakh, those who were partially cured was Rs 1.86 lakh and those who were fully cured was Rs 83,667. The study points towards the highly privatised healthcare infrastructure in the state. An overwhelmingly high proportion of victims (86 per cent) were admitted in private hospitals. About 87 per cent victims were without life insurance coverage.“The economic burden of road accidents is far deeper and goes much beyond the direct treatment and vehicle damage costs. Road accidents, when result in the sudden demise of family members belonging to the similar age group within the same household, create a mutual lookafter void, which imposes substantial care and nurturing costs.”The study based on 100 road accidents, between 2014 and 2019, with 50 cases of death and injuries each, conclusively established that road accidents have disproportionately affected younger, productive, qualified, working and skilled populace. In both categories, namely injured and dead, about half of the victims belonged to the 15-40 years age group with qualification of matric and above, had government or private jobs, were involved in daily wage work, pursuing study and farming.About 68 per cent of the victims died on the spot, 12 per cent died en route to hospital or during treatment. And 28 per cent of the victims experienced permanent disability. Nearly 28 per cent of the victims suffered injuries on head, 30 per cent on knees and lower legs and 14 per cent on multiple body parts. Accidents necessitate instant arrangement of funds for treatment. Victim families resorted to informal borrowings as own family resources were inadequate.

30-11-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Punjab to cut down capital expenditure by Rs7,000 cr||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 29The Punjab Government has been forced to cut down its capital expenditure by over Rs 7,000 crore as its revenue receipts have been hit by a Covid-induced economic slowdown leading to a fall in GST collections, reduced Central devolutions and VAT collections.This means that the money available to the state government for building its fixed assets, schools and colleges, healthcare institutions and other infrastructure, will have to be cut drastically.The aggregate debt is expected to rise as Punjab has now agreed to opt for Central government’s proposal to borrow an additional Rs 3,033 crore to meet the revenue shortfall arising out of GST compensation to be given to the state. This will mean that Punjab’s debt will cross Rs 2.50 lakh crore from the estimated Rs 2.48 lakh crore.“Though we do not agree with the option given to us as it is both unconstitutional and immoral, we had no option left as almost all other states have gone in for the proposal given to them to meet the shortfall,” Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal told The Tribune.He said the state had no option but to take a cut of over Rs 7,000 crore in its budgeted capital spending. In the Budget proposals, Punjab had set aside Rs 24,089 crore for its capital expenditure. “Other than the losses we are facing in our own revenue receipts, the Central devolutions have gone down drastically, besides non-payment of GST compensation,” he said. Figures available with The Tribune show that the GST collections in the first two quarters of this year had declined by 30.99 per cent, Central sales tax by 18.05 per cent and VAT by 8.08 per cent. The total revenue collection was down by 18.68 per cent.Badal said though they had to cut down on the capital expenditure, Punjab was better off than some of the other states which have had to defer payment of salaries, interest repayments and social security pensions.

On Sunday, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar attacked his Punjab counterpart Capt Amarinder Singh, claiming that the latter used “inappropriate language” that did not behove a CM.“It is better not to respond to the Punjab CM’s utterances. People on social media are commenting that a Chief Minister should not behave in such a manner with his counterpart. At least, I should show restraint and stay away from responding in the same vein,” he told the media on the sidelines of a function here.Khattar reiterated that the farmers’ agitation was sponsored by the Congress and the Punjab Government. “The state forces used water cannon and tear gas shells to stop farmers marching from Delhi. This cannot be construed as use of force.”When asked whether or not the state acted under pressure mounted by the Centre, Khattar said, “The state government acted in view of the Covid pandemic. The state government has been following the Covid protocols in organising functions. I am surprised at the Punjab Government which sponsored the agitation during the pandemic. Who will be responsible if the virus spreads because of the protest? Of course, the Punjab Government.”The CM said he tried to talk to Capt Amarinder to discuss the matter, but he did not respond. “Initially, the Punjab CM denied that I had tried to contact him. But when we put forth the records, he was caught off guard,” he added.Amarinder to blame: VijAmbala, November 29Home Minister Anil Vij has blamed Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh for the farmers’ agitation.“Farmers across the country have accepted the new laws.
