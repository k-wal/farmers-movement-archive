25-12-2020||Chandigarh||Stop defaming farmers, hold talks on ways to repeal agriculture laws: Badal to Centre||Shiromani Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said on Friday the Centre should stop defaming farmers and hold talks with them on ways to repeal its contentious agriculture laws.In a statement here, the SAD president said the Union government has adopted a “callous and insensitive attitude” towards the suffering of farmers who are camping out in the open in severe cold wave conditions at Delhi borders.“It almost seems that the government wants to punish the farmers for raising their voice against the three agricultural marketing laws which were forced through in the last parliamentary session. This is the reason why the centre has adopted a policy which is aimed at tiring out the farmers,” the SAD leader said.“Bogey of talks is being raised with the sole purpose of defaming the farmers and giving the impression that they are being stubborn. The truth is that it is the Centre which is being obstinate by refusing to repeal the three Agriculture acts which are unacceptable to farmers across the country,” he said.Asking the NDA government not to play with the “sentiments of farmers by extending non-specific talk invitations without any agenda or time frame”, Badal said the Centre should hold talks on ways and means to repeal the three laws in a sincere manner.“It should also desist from defaming farmers as separatists and victimising arhtiyas (commission agents) through income tax raids. It would be best if the government called a special one-day session to repeal the three agricultural laws.”“Once this is done, then new laws can be framed in consultation with farmers.  I don’t see any reason to fault this logic. Not doing so will only strengthen the impression that corporate players who stand to gain through enslavement of farmers are coming in the way of a fair settlement to the ongoing farmer agitation,” he said.Telling the top BJP leadership to adopt a “humanistic approach”, Badal said, “More than 40 farmers have already lost their lives in the last one month. They have been agitating against these measures ever since they were introduced as Ordinances six months back”.“The government steadfastly refused to listen to the grievances of the farmers for five months and only initiated talks when the farmers blockaded the borders of Delhi. This does not bode well for a democratic State. How many more farmers should be martyred before the State sits up and listens to their voice and acts on it,” the former Punjab deputy chief minister added.Remembering the late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his birth anniversary, Badal said he would not have let things come to such a pass.“The present NDA government needs to learn from the example of inclusive governance set by the late prime minister and take everyone along with it. Divisive politics is not good for the progress of the country. The government should move swiftly to end the suffering of thousands of men, women and children who are camped in unbearable conditions on its doorsteps. Let us give the ‘annadaata’ the respect it deserves,” Badal added.The SAD had earlier broken ties with the BJP and had pulled out of the NDA over the agriculture laws. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/stop-defaming-farmers-hold-talks-on-ways-to-repeal-agriculture-laws-badal-to-centre-189269

They were detained on suspicion of conspiracy to a murder in India in 2009," the statement said.The trio are now expected to undergo proceedings to be extradited to India, with some separatist Sikh groups in the UK claiming that an order for such proceedings has been signed off by Home Secretary Priti Patel.The Sikh Press Association published a statement on behalf of the arrested men and claimed they have been held in connection with the 2009 murder of Rulda Singh, a senior member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), who was shot in Patiala and died a week after the attack. It further alleges that the development is linked with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab's visit to India earlier this year."If the three are extradited they would almost certainly be tortured and have no chance of a fair trial," claimed Bhai Amrik Singh, Chair of Sikh Federation UK. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/three-british-sikhs-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murder-of-rss-leader-rulda-singh-in-patiala-in-2009-189247
25-12-2020||---||Don’t disrupt state’s telecom services, inconvenience citizens, Punjab CM appeals to farmers||Chandigarh, December 25Amid reports of disconnection of power supply to various mobile towers across the state, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday appealed to protesting farmers not to inconvenience the general public with such actions but to continue to exercise the same restraint as they had been showing over the past several months of their agitation.Pointing out that telecom connectivity had become even more critical for people amid the Covid pandemic, the Chief Minister urged the farmers to show the same discipline and sense of responsibility which they had been exercising during their protest at the Delhi border, which has completed one month, and also earlier during their agitation in the state.Urging the farmers not to take the law in their hands by forcibly shutting down telecom connectivity or manhandling employees/technicians of telecom service providers, the Chief Minister said such actions were not in the interest of Punjab and its future.He said the people of Punjab had been standing with the farmers in their fight against the farm laws and would continue to do so.Amarinder also requested the farmers to reciprocate by ensuring that the battle for justice did not cause any problems for the people of the state.Forceful disruption of telecom services due to snapping of power supply to mobile towers by farmers in several parts of the state was not only adversely affecting the studies and future prospects of students, who are dependent entirely on online education, but also hampering the daily life of people working from home due to the pandemic, said the Chief Minister.Further, the disruption of telecom services would also seriously affect the state’s already disturbed economy, he noted, exhorting the farmers to continue with their peaceful protests without causing any inconvenience to the citizens of Punjab.Captain Amarinder pointed out that the prolonged economic crisis, which would be aggravated as a result of telecom service disruption in the state, would have a trigger-effect on the agriculture sector, as well as the farming community too.The effects would be detrimental to all sections, he said, adding that such actions would adversely impact his government’s efforts to attract more investment in the telecom sector as part of its recently announced ‘New Telecom Guidelines 2020’, which was also aimed at improving telecom connectivity in the state.In the wake of COVID-19, the urgency of these guidelines was felt seriously as there was dire need to improve connectivity through easing ‘Right of Way’ permissions for over-ground and underground telecom infrastructures. The guidelines were expected to give a quantum jump to the telecom and Internet connectivity in the state. Notably, Punjab is one of the states with the highest telecom density.The Chief Minister’s appeal came in the wake of a request from the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA), a registered body of Telecom Infrastructure Providers, asking the state government to persuade the farmers not to resort to any unlawful activity in their fight for justice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-disrupt-states-telecom-services-inconvenience-citizens-punjab-cm-appeals-to-farmers-189245

25-12-2020||New Delhi||Tomar urges Punjab farmers to end protest, resume talks||Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday urged Punjab farmers to end their protest and come forward to hold discussions with the government to resolve the deadlock over the three new farm laws.Tomar, who is leading the talks with 40 farmers unions, hoped that farmers would understand the importance of these three legislations and would hold discussion with the government to reach a solution to break this stalemate.Stating that there is some misconception in minds of Punjab farmers, the Agriculture Minister said: "I want to urge them to leave the protest and come forward for the dialogue. I am hopeful that farmers will understand the importance of new laws and reach a solution."Thousands of farmers and their family members are protesting at various Delhi borders for nearly a month seeking repeal of the three farm laws. So far, five rounds of formal talks between the Centre and 40 protesting farmer unions have remained inconclusive.The government has written twice inviting them for the next round of talks at a date of their convenience.Besides Tomar, Food, Commerce and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash are participating in the discussion with the 40 farmer unions.The protesting groups have maintained that the new laws will eliminate the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP), do away with the mandi (wholesale market) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.However, the government has been saying that these apprehensions are misplaced.

This means the land cost comes to over Rs 350 crore, whereas it has been auctioned for Rs 90.58 crore,” said Bir Devinder Singh, former Deputy Speaker of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, while demanding a CBI probe into alleged scam.PSIEC Vice-Chairman Mahesh Kumar Singhal said in the BoD meeting held on October 21, 2020, he had sought advice of the Advocate General and income tax adviser and OSD (Finance) on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/liquidated-firms-land-auction-sparks-row-189088
25-12-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||Farmers reach out to other states through webinar||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 24Fearing that the “propaganda machinery of the Centre” will succeed in convincing people across the country that the protest in Delhi was only for a cause that affects Punjab and Haryana farmers, a joint forum of the agitating farmers on Thursday launched an outreach programme.Through a webinar, attended by thousands of people in India and abroad, farm leaders strategically tried to address the public, saying the protest was not just about the doing away with the Agriculture Produce and Market Committees, but also about their effect on the common man as the prices of food would be dictated by corporates.This made an instant connect with the people of states like Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra among others, who otherwise had expressed reservations against the sti. A woman farmer from Bihar said the BJP had been successful in creating the narrative that only two states were against the laws, while these would be beneficial to farmers of other states. “But we know better, as small farmers from Bihar are forced to work as labourers to supplement their meagre incomes after the so-called reforms freed up the mandis.”Leaders Darshan Pal, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, Prem Singh Bhangu, Rajinder Singh Deepsinghwala (from Punjab) and Abhimanyu (from UP) put forth the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, saying it allowed corporates to store as much foodgrain or crops, which would help them create huge stockpiles and using these to flood the markets around the harvest time, to artificially lower the prices at which farmers can sell. A farmer from Nagpur said: “This is exactly what the corporates do with citrus fruits. The MSP of all crops should be the legal right of farmers, and the Centre must grant us this right.”Deepsinghwala, who moderated the session, said to counter the Centre’s narrative, they decided to use social media and give their side of the story regarding the new farm laws and clear the air about the protests. “We wanted to give the message that this is not a political protest. It is a protest to save the lives and livelihoods of farmers,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-reach-out-to-other-states-through-webinar-188982

Our work is suffering a lot and our jobs are at risk,” said an IT professional.Nonetheless, the towers installed in the rural border belt of Majha region, including Attari, Ajnala, Patti, Chawinda Devi, Bhikiwind, Baba Bakala, Ranike, Khadoor Sahib, Jhabal, were affected.In Ferozepur, the farm union activists on Thursday forcibly snapped power supply to another eight mobile towers situated at various locations. The power supply to mobile towers was snapped at Peer Mohammed village, Chakkiya, Sheehanpuri, Behak Pacharian, Kohala, Fatttewala, Chuchakwind in Makhu, Zira and Mallanwala blocks of the district. Another group of farmers snapped power supply to the mobile tower in Chak Bhangewala village in Mamdot.Similar reports of disruption in the service came from Balachaur in Nawanshahr. In all, four towers at Jandiala and three in the Shahkot, Nakodar belt in Jalandhar were damaged in the Jalandhar region.While the service of three towers was snapped by farmers at Jandiala Manjki village, one tower put up at the panchayat ghar of Samrai village was also closed by the members of the BKU (Rajewal). Members of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee also made three towers defunct at Shahkot, Lohian and Mallian Khurd villages.The villages that are worst-affected in Bathinda include Natheha, Nangla, Bangi Ruldu, Kalalwala, Pathrala and Gurthari. The villages where the tower sites were vandalised in Malaut included Bhai Khera, Phullu Khera, Fatehpur Manianwala, Raniwala, Panjwa, Mehna, Ghumiara, Shamkhera, Jandwala Charat Singh, Danewala and Sarawan Bolda villages.In Makhu also, members of the BKU (Rajowal) and BKU (Krantikari) switched off the tower of the telecom company.(With inputs from Anirudh Gupta and Aparna Banerjee)4 grocery stores closed in FazilkaFazilka: Farmers on Thursday evening forcibly closed four grocery stores of private firms, supporting the farm laws, in Fazilka. Dozens of farmers led by Harish Ladhuka, district chief, BKU (Dakaunda), asked the employees of four grocery stores to shut their establishments. Harish said the move was taken on the call of the state-level office-bearers of the union. He said two mobile towers in Salemshah and Rana villages were also closed. oc||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/anger-mounts-activists-target-pvt-telcos-towers-188985

||Cotton procurement hit||Tribune News Service Bathinda, December 24 The farm agitation against the contentious agricultural laws has taken its toll on the procurement of cotton in Punjab this season. Even as cotton procurement had begun early this season and the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) purchased a record volume of the produce till the second week of November, the procurement has registered a sharp decline after that.  Firstly, it was the farm agitation around a month ago that affected the procurement and now, the four-day strike by arhtiyas in the state has impacted the procurement of cotton amid the peak season. Data procured from the CCI revealed that while it was procuring approximately 65,000 quintals of cotton on a per-day basis in the state, the daily procurement had come down to approximately 21,000 quintals now. Talking to The Tribune, Neeraj Kumar, CCI general manager and Punjab in charge, said, “We got an overwhelming response initially when the procurement started as many farmers turned up in the market to sell their produce but after the farm agitation and arhtiyas’ strike, the procurement of cotton has got affected. However, farmers who want to sell cotton are directly going to the cotton factories and the procurement by the CCI is underway.”  Sources said arhtiyas, in order to muster up support for their strike call, had asked farmers to stay back and not to bring their produce to the mandis.  As per the records of the CCI, total 25 lakh quintals of cotton had been procured so far and payment of approximately Rs 1,250 crore was made to farmers this season.  Meanwhile, Ruldu Singh, state president of the Punjab Kisan Sabha, said, “The farm agitation will have ripple effects in the coming days. The cotton procurement will remain affected until the Union Government hears out our genuine demands and repeals the anti-farmer laws. We stand firmly with arhtiyas in their call for strike in the state.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cotton-procurement-hit-188987

First she was taken to the PGI-Rohtak by the members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan). Later, she was brought back to the Sangrur Civil Hospital, where she was treated for 10 days and then referred to Rajinder Hospital in Patiala. She reached her village 10 days ago. She was unwilling to come back even after suffering serious injuries.Even after being in a lot of pain, her activism is still brimming as she has started motivating other women, who come to inquire about her health, to join the protest.When asked whether she had any hope from the Punjab Government or any other political party, she replied in negative. “My only hope is the BKU (Ugrahan), which apart from supporting my family is also paying for my treatment expenses. I do not have any hope from politicians as neither of them has offered any help to me nor any government officer has come forward for my treatment so far. The present stir will give a new direction to Punjab politics and I want to be part of this historic moment.”Meanwhile, BKU (Ugrahan) Alloarkh village president Gurdev Singh said Mahindar had been adamant to join protest at the earliest. “Doctors have advised us for her operation and we are ready to bear all expenses but she is not ready. She first wants to see the rollback of the ‘black’ laws by sitting in the protest. We are trying to convince her,” said Kashmir Singh, vice-president of Alloarkh village BKU (Ugrahan).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/leg-injury-fails-to-dampen-65-year-olds-spirits-188993

But for the leaders of BKU (Ugrahan), which is the largest outfit, the debate must go on over it to convince its members against it.All of its state panel members have shunned liquor consumption many years back as they say it may have an adverse impact over their fight for farming.Even during the present protest, the “experienced” leaders, who once used to drink and understand the side-effects, are trying their best to convince maximum number of their members to stay away from liquor.“Even during our routine meetings, we keep motivating our members to shun liquor. During the present stir, our members are repeatedly trying to motivate our cadre to do so. Our members understand the gravity of the situation and take our advice positively. No one in our state panel consumes liquor,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of BKU Ugrahan.Some young members, while talking to The Tribune, said that they usually have detailed discussions about liquor consumption during their meetings. Their leaders always try to convince them against liquor consumption.BKU (Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan admits that he was a hard drinker and stopped liquor consumption after many years.

25-12-2020||Aman Sood||Facing shortfall in revenue, PSPCL seeks 8% hike in tariff||Tribune News ServicePatiala, December 24Power-surplus Punjab wants to hike electricity rates further following a shortfall in revenue in the current fiscal due to continuous lockdown and dip in demand during a large period of the year.According to its annual revenue requirement (ARR) petition filed before the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has sought almost over 8 per cent power tariff hike for the next fiscal.The PSPCL has sought an increase of 53 paisa per unit which means that the power, which now costs somewhere Rs 6.51 per unit, will then cost Rs 7.04 per unit. Last fiscal, the PSPCL had sought a hike by around 12 to 14.10 per cent in the existing rates but the PSERC allowed an average tariff hike of 2.14 per cent across categories for 2019-20.Every year, the Punjab Government gives a written commitment on subsidy and every year, there is a huge shortfall that impacts the PSPCL finances. This year, till December 15, the shortfall of subsidy is somewhere around Rs 5,187 crore which will rise further by March 31, 2021, when the fiscal ends.The current financial year subsidy, including arrears, is Rs 16,400 crore. The arrears of the current financial year will add up to the subsidy of the next year. The next year’s projected subsidy amount is Rs 13,398 crore where the revised tariff may exceed Rs 20,000 crore.While the tubewell rate has been increased from Rs 5.6 to 6.4 per unit, the actual revenue may be around Rs 3 per unit due to subsidy deficit which implies a loss of Rs 3.4 per unit on agriculture power supply. “In the case of large industrial consumers, the rate has been increased from 7.4 to Rs 8 per unit but the Punjab Government has fixed Rs 5 as the limit and the balance of Rs 3 will remain only on paper. The government should give details of how and why subsidy shortfall occurred in 2020-21 and how the subsidy will be ensured in 2021-22,” said All India PowerEngineers’ Federation spokesperson VK Gupta.The government charges 20 per cent tax on power unit rates decided by the PSERC. The PSPCL has also sought a hike in fixed charges for all categories of consumers. “The PSPCL has projected a net annual revenue requirement of Rs 37,657 crore and projected revenue of Rs 32,745 crore as per the current rate, leaving a gap of Rs 3,352 crore. This revenue gap jumps to Rs 8,363 crore by adding the gaps of last two financial years. To meet this financial gap, the PSPCL has sought category-wise overall hike of 8.1 per cent,” as per the ARR.As per the petition, the PSPCL has demanded lowest-ever power hike in domestic, while the highest-ever increase of 13 per cent has been sought for small category consumers.To give cross-subsidy to domestic consumers, as is done in the National Capital, the PSPCL has proposed hiking cross-subsidy of around 13 per cent to pass the minimum tariff hike on them.Charges lower in other statesPunjab is moving towards becoming one of the highest tariff states in the country, with a hike every year. The average tariff for domestic consumers comes out to be roughly Rs7.41 per unit in Punjab. Many states which are usually buying power to meet their demand are charging less than Punjab, which include Assam (Rs7.25 per unit), Uttar Pradesh (Rs7 per unit plus Rs110 /KW), Haryana (Rs7.10 per unit), Chhattisgarh (Rs4.85 per KWH as fixed charges plus Rs2.45 per unit) and HP (Rs5.45 per unit)Earnings hit, take back proposal: BJPChandigarh: The Punjab BJP on Thursday flayed the government for proposing a hike in power tariff, saying during the economic slowdown period, this would be a cruel blow to people.

The incident occurred between 1 am and 2 am following which senior officers of the BSF and Punjab Police made a dash for Kalanaur. Intelligence agencies have been informed about the infiltration attempt. This is the eighth time in the past three months that Pakistan has flown in drones into the border district. BSF DIG (Gurdaspur sector) Rajesh Sharma said around 1 am, personnel of the 58th Battalion sighted and subsequently fired upon the drone, forcing it to fly back into Pakistan. An hour later, the security agencies again spotted the drone and opened fire. Sharma informed Gurdaspur SSP Rajinder Singh Sohal, following which a joint search operation was launched in 15 villages located near the International Border (IB). The villages were sealed. Sohal said the search exercise could not be carried out at night because of poor visibility due to fog. “In the morning, we combed large tracts of agricultural land, including sugarcane fields,” he added. A senior officer said drone guns and sky fencing system might be pressed into service in the future to ward off such intrusions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pak-drone-spotted-twice-along-border-189004

The penal interest would be recovered from the erring employee’s salary.Taking up Nirmal Shukla’s plea against the state and other respondents, Justice Monga asserted: “It is rather a harsh case where an unfortunate widow, who lost her husband to the battle of cancer, is being made to run from pillar to post after her husband’s death so as to get medical reimbursement of Rs 41,282 incurred on the treatment of her husband from August 13, 2016 to August 23, 2016, during the period he remained admitted at PGIMER, Chandigarh.”Justice Monga observed the petitioner’s claim was diverted to Oriental Insurance Company on the ground that the government during the relevant period floated the scheme, making enrolment mandatory for employees to avail cashless benefits. In its absence, the state government was not liable to reimburse medical expenses for that particular year.Referring to the mitigating circumstances, Justice Monga observed the widow was obviously over-occupied attending her husband suffering from prostate cancer. It was a “over-pedantic view” on state functionaries’ part to expect the widow or the employee to have the knowledge of enrolment with the insurance company. The husband, too, was not in any mental condition or physical state to go and get himself enrolled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-raps-punjab-for-over-pedantic-view-189008

These firms were allegedly involved in issuance of fake invoices and fraudulent availing of income tax credit (ITC).Bhui has admitted to having connived with Jain in issuing fake invoices and passing on fake ITC through additional 16 bogus firms (in addition to seven firms owned by him) created or operated by him and Jain.Ashutosh Baranwal, Principal Commissioner, in a press release today said Bhui had confessed that these firms had indulged in issuance of invoices without actual receipt/supply of goods.Bhui, through the seven firms, had issued fake invoices valued at Rs 97.43 crore involving ITC of Rs 8.08 crore. Through 16 additional firms, he in connivance Jain further issued fake invoices valued at Rs 296.48 crore with the ITC amounting to Rs 24.94 crore.In all, Bhui issued fake invoices valued at Rs 393.91 crore, involving fraudulent ITC of Rs 33.02 crore, through 23 fake firms, said Baranwal.The firms were opened and registered on common commercial addresses and the name board of the firm displayed outside the rented premises was simply changed to hoodwink the GST authorities visiting the premises for physical verification.Based on the documentary evidence and admittance of GST fraud by Bhui and for his connivance with Jain in wrongful availing of the ITC as well as passing on of fake ITC without actual supply of goods, the former appeared to have committed offences specified under GST Act, 2017, the statement said. As the ITC involved was more than Rs 5 crore, the accused were placed under arrest yesterday and remanded in 14-day judicial custody.This is the eighth arrest by the CGST Commissionerate here since November 11 as part of a drive against those defrauding the exchequer by issuing fake invoices and passing fraudulent ITC and monetising it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rs-393-cr-fake-invoices-issued-via-23-bogus-firms-189010

This time, it has not even purchased the vaccines and swine flu cases are already being reported.The department claims it is waiting for Centre’s approval to ascertain the prevalent virus subtype this season. In the absence of vaccination, the staff at government hospital is reportedly apprehensive about attending to suspected swine flu patients.As per the National Centre for Disease Control data, Punjab has reported 68 cases and five deaths this year.Experts say medical workers are exposed to the deadly virus if not vaccinated beforehand. They say the department has already delayed vaccinating the high-risk group, as the body needs at least 21 days to develop required antibodies to fight the swine flu.A health worker in Patiala said, “They have not purchased the vaccine yet. It will be of no use if given after one month when the virus would have already infected many health workers.”A doctor at the Patiala health department said, “We have directed private hospitals to test patients for swine flu after they are tested negative for Covid.”Meanwhile, Dr Gagan Grover, state nodal officer, swine flu control programme, said they were already in talks with various suppliers to purchase the vaccine and were waiting for directions from the Centre. “The trivalent flu shot is already available in market. However, we need the quadrivalent vaccine, which is more effective. We are already in talks with the Centre and the ICMR for information on which virus strain is prevalent this season.

They, however, were disappointed at the minister giving them assurances that the matter was being examined by the Finance Department.The Centre has held back Punjab’s Rural Development Fund (RDF) worth Rs 1,200 crore, which Punjab’s Congress government alleges is an arbitrary decision. The state will lose these funds if not released by December 31, when the current Cash Credit Limit allowed to purchase paddy expires.Talking to The Tribune from Delhi, after the meeting ended late this evening, the ministers said they were just told that after the Legal Department had examined Punjab’s case, the Finance Department was examining it.“I don’t understand why they are delaying it. There is no legal sanction for this arbitrary act. In the past six decades, this fund has never been stopped. There was no explanation for stopping the fund. Punjab had given its reply to the Centre after an objection was raised in October on how the money was used for the intended purpose of rural development,” Badal told The Tribune.Food Minister Ashu said this was a statutory tax, and the Centre should release it. “But no concrete assurance has been given to us,” he rued.A letter to hold back the RDF was sent to the state on October 23, where the Centre sought information on how the state was using it. The Centre had decided to hold back the fund till the issue was sorted out.This was right in the midst of the farmers’ agitation against the farm laws and Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had taken a strong objection to it.BqArbitrary move“I don’t understand why they are delaying it. There is no legal sanction for this arbitrary act. In the past six decades, this fund has never been stopped.
