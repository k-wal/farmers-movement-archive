The department has also appointed Dr Jagdev Singh Kular, Professor, anatomy, as the new Vice-Principal of GMC.A day after inquiry into the alleged PPE kit scam begun, the Department of Medical Education and Research has removed Government Medical College Principal Dr Sujata Sharma and Vice-Principal Dr Veena Valecha from their respective posts.According to sources, the move was linked to the recent PPE kit scam at the college. The college had purchased PPE kits worth over Rs60 lakh in April to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.Insiders claim that more heads are expected to roll within the next few days, as the issue of mismanagement in funds meant for battling Covid-19 pandemic was serious.After the college made the PPE kits available to medical professionals, they complained that these were of poor quality. Later, a re-inspection committee constituted to report about the quality of these PPE kits had also rejected the kits on four grounds, including the material being non-water resistant and absence of N-95 masks with the kits.Though the committee submitted its report on April 25, the college authorities continued to sit on it for over more than two months. Local MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, who issued a grant of Rs1crore to GMC for fighting Covid-19, had written to the government demanding a probe after the allegations of medical staff.In mid-June, Aujla again wrote to the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation complaining that the inquiry was being deliberately delayed.In response, the ministry had on June 23 written to the state government to complete the inquiry in a time-bound manner. The state government then had entrusted the inquiry to Chief Administrator, Amritsar Development Authority. Beginning the probe on June 30, the investigator held the second meeting on Wednesday and recorded the statements of members of the inspection committee and nursing staff representatives.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/day-after-probe-begins-gmc-amritsar-principal-deputy-removed-107387

He said that the president of CKD had committed to furnish it, but in vain.“Till the eligibility declaration forms of all members reach the Akal Takht, CKD has been directed that no new appointments could be made”, said the jathedar.Nonetheless, before these directions could deliver, the CKD had inducted approximately 60 new members against the vacant positions during an online executive and general body meeting held on Tuesday.CKD president Nirmal Singh told that he could not attend the meeting due to domestic exigency, but assured that he would personally meet the jathedar to clarify it at the earliest. He said that a dedicated panel was always there, which ensure that every member should comply the laid down criteria and only the Gursikh should be included in the body.CKD vice-president Dr Inderbir Singh Nijjar, who had conducted the session, told that it was a communication gap due to which jathedar’s directions could not be delivered on time.“It was an online meeting already scheduled two weeks ago.

He said: “With zero earnings, it is impossible to run a household. My wife and I have been finding it difficult to manage two square meals a day. Besides, the pending school fee of our daughter has been giving us jitters. I managed to make the two ends meet for some time by utilising my savings. But for how long can one survive like that?”With a family to feed, Amritpal and his wife coined the idea of selling home-cooked kadi chawal, rajma chawal and lassi on the roadside in the industrial city of Ludhiana. The couple has turned their car into a ‘mobile Punjabi dhaba’. “It was my wife Rajwinder’s idea that we should start selling special home-cooked food,” he said.Given that businesses were shutting down, and people were being laid off in almost every sector, the idea of sitting tight, or hunting for a job seemed preposterous to him, he said.Amritpal claims that so far his effort had yielded him good results, with people either opting for takeaway option, or having the food on the roadside itself. However, by no means it was a cakewalk. “Despite the fact that we have kept it minimalisic, with no paraphernalia such as tables and chairs, the authorities have been telling us to stop selling the food. We are just making money by selling home-made Punjabi specialities, such as rajma chawal, kadi chawal and lassi,” he says. “I am also realising the shift in the attitude of people, with consumers being really apprehensive about hygiene and other safety concerns,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/savings-gone-dj-turns-food-vendor-107414

Now, the return of labourers has brought a sigh of relief for them.Just about a month after hundreds of migrants walked from one district to another and later managed to get a train to their native places in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, many of them have returned to Punjab. The remaining too are eager to come back as they are finding it difficult to sustain their families in the absence of work.Pritpal, a hosiery worker who had covered 100 km on foot to board a train to his native village in Uttar Pradesh, says: “I cannot let my children sleep on empty stomach. If I don’t work, we will die of hunger. I failed to find any work in Uttar Pradesh, so I returned. I am not scared of getting infected with Covid-19, but seeing my kids crying due to hunger is a nightmare.”Salim Mohammed, who works in horticulture fields at Patran village, says most residents of his village in Bihar are banking on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) for work. “My children were not getting proper food. So I decided to return. My average earning here is Rs 13,000 a month while lodging and boarding is free,” says Mohammed, who has worked in Punjab for over 18 years, but left in May only to return last week.Chhote Lal, who works in a plywood unit in Patiala, says: “Back home, there was no work and no money to meet even our daily needs. We called our employer here who offered us work. We thus decided to come back.”Meanwhile, the reverse migration has brought cheer to farmers, industrialists and construction contractors as their work was hit badly due to the mass exodus.Nischint Kumar, the owner of a hosiery in Ludhiana, says: “Finally, I have workers back in the mill. It is a great relief as it is our peak production season and we still have some time to meet the targets.”Labour sector experts say the state governments should ensure that all migrants should be officially registered to make it easier for them to avail financial and other benefits from the Central and state governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/migrants-return-say-hunger-bigger-threat-107409

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had extended the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY) till November.Almost 60% of the state’s population has received benefit of Centre’s two food distribution schemes — the PMGKAY and the Atmanirbhar Bharat. The state government also distributed food packets among migrants.While the Food and Supplies Department has reached out to 98 per cent of the 1.41 crore beneficiaries under the PMGKAY, 50% of the 14 lakh beneficiaries under the Atmanirbhar Bharat have received food packets comprising wheat flour, black gram and sugar.Figures available from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, show that 85% of wheat and 75% of dal have been distributed across the country under the PMGKAY. Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat food distribution scheme for migrants, only 12% beneficiaries have benefitted.“Punjab is a food bowl of India. We have already distributed additional ration (5 kg of wheat and one-kg dal per person) under the PMGKAY for three months (April- June),” said Food and Supplies Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.“Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat, we could have achieved higher targets if we did what the Centre had directed (distribute 10-kg wheat and 2-kg dal per household of five persons). However, we reduced the unit size to per person and supplemented the food to be given. We distributed 17 lakh packets, 10 kg of wheat flour , two kg of sugar and two kg of black gram/ pulses per person (migrants),” he said.Anandita Mitra, Director, Food Supplies, said, “Punjab procured 400 metric tonnes of dal, paid grinding cost of wheat into flour and 14 lakh kg of sugar for distribution. The state government has spent Rs 69 crore from its own kitty, besides spending another Rs 18 crore for supplementing the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme.”Officials said all 14 lakh beneficiaries would get food packets in a week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-surpasses-national-food-distribution-target-107410

I am fully prepared to take any steps necessary to protect the interests of the state and its farmers — Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief MinisterThe meeting saw unions unanimously passing a resolution against the ordinance on agricultural reforms and proposed amendments to the Electricity Amendment Act, urging the Centre to reconsider or withdraw the same.Satnam Singh Pannu, president, Kisan Majdoor Sangarsh Committee (Piddi group); Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president, BKU (Ekta Ujgrahan); and Surjit Singh phul, president, BKU (Krantikari); said their way of protest was different from that of political parties.Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Sunil Jakhar said the party leaders had consensus on calling the special session of the Vidhan Sabha to “expose the anti-farmer face of the BJP and the Akalis”. “It was Capt Amarinder Singh, who had enacted the Termination of Agreements Act in 2004 as the then CM,” he said.On a suggestion from Jakhar, the Chief Minister said he would get the proposal of challenging the ordinances legally examined.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-government-plans-special-session-over-farm-ordinances-107420

He was “distressed” over the proposed auctioning of the GNDTP land.The deceased has been identified as Joginder Singh Bhola (55), a resident of Cheema in Sangrur district. He had been associated with the BKU Ekta Ugrahan for long. Joginder was carrying a placard bearing a photo of Guru Nanak Dev. The placard read, “Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant is a historic place and I am sacrificing my life to stop it from being sold.”BKU Ekta Ugrahan state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said Joginder had sacrificed his life outside the thermal plant. “It seems that he had come prepared for this...,” he said.The Punjab Government should restart the GNDTP by stopping its privatisation, he said while demanding Rs 10 lakh as compensation and a job for Joginder’s family. The deceased’s kin and BKU Ekta Ugrahan workers said they wouldn’t allow postmortem until the district administration fulfilled their demands.Later, SAD’s kisan wing president Sikander Singh Maluka and former MLA Sarup Chand Singla visited the Civil Hospital and blamed the state government for Joginder’s death. They claimed that the Congress had promised during the 2017 poll to restart the thermal plant, but rather proposed to auction its land.AAP district president Navdeep Singh Jeeda also reached the hospital and blamed the state government.

Per day cooking cost for primary and upper primary student is Rs 4.97 and Rs 7.45, respectively.The state government has told DEOs to tell schools to transfer the cooking cost to the bank accounts of these children, but earlier on April 15, schools had distributed cooking cost in cash with dry ration to parents of students.Now with the directions of the state government to deposit the cooking cost in the bank accounts of students, a few teachers are raising questions over the government order, terming it a difficult job when the lockdown is in place and they are lacking safety gears. “When there are long queues in front of every bank, it is not practical to deposit Rs 372 or Rs 558 in the account of every student,” a teacher said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/13-6-lakh-to-get-mid-day-meal-ration-in-punjab-107422

The duo spoke on the occasion of the foundation day of Akal Takht today. Giani Harpreet Singh said both India and Pakistan should form a consensus to facilitate devotees to pay obeisance at Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara. Taking cognisance of the suicide committed by a youth at Nangal Shanga village in Nawanshahr after “his turban was removed by some locals” during a scuffle, Giani Harpreet Singh said those named in the video by the victim should be booked under Sections 302 and 295A of the IPC. He cautioned regarding propaganda being spread on social media against the Sikh community. “Akal Takht is not a building, but a true concept of Sikh ideology. To maintain its sanctity, unity among Sikhs is essential.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/reopen-kartarpur-corridor-jathedar-tells-centre-107423

Fruits are served only to VIPs who visit on festivals or to attend meetings.Finding these purchases suspicious, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal has suspended manager Jasvir Singh, deputy manager Lakhvinder Singh, accountant Kaur Singh, inspector Bakhshish Singh and store keeper Harmandar Singh and ordered an inquiry.Interestingly, a mere Rs 1 lakh were found in the cash box (golak) as offerings at the gurdwara during lockdown while the management entered bills of nearly Rs 2.5 lakh against purchase of fruits during the same period.In fact, due to the thin footfall, the SGPC had issued an appeal to people to send ration to gurdwaras as offerings were almost nil during the lockdown. Following this, several people from the region, including SGPC members Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa and Ajmer Singh Khera, with help of their supporters, brought truck loads of ration to Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib.This is, however, not the first irregularity unearthed by the SGPC at Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib. Recently, a scam of nearly Rs 5 lakh of fake receipts issued to devotees against ‘kadah parshad’ was also detected.SGPC secretary Mohinder Singh Ahli confirmed that five employees have been suspended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/takht-sri-kesgarh-sahib-funds-embezzled-5-suspended-107424

The protesters submitted a memorandum to the Civil Surgeon.Ranjit Kaur, president of the union, said, “The state government has decided to go ahead with fresh appointments instead of regularising services of around 2,250 multipurpose health workers who have been rendering their services for the past decade or so.

The petitioners, among other things, were seeking the quashing of order dated September 26, 2019, vide which the government rejected RMOs’ demand for being considered equivalent to PCMS doctors for awarding 30 per cent marks as incentive in postgraduate admissions.After hearing counsel for the petitioner and Punjab Additional Advocate-General Pankaj Gupta, the Bench asserted the government was following the procedure prescribed under the MCI regulations while awarding marks to the in-service candidates rendering service in rural and difficult areas in toto.The government has taken a policy decision to restrict the benefit to the PCMS doctors and not to grant it to the RMOs. Its stand is static as even prior to a notification of a regulation under the MCI regulations the benefit of reservation of seats for admission to postgraduate courses to in-service candidates was restricted only to the PCMS doctors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-upholds-punjabs-decision-on-incentive-marks-for-pg-courses-107426

These centres were opened at Lal Singh Basti, Dhobiana Basti, Janta Nagar and Jogi Nagar under the National Urban Health Mission to provide basic and primary healthcare facilities to those who are financially weak.The foundation stone of the centres was laid by the then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal along with the then Health Minister Laxmi Kanta Chawla on February 22, 2009.Despite the availability of buildings, the Health Department has failed to run these centres. The situation is such that despite huge buildings, the centres are operating as dispensaries.Adoctor posted at the health centre said: “It is for the Health Department to decide. If they have invested crores of rupees to construct the spacious building of the health centre, they must ensure that adequate staff and medical equipment is provided here. The health centre caters to a population of over 40,000. These buildings can be utilised only if officials hire more staff and provide proper medical services at the centre.”Bathinda Civil Surgeon Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu said there was a shortage of staff due to which these centres were not working to their capacity. “We send our requirements to the Health Department regularly to make sure we provide the best medical facilities to the people.

After exercising the right for only a part of a larger building, he could not avail the special benefit for the remaining portion.“The intention of the legislature was to restrict the right to recover immediate possession only to one building which may be only a part of a larger building. Hence, the landowner would be deemed to have foregone the right to seek eviction under Section 13-B of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, with respect to remaining part of the building,” Justice Anil Kshetarpal asserted.The judgment came on a bunch of petitions by Balvir Chand and other tenants though counsel Pankaj Jain. The matter was placed before Justice Kshetarpal after the rent controller ordered eviction of tenants.Jain submitted it was admitted before the rent controller that NRI Narinder Singh, one of the co-owners, had previously filed a petition under Section 13-B of the 1949 Act, which was allowed and possession of eight shops from different tenants had already been delivered. Yet, the rent controller ordered eviction of the tenant-petitioners.Alluding to the right to recover immediate possession of a building, Justice Kshetarpal asserted the word “building” as defined in the Act referred to any building or part of a building. “A part of a building also falls in definition of the word “building”.Justice Kshetarpal added: “Once the NRI elects a building which may only be a part of the building, he cannot subsequently file second petition under Section 13-B of the 1949 Act. This will be applicable not only with respect to separate building but also a part of the building which the landowner omitted to opt/elect at the time when the first petition was filed or possession whereof was not sought when the first petition was filed.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nris-can-exercise-right-to-repossess-property-only-once-107432

Industrialists maintained that under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme, the banks were sanctioned Rs 1 lakh crore to help the MSME sector. However, of the total 6.32 crore MSMEs, only 30 lakh enterprises have got the benefit so far, which is only about 5 per cent.All Industries Trade Association president Badish Jindal told The Tribune that till June 19, Rs 1,262 crore was sanctioned to the MSMEs. Of the sanctioned amount, only Rs 656 crore was released to over 51,000 units.“There are over 2.55 lakh units in Punjab, including new, sick and healthy units. The state government had promised to provide loans to the MSMEs, but the banks are not cooperating. The banks are providing loans to the healthy units only, whereas the sick units are not being entertained, and the new units are not being given loans without collateral,” said Jindal.The industry maintains that the government has come up with National Credit Guarantee Trust Company, which will provide 100 per cent security to banks. Despite that, the banks are not sanctioning the loans. The Reserve Bank of India has also instructed the banks to sanction the loans to the MSMEs with caution.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation, said the MSME owners were not satisfied with the way the banks were treating their units.“The interest rates vary from bank to bank. If the banks really want to help the sector, they should provide easy loans so that the MSMEs are back on the track after the lockdown period. Since the government has sanctioned a huge amount to banks, the latter shouldn’t be reluctant in providing loans to help the industry,” said Kular.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/credit-scheme-fails-to-bail-out-msmes-as-banks-turn-cautious-107434

A year later, he has again prepared his fields for paddy but is afraid of the future."I can't say what will happen this time, but there's no other way. It depends on the nature," he says.A resident of Mundi Cholian village, Mukhtiar had sent his son abroad two years ago after taking heavy loans. He had thought he would pay the debt after selling his paddy crop, but that didn’t happen. The son is now out of job because of the Covid pandemic. He is also unable to help the family. Now, Mukhtiar is praying that the family doesn't suffer again. He owns 10 acres and the floods had ravaged his entire crop last year.This is the tale of several farmers in the worst affected Lohian in Shahkot subdivision who have sown paddy again amid fear.Surjit Singh of Nasirpur village had to postpone the wedding plans of his daughter after his paddy crop on 14 acres got destroyed, inflicting a loss of Rs 8 lakh. Singh owns 10 acres while the remaining four are on lease.“I was looking for a suitable match for my daughter last year. I wanted to marry her off. But when I suffered a heavy loss, I decided to wait for a year. I am hoping to earn enough to marry my daughter this year,” he said.Notably, farmers have been given Rs 12,000 per acre as compensation for their loss, but they say the compensation cannot fulfill their needs.Phuman Singh, Sarpanch, Mundi Cholian, said the condition was uncertain. “The farmers are frightened. I have also suffered huge losses.
