All of those whose results came back positive on Monday were contacts of four policemen who tested positive four days ago.Barnala Civil surgeon Dr G B Singh, who is also in charge of Sangrur, confirmed the development on Monday evening----hours after news of cops testing positive had spread panic in the area.“I have ordered all policemen to get tested to prevent further spread,” Sangrur Deputy Commissioner Ramvir said.Locals meanwhile have accused health authorities of not sharing details of the development. They also accuse health authorities of neither conducting enough COVID-19 tests nor holding enough awareness drives. “It’s the failure of health department that they made tall claims of conducting testing. Such large numbers of policemen testing positive show that before the start of infection, health department authorities have neither made the cops aware nor have they conducted timely tests on policemen to prevent the spread of infection. The chief minister and health minister must look into this issue,” said a local on the condition of anonymity.“Despite the directions of Punjab CM and health minister to share the maximum details of positive patients with residents to prevent the spread of infection, the Sangrur authorities are working at their best to hide information to hide their failure, which has cost dearly to Lehra residents and cause widespread infection here,” said another resident.Sangrur’s death toll now stands at 22, with the virus killing another resident of Longowal block  at GMC Patiala on Sunday. The latest victim was a 54- year-old woman admitted to the hospital last week.  Fifteen of the 22 deaths so far are from Malerkotla, two from Amgarh and two from Sherpur and one each from  Fatehgarh Panjgrayan, Ahemdgarh and Longowal. The district currently has 96 active cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/25-cops-test-positive-in-sangrurs-lehra-sub-division-set-off-panic-in-the-area-115538

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Army jawan among 4 more nabbed in drugs and weapons smuggling case busted last week||The Punjab Police have arrested an Army jawan and three more accused in connection with the illegal arms and drug smuggling racket busted last week with the arrest of a BSF personnel and three others.The total number of persons arrested in the case so far now stands at eight, said DGP Punjab Dinkar Gupta, adding that the Punjab Police was actively engaged in following the money trail to eradicate the drug menace from the state.Giving details of the latest arrests, the DGP said that Ramandeep Singh, an Indian Army soldier, was apprehended from Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh), where he was currently posted, on the basis of disclosures made by BSF Constable Sumit Kumar, who was arrested along with three accomplices by Jalandhar (Rural) police a week ago. Ramandeep’s three accomplices, Taranjot Singh alias Tanna, Jagjit Singh alias Laddi, and Satinder Singh alias Kala, have also been arrested and are being brought on production warrants.Another Rs 10 lakh has been recovered from Kala as drug money, taking the total amount of such money seized in the case to Rs 42.30 lakh.Sumit, who belonged to the same village—Magar Mudian, PS Dorangla, district Gurdaspur, as Ramandeep, had disclosed during questioning that he was lured by his village classmate—the Army jawan—into the cross-border narco-weapons smuggling racket.The duo was also lodged together in Gurdaspur jail after committing a murder in their village.Sumit Kumar was bailed out on January 4, 2018, and Ramandeep Singh was bailed out on September 14, 2019.According to the DGP, Ramandeep was running the drugs and weapons smuggling racket in conspiracy with Taranjot Singh and Satinder Singh.Kala was, for some time, lodged in Amritsar jail, where he came in contact with Maulvi alias Mulla, a Pakistani national, who introduced him to Pakistani smugglers.Gupta said that from Amritsar jail, Satinder was shifted to Kapurthala jail where he befriended Taranjot Singh and made him an accomplice. After Kala underlined the need for involvement of a BSF man in the racket, Ramandeep Singh persuaded Sumit to join the drug smuggling module.Throwing light on the modus operandi of the gang, the DGP said that Sumit used to send photographs of the fencing, drug-delivery locations and others to Tanna and Kala.After the delivery of the consignment on the Indian side at a pre-determined time and place, three other accomplices of Tanna used to collect it from Sumit Kumar.Gupta said that Jagjit Singh used to provide his Swift car to them for transport of the drug consignments.The Director General of Police said that based on investigations carried out so far, these accused are suspected to have smuggled in 42 packets of heroin, a 9mm foreign-made pistol (with 80 live rounds and  2 live rounds of 12 bore gun) so far, adding that they had received Rs 39 lakh as drug proceeds from Pakistan based smugglers so far.He said that out of Rs 39 lakh, Rs 32.30 lakh was received by Sumit Kumar to be distributed equally between him and Ramandeep Singh.In line with its strategy of ‘following the money trail’ to hit out hard at the various pillars of the drug smuggling and supply trade, based in Pakistan, UAE and various parts of India, such as Punjab, J&K, Delhi etc, the Punjab Police have successfully busted many modules in the narco-terrorism supply chain, which is operated under the direct watch of the ISI as well as the rest of the Pak establishment to finance its terror operations, said the DGP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/army-jawan-among-4-more-nabbed-in-drugs-and-weapons-smuggling-case-busted-last-week-115507

The high court asked the school authorities to decide on applications of such parents expeditiously.The State of Punjab had filed an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana against the order of a single judge allowing the schools to charge fees regardless of whether they were offering online education and to charge actual expenses incurred for the lockdown period. The single judge had allowed parents facing financial difficulty to apply for exemption or waiver of fee.After extensively hearing parties for more than two hours on the question of interim relief, the Division Bench of the High Court, comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shankar Jha and Justice Arun Palli, orally noted that ordinarily the court would only have issued notice on the appeals, but the interim order was currently being passed given the apprehension and anxiety expressed by the AG Punjab on the effect of the judgment passed by the Single Judge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-student-to-be-struck-off-rolls-for-not-paying-fees-pending-final-decision-says-punjab-and-haryana-hc-115491

20-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala booked for promoting violence, gun culture in new song 'Sanju'||Punjab Police is set to move the Punjab and Haryana High Court for cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted in an Arms Act case to singer Sidhu Moosewala, against whom the Crime Branch booked another case on charges of promoting violence and gun culture with his latest song 'Sanju'—which was released on social media a few days ago.Sharing details, Punjab ADGP and Director Punjab Bureau of Investigations, Arpit Shukla, said the singer had been booked at Mohali, on the basis of information received that his song 'Sanju', which is trending on various social media platforms, blatantly glorifies the use of weapons and boasts about the various FIRs, including the one under the Arms Act, registered against him.The ADGP said the police would file a petition for the cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted to Moosewala by the High Court.Shukla said it had been verified that the latest video song, 'Sanju', was uploaded from Moosewala’s official YouTube channel.In the song, Moosewala makes explicit references to the case registered against him under the Arms Act, and the video starts with a news clip of him being booked in the said case by Punjab Police for unauthorised use of an AK-47 rifle.In the video, Moosewala’s news clip is later merged with news reports of film actor Sanjay Dutt having been convicted and sentenced for similar offences.Shukla said the lyrics of the song, as well as the video, promoted and glorified possession and use of illegal firearms, and boasted about registration of FIR as sign of a ‘real man’.Shukla said the lyrics of the song, “gabru de naal Santali (47) jud gayi, ghato ghat saja paanj saal vat de, gabru utte case jehra Sanjay Dutt te, jatt utte case jehra Sanjay Dutt te….; awa tawa bolde vakil sohniye, sari duniya da oh judge sunida, jithe saadi chaldi appeal sohniye… ”, not only promote the use of illegal firearms but also undermine the judiciary, the police and the advocates.Shukla said Moosewala had earlier been booked for a similar offence on February 1 this year by the Mansa police.On May 4, he was booked by the Barnala police for various offences under the Disaster Management and Arms Act after his photographs of firing an AK-47 rifle at a firing range during the curfew went viral on social media.His latest act is clearly intended not only to ridicule, mock and undermine the police but also showed that the singer is incorrigible and had repeatedly committed such offences, said Shukla.The ADGP said the Punjab and Haryana High Court had already directed the Director General of Police of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to ensure that no songs glorifying liquor, drugs and violence were played even at live shows.Even Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has expressed deep concern over the propagation of violence and gun culture in Punjabi songs and has given clear directions to the state police not to show any relaxation or concession towards such singers, who allure innocent youth into following the path of violence and hooliganism.Shukla said it seemed that with his latest song, which he seemed to wear as some sort of a badge of honour, Moosewala deliberately wanted to incite and mislead the youth of this border state, which had borne the brunt of terrorism in the '80s and '90s, by glorifying the use of AK-47 rifles and other weapons.He said Moosewala had been booked under Sections 188, 294, 504 and 120-B of the IPC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-singer-sidhu-moosewala-booked-for-promoting-violence-gun-culture-in-new-song-sanju-115428

The district had just 480 cases till July 9.Patiala on Sunday reported 80 new cases of coronavirus. Of the 80 cases, 51 are from Patiala city, three from Nabha, 11 from Rajpura, nine from Samana, and six from different villages in the district.Sources said that it was the result of people’s indifferent attitude towards social distancing.It has been learned that people are still holding kitty parties, small gatherings, and marriage functions at their residences.Sources in the health department said that a surge in cases of coronavirus was the result of the small gatherings wherein social distancing norms had gone for a toss.The health department informed that in many cases, one person had spread the virus to over 30 people. A boutique owner in Partap Nagar has tested positive and had become the source of the entire staff and their families testing positive.Similarly, a local leader in Top Khana Mor, an area in the city, has already infected over 20 people, including 16 of his family members.Another factor that has contributed to the surge in Patiala was interstate movement and then hiding of travel history.A health officer said: “Nobody wants to get quarantined as it affects one’s daily routine. But, pandemic can’t be controlled with this attitude of the people.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/coronavirus-cases-in-patiala-double-in-10-days-tally-reaches-981-115418
20-07-2020||Charanjit Singh Teja||Downpour floods Heritage Street in Amritsar||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, July 19Tall claims made by the Municipal Corporation about desilting of drains have fallen flat after heavy rain lashed the city on Sunday morning.Various places, including low-lying areas, walled city and outer ring road, were waterlogged.Several sewer lines remained choked, leading to accumulation of rainwater on the BRTS track, elevated road near Mall of Amritsar, Taylor Road, Madan Mohan Malviya Road, Batala Road outside Celebration Mall, Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Majitha Road, SSSS Chowk and Fatehgarh Churian Road. Roads leading to many tourist places, including Partition Museum and Heritage Street, were also waterlogged. Besides, the rainfall also brought forth the true picture hidden behind the glitter of the Rs250-crore Golden Temple Heritage Street project.Just before the monsoon season, Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu and senior MC officials had claimed that they were prepared and equipped to tackle the problem of water-logging in the city. They had claimed that the work of desilting of drains was done. People residing in low-lying areas flayed the authorities for poor arrangements to deal with water-logging.Ajay Khosla, a resident, said: “I am surprised after seeing water-logging even after the desilting of sewer lines. The problem of water-logging near historical sites is common and it is unfortunate that concrete steps have not been taken to resolve the issue.”Hardev Singh, a resident of Partap Nagar, said: “It is tough for people to commute safely on city roads. The water-logging problem can be seen on every road.”Most of the city areas are deprived of a storm-water drainage system. The city is dependent on sanitary sewer. It takes time to drain out rainwater. The authorities have covered all open drains, leading to a flood-like situation after a spell of rain.Despite repeated attempts, Anurag Mahajan, Superintending Engineer (Operation and Maintenance), MC, could not be contacted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/downpour-floods-heritage-street-in-amritsar-115377

20-07-2020||Vijay C Roy||The harvest of collaboration||Perturbed about his dwindling farm income, Kamalvir Singh, a marginal farmer from the nondescript village of Sirkapra in Patiala district, registered Nojvan Farmer Producer Company Limited in 2017. The idea was to assist small and marginal farmers and raise their income by involving them in an allied activity of apiculture. The initiative, which started with a few farmers, has now 580 members and a turnover that touched Rs 4.5 crore in the last fiscal.“Thanks to apiculture, members of the FPO are making their income grow without any additional burden on agriculture. More farmers are now engaging in this activity and the membership is witnessing steady growth,” says Kamalvir.The FPO has also obtained FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) certification for packaged honey products and an export certificate for bee pollen. It is also the first FPO working in this sector to export bee pollen. It has exported consignments worth Rs 1.75 crore.Many farmers in Punjab are reaping a rich harvest by joining FPOs. Gurdaspur-based FPO Young Innovative Farmers’ Producers Organisation was registered in 2015 with the objective of increasing farmers’ income through collective production and marketing. The FPO has around 230 members and deals with production, collection and marketing of milk and milk products. It has also started a farm machinery bank for members and other farmers.“We have also opened a sales outlet of animal feed. We supply quality animal feed at reasonable rates to the members. The net profit in the fiscal year 2019-20 was around Rs 7 lakh, which was passed on to the members,” says Avtar Singh Sandhu, president of the FPO.Another FPO, the Rupnagar Producer Company Ltd (RPCL), was registered in April 2013. The FPO was promoted by NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) and Ambuja Cement Foundation. Beginning with 10 farmers, at present over 310 farmers are shareholders in the company. The FPO clocked a turnover of Rs 3 crore in the last fiscal. It is engaged in diverse sectors: sale of pesticides and fertilisers, farm machinery bank, procurement of foodgrains and an aggregator for biomass.“The FPO has also acquired an arhtiya licence to procure the produce. By way of sharing of proceeds, the FPO gives additional benefit to farmers through wheat and paddy procurement over and above the MSP,” says Sanchit Sharma, CEO of the FPO.Small and marginal farmers in the state face stumbling blocks such as rising cost of cultivation, no assured market, lack of access to modern technologies and quality inputs. As a result, they are not able to realise optimal productivity and remunerative price for their produce. Through FPOs, the famers can have access to benefits such as quality agri-inputs and extension services. Besides economy of scale in their operations, this has resulted in increased bargaining power for them.Promoted by NABARD, there are 103 FPOs working in various sectors, with each FPO having 100-200 farmers as members. The FPOs are engaged in activities such as input supply, seed production, vegetable farming, dairy processing, processed food, honey production and marketing. A few have started custom-hiring centres for farm machinery.Although many FPOs are still in a nascent stage, they have, on the whole, brought about visible change in collectivising the operations of small and marginal farmers.“The Centre’s decision to set up 10,000 more FPOs is a step in the right direction as these will be promoted under a uniform policy. However, the key factor will be implementation and monitoring,” said Puneet Singh Thind, president, Northern Farmers’ Mega FPO. The FPO provides handholding to farmers, right from the formation of the FPO to the marketing of products.“The announcement by the Centre will go a long way in promoting processing and value addition in farm produce which is restricted to the wheat-paddy cycle,” says JPS Bindra, NABARD’s chief general manager, Punjab regional office.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/the-harvest-of-collaboration-115287

Nurses and workers are not responsible for the goof-up. We have demanded an impartial investigation so that the blame is not shifted onto lower-rung workers. —Narinder Kumar, Employee union leaderOn the other hand, nurses and Class IV workers have threatened to go on a strike. “The authorities are looking for scapegoats.

The hospital has also been fined Rs 33,000 as costs, separately.Harbhajan Singh had his knees replaced at the Orthonova Joint and Trauma Hospital in May 2016. The family said that few days later, he complained of severe pain and infection, following which he was re-admitted. His right knee was operated upon once again. The “excruciating pain” continued even afterwards and he was operated upon a third time in July.The family said Harbhajan Singh had to be admitted to the Punjab Institute of Medical Science (PIMS), Jalandhar, on July 29 where he showed no signs of improvement. The patient was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, on September 11, 2016. However, he had to be rushed to the Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, on his way. He was referred to the PGI next day but died on the way.The hospital, on its part, contended that the order had ignored the opinion of the special board constituted by the civil surgeon, which was not fair. The board included Dr Basant Rai, Assistant Professor, Medical College, Amritsar; Dr Rakesh Kumar Chopra, Forensic Specialist; and Hardev Singh, Ortho Specialist. The board opined that there was no medical negligence during the treatment of the patient.Talking to The Tribune, Dr Harpreet Singh of Orthonova Hospital said: “We do not agree with the order because it ignored the report of the medical board on giving a clean chit to our hospital. We will, very soon, be approaching the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission against the state commission order.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jalandhar-hospital-told-to-pay-rs-35l-for-medical-negligence-115141

Losing all hope, the 28-year-old arrived at the District Hospital, Mohali, which rose to the occasion and created a special isolation wing for her delivery within hours.Thus, the hospital, known as a ‘VIP cradle’ and for ‘lacking enthusiasm for work’, became one of the few in the state to have successfully handled the delivery of a Covid patient. When a large number of tertiary care hospitals, including ‘premier institutes’, have refused treatment to patients, the Mohali hospital has offered OPD services to 1 lakh patients between March 15 and July 15.Manoj, a resident of Chandigarh’s Sector 43, who works as a washerman, was in the hospital on Saturday for the delivery of his wife. “We were not attended to by doctors at government hospitals in Chandigarh, so we came here,” he said.“Our services remain open 24x7 and even on holidays and Sundays. During the pandemic, around 1,500 deliveries were conducted at the hospital, including 522 C-section and 215 high-risk cases,” said Dr Areet Kaur, Senior Medical Officer and incharge of the hospital. The hospital has conducted 137 major surgeries, including 88 laparoscopic surgeries, 10 knee replacements, a hip replacement and 38 cataract surgeries during this period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/for-pregnant-covid-patient-mohali-dist-hospital-sets-up-special-facility-115145

This data, in turn, is being used by the administration and health experts to keep the infection rate down. Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ishfaq is regularly in touch with IIT Associate Dean V Kamakoti to ensure that the software is used to its maximum potential. Ishfaq said: “The software uses data of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) pertaining to positive patients and also identifies the places visited by them in the past 15 days based on their mobile phone location. It provides information about action spots where there is an immediate threat of an outbreak and about emerging spots where there is no immediate threat, but which can become hotspots if precautions are not taken.

20-07-2020||Ruchika M Khanna||In the test of online teaching, ITIs rank high||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 19Madan Lal (46), an instructor at ITI-Fazilka, had never worked on a computer. His phone was nothing more than a medium to receive and make calls and messages. But that was in the pre-Covid era. Nearly four months after the pandemic hit the country, he is now a pro at using the phone and computer for teaching motor mechanic skills to his students.For five days a week, he goes to his friend’s mechanic workshop in Fazilka and any vehicle that comes for repair becomes his teaching tool for students — all connected to him through a Zoom video call.His student Ankush Harjai says though he misses the regular classroom experience, at least his training is not being affected due to the closure of ITIs. Son of a commission agent, he says the initial anxiety of losing a year because of the inability of educational institutes to begin regular classes is gone and he now finds some semblance of normalcy in his life in the midst of the pandemic.Like Ankush, there are 28,000 other students across Punjab who feel the present adversity has brought out the best in the Technical Education Department. Known for their rather casual approach to skill training, the 117 ITIs in the state have emerged as a sound media of imparting skills by adapting to various online facilities. Around 75 per cent of the work is based on practical training.Anurag Verma, Principal Secretary, Technical Education, says initially, it seemed difficult to shift to online classes, considering the little knowledge of computer and other online teaching aids. “But since we realised early on that the battle is a long one, which requires a completely new way of teaching, we moved quickly in that direction,” he says.‘Ensure admissions on 90 per cent seats’Anurag Verma, Principal Secretary, Technical Education, has asked principals of government polytechnic colleges to ensure that 90 per cent seats are filled. He has warned of strict action, including issuing a ‘chargesheet’ to the employees, if they fail to meet the target.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-the-test-of-online-teaching-itis-rank-high-115147

Instead, the regulator has mandated that fixed charges be recovered in six monthly instalments beginning from September.Stand By Our Promise: MinisterThe minister says he has made announcement to waive fixed charges for MSME units and he stands by his promiseDue to the unprecedented conditions created by Covid-19 which necessitated a complete lockdown in the state, the government had decided to exempt fixed charges for medium supply (MS) and large supply (LS) industrial consumers for the next two months starting from March 23 and to fix energy charges to commensurate with reduction in fixed charges (single rate).Read also: Industry condemns ‘U-turn’ on fixed charges by PSPCLTaking suo motu cognisance of the government directions, the PSERC ruled in its orders: “Keeping in view the difficulties faced by LS/MS/ non-residential supply (NRS) consumers due to the lockdown, the commission, in exercise of its power conferred under relevant regulations, decides to defer the payment of pending amount of the fixed charges of two months starting from March 23 for MS, LS (industrial) and NRS (commercial) consumers.”The commission allowed the recovery of these deferred fixed charges in six equal monthly instalments without any late payment surcharge while laying down that the first instalment will be raised in the bill of September and the last in the bill of February 2021. It further stipulated that no connection shall be disconnected for non- payment of these arrears till March 31, 2021, and, thereafter, action will be taken as per the provisions of the Supply Code Regulations.Upset over the reversal of government orders, the industry has termed it a betrayal.Badish K Jindal, national president, All Industries and Trade Forum, condemned the non-fulfillment of the promise of waiver of charges by the government. He said the PSERC decision for recovery of charges was a big jolt to the industry.Jindal said, “The government must intervene and offer to bear the financial burden of fixed charges for the industry for two months which are less than Rs 300 crore as the government has saved over Rs 350 crore of subsidy payable to industrial consumers due to complete closure of industrial units for over two months.”Meanwhile, industrialists of Mandi Gobindgarh also resented the PSERC move. They held an emergency meeting and urged the CM to keep his promise else they would be forced to shut the industry and stage a protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/power-regulator-reverses-govt-move-on-fixed-charge-waiver-115148

Apart from AAP and other parties, rebel Akali leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has also supported the protest.Earlier, the SAD had said there was nothing wrong with the ordinances, which were aimed at the ‘One India, One Market’ move of the Centre. However, several organisations of farmers criticised the move saying it would end the ensured purchase of wheat and paddy on the MSP.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday offered to lead a delegation of farm groups to seek a clarification on the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce Ordinance-2020 from Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, even as he made a categorical announcement that the SAD would always stand with the farmers and never allow tinkering with the MSP or assured marketing of foodgrain.He said, “Nothing is more important to us than the welfare of farmers. We are ready to make any sacrifice for them. We have a policy of zero tolerance on the issue.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akalis-to-lead-delegation-to-seek-clarity-on-ordinances-115149

Now, nearly 800 experts from the fields of information technology, forensic science, law and intelligence would be recruited in the civilian domain structure of the BoI.Effective investigationDetectives, prosecutors and forensic experts in civilian dress will help and guide the investigation process. —Dinkar Gupta, DGPThis cadre would comprise non-uniformed officials, while another about 3,450 uniformed personnel in different ranks would also be recruited in due course of time.Though the move is being hailed by police officials and academicians across the country, questions remain on whether the government would be able to make merit-based recruitment since a similar experiment to hire civilian intelligence officers in 2016-17 had failed.In the first batch of 25 such officers, 21 were from Jalalabad, the home constituency of the then Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. The recruitments, done before the 2017 Assembly elections, were scrapped by the Congress after coming to power.DGP Dinkar Gupta said: “The department has undertaken recruitments for other ranks for quite some time now. We are in the process of establishing a board of experts and experienced police officers known for their integrity to supervise the recruitment in civilian domain on the basis of merit.”Having pushed the proposal ever since he took over in February 2019, Gupta said measures to check back-door entry would be taken by conducting a written examination, followed by an interview and physical fitness test. For this, the selection of the vendor would be through open bids.The online entrance test would be in the form multiple set of computer-based question papers where the secure delivery of question papers in encrypted mode at each test centre would be ensured.Biometric webcam registration of candidates at the venue of computer-based examination, besides CCTV surveillance and other measures would be taken. The eligibility would be graduation at the entry level in the field of expertise. “In-house experts can also apply,” said Gupta.On the need for civilian experts, the DGP said: “At present, police personnel look into every aspect of the crime, right from the crime spot to the court, while doing other duties. The BoI will take up serious crimes such as murders, rapes and other offences as is done in the Western countries such as the US and Canada, where detectives and prosecutors in civilian dress along with forensic experts help and guide the investigation on a daily basis.”Previous trialA similar experiment to hire civilian intelligence officers in 2016-17 had failed.

Closure of shops resulted in loss of perishable food items, including fruit, vegetables and dairy products.Though farmers were able to harvest their crop on time, they were not satisfied with the coupon system introduced at grain markets. Highlighting the positive impact of the lockdown, farmers reported use of family labour for agricultural activities and sharing of costly farm machinery. Of 502 farmers who participated in the survey, a large number said they were following health guidelines. The study was conducted by Dr Kiranjot Sidhu, Dr Sukhdeep Mann and Dr Ritu Mittal of the PAU.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/study-farmers-incurred-losses-due-to-curbs-115151

They feel the heritage character of the station may not remain intact after the makeover.Not Yet Received Makeover Guidelines: DRMThe Indian Railways Station Development Corporation (IRSDC) is in the process of finalising a company to redevelop and beautify the over 150-year-old railway station into a modern entity with residential flats, shopping malls and educational institutes with a budget of Rs 375 crore.The holy city is among the four places, including Nagpur, Gwalior and Sabarmati, where railway stations are to be redeveloped.Prof Balvinder Singh, spatial conservation planner and former head of Sri Guru Ram Dass School of Planning, Guru Nanak Dev University, said any development work, despite being on the lines of contemporary architecture, must take into account the historic value of the structure.Heritage lovers are irked with the Railways over the changes being made on the façade of the Victorian-style architecture of the local railway station, which came into being in 1859. As per the guidelines of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, the colour, texture, scale and design of heritage buildings should not be changed. The guidelines entail that the originality, traditional material, techniques and craftsmanship of century-old buildings should be maintained.Mohan Singh, a retired professor, said the local railway station was of historic importance as it was among the first railway stations constructed by the British in Punjab.Railways officials said the new design for the railway station was introduced in conformity with the Sikh architecture about a decade ago and the architectural designs of the Golden Temple and Khalsa College were taken as role models.Rajesh Aggarwal, Divisional Railway Manager, said his office had not yet received any guidelines regarding the proposed beautification plan of the railway station.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-railway-station-facelift-worries-experts-115154

However, despite a provision of cash awards for coaches in the policy, no such remuneration has been given to them.‘Effort not recognised’When athletes were awarded by CM Capt Amarinder Singh in 2018, their coaches were not even invited to the event. The government should give cash rewards to all coaches and recognise their efforts. —Sukhdev Singh Pannu, Coach“The government, media and even people at large praise and recognise only the players when they win medals. No one talks about the backstage heroes — the coaches,” said a coach, requesting anonymity.Mohinder Singh Dhillon (68), the man behind ace shot put player of Punjab, Tejinder Pal Toor, says coaches sacrifice a lot to train players, but it usually goes unnoticed.“We (me and Toor) have produced world-class results...but the government is not recognising the efforts we are putting in.

20-07-2020||Harshraj Singh & Aakanksha N Bhardwaj||Labour dwellings a hurdle in fight against Covid in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana/Jalandhar, July 19Sangeeta (name changed) wakes up at 3 am to go to the toilet. She wants to avoid any confrontation with her neighbours in the vehra (cluster of small dwelling units) of Ward No. 78 in Jalandhar. Her vehra has only two toilets for more than 60 residents.The story is no different for 28-year-old migrant Puneet Kumar, who lives in Dhandari in Ludhiana. The vehra has only six toilets for around 300 people.Such vehras in the Industrial Area, Focal Point, Sanjay Gandhi Nagar, Shiv Nagar and Gadaipur in Jalandhar offer similar living conditions to migrants, who are staying in cramped quarters. And things are no different in congested settlements at Prem Nagar, Dhandari, Giaspura, Sherpur and other villages outside Ludhiana, but within the municipal limits.These squalid living quarters are home to thousands of migrants. A small vehra has about 20 rooms and a bigger one has 100 or even more. Each room houses four to five persons, who mostly cook within the same space.Jasmeet Singh of the Karkhana Mazdoor Union, Ludhiana, said poor sanitary conditions were a major worry at the vehras.The authorities conceded that a sizable number of the vehras were illegal constructions. These had inadequate drinking water supply. The toilets were much less than adequate in a majority of vehras. The sewers, more than often, could be seen overflowing.Karnesh Sharma, Municipal Corporation Commissioner, Jalandhar, said a survey was held in the city and soon, public toilets would be constructed as per the requirement.On the other hand, a large number of people staying in such close proximity is another cause of worry, especially during the Covid pandemic.RK Yadav, a resident of Giaspura, said: “Our rooms are generally very small. During the day, labourers go out for work but in the evening, huge gatherings are seen at the vehras.”Dr TP Singh, Assistant Health Officer, Civil Hospital, Jalandhar, said a single infection in these crowded quarters could lead to a big trouble. Dr Ramesh Bhagat, District Epidemiologist, Ludhiana, said Covid cases had been reported from certain vehras in the city. Talks were on with the government to make a plan to shift the dwellers of such vehras to a safe place if more cases were reported, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/labour-dwellings-a-hurdle-in-fight-against-covid-in-punjab-115139
