The main purpose of organising the party was to reconfirm that we all are united,” said Narinderpal Singh, Head Granthi of Gurdwara Sahib.Members of Muslim community said visiting the historic gurdwara was not a new thing for them as they had been coming to this gurdwara since their birth.“Every time whenever pass this gurdwara, we bow our head because our religion has been teaching us to respect all religions,” said a local member of Muslim community after offering namaz in gurdwara.It is not first time that local gurdwara has taken steps to strengthen their ties with local Muslims, but after the lockdown in March, the gurdwara management committee had started serving langar to a local Madrassa, where students of others states were stuck.Apart from serving langar to Madrassa students, gurdwara management committee had also served langar to around 1,000 other needy and poor residents of city during lockdown.“We have defeated corona in Punjab because we have the blessings of all religions. Last night’s party was another example of brotherhood,” said Manjit Singh Brar, SP Malerkotla.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/muslims-offer-namaz-in-malerkotla-gurdwara-attend-roza-opening-party-89415

Peddiraju, one of the sons said.“My other siblings — two other brothers and two sisters could not believe their eyes when they saw our missing father in a TikTok video of Punjab’s Ludhiana Police.”The children saw two men hand over a food packet to Venkateshwarlu, who was seen walking with the help of a walker.In the video, a Punjab Police Head Constable as part of the social service helped the needy during the cronavirus pandemic, especially the beggars and people living on the streets. The children saw that their father was trying to communicate in a sign language and pointed out that he could not hear or speak. They became sure that this was their father.Peddiraju approached his state’s police, who got in touch with their Punjab counterparts and after confirming that the man featured in the video is Venkateshwarlu issued the former a movement pass to travel down to Ludhiana in a car on Saturday. “I was so happy to meet my father after such a long time. It was painful to see him begging on the roads, but thank God we finally found him,” Peddiraju told local media.The old man had gone missing in April 2018 after he left home to look for a job as a daily wager. They don’t know how he reached Ludhiana, but they think that in an inebriated state he may have boarded a train and landed in Punjab. A police complaint was filed but in vain.Peddiraju said his father had developed an injury in the leg which will be shown to the doctors in Hyderabad, once the lockdown is lifted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-police-food-distribution-video-helps-unite-telangana-man-with-family-89394

24-05-2020||---||Punjab CM asks DCs to ensure no migrant forced to walk to hometowns or goes hungry||Chandigarh, May 24Asserting that it was his government’s duty to ensure that all migrants, keen to go back home, return to their native states safely, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Sunday, directed all Deputy Commissioners and district police chiefs to ensure that no migrant was forced to walk to hometowns or to remain hungry while in Punjab.Any migrant found walking on the road should be transported by bus by the police to the nearest place from where he could board a train or bus to his native state, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh directed the DCs and the police officials, even as the 300th Special Shramik Train left the state carrying migrants to Uttar Pradesh. Till they leave Punjab, they should be provided food and water, Captain Amarinder Singh has further directed the officers, a press release by the government said.Urging migrants not to panic, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh assured that the state government would make sure that every single migrant, who was keen to return home, was assisted by the state, with arrangements for their free travel and food.Underlining the state’s commitment to “look after every person in distress”, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh described the migrants as “our fellow Indians who contribute to the State and its economy”.“Punjab is your ‘karma-bhoomi’, even if it is not your ‘janam-bhoomi’,” said Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh to migrants, appealing to them not to try to undertake an arduous journey by foot to their native places as the state government was making all necessary arrangements for their travel by trains or buses.The Chief Minister disclosed that more than 10 lakh persons have registered on the state portal for outbound movement from Punjab. The state government has undertaken a massive validation exercise of all registered persons by making individual phone calls to re-ascertain whether or not they were keen to return to their native states.“This is being done in view of the fact that in the past three to four days, around two-thirds of the industrial units in the state have commenced operations after the easing of restrictions, following which the number of persons keen to travel out of Punjab has reduced considerably,” Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said, terming it a welcome sign.However, the state government would continue to ply trains to the concerned states till such time persons evince a desire to return home, said Captain Amarinder, adding that the state government had had already paid Rs 20 crore to the Railways for free travel of migrant workers to their respective states, following its decision in April-end to provide free travel and food for all migrant workers keen to return to their respective states, the press release from the state government further read.Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh shared that the 300th Special Shramik train, on Sunday, departed from Patiala for Uttar Pradesh at 5 pm.By Sunday night, as many as 311 Special Shramik trains, carrying more than 3.9 lakh passengers would have been sent from different districts of Punjab to various states of India, including sates of southern India and the north-east.In addition, migrant workers are also being transported free of charge from their homes to the railway stations by government buses across the state. Punjab has also sent state transport buses to drop migrant workers to districts of western Uttar Pradesh without any charge to the migrants, the press release said.“Punjab’s officers, both in the state headquarters as well as in the districts, have done a commendable job in facilitating this organised movement of migrants,” said the Chief Minister.At the same time, the state government is also facilitating Punjabis stranded in other states to return to Punjab, including providing financial assistance for travel, wherever necessary.Captain Amarinder, however, expressed the hope that “all state governments will abide by their responsibility of transporting our persons stranded in other states.”The Chief Minister said he had already written to all concerned Chief Ministers in this regard.Allaying concerns on this count amid the fears of COVID-19, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh further said clear protocols were in place for quarantine and testing of such travellers, to check further spread of the virus in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-asks-dcs-to-ensure-no-migrant-forced-to-walk-to-hometowns-or-goes-hungry-89374

When it comes in contact with the Himalayas, it brings rains to the hills and plains.

24-05-2020||Minna Zutshi||Sahir’s Ludhiana fails him||In the 1980s, noted Urdu poet late Kaifi Azmi came to Ludhiana to attend an event organised by the Progressive Writers’ Association. Later he expressed his desire to visit the place that housed Sahir Ludhianvi’s memorabilia — a place that, he supposed, would be the literary and cultural hub for poets and writers in Ludhiana. He said, “Mein salaam karney ke liye unke ghar jaana chahta hoon.”But to his surprise, Kaifi found that there was no place in the city dedicated to the memory of the poet. He then did what he thought was the next best — he stood on the Jagraon bridge and paid his respects to the poet who had chosen to make the city a part of his identity.Also read: Lyrics straight from the heartAnother progressive writer, poet and critic, late Ali Sardar Jafri, on his visit to the city, expressed “huge disappointment and pain” on Ludhiana’s failure to honour the memory of Sahir, whose formative years were spent in the city.Strangely, for the poet who embraced the name of the city as his very identity, Ludhiana on its part has not chosen to keep him alive in public memory, says Sahir’s friend and author Dr Kewal Dheer. Recounting an incident revealing Sahir’s feelings for the city, Dr Dheer says, “We had invited Sahir for a mushaira in Ludhiana. We got a few envelopes ready so that these could be given to the participating poets as ‘token of our appreciation’. Sahir simply refused to accept it. “Mehmaan nahi hoon. Mezbaan hoon (I am not a guest. I’m a host),” was the poet’s clinching argument.Dr Kewal DheerLack of vision, petty politics, bureaucratic wrangling — each and every factor played its part in not letting a cultural centre on Sahir come up.Sahir was born as Abdul Hayee in Sekhewal village (now in the Ludhiana East Assembly constituency) in 1921. His mother later moved to his maternal grandparents’ place in the Karimpura area in Ludhiana. Not many in the city are familiar with Sahir’s soul-stirring poetry, particularly the literary poetry that fired the imagination of the youth in his times. Sahir did not merely pen his thoughts or give vent to his emotions, he also documented the then-India, as Delhi-based filmmaker Rajesh Badal remarks. Sahir’s first long nazm Parchhaiyan focused on the dehumanising aspects of war.“We cannot ignore the fact that we failed to tell the youth about Sahir and his literary greatness. Lack of sensitivity, commercialisation of culture, coupled with a consumerist approach have been responsible for this lack of interest,” says Dr Dheer, who has penned two books on Sahir — Dastan-e-Sahir, Sahir Ludhianvi — Sahiri Aur Shayeri.Down memory laneDr Ravinder Vatsyayan from Ludhiana has “endearing memories” of his meeting with Sahir at SCD Government College in 1970. Sahir had come to the college for a match between old and new students. Vatsyayan was given the duty of holding his coat. He wore it the entire day as a badge of honour!Lost in a legal-political mazePoets, writers and lovers of Urdu language in Ludhiana resolved to construct a memorial for Sahir. In 1995, the then-Chief Minister Beant Singh released a grant of Rs65 lakh for the construction of Sahir Cultural Centre. However, in August 1995, Beant Singh was assassinated and the cultural centre remained a stillborn idea. “Lack of vision, petty politics, bureaucratic wrangling — each and every factor played its part in not letting the cultural centre come up,” says Dr Dheer adding what was worse was that a signboard near Fountain Chowk Road that was to be rechristened as ‘Sahir Ludhianvi Marg’was unceremoniously removed. The silver lining The SCD Government College, however, has acknowledged the literary and cinematic achievements of its alumnus Sahir Ludhianvi. Dr Amarjit Hayer, who retired as Professor of Journalism, Languages and Culture from Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, says that the college has acknowledged Sahir’s literary greatness. “Sahir penned two poems on his alma mater. The college, during its Golden Jubilee celebrations in 1970, invited Sahir and awarded him a gold medal.” The college, which had once asked Sahir to quit, finally recognised his accomplishments.“The college takes pride in the achievements of Sahir Ludhianvi. The SCD Government College is celebrating his centenary year. We look forward to celebrating the poet’s birth centenary in 2021,” says the college principal Dr Dharam Singh Sandhu, as he proudly shows the group photo of Sahir and his classmates displayed in the college gallery. The college auditorium and also the botanical garden are named after the poet.Sahir Ludhianvi’s fans too have been trying their best to keep his memories alive. The Sahir Ludhianvi Library in Punjabi Bhawan received funds from former Chief Election Commissioner of India Dr MS Gill, also an alumnus of the SCD Government College. Dr Kewal Dheer has been keeping the banner of the annual Jashn-e-Sahir mushaira afloat. Sahir himself had attended this mushaira in1975.Sahir and AmritaAt a public event in Lahore where Sahir read Taj Mahal, there was “a slim, delicate and extremely beautiful young girl” in the queue. Instead of the customary autograph book, she extended her hand. Sahir wrote on her palm: “I have signed a blank cheque. You can cash it any time.” The girl was Amrita Pritam! Amrita’s love for Sahir was intense. A couplet she wrote for him, says: “Maine toot ke pyaar kiya tum se/ kya tumne bhi utna kiya mujh se?(Source: Literary critic and author Gopi Chand Narang, in his foreword to Surinder Deol’s book Sahir: A Literary Portrait)EnchanterIn the mid-1930s Abdul Hayee selected Sahir (magician, enchanter) as his takhallus. The inspiration for adopting ‘Sahir’ as his takhallus was Mohammad Iqbal’s couplet: “Is chaman mein honge paida bulbul-e-sheraaz bhi, sainkron sahir bhi honge saahib-e-eijaaz bhi”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sahirs-ludhiana-fails-him-89273
24-05-2020||Gurnaaz Kaur||Uma Gurbaksh Singh took Punjabi theatre to new heights||At the tender age of 13, she took up the baton to take Punjabi theatre to greater heights and succeeded. Uma Gurbaksh Singh, fondly called the first lady of Punjabi theatre, passed away at the age of 93. Needless to say, the loss is humongous and memories galore.From being the first female actor in the Punjabi play “Raj Kumari Latika” in 1939, when women were not expected to act or be part of theatre in any capacity, to doing a role of a lover alongside her elder brother Navtej Singh, her entry was etched in time.But that was just the beginning, quite a progressive one at that. Soon, she headed protest plays as part of the nationalist movement. Uma Gurbaksh was among the seven female artistes, who was imprisoned for staging the play “Hulle Hulare” against the British rule in India.Her love for theatre and the way she promoted it is reckoned by one and all. “She lived a beautiful life and her contribution to Punjabi theatre is unmatched. She patiently promoted the art and would come to watch plays, attend seminars and be a part of script readings until recently,” shares Kewal Dhaliwal, president, Punjab Sangeet Natak Akademi.In Preet Nagar, she was instrumental in bringing about an auditorium, which Dhaliwal says, is on a par with any international conference hall.“For the past 20 years, every third Wednesday a show is presented at the auditorium. She took great care of the artistes; from their stay to their meals, she made sure everything was looked after.” Uma was an inspiration for many more girls. Following in her footsteps and with her support, several of her women friends joined theatre. That’s when they became a group of seven. According to playwright and theatre director Sahib Singh, “Even in jail, she protested. It reflects how daring she was as a person,” Singh said.Even after being so educated and forward, Uma chose to stay close to her roots and not move to a city. She was a fine classical singer, a sitarist and wrote stories for kids.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/uma-gurbaksh-singh-took-punjabi-theatre-to-new-heights-89108
24-05-2020||---||Amritsar remembers legacy left behind by this theatre stalwart||Uma Gurbaksh Singh, a stalwart of Punjabi theatre’s history and the city’s legacy, passed away on Saturday morning after a prolonged illness. She was 93 and had been bedridden for the past few months. She was cremated in the presence of her family members and personalities from theatre and literary field.Uma Gurbaksh paved the wayUma Gurbaksh Singh was born at Khana Baluchistan, in undivided India, on July 27, 1927The journey of Punjabi theatre got a novel swing, when Punjabi novelist Gurbakhsh Singh ‘Preet Lari’ established a township ‘Preet Nagar’ in Amritsar in 1938. She introduced the concept of open air theatre and gave Punjabi theatre its first female actor with his daughter Uma Gurbaksh Singh CorporationShe had the lead role in his play Rajkumari Latika alongside Gurbaksh Singh’s eldest son Navtej Singh in 1939, another bold move considering the time that got people talkingKewal Dhaliwal, president, Punjab Sangeet Natak Akademi, who has extensively researched about her work and legacy, said: “With her entry to theatre, many more girls got encouraged and they started participating in plays being staged at Preet Nagar. One among them was Rajinder Kaur, who later adopted the cine-name of Achla Sachdev. Apart from being a theatre artiste, she was a writer, singer and also played sitar very well.”She gained exposure by meeting many of her contemporaries and senior writers in Preetmilnis held at Preet Nagar including many upcoming and established writers, artists such as Irish great grandmother of Punjabi theatre, Norah Richards; Punjabi writers Dhani Ram Chatrik, Amrita Pritam, Mohan Singh Mahir, Balwant Gargi, Balraj Sahni and Urdu writers Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi and Mulk Raj Anand. She also performed musical plays being staged by a troupe led by opera director Shiela Bhatia. She shared stage with Sarod Maestro Ali Akbar Khan, great Sitarist Ravi Shankar and versatile theatre artiste Benoy Roy, when musical play named ‘Immortal India’ was staged at open-air theatre, Lawrence Garden, Lahore.Her courage off and on stage was well-known. Her younger brother Hridaypal Singh, who is the general secretary of Gurbaksh Singh Nanak Singh Foundation, had once shared: “In 1945, she was arrested by the British government along with her six female companions for performing ‘Hullehullare’ that had often repeated musical dialogue Kaddeo bahar firangi noon, kardeo paar firangi noon, (push out the foreigner, throw away the foreigner).”“She believed in good social behaviour, discipline and hard work. Even at 93, I had never seen her tired or gloomy. On the contrary, she was very affable, never a wrinkle appeared on her forehead,” shared Dhaliwal. In her later years, she mostly remained in the background, extending support to one and all. “Probably why, nothing much has been written about this first female artiste of Punjabi theatre till today,” says Dhaliwal, adding excerpts from one of his interactions with her.She had said: “Never mind, if I do not act now, if I do not sing now, but by getting plays staged here, by listening to music performed here every month, I have not allowed the actress in me to die. When I see young girls on stage, I feel relieved that the courage we had once shown has not gone waste.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amritsar-remembers-legacy-left-behind-by-this-theatre-stalwart-89156

To attract investment, builders offer assured returns to investors till the issuance of a completion certificate.The certificates issued to incomplete projects by the Zirakpur MC were meant to be used by the builders to stop payment of the promised monthly returns.The matter was exposed after some investors approached the senior authorities.Now, the certificates issued last year would also be probed. Local Government Minister Brahm Mohindra has directed the chief vigilance officer (CVO) of the department to probe the matter.In an interim report, the CVO had pointed out that all certificates issued by the Zirakpur MC last year were illegal, as only the Minister-in-charge and the Secretary were competent to accord technical approval before issuing of the certificates by the EO concerned.The department then cancelled the certificates issued by Executive Officer Manvir Singh Gill in the last five months. The EO has already been placed under suspension. “Now the department would cancel all certificates issued since October last year. A public notice is being issued asking the builders concerned to again apply for the certificates,” said an official.Pointing to a larger builder-official-politician nexus, the certificates issued to incomplete projects by the MC were meant to be used by the builders to stop payment of assured monthly returns to their investors. The scam was exposed after some investors reportedly approached the authorities concerned.Sources said the suspended EO, who is said to have the backing of a Congress leader from Dera Bassi, had initially stated that he had not issued any certificates.But after facing pointed queries from the vigilance teams, he reportedly admitted to issuing the certificates. The vigilance is struggling to get its hands on the entire record pertaining to the projects, it is learnt.The EO had not even carried out physical verification of the projects for issuing fire safety no-objection certificate or giving permissions for sewerage and water connections and setting up of sewage treatment plant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/department-to-probe-completion-certificates-issued-last-year-in-zirakpur-89047

In many cases, it has been nearly a month since they last heard from the authorities. Driven away from the railway station by the police, they are now camping under flyovers in the city.Most of the crowd comprises jobless workers and their families from Faridkot, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Jalandhar. Those from neighbouring districts had heard that they were required to board the train from Jalandhar.The district administration has so far sent 79,800 labourers to various destinations via 66 trains. With the city’s underpasses becoming migrants’ abode, many vendors have opened small shops to cater to their daily needs.Putting up at Pathankot bypass, Munna Alam, a native of Betiyan (Bihar), shows his bruised arm. He alleges that he was beaten up by the police while queuing up at one of the screening centres in Jalandhar. He has tried six times to get on to a train to Bihar, but to no avail.Similarly, Sudhir Kumar, who came from Faridkot, says, “I came here day before yesterday. There was no train from Faridkot. I got registered and also got the message, but never got the green signal. The wait seems endless.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/awaiting-nod-to-board-train-migrants-camp-under-flyovers-89063

The situation has become alarming in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic that affects lungs and given the scenario, the paddy stubble burning cases are likely to rise.Following shortage of labour to prepare their fields for the paddy season starting next month, farm fire figures touched 11,844, the highest since 2018. In 2019, the number was 10,114. The period in all these years was from April 15 to May 22. Moga and Ferozepur top the chart with 1,016 and 972 cases, respectively, in this post-harvest season.Till date, as against the Rs 6.10 crore penalties already imposed against farmers by the state agencies, a little over Rs 1 lakh has been collected only.As per information collected by The Tribune, over 2 lakh farm fire incidents have been reported in the past seasons from 2017 to 2020, but only a few farmers were penalised.Sources said with poor recovery of fines and not enough steps to penalise erring farmers, hundreds of them resorted to burning stubble. “No outfit or leader is willing to speak on this issue, fearing a political backlash from the farm community. Not a single politician or party has assured Punjab residents of a smoke-free agriculture. Our children are getting asthmatic and our groundwater is depleting. Yet no one is bothered,” say environmentalists.Wheat stubble is used to make dry fodder for cattle and farmers burn only the leftover roots. These roots can be easily mixed in the soil, but some farmers burn them as it is an easy way out.State Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said, “We have been holding awareness drives, registering FIRs and challaning the erring farmers. It is high time some strict action is taken. No one has the right to pollute our environment.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-sees-record-11-844-stubble-fires-this-season-89064

The party also demanded action against distilleries and excise officers, who had “caused losses of thousands of crores to the exchequer”.Addressing a press conference, senior SAD leader Prem Singh Chandumajra alleged that Rs 826-crore concessions were given to liquor and mining contractors despite the fact that the state lost excise revenue of Rs 5,600 crore in the last three years. He alleged nothing was being done to compensate farmers of Patiala, Ropar, Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib districts for “extremely low” wheat yield due to excessive rains.He said the farmers of these districts had suffered a loss of Rs 350 crore due to a 2-lakh metric tonne drop in yield against last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/compensate-farmers-not-liquor-traders-sad-89067

They have been trained by the WWF-India and the Punjab Forest Wildlife Preservation Department under an activity plan executed in collaboration with the DCB Bank. They are proficient to monitor the Indus dolphin population and jot down the survey sheets certified by WWF-India in its official report.WWF-India’s Coordinator, Aquatic Biodiversity, Gitanjali Kanwar, said Beas Mitars helped compiling the baseline data and documentation of Indus river dolphin during the lockdown period.“A maximum of four dolphins at one point of time in the Karmowala area and minimum of one at another spot that fall in the Gadhka area, both in Tarn Taran, was spotted quite often. The lockdown has taught us a positive lesson that for prosperity of natural resources and aquatic life, human beings must not commit the error of polluting rivers anymore,” she said.The Beas conservation Reserve is the home to the only population of Indus river dolphin (platanista gangetica minor) in India. The areas with the most regular dolphin sightings are in the vicinity of remotest villages like Dhun, Karmowala, Gadhka, Mundapind, Dhunda, Goindwal, Baisal and Gagrewal.Who could have imagined about the unusual situation that novel Covid 19 brought with it? Yet, not a single day had passed when the WWF was not getting updates from Beas Mitars about the water level, its quality, and health of the aquatic life.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rare-dolphins-spotted-in-beas-as-pollution-dips-89068

24-05-2020||---||Can’t order opening of religious places on lines of industry: High Court||Chandigarh, May 23The opening of religious places and holding of religious congregations could not be ordered on the analogy of opening of business establishments, the High Court today asserted, while holding that freedom to religion was subject to public order, morality and public health.Upholding the guidelines issued on March 24 by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs stating that all places of worship would be closed for public and religious congregations, a Division Bench of the HC added directions could not be issued to the state government to relax restrictions regarding places of worship.The order by the Bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Ajay Tewari came on a petition filed by advocate Mubeen Farooqi seeking directions to Punjab and other respondents to open all religious places.The Bench added that the imposition of restrictions on religious places was in larger public interest and the object sought to be achieved was prevention of gathering at religious places to control the spread of Coronavirus.Holding that the guidelines were issued strictly in conformity with the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Bench added the imposition of restrictions was not repugnant to Article 25 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of conscience to every person and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the stateDescribing the current situation as “extraordinary”, the Bench added the restrictions did not amount to interference in the religious affairs of any community. It was a public policy and the scope for judicial interference in such matters was “very limited”.“The restrictions imposed by the Ministry of Home Affairs do not violate any fundamental or legal right of the petitioner or the similarly situated persons. The endeavour of the Ministry is to break the cycle by maintaining social distancing. We will not substitute our wisdom for the wisdom of the Executive decision, which has been taken in the larger public interest,” the Bench added.Before parting with the 68-page judgment, the Bench asserted the right of the state to impose restrictions, required or found necessary on the ground of public order, health and morality, was inbuilt under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution and the imposition of restrictions constitutes “paternalistic act”.Merely relaxation of restrictions in certain areas could not be a ground to relax the same regarding religious places of worship. “The discretion not to permit opening of all the places of worship for public and prohibiting holding of religious congregations/gatherings has been exercised judiciously,” the Bench concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cant-order-opening-of-religious-places-on-lines-of-industry-high-court-89073
