RGNUL Covid 19 Committee has recommended, in compliance with orders of Punjab Government, to postpone the online examinations scheduled from 18th May 2020. The recommendations of Covid-19 committee have been approved by RGNUL Academic Council in its meeting dated 10th May 2020.”Vice Chancellor Dr Paramjit Singh Jaswal during a conversation on Sunday said he had received a call from the Deputy Commissioner’s office over the matter, thus they have decided to go as per advice of state government and postponed exams||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-government-snub-rgnul-reverses-decision-over-conducting-of-exams-83433
11-05-2020||Saurabh Malik||Centre allows opening of all private hospitals||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 11The Centre has allowed the opening of all private hospitals and asked all states and UTs to ensure smooth movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedical staff, sanitation personnel and ambulances. They have also been asked to ensure the opening of all private clinics, nursing homes and laboratories with all medical professional and staff.As a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking improvement in healthcare facilities and assistance to people during the COVID-induced lockdown period came up for hearing, Additional Solicitor-General of India Satya Pal Jain told the Punjab and Haryana High Court that such movement would also be facilitated inter-state, wherever required.The counsel for the state of Punjab said necessary instructions had already been submitted to the government and private hospitals to provide requisite treatment even to non-COVID patients, and the instructions had already been implemented.Jain informed the Bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli that restrictions imposed by some of the states and the UTs on the movement of medical professionals and paramedical personnel was discussed in a meeting chaired by the Union Cabinet Secretary on May 10.The decisions taken were, subsequently, conveyed to the Chief Secretaries of all states and the UTs through a circular issued by the Union Home Secretary.Jain added that the letter by the Home Secretary made it clear that any restrictions on the movements of medical professions and paramedical staff could lead to sever constraints in rendering medical services to COVID and non- COVID patients.Jain said it had come to the government’s notice that private clinics and nursing homes at many places were reportedly not allowed to open, though the functioning of these medical facilities was crucial as these were supplementing regular medical infrastructure and relieving the burden on the hospitals.The petition in the public interest was filed by advocate Ferry Sofat against the Union of India and other respondents. His contention was that government and private hospitals in the state of Punjab were equipped to treat the COVID-infected patients, but the patients suffering from other serious ailments were not being extended necessary healthcare facilities and medical assistance.The Bench asserted the assertions in the writ petition have been denied. “Satya Pal Jain, Additional Solicitor-General of India, informed us during the hearing that Government of India and the Ministry of Home Affairs have issued fresh instructions on the matter in issue on Monday, which the state government shall have to follow/abide by,” the Bench added, while permitting the petitioner to withdraw the petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-allows-opening-of-all-private-hospitals-83428

11-05-2020||Mohali||Former Punjab DGP Saini granted anticipatory bail in 29-year-old abduction case||A local court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to former director general of Punjab police Sumedh Singh Saini saying there was a serious doubt about the maintainability of the FIR registered last week in a 29-year-old case of abduction and police torture.Additional District and Sessions Judge Monika Goyal cast doubts on the motivations that led to the FIR.“Chances are that it (the FIR) is an outcome of political vendetta as present applicant was instrumental in lodging FIRs against high ups,” the court said.The court also said that since the case was now more than 29 years old and that Saini was willing to cooperate with investigators, it saw no point in arresting him, especially at a time when the Supreme Court and high courts were trying to de-congest jails in the light of the COVID-19 outbreak.Saini and seven other policemen, some of them now retired, faces criminal charges in a 29-year-old case of abduction of the son of a former IAS officer.“The purpose of investigation will suffice if the applicant is directed to join investigation and to cooperate properly. Thus, present is a fit case where he is entitled to anticipatory bail,” Judge Goyal said.The court admitted that the allegations pertained to a heinous crime, but said that the only explanation the prosecuting agency and the complainant gave for the case being delayed was that Saini, being DGP, was very influential, but took no action in proceeding with the case.The court said the Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed the CBI to investigate and an FIR was lodged on July 2, 2008. But the Supreme Court quashed it on December 7, 2011, saying the complainant/prosecution was at liberty to take recourse to fresh proceedings permissible under law, but the Multani family took no action.The court also observed the complainant alleged he came to know about the details of his brother’s torture and subsequent elimination after reading a magazine article.The issue was dated December 14, 2015. But the complainant did not take action till May 6, especially since Saini had retired in June 2018, the court said.“No explanation is coming as to why the present complainant had kept mum for such a long time especially after June, 2018 and had chosen this time, that is the outbreak of COVID-19 when whole of the State of Punjab is under curfew and had travelled all way from Jalandhar during this time to do an act of lodging the FIR in 29 years old case.“COVID-19 had brought the strongest nations to their knees, but the present complainant, who has fear of life and safety of his family since 1991, had chosen this time to come out and lodge the FIR against the present applicant, when prior to this, he had not taken any step in regard with disappearance of his brother," the court said.Saini filed an application for anticipatory bail last Friday---two days after he and seven other policemen were booked for the abduction, torture and stage-managed elimination of Balwant Singh Multani.Multani was the son of former IAS officer Darshan Singh Multani.Saini and the others were booked under sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) on the basis of a complaint by Balwant Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani on Wednesday evening.Palwainder Singh Multani claims the cops abducted, tortured and killed his brother in police custody.The victim Balwant Singh Multani was accused of carrying out an attack on Saini when he was the Chandigarh Senior Superintendent of Police on December 11, 1991. He was booked along with Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar---a convict in the Delhi bomb blast case---and two others, but the police later claimed Balwant escaped from the custody of Qadian (Gurdaspur) police.The others booked along with Saini are DSP Baldev Singh, Sub-Inspectors Satbir Singh, Harsahai, Jagir Singh, Anoop Singh, and ASI Kuldeep Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/former-punjab-dgp-saini-granted-anticipatory-bail-in-29-year-old-abduction-case-83418

11-05-2020||Rajmeet Singh and Ruchika M Khanna||Punjab cabinet meeting held without chief secretary; ministers authorise CM to approve excise policy||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 11The Punjab Council of Ministers in its meeting held in the absence of Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh on Monday authorised Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to approve the tweaked excise policy.Owing to the standoff between the ministers and the Chief Secretary, the latter was reportedly asked by the government to stay away from the meeting. Satish Chandra, Home Secretary, conducted the meeting.Reposing faith in the Chief Minister, who also holds the charge of the Excise Department, the cabinet ministers left it to him to clear the policy.But Finance Minister Manpreet Badal and Technical Education Minister Charanjit Channi, along with others, categorically said that as a matter of principle, they would not attend any meeting in which the Chief Secretary was present.The Chief Minister is learnt to have asked the ministers to place on record their contentions regarding the Chief Secretary.Sources said that with the Chief Minister asking the Council of Ministers to bring on record that they had no faith in the Chief Secretary, trouble is brewing for the topmost bureaucrat, who retires this August. More developments were expected soon on this front, sources said.Incidentally, the Chief Secretary has been holding the charge of the Financial Secretary, Taxation, since December 31 last year.Sources said that after Manpreet, along with other ministers, registered his protest over the alleged behaviour of the Chief Secretary, the Chief Minister is learnt to have told them that it was wrong on their part to walk out of the meeting. They should have told the officers about their reservation before calling off the meeting, he said.Earlier in the day, the ministers had made up their mind to take up the issue of the Chief Secretary and the pro-contractor clauses in the cabinet meeting with the Chief Minister. This would have caused embarrassment to the Chief Minister and the government.On Friday, Manpreet, along with other ministers, had walked out of the meeting over the alleged remarks made by the Chief Secretary.Meanwhile, Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring took to Twitter to question the CS regarding “the involvement of his son in running a distillery in Kapurthala as a partner with a top liquor contractor”.“The licence to operate the distillery cannot be sub-let, since the country liquor quota stands only in the name of the licensee,” he said.He also alleged that smuggled liquor belonging to the company of the liquor contractor (who is partner of the CS’s son) was caught and then let off.Later, Manpreet said the Chief Minister had been authorised to tweak the excise policy in wake of the 36 business days lost due to the curfew (between April 1 and May 6).“The behaviour of the CS in the past two days was not in line with the important office he holds. Thus, as part of unofficial business in the cabinet, I moved the proposal that I would not attend any meeting where the CS was present. I was supported by my colleague Charanjit Singh Channi. Later, we were asked by the CM to put it on record, after all cabinet ministers unanimously supported us,” he said.Badal said the decision was not because of any ego clash, but had been taken in the “highest interests of the state of Punjab”.Amidst the standoff between the Council of Ministers and the Chief Secretary, lobbying has already begun for the post of Chief Secretary. At least three senior officers of Punjab cadre (1987 batch) are in the reckoning.Interestingly, the Chief Secretary is the Secretary to Cabinet, according to Rules of Business, Government of Punjab, and it is unprecedented that a unanimous decision was  taken by the cabinet against the custodian of all records of the cabinet.Sources in the government said though seniormost IAS Officer KBS Sidhu should have been asked to conduct the meeting, after the CS was asked to stay away, this was not done. This, too, has raised eyebrows.Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh took a half-day leave on Monday amid the stand off.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-meeting-held-without-chief-secretary-ministers-authorise-cm-to-approve-excise-policy-83393
11-05-2020||New Delhi||As donations reduce drastically, Delhi gurdwaras face trouble feeding the needy during lockdown||The ‘gurdwaras' in the national capital are facing shortage of ration and cash following a steep rise in the number of homeless people being fed amid the ongoing lockdown, says the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee. Since the imposition of the countrywide lockdown on March 25 to stave off the spread of coronavirus, the DSGMC-managed gurdwaras across the city have provided free meals to around 50 lakh homeless people, migrant workers and elderly.Some of the gurdwaras have also provided shelter to around 200 health staff, including doctors and nurses, besides taking care of coronavirus positive patients in various hospitals.The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has deployed 500 people, including cooks, drivers, and sanitation workers, to carry out relief services during the lockdown.Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the president of the Sikh body said, “Earlier, the gurdwaras in Delhi would receive around Rs 40 lakh in donations which kept the ‘langar' (community kitchen) service going.”    As a large number of people are unable to visit the gurdwaras during the lockdown, the donations have reduced drastically to just 20 per cent, he said.The langar service is going on thanks to some kind people who have been donating ration, including ghee, oil, sugar, flour, rice, pulses, spices, salt etc. “But the number of people who need to be fed is increasing every day and our resources are under tremendous strain,” Sirsa said.He said the DSGMC has been receiving calls from various gurdwara across the national capital, informing it of the depleting resources.The Sikh body is completely dependent on donations. It is because of the help of a few large-hearted people across the globe that the DSGMC is able to continue with the services, Sirsa said.A few people have come out and donated cash anonymously. A couple donated Rs 2.5 lakh on their 50th anniversary to the DSGMC, he said. “At least 20 trucks of ration have been donated to the gurdwara anonymously,” the official added.Families based in various parts of the world and belonging to different faiths have been donating ration and cash, he said.Recently, the World Punjabi Organisation, a body representing Sikhs across the globe, donated Rs 51 lakh to the DSGMC. Similarly, some businessmen and companies based in India donated cash to help the DSGMC feed the needy. “But, considering the number of people who need food, we require more people to come out and donate in cash and kind. If you cannot go to a gurdwara to do ‘sewa' (service) during the lockdown, please donate ration to a nearby gurdwara or make monetary contributions to DSGMC through its website,” Sirsa added.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/as-donations-reduce-drastically-delhi-gurdwaras-face-trouble-feeding-the-needy-during-lockdown-83350

But it was best to prevent exposure of the mother and foetus to infections, as multiple visits and special care are required. “The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way for everyone and gynaecologists are managing the antenatal care during pregnancy through online video consultations to limit the exposure to outside world.

They were reluctant to reveal the names of persons they visited in the past few days. So, the police traced their mobile tower locations to know about their contacts,” the officer said.In Ludhiana and Amritsar, the police helped health officials in tracing the contacts of four patients last week.“Phone records cannot lie,” a top cop attached with the investigation wing said, adding “to quarantine persons close to a Covid-19 patient is the need of the hour to stop the spread of the virus”.“The technology has helped the police track down contacts of positive patients,” an SSP said, preferring anonymity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/police-use-technology-to-trace-contacts-of-patients-83060

But in less than a month and by following Covid compliant norms, we have procured 115 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of wheat, of which over 90 LMT has been lifted. We had set up 3,700 purchase centres against 1,820 in pre-Covid times. The labour shortage was met by using the local labour. To meet the shortage of one lakh gunny bags, we not only used PP bags, but also allowed those used once.44% ration by stateEver since the lockdown has been announced, 1,171 trains carrying foodgrain have been sent to food-deficit states. Punjab has contributed 44% to ration which is being distributed across the country.How will this help Punjab’s economy?We will bring Rs24,000 crore in circulation by buying almost 125 LMT of wheat. Of this, Rs15,000 crore has already been paid to the farmers. This is thus a blessing in disguise during such stressful times for farmers, commission agents, transporters and even those whose premises are being used for stocking wheat, which in turn will have a cascading effect. The state government too will earn over Rs3,000 crore.How has Punjab helped other states in times of crisis?Punjab has proved beyond doubt that it is the granary of India. Ever since the lockdown was announced, 1,171 special trains carrying foodgrain (wheat and rice) have been sent to food deficit states. It has been quite a journey from 2018, when Niti Aayog told Punjab to not worry about the food security and concentrate on increasing farmers’ income. Punjab has contributed 44 per cent to the ration that is now being distributed across the country to the underprivileged.How efficient is the food distribution among the underprivileged in Punjab?In Punjab, there are 1.41 lakh beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act. We have given ration for six months to all of them (5 kg wheat per person), besides successfully launching the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, where ration is being given to migrant labourers and others not covered under the Act. These are being distributed to 15 lakh families or 60 lakh people.But the Centre claims that pulses sent to Punjab have been distributed to just 1 per cent of beneficiaries. What do you have to say?The record available with us proves everything. The pulses to be distributed in April were sent in May. In Punjab, foodgrain distribution is done for six months, and we requested the Centre to allocate us pulses for three months, which did not happen. As much as 10,800 metric tonnes of dal was sanctioned for Punjab, of which we got only 5,565.94 MT. We got pulses in 18 districts and it has been distributed almost immediately. The food department staff have been working for 16 hours a day to ensure that no one in Punjab goes hungry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-has-again-proved-it-is-granary-of-india-83084
