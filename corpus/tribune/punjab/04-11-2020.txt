Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension that the Central farm reform laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-keen-to-run-trains-but-you-and-your-govt-not-performing-duties-nadda-to-punjab-cm-166024
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Cong MPs to meet rail minister over goods train suspension||Punjab Congress MPs will meet Railways Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday in Delhi over the suspension of goods trains that has led to a power crisis and critical situation of essential supplies in the state.Congress parliamentarian Amar Singh said on Wednesday that he and MPs Preneet Kaur, Jasbir Singh Gill, Santokh Chaudhary, Mohammad Sadique, Manish Tewari and Gurjeet Singh Aujla would meet Goyal.Singh said a meeting of Congress MPs with Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also been fixed for Saturday.The Fatehgarh Sahib MP said the parliamentarians would be raising the issue of non-operation of freight trains in the state by the Railways, saying it had hit the supplies of coal, fertiliser and other essential items.Congress MPs have been camping in Delhi for the past few days to meet central ministers to discuss various importance issues regarding the state.Singh pointed out that coal supplies to thermal power plants have been hit because of the suspension of goods trains.The state-owned power utility has announced that it would impose power cuts in the wake of mismatch between the demand and the supply.According to Singh, there is an acute shortage of urea and DAP (diammonium phosphate) for the farming sector. Around 15,000 containers of the state industry have also been stuck and the supply of gunny bags also affected, which would impact the lifting of paddy crop arriving in the grain markets.“Railways is the lifeline of this country and we want that it should resume operations,” he told PTI.Coal supplies to thermal power plants in Punjab have been severely affected after the Railways suspended the operation of freight trains due to the blockade of some tracks by farmers over the three new contentious legislations.Earlier, protesting farmers had announced to allow movement of freight trains till November 5. However, the Railways later decided to extend the suspension, saying protesting farmers were still blocking the tracks. It has also been demanding that the agitators should vacate the platforms.Congress MP Amar Singh said the MPs would also take up the issue of non-release of GST (goods and services tax) and rural development fund (RDF) with Shah.The Punjab government has said it had not received Rs 10,000 crore of GST dues from the Centre since March. The Union government has also stopped the release of Rs 1,000 crore of the RDF to the state. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cong-mps-to-meet-rail-minister-over-goods-train-suspension-166022

The farmers, who have received support from 200 other unions associated with All India Kisan Sangharsh Committee, will be blocking all national highways between 12 noon to 4 pm. In Punjab, they will be blocking all state and national highways.A meeting of the 30 farmer unions of the state — barring BKU Ekta Ugrahan and Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee — was held today, wherein it has been decided to allow the passage of goods trains till November 20. They had earlier allowed the passage of goods trains in the state till November 4, but the Union Railway Ministry has decided to keep the railway service to Punjab under suspension.Other than this, it has been decided to continue the gherao of businesses owned by corporate houses - toll plazas, petrol pumps and retail businesses, and outside the houses of BJP leaders in Punjab, said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of BKU Dakaunda.Meanwhile, a delegation of Punjab government, including minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Political Adviser to CM Capt Sandeep Sandhu, also met the representatives of these 30 Unions and those of BKU Ekta Ugrahan separately today. Yesterday, they had met representatives of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, trying to explain the effects of the long protest and the resultant suspension of train service to Punjab by the Centre, on the state’s economy.They are learnt to have explained to the unions how the urea, DAP and potash shortage was being created for the wheat crop to be sown and how the shortage of gunny bags for storing paddy and the custom milled rice, besides the shortage of coal for the power plants, would hit the state hard. It is learnt that the unions have refused to budge.It has been 35 days since the statewide protests were launched by the farmers, after the contentious Farm Acts were passed in the Parliament. Farmers have now said they will sit along the tracks and at railway stations, so that the railway operations can be resumed, though they will not allow the passenger trains to operate till their demands were met.It is learnt that 2,225 railway rakes could not be operated till date, and Railways claim they have suffered a loss of Rs 1,200 crore. Dharnas are continuing at 32 places in the state. As many as 1,350 passenger trains have also been cancelled till date.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/protesting-farm-unions-in-punjab-refuse-to-budge-165965

Law and order is a state subject. The removal of the rail blockade for the smooth passage of passenger and goods trains is in the interest of everyone. For winters, we have to move LPG cylinders and clothing for forces deployed in forward areas,” Javadekar said responding to a question relating to Punjab Chief Minister’s dharna here.Javadekar also wondered whether the agitation was “political in nature and in support of commission agents” as farmers had benefitted by selling their produce at a higher MSP rate.Farmers in Punjab have been protesting against the Centre’s three farm reform laws, which began around September 24, as they expressed apprehension that the new legislations would pave the way for dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of capital intensive corporate houses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-governments-inaction-led-to-rail-blockade-in-state-prakash-javadekar-165964

However, he was acquitted by a court.After the police did not take any action against the school management, the activist had approached the President and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and the state Home Department. He had urged them to take action against a senior police officer in Faridkot for “intentionally” not following the rule of law by refusing to act against the school management which was accused of harassing the activist.It is alleged that the Faridkot Police did not adopt the due legal course to prosecute an accused even after Justice Mehtab Singh Gill, the commission of inquiry, asked the state government to take necessary action against the accused. Justice Gill had even asked the government to give compensation to the victim adequately and recover the compensation amount from the investigating officer.Kaushal’s ordeal started in November 2011 after he exposed a scandal in the functioning of an educational institution. He had unravelled how the institution was preparing fake salary statements and submitting a bogus record to various government departments to avoid financial liabilities.After this, Kaushal had started facing the reprisal at the hands of accused, allegedly in connivance with the police.On the complaint of Shiv Shankar Mittal, the manager of Amaravati Memorial Public School, the police registered a criminal case against Kaushal in December 2011. However, the court acquitted him of all charges in November 2016.Kaushal demanded the Home Department take appropriate action against Mittal for filing false complaints with the police and causing him harassment for over five years.On the directions of the Home Department, the police started legal action against Mittal but half-heartedly, revealed an order of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, in Faridkot.For the police not prosecuting the accused with true spirit, Kaushal approached the inquiry commission of Justice Mehtab Singh Gill and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-9-years-and-more-than-200%C2%A0complaints-case-filed-on-rti-activists-complaint-165933

It seeks to provide piped water connections to every rural household in the country.The progress of JJM's implementation was presented by the National Jal Jeevan Mission of the Union Jal Shakti Ministry on Tuesday at a web-based conference of ministers and authorities relating to water in states and UTs.It was presided over by Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Skngh Shekhawat and attended, among others, by Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar and Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria.Besides the fast depleting underground water in these states, the water in their several parts is contaminated. Studies in the past say Haryana tops among these states with regard to overall contamination, including with fluoride and dangerous arsenic acid.Reports also say Punjab's underground water table has high quantity of nitrate, cadmium and chromium (heavy metals).Ladakh is one of the world's most difficult mountainous terrains that present a severe challenge to lay water piped network and to maintain flow of water.The NJJM authorities kept up the focus on JJM during the Covid-19 onslaught.The conference was organised to discuss various issues including JJM's planning and implementation.Its focus was also on 100-day campaign to provide piped drinking water to country's every school and anganwadi centre.Addressing the conference, Shekhawat said JJM also creates employment opportunities for locals in rural areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-haryana-himachal-j-k-ladakh-ahead-of-deadline-to-implement-jal-jeevan-mission-165931

We are also buying more power available in the open market to meet the demand,” Prasad said.According to a government spokesperson, at present, the day demand in the state stands at about 5,200 MW and the night demand is about 3,400 MW. Supply, on the other hand, is totally inadequate with only Agricultural Power (AP) load of vegetable feeders (800 MW) being given supply for 4-5 hours during day time every day. The other AP load is currently insignificant (about 300 MW).The situation, said the spokesperson, was grim as PSPCL was left with no generation control and market rates of power continued to be highly volatile and could further spike any time, resulting in increase in the cost of power purchase, on which the state is now completely dependent to feed its cables.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/following-coal-shortage-pspcl-resorts-to-power-cuts-in-punjab-165929

He was accompanying Congress legislator Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.Likewise, other legislators from Punjab were stopped at the entry point in Delhi.Later, Sidhu told the media that he was in Delhi to participate for the cause of farmers.Describing the Centre's farm laws as an "attack on the federal structure", Sidhu said these black laws would ruin the farming community and others associated with the agrarian economy."The Central government is robbing rights of our farmers...We have empathy not sympathy with them," he added.The Chief Minister has announced that he will lead a relay 'dharna' of Congress MLAs at the Rajghat on Wednesday to highlight the state's "power crisis and critical essential supplies" situation amid the Centre's alleged adamant refusal to allow movement of goods trains due to farmers' agitation.The Chief Minister said that Punjab had run out of coal, urea and DAP and other essential supplies due to the Indian Railways decision not to ply goods trains even after the farmers eased their blockade to allow such movement.As the crisis resulted in complete shutdown of all power plants as well as curtailment of agricultural and vegetables supplies, the Chief Minister said, he had decided to hold a "symbolic relay dharna" to bring the state's grim situation to the Centre's notice.The Chief Minister had earlier failed to get an appointment with President Ram Nath Kovind on the agriculture-related amendment Bills.

The governor is just a post box in this matter and has no rights. He has to send the bills to the President but is sitting on them. I wanted to brief the President on the emerging national security and food security issues in Punjab where Pakistan is looking to create trouble. We don’t have sacks to store harvested wheat,” Amarinder said at a dharna he led of all state MLAs barring those from AAP and Shiromani Akali Dal. The CM said he had assured the railway minister of cooperation should goods trains come into Punjab but “the same hasn’t happened”.“We have been told that we are anti-national. That’s not true. We are here to preserve and not disturb national unity. Soldiers of Punjab battalion were among those killed in the Galwan clash. We know how to shed our blood for the nation. We have made many sacrifices and will always be ready to do more. Some farmers are agitating along some rail lines but we have assured the Centre that railway police and Punjab Police can together handle the matter,” the CM said after Congress lawmaker Navjot Singh Sidhu, former State minister Parminder Dhindsa and Bholath MLA Sukhpal Khaira had slammed the Centre for attacking federalism with central farm laws. The MLAs vowed continued action against central laws with the CM saying, “We have challenged the central laws under rules shown by late FM Arun Jaitley to BJP states. At the time, the President had assented to the state bills.

He said that the five Sikhs from their side daily come to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple and perform ardas to get justice in missing saroops.“The SGPC task force tried to scuttle our protest by indulging in clash but I wanted to clarify that the Sikh activists were still adamant to confront the SGPC over the whereabouts of missing saroops. Some of our members were admitted in the hospital, but our mission to expose the SGPC’s failed administration will continue”, he said. On October 24, a clash took place in the precincts of Golden Temple complex following which cross-FIRs were registered.Khosa told that at least 60 Sikh activists were booked under serious charges which were far from truth. “I too was booked along with other Sikhs who were attacked by the SGPC task force and were detained for hours. Till date, the police too were lenient and never bothered to get our statements registered”, he said.When asked about a video clip that went viral depicting him to be in an inebriated condition while roaming in the Golden Temple complex, he said, “I am ready to undergo dope test in the presence of ‘panj pyaras’, Granthi Singhs or intellectuals”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/missing-saroops-satkar-committee-members-adamant-on-confronting-sgpc-165826
04-11-2020||---||No coal, brace for outages, says Punjab Government||Patiala, November 3The Punjab Government today said it was left with no option but to resort to power cuts, with coal stocks in the state drying up fully as a result of the prolonged suspension of goods trains.As day-time power shortage rose to 1,000-1500 MW, with last of the state’s power plants, GVK Thermal, also running out of coal, the Power Department is left with no option but to impose power cuts on all residential, commercial and agricultural consumers beginning Tuesday evening.According to a government spokesperson, at present, the day demand in the state stands at about 5,100-5,200 MW and night demand is about 3,400 MW. The supply, on the other hand, is totally inadequate with only Agricultural Power (AP) load of vegetable feeders (800 MW) being given supply for four to five hours every day. The other AP load is currently insignificant (about 300 MW).“Load shedding is now being carried out regularly on various feeders of the state after 4 pm, for four to five hours every day, while agricultural power or vegetable supply is also being curtailed on a regular basis,” said the spokesperson.The spokesperson said the situation worsened today, when the one unit of GVK (2x270 MW) that was operational at around 12 noon headed for shutdown by 5 pm when the coal stock was slated to completely run out. Other private thermal power plants i.e. NPL (2x660 MW) and TSPL (3x660 MW) have already exhausted their coal supplies and are out of operation. The state’s own thermal power stations of Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat (1,760 MW) are also boxed up at present.Incidentally, in normal circumstances, the day-time demand in the state is typically met from centre public sector stations (2,500 MW), own hydro power stations (375 MW), GVK Thermal (250 MW), renewable, mainly Solar, (450 MW) and purchase from power exchange/tenders (2,700 MW).“After deducting the state government’s day-time banking obligation of about 1070 MW, this totals 5200 MW, which is sufficient to meet the average daily power demand in the state during the day in normal circumstances”, said the government spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-coal-brace-for-outages-says-punjab-government-165794
04-11-2020||Aman Sood||All pvt plants shut, no dearth of cheap power||Tribune News ServicePatiala, November 3No supply of coal due to the farmers’ agitation may have shut power plants in the state, but Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is buying cheap electricity from the power exchange at market rates, thus saving on crores of rupees.Former PSPCL chief engineer Opportunity lostPSPCL had a golden opportunity to finish off the coal stock of the independent power producers and avoid fixed charges...but it made all three producers to operate at partial load.Besides energy charges, which are too high, roughly Rs 9.75 crore is being paid as fixed charges to all three private power plants. Experts say power costs Rs 3.80 per unit from GVK’s Goindwal Sahib Plant, Rs 3.35 per unit from Mansa-based Talwandi Sabo Power Limited and Rs 3 per unit from Rajpura-based Nabha Thermal Plant. Comparatively, power from the open market is available in abundance at less than Rs 3 per unit and rates are expected to drop further by mid-November. Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that even before the farmers’ stir started in the state, the three private plants in September had “not adhered to the mandatory guideline of keeping 30 days of coal stock”.No action over stock normPSPCL is yet to initiate action against all three private plants for their failure to maintain at least 30 days of mandatory coal stock, leading to shutdown.Sample this: On September 20, Nabha plant had 2,69,981 MT of coal for 15.43 days; Talwandi Sabo plant had 1,82,438 MT for 5.20 days; and Goindwal Sahib plant had 37,198 MT of coal for 5.31 days.PSPCL is yet to initiate action against all three private plants for their failure to maintain at least 30 days of mandatory coal stock, leading to shutdown. Instead, it continues to pay fixed charges to them. The lone private plant (GVK’s 540 MW) today was shut after it exhausted its seven-day coal stock. “If the IPPs would have kept their 30-day stock then there would have been no closure of any plant. The best way in public interest would have been to run these plant on full load to exhaust the coal and not pay fixed charges at Rs 10 crore daily as 30-day coal stock was not maintained by them, and thereafter to procure power from exchange at much cheaper rates”, said a former PSPCL CMD.Punjab can easily buy power from the exchange for around Rs 3 per unit. “Consumers will reap the benefit if private plants are kept shut till February. In past winters also, PSPCL bought bulk power from exchange to save on high energy rates charged by private plants,” sources said.“PSPCL today started a unit each at state-owned Rupnagar and Lehra thermal plants. We could not get 500 MW from the exchange and, therefore, some cuts in villages were imposed. We are managing as for now,” said A Venu Prasad, CMD, PSPCL.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/all-pvt-plants-shut-no-dearth-of-cheap-power-165793

The company reportedly did not pay 2 per cent mandi fee levied on horticulture crops.The matter came to light in June following which a notice was issued to the firm for violating the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961.In its reply, the firm claimed that as per the central Act (passed in September), it was free to buy produce from any state without registration. The legal opinion sought by the Market Committee of Abohar corroborated the claim. On October 16, the mandi board ordered a probe. Ravi Bhagat, MD, Mandi Board, said: "The letter (allowing exemptions) was issued before the state passed Bills.

The industry in the state has been bearing the brunt of the agitation and now, with retailers’ operations disrupted, it will prove to be a big blow to the state’s economy.“The protesters are forcibly shutting down stores. In some cities, stores of modern retail have been asked to shut down fully while in others, it is sporadic. On an average, 20-30 per cent of the stores are shut down,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI), the apex body for the Indian retail industry. He added that there was fear among retailers. The agitation is causing economic losses not only to large businesses but also to small grocery shops.“This has also led to job losses for daily wage earners who are mostly employed indirectly as third-party providers of logistics. The month-long agitation has also impacted the income of small farmers supplying to our members (stores),” he added.“Looking at the crisis faced by our members, we have written a letter to the Chief Minister, seeking his intervention to enable ease of doing business in the state,” he added.The letter adds that despite economic activities picking momentum, recovery will not be possible if restrictions on operations continue. The retailers have demanded uninterrupted operations as the deadlock has continued for almost a month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/business-hit-retailers-approach-punjab-cm-165532

The police barricaded Circuit House to keep the marching protesters at bay. When the situation became tense, they escorted Mittal to safety from the back door.Farmers protested against Mittal as soon as they came to know about his visit to the city. Addressing protesters, BKU (Sidhupur) leader Baldev Singh Sandoha said: “Narendra Modi-led NDA government is working against the farmers’ interests. Everyone is supporting us on the farm laws, except BJP leaders.”Mittal had come to meet BJP local leaders on the farm laws and the upcoming elections to the Municipal Corporation. Interacting with mediapersons, he alleged that most protesters were not farmers, but Naxals.The BJP leader stressed the farm laws were for the betterment of farmers, but opposition parties were misleading everyone for their political gains. Further, Mittal said goods trains were suspended as farmers were still protesting on rail tracks. Moreover, the state government did not ensure the safe passage to trains. The former minister stressed if farmer unions were willing, he could arrange their meeting with the Union Agriculture Minister. — TNSShwait Malik faces protest in FazilkaBJP former state president Shwait Malik on Tuesday had to face the ire of protesting farmers during his visit to Fazilka.

Across the state, farmer unions continued with their sit-ins at railway stations, outside private petrol pumps, toll plazas and businesses owned by corporate houses.While at some places, crowds are dissipating as farmers take their paddy to the mandis and return to farms to sow wheat, there is no let-up in protests. In fact, union leaders are busy preparing for a “chakka jam” scheduled for Thursday.State short on coal, fertilisersThe call for protest was given by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Committee in Delhi last week, and all national highways across India will be blocked for a few hours. Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the BKU (Dakaunda), said in Punjab, all state highways would be blocked between 12 noon and 4 pm.The biggest farm union in the state, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), would hold dharnas at 30 places on highways across 14 districts on Thursday, said Sukhdev Simgh Kokrikalan, general secretary of the union. Meanwhile, a meeting of union leaders with a delegation of Punjab ministers is scheduled on Wednesday, where the impact of the suspension of trains on the state economy will be discussed.While the state is running woefully short on coal for state-owned and private power plants, it also stares at a shortage of urea, potash and DAP, needed for the sowing of wheat crop. Punjab needs 4.50 lakh tonne DAP and 10 lakh tonne urea before December 31, which is now stuck because of the suspension of goods trains. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-prepare-for-chakka-jam-165537

People of the state have not forgotten or forgiven you for the acts of omission and commission committed by you during the 10-year misrule of the SAD-BJP,” the Chief Minister said.Rejecting as “atrocious” the SAD president’s allegation that he (Captain Amarinder) was shielding the minister, the Chief Minister asked Sukhbir to “stop misleading people with such shamelessly false and baseless claims”. “The people of Punjab will not be taken in by your unfounded allegations,” he told Sukhbir, terming the Akali chief’s threat as a manifestation of his “vindictive” mindset. He alleged it was the same mindset that was behind thousands of innocent Punjabis being thrown into jail on false charges under the SAD-BJP regime.

He asked the CM if he was really serious about the protest or was just playing to the gallery. “If the purpose is to demand repeal of the farm laws and ensuring assured purchase of foodgrain as per the MSP, then the CM should lead an indefinite hunger strike and not give in till the demands of the farming community are accepted,” he said. The CM was, however, unlikely to accept his proposal as he did not want to take on the BJP-led Union Government, he said. Sukhbir alleged both Central and state governments wanted to defame farmer organisations. “This is why they are colluding to delay the start of goods trains,” he said.— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-should-go-on-fast-sukhbir-165539

The Bench added the current tendency to the contrary had been frowned upon by the Supreme Court.High courtCitizen has right to free speechIn a democracy, every citizen has a right to voice his/her opinion freely and criticise the functioning of the government. However, unparliamentary language should not be adopted. The assertion came in a case where a petitioner-accused, apparently unhappy with the lockdown imposed due to the Covid outbreak and the way the pandemic was being handled by the Government of India and Punjab Government, criticised their functioning.Justice Sudhir Mittal asserted definitely intemperate and abusive language had been used against high officials of the governments as well as elected representatives. But it did not amount to exciting disaffection towards the government established by law or to excite hatred against it. It also did not amount to inciting religious disaffection or disruption of communal harmony. It was an expression of dissatisfaction with the functioning of the government and criticism of its policies.“In a democracy, every citizen has a right to voice his/her opinion freely and criticise the functioning of the government.

||How Punjab did its bit for space programme||This year marks the birth centenary of Satish Dhawan, who transformed India’s space programme from a nascent, amorphous and personalised initiative into an efficient, professionally run, teamwork-driven and goal-oriented organisation.Individuals born in the 1910s and 1920s were academically well-trained by the time opportunities opened up in independent India. Because of the disruption caused by Partition, Punjab, however, was in no position to offer them anything. Just as the Lahore film industry shifted to Bombay after Partition, Punjab’s scientific talent moved to Bangalore and Bombay.World War-II compelled the British to involve Indians on the scientific and industrial fronts in support of its war efforts. Hindustan Aircraft Limited (HAL) was established at Bangalore in 1940 as a private body. It was taken over by the British in 1942, and handed over to the US armed forces the next year.In 1940, a chemistry professor from Lahore, SS Bhatnagar, was brought into the government as Director, Scientific and Industrial Research, and the CSIR established in 1942. Though still working under the British, Indians dovetailed their country’s post-Independence interests into the British exigencies of war.An Atomic Research Committee was set up in 1946 under Homi Bhabha’s chairmanship and the Atomic Energy Commission two years later. This was the beginning of Indian strategic science. On Bhabha’s death in 1966, Vikram Sarabhai was appointed his successor. Sarabhai initiated the space programme, of which the missile programme became an offshoot.In 1945, it was decided to send abroad a certain number of students at government expense for advanced courses in technical and science subjects directly related to post-war needs. Two of the early beneficiaries of the overseas scholarship scheme were alumni of the University of Punjab, Lahore: Satish Dhawan and Brahm Prakash.Dhawan was the son of Rai Bahadur Devi Dayal Dhawan, an MSc and LLB who joined the Punjab Civil Service and rose to be a sessions and district judge. Satish passed his Intermediate examination from Government College, Ludhiana, and BA in physics and maths in 1938 from Government College Lahore. He went on to do an MA in English in 1941. Presumably, at that time, he was interested in following in his father’s footsteps as a civil servant. The contraction of opportunities due to the war may have put paid to his original plans. He then enrolled at the Maclagan Engineering College and obtained a BE (Honours) degree in mechanical engineering with two gold medals and a handsome scholarship in 1945. He had joined HAL at Bangalore for practical training, and in 1946, left for the US on government scholarship, to return in 1951 with a doctorate in aeronautics and mathematics from Caltech.He joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and has the distinction of being its longest serving Director (1962-81). The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was set up in 1969 with Sarabhai as Chairman. On Sarabhai’s death in 1971, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi handpicked Dhawan to take over. Dhawan headed ISRO from 1972 till 1984. In 2002, ISRO renamed its Sriharikota rocket launch centre (SHAR) as Satish Dhawan Space Centre.In 1976, the Punjab Government prefixed Dhawan’s name to Government College, Ludhiana (GCL). Dhawan’s matric and BA certificates mention his name as Satish Kumar Dhawan (SKD). Subsequently, he shortened his name by dropping Kumar. It is not clear under what circumstances the Punjab college chose to add Chandra as his middle name while naming itself as SCD-GCL.Dhawan led from the front. In the initial stages, when there was failure, he did not look for scapegoats, but manfully took the blame upon himself. But later, when there was success after success, he retreated into the background so that limelight might fall on his associates and subordinates. He was a suave, polished gentleman. It has been shared recently that the only time his Punjabi heritage manifested itself was, perhaps, in the language directed at nobody in particular, which was uttered by him while driving.ISRO was fortunate in having the services of the Lahore-born metallurgist Brahm Prakash (who did not use his family surname Sekhri). Born in 1912, Prakash passed his Intermediate from Sanatan Dharm College. He then enrolled at Government College, Lahore, from where he obtained BSc Honours in chemistry in 1933. He then joined SS Bhatnagar’s chemistry lab from where he did MSc, and then PhD in 1942. His father worked for the railways. Prakash also joined the railways at their metallurgy lab in Ajmer where he worked during the war. In 1946, he left for the US and obtained an ScD (Doctor of Science) from MIT in 1949.On return to India, Prakash was chosen by Bhabha for the position of metallurgist in the Atomic Energy Establishment. From 1951 to 1957, Bhabha had asked him to remain on the faculty of the Indian Institute of Science, when he moved to the Atomic Energy Establishment in Bombay where he focused on the indigenous development of nuclear fuels. On retirement from Bombay in 1972, Dhawan persuaded Prakash to move to Trivandrum to head the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). He finally hung up his boots in 1979 due to ill health, shortly before the first successful launch of SLV-3 in February 1980.On his visit to Thumba as President, APJ Abdul Kalam recalled that he “was fortunate to be associated with three great human beings — Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Professor Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash.”Yash Pal became a household name with Doordarshan’s science series Turning Point, which began in 1991 and ran for more than 150 episodes. His place in science history, however, rests on firmer grounds. His studies were interrupted due to Partition. SS Bhatnagar helped him pass through the MSc Honours School in physics in 1949 from the then East Punjab University by arranging classes for his batch at Delhi University. He, however, had already joined Bhabha’s Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) as a research student. In 1954, he proceeded on leave from TIFR to MIT from where he obtained a PhD in 1958.He was the first Director (1973-81) of the Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad. In 1975, India became a participant in the American Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE). Dhawan asked Yash Pal to direct the SITE India programme. Yash Pal’s felicity with instrumentation, his ability to enthuse and persuade people, including Indira Gandhi; his ability to inspire younger people; and his love for teaching, all combined to make the educational TV programme a success. The US had made its satellite available only for a year: from August 1975-July 1976. To continue the programme, India contracted a commercial satellite from Ford Aerospace and then decided to develop its own satellite network as part of the INSAT programme.Independent India embarked on strategic science. It was a challenging task because we had no previous experience and external technological and other assistance was not forthcoming. India made a great success of its mission. The synergy between Dhawan, Brahm Prakash and Yash Pal propelled them and the others engaged in space research to make unprecedented contributions which are nationally recognised, but deserve to be better known in Punjab itself.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/how-punjab-did-its-bit-for-space-programme-165696
