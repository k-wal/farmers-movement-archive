Even if I got hit it wasn't a problem as long as I got the right line and length. I was trying to pull the batsmen out of the crease by varying my length. That, I suppose, helped me get three big wickets on Friday."Harpreet conceded he was under pressure as he had hardly got the opportunity to bowl in the three years he has been with the franchise."Yes, there was pressure. (Over the years) I have taken a lot of pressure. It's natural that when you don't perform (get the opportunity), pressure gets to you. Today, I had made up my mind to just play freely. Whatever happens, we'll see, but I won't take stress," said Harpreet, who bowled Australia's Glenn Maxwell for a duck before getting rid of the dangerous AB de Villiers for three runs."For De Villiers, my plan was to keep the ball away from him, so that he comes out and plays my deliveries. The ball was gripping the wicket, so that's why I'd kept a slip also. I wanted to send a dot ball but luckily got a wicket. I'm blessed," said Harpreet who has played age-group tournaments for his state.

So, he decided to run classes for them in a bus for the next few days.The chemistry teacher asked why were the coaching centres asked to suspend offline classes while the buses had been allowed to operate at 50 per cent capacity. He said he found a way out to teach his students in buses in an offline mode. ‚ÄúThis way, I will be able to achieve my purpose as the children will have a better understanding of concepts. Also, since we will be legally correct in doing this, we will also not be defying any government orders,‚Äù he said.But hours after his videos went viral, the professor was booked by the city police. Deputy Commissioner of Police Jagmohan Singh said, ‚ÄúThe professor had committed violations under the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act and hence we have lodged an FIR against him at New Baradari Police Station. It was wrong on his part to call students and provide coaching, be it in a bus. We also checked videos and found that the professor was not wearing his mask properly, which again is a violation.‚ÄùMeanwhile, students who had come on the call of the professor maintained that they felt that they were able to understand concepts better through offline teaching rather than using gadgets from home. Some of them also complained that their internet services were not working properly.Prof MP Singh had been in news a few days back as well when he sold vegetables in a cart, trying to mock the government for making teachers like him lose their bread and butter. ‚ÄúWhat else can we do to feed our families? I believe selling vegetables is a more profitable business these days,‚Äù he said, while posting his video on Facebook.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/chemistry-prof-takes-lecture-in-bus-booked-246638
