03-05-2021||Chandigarh||With only 3.30 lakh allocation for 18+ in May, Punjab CM orders 70% doses to be used for co-morbid individuals||With the state getting an allocation of only 3.30 lakh vaccines for the 18+ category from the Serum Institute of India for the month of May, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday ordered 70 per cent of the doses to be reserved for individuals with co-morbidities, and the remaining 30 per cent to high-risk category of employees and workers in this age group.Chairing a high-level virtual review meeting, the chief minister announced that within these groups, district-wise allocation has also been prioritised based on population index, mortality and density.Given the severe supply constraints, it has been decided to limit the vaccination for 18-44 age group in this phase to major urban centres, he said, expressing concern over the fact that even for the 45+ age group, the state was in short supply, as a result of which only a few vaccine centres were currently functioning.The state expects 2 lakh doses to arrive tomorrow for vaccination of 45+ category. Of the 33,46,500 Covishield doses received so far, a total of 32,91,450 has already been utilised.In the 18-44 age group, for the month of May, the maximum allocation of 50 per cent has been prioritised for Group A of the most affected districts of SAS Nagar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Bathinda and Patiala.Another 30 per cent has been reserved for the Group B districts of Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, SBS Nagar, Faridkot, Kapurthala and Gurdaspur, while 20 per cent will be utilised in the other districts that have the least cases at present.Allocation has been made proportionate to the population of major urban areas of Zones A and B, while for Zone C, an equal distribution of doses across has been allocated for each district.These decisions have been taken in accordance with the vaccine strategy recommended by the state’s Vaccine Expert Committee for May, an official spokesperson said after the meeting.The committee recommended that when further doses are available or as the epidemiologic situation changes, the prioritisation framework may be modified. The committee comprises Dr Gagandeep Kang, Dr Jacob John and Dr Rajesh Kumar.Accepting the recommendations of the committee, the chief minister approved expansion of the list of comorbidities to include obesity (BMI>30), disabilities (e.g. spinal cord injury) and multiple co-morbidities determined to increase risk by a treating physician, in addition to those specified by the Central government.He pointed out that since individuals with co-morbidities are at highest risk of severe disease and deaths, it was imperative to vaccinate them on priority.For the remaining 30 per cent, the chief minister said that while the strategic roadmap contains a list of professions at risk, given the limitation of vaccine availability, for the month of May, the top three categories have been chosen.These are: i) government employees, ii) construction workers, iii) teachers and other staff at government and private educational establishments, all of whom have a greater interactions with other individuals and are highest risk of infection and transmission.It may be noted that the government of Punjab has placed an immediate order of 30 lakh doses with Serum Institute of India for 18-44 category, but has been informed that the allocation will be 3.30 lakh doses only for the 18–44-year age group for the month of May 2021.To boost supplies, the Vaccine Expert Committee has recommended that increased doses be sought in partnership with private sector and other sources, for allocation of available doses in May.It has also suggested that the state government initiate a consultation with national and international vaccine experts to recommend the dosing strategy for Covishield and possibly other vaccines, given the international experience with expanding population coverage and its impact.Further, the committee has recommended development of a plan for evaluation of vaccine effectiveness for prioritized groups, those with co-morbidities, and the general populations. This will be valuable in designing further control efforts and may be done in conjunction with infectious disease modelling for the state, the committee stressed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/with-only-3-30-lakh-allocation-for-18-in-may-punjab-cm-orders-70-doses-to-be-used-for-co-morbid-individuals-247705

These, he said, were not enough to handle the requirement for transporting the Oxygen supplies coming in from other states.Punjab has a 195 MT allocation from various plants in other states, but the actual supply received over the past 7 days has been around 110-120 MT daily, which has also been erratic, the Chief Minister noted. In this period, the number of patients on Oxygen support has gone up from 4,000 to around 9,000, and though the state government’s steps to monitor and streamline supplies through its controls rooms has helped in keeping things stable, the situation remains fluid and a matter of concern, he added.The current consumption of oxygen in the state is more than 225 MT daily, while the  average increase in demand every day is around 15-20%.Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan told the meeting that in addition to the shortage of trucks available with transporters in the state, the fact that a tanker takes around 4-5 days to bring the 90 MT quota allocation from Bokaro plant has made things worse. Unless the state gets more tankers, the situation could aggravate, she added.In addition to 90 MT from Bokaro, the state’s current allocation is: 60 MT from plant in Baddi, 20 MT from plant in Panipat, 15 MT from plant in Roorkee and 10 MT from plant in Dehradun. Besides, around 80 MT is generated daily from the state ASUs & local PSA, and steps are being taken to increase production on a continuous basis, she said, adding, however, that this was not sufficient to meet the increasing demand.Medical Education Minister OP Soni said more oxygen cylinders were also needed at Government hospitals to meet the growing requirement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-seeks-more-oxygen-tankers-from-centre-to-meet-growing-demand-247704

The number of doses administered last month showed a downward curve.Last week (April 25 to May 1), 5.18 lakh doses were administered by the health department —- nearly 25 per cent less than what was given a month ago. Health officials say that due to shortage of supply, the state does not have any doses to supply to hospitals tomorrow.Since the vaccination was opened for the general public above the age of 45 years, the number of administered doses should have increased instead of decreasing, say experts. The shortage has resulted in a large number of people being turned away from vaccination centres.Going by the current pace, it may take a complete year to vaccinate the state’s population, the experts add.Dr GB Singh, Director, Health and Family Welfare, said in a day or two around 6.16 lakh doses would be sent by the Central government which would last 15 days. “However, as of now, not a single dose is left in the stock to distribute to district headquarters,” he added.Dip in coverageWeek DosesVaccination so far||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-short-of-supply-vaccination-pace-slackens-247421

In the past too, the “non-conformist” legislator has had his run-ins with the civil and police administration making his political bosses uncomfortable at the turn of events.On January 22, about 80 Pathankot cops seized two stone crushing units, one of which belonged to the MLA, in the mining rich hamlet of Kirri village on the Ravi.This incident left many in the PPCC red-faced. Now, Congressmen are now mulling a revamp of the entire party machinery in the area. The consensus is that the prevailing state of affairs will not be politically beneficial to the Congress in the Assembly elections.The MLA had indeed struck a blow in the April 29 meeting when he virtually torpedoed any chance the Congress had of electing its man as the Sujanpur MC chief. “By virtue of having nine councillors in the 15-member house, we have a majority. However, this advantage is fast slipping away as BJP MLA Dinesh Babbu is making frantic efforts to engineer defections. The BJP is sure to get its man elected as the MC chief if our party does not set its house in order,” said a Congress councillor.Ever since the PPCC was forced to reschedule the election date, the BJP has gone on an overdrive to ensnare three opposition councillors which effectively means it will have the majority. The allurements being given to the fence-sitters include two of them being adjusted as president and vice-president.Pal could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhoa-congress-mlas-defiance-gives-bjp-the-advantage-247351

Now, he is holding one-to-one talks with the party councillors to know their opinion and make a consensus on the top three posts.The Congress had claimed to have gained majority in the MC with the support of nine independents. On its symbol, the Congress got 20 seats in the total of 50 wards. The SAD got 15 seats, independents 10, AAP four and BJP got just one seat.Former PCC secretary Manjit Singh Mann is trying to push the name of his wife Amanpreet Kaur Mann for the Mayor’s post. Mann claimed that a majority of councillor’s were in his wife’s favour for the post.Another councillor Rita Chopra is also said to be in the race for the Mayor’s post. Gurpreet Singh Sachdeva (Independent), Ashok Dhamija (Congress) and Parveen Kumar Peena (Congress) are also in the race for the Mayor’s post.As the Congress obtained majority in the House with the support of nine Independents, Sachdeva’s importance could not be ruled out because he holds a good clout over the Independents.Peena switched from the SAD just before the elections. Besides, Dhamija could be the best choice among the male contenders.

03-05-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Punjab farmers rejoice at poll outcome||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 2A sense of joie de vivre has gripped protesting farmers and farm leaders since the results for the elections to four state Assemblies and a union territory were declared today, especially as the Samyukt Kisan Morcha had campaigned against the BJP in West Bengal.A decisive defeat of the BJP in West Bengal is being interpreted by them as the first important step that could force the BJP-led Centre to reopen dialogue with them.At the same time, the imposition of a complete lockdown in Haryana for a week, is being eyed with suspicion that it could be used to harm the kisan morcha on the Delhi borders. Though the farm leaders believe that the Centre and/or the BJP government in Haryana would not use the Covid threat to forcibly lift the morcha, they have upped their defences. Many farmer leaders believe that lockdown could impact the joining of more farmers at the protest sites, as free movement could be restricted.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), said though there were clear directions of the SC that no force could be used on those protesting peacefully, they were prepared for any eventuality. “The government dare not use force or it will face the consequences. We are hopeful that there could be some climbing down by the Centre. Just as farmers campaigned against the BJP in Bengal, they will start doing so in UP, where the panchayat polls are due,” he said.Dr Darshan Pal, president, Krantikari Kisan Union, said a false narrative was being built that the congregation of farmers should be dispersed to stop transmission. “We ensure social distancing and distribute Vitamin tablets among protesters, besides serving concoctions to boost immunity.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-rejoice-at-poll-outcome-247347
03-05-2021||Aman Sood||Liquor traders in Punjab want relief in lieu of curbs||Tribune News ServicePatiala, May 2Fearing mounting losses due to the Covid-19 restrictions, many liquor traders in Punjab have demanded compensation for the lockdown days and curtailed working hours.In their application, they have cited low sale and huge loss along with the “pressure” of drop in sale due to farmers’ agitation and the restricted hours of operation in 2020 and now in 2021.Sale quota up but prices unchangedAs per the excise policy, any such relief can be provided to them by the Chief Minister. Traders claim that the state police had uncovered instances of manufacture and sale of illicit liquor in recent months when authentic liquor was not allowed to be home delivered like other items.“We fear with no home delivery of liquor and curtailed hours of wine shops, the illegal trade will only mushroom as they would smuggle and drop liquor at homes,” said a liquor trader.“Usually, 85 per cent of liquor sale takes place from 6 pm to 11 pm after factories and shops are closed. During the day, only 15 per cent sales are reported. Imposition of lockdown since April 26 and complete lockdown from Friday 6 pm to Monday 5 am has hit the sales badly,” said another trader.The letter reads: “We request the government to waive the licence renewal fee for the month of April 2021 as liquor trade, restaurants and other eating joints are already facing losses due to fresh restrictions.”A Venu Prasad, Principal Secretary, Excise and Taxation, said: “As of now, no decision has been taken in this regard. We will look into the issue.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/liquor-traders-in-punjab-want-relief-in-lieu-of-curbs-247360
03-05-2021||GS Paul||Amid second wave, Golden Temple sees dip in footfall||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, May 2Amid the second wave of Covid, the SGPC has witnessed a massive dip in the “offerings” from devotees at the Golden Temple.The SGPC had proposed an expected budget of Rs 912 crore for 2021-22, which is Rs 40 crore more than the revenue that the Sikh body expects to make.Frund crunch loomsSGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur has appealed to the sangat to contribute generously as there is a sharp decline in income due to Covid restrictions this year too.With the weekend curfew that commenced from Friday and remained in force till 5 am on Monday, the footfall of devotees at the Golden Temple was for ‘namesake’, said Golden Temple’s manager Gurinder Singh Mathrewal.The low footfall, he attributed, to the disruption of air and rail connectivity as devotees from overseas and other states could not make it.Prior to Covid in 2019-2020, from an average collection of ‘offerings’ which was Rs 23 lakh a day, that included the online donations, the existing weekend collection (when the curfew was imposed) has dipped to between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000. Since, the Covid crisis has hit globally, it has impacted the online donations too that come mainly from NRIs.The dip in the footfall could be gauged from the fact that prior to the pandemic, the Darshani Deodi bridge, that leads to the Sanctum Santorum used to be jam-packed with three queues of waiting devotees for hours, today witnessed a scant number of devotees. Under normal circumstances, close to one lakh devotees visit the shrine on Saturdays and Sundays.An official of Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee Langar hall, which was popularly tagged as the world’s largest kitchen that fed between 70,000-80,000 devotees a day, said since the outbreak of Covid, the langar was being prepared for not more than 20,000 heads.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-second-wave-golden-temple-sees-dip-in-footfall-247361

As a result, many people have turned up for vaccination.Mansa was lagging behind in vaccination, owing to people’s misconception about Covid-19.

He accused both the Centre and state government of failing to crackdown on such practices.Mann said there were reports of black marketing of Covid-19 supplies, especially the antiviral drug Remdesivir, which was given to severely ill patients.“While hospitals are facing shortage of Covid drugs and people are being harassed, miscreants on the other hand are able to supply the same for 10 times the original price,” he said.He claimed that the drugs were being smuggled from hospitals and producers and critical patients were being asked to pay inflated price. “Offenders are hoarding oxygen cylinders and are later supplying it at higher prices,” he said.Taking a dig at the Central government, Mann said that the government had “failed” to crackdown on those indulging in hoarding and over-pricing of essential Covid-19 medicines and oxygen cylinders. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-failed-to-keep-black-marketeers-in-check-aap-247367

The anaesthesia department of the hospital is organising the training.“No resident should be posted at any Covid-19 facility without undergoing the essential training module,” said Dr Rajiv Sharma, principal. “From uploading the details of patients on mobile apps to maintaining a record, interns and final year students can offer great support to overworked senior doctors in Covid wards,” said a senior functionary in the Medical Education Department.However, Covid duties are more challenging for interns who are waiting to appear in post-graduation exam for admission in MD/MS courses. The exam was scheduled for April 18, but now stands postponed indefinitely in view of surge in Covid cases.“Till the exam is conducted, most us won’t be willing to work in Covid wards,” said an intern.Sources said the National Medical Commission has conveyed to the state governments that final year medical students wouldn’t be equipped to make clinical decisions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/final-year-mbbs-students-to-help-overworked-seniors-247365

Mohinder Gupta, president, Furnace Association, said of the 600 industrial units in the town, more than 50 per cent had already shut and the rest were barely operational.He said while they were sensitive to the prevailing situation in the country, a formula could be adopted wherein 80 per cent of the total oxygen generated could be supplied for medical use and the rest for industrial requirement.Appreciating the CM’s commitment to not shut industrial units, he said if the situation persisted, migration of labour would soon follow as the industry would not be in a position to pay electricity bills or GST. The administration has formed an oxygen audit committee and deployed police and civil officials at all six oxygen-producing units.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/industry-seeks-part-supply-of-oxygen-247369

The reason: shortage of manpower, especially, anaesthetists to use these ventilators. Many ventilatiors were purchased during the first wave of pandemic.As per the health department, around 121 posts of anaesthetist and 98 of medicine doctors, along with others, were advertised recently, but only few showed up for the walk-in interview.Dr Harshinder Kaur, Government Medical College, PatialaProvide these to tertiary institutesTo ease out the workload and improve quality at tertiary healthcare institutes, ventilators should be provided to sub-divisional levels for better management of patients.Dr GB Singh, Director, Health and Family Welfare Department, said only 24 specialists, including some anaesthetist, of the total 488 posts had joined the department in the walk-in interview held last week.Consequent upon the shortage of manpower, the government had to distribute ventilators to private hospitals wherein infrastructure and manpower was already available. Besides, some ventilators have been redistributed in government hospitals taking into consideration the availability of professionals to handle the ventilators in the ICU therein.Confirming the development, Dr GB said, “We have now redistributed the ventilators to private and government hospitals where required manpower was available. Ironically, some anaesthetists are already posted at sub-divisional level or district hospitals. However, they don’t have the ventilators because these have only been made available at tertiary health care institutes like Government Medical Colleges.Consequently, the three tertiary Covid healthcare institutes — Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot — are overwhelmed with Covid patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/short-of-staff-punjab-health-department-gives-ventilators-to-private-hospitals-247371

More than a year later, we still do not have any L-3 facility for Sangrur patients. The authorities should have made the required arrangements at the Civil Hospital,” said Winnerjit Singh Goldy, SAD spokesperson.L-1 patients are being isolated at homes while the administration has arranged 128 beds for L-2 patients.
