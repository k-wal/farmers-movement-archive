Amid the call of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to oppose the weekend lockdown, the Chief Minister had on Friday asked the DGP to strictly enforce all the weekend restrictions and not allow any violation at any cost.“Nobody can be allowed to play with the lives of the people,” he reiterated on Saturday, adding that the leaders had misinterpreted his remarks. “How can my government go against the interests of the farmers when it was the first in the country to move the amendment laws in the Vidhan Sabha to annul the draconian Farm Laws of the Central Government?” asked the Chief Minister, asserting that as far as the central laws were concerned, his government’s stand against them had been clear and consistent. “This is not the time to play politics but to put all our energies into protecting the life of every human being,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/wont-allow-violation-of-covid-curbs-says-amarinder-singh-250005
08-05-2021||Bathinda/Mansa||Farmers' protest call against lockdown gets tepid response in Bathinda, Mansa||The farm unions call for protest against the lockdown has barely managed to leave the desired impact on the ground level of Bathinda and Mansa districts, as they had to adhere to strict restrictions of weekend lockdown.  Markets in these districts remained shut throughout the day. After a call by Sanyukat Kisan Morcha, farm unions were to carry out the protest march, and rallies against the lockdown, and support traders to open their shops and outlets, but the latter did not comply with them.   State president of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Amit Kapoor, said: "We support farmers, but considering the ranging pandemic which has claimed several lives, we decided not to open shops when there were lockdown restrictions imposed by the government. We do not want to risk people's lives".Although, farm unions—including BKU Ekta Ugrahan, BKU Sidhupur, BKU Lakhowal, BKU Dakonda and Punjab Kisan Union among dozens of others— unions carried out rallies, and marched in the city, in different blocks of these two districts against lockdown. Shopkeepers and traders' fraternity largely kept their shops closed. In a few instances, farmers have managed to help shopkeepers to open their shops, but the police intervened and closed down the shops. Farm union leaders said, that the lockdown restrictions affected the business of the traders' fraternity last year as well, and that they support traders to open their shops. Union leaders have also claimed that they managed to help shopkeepers to open their shops. A leader of BKU Sidhupur, Resham Singh Yatri, said: "We have managed to help shopkeepers to open their shops in Maur, Goniana, Rampura, and other areas before police forced them to close shops". He added: "If the government was aware that the second wave of coronavirus can come, then why did they not take requisite steps in time to counter it? The government wasted crucial times rather than augmenting medical infrastructure, and now it wants to impose lockdown again to harass people."Deputy Superintendent of Police, Gurjit Singh Romana, said: "We had carried out a march in the city to keep round-the-clock vigil to make sure that lockdown restrictions imposed in wake of the rising number of COVID-19 cases are being duly adhered to. There was no shop opened in the Bathinda city."Farm union leaders said that they would continue to exhort traders to open shops, and if the administration or police stop them, they will launch agitation against them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-protest-call-against-lockdown-gets-tepid-response-in-bathinda-mansa-249998

Describing the situation as “critical” warranting “immediate attention of the Union of India”, the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh said the governments must draw a common strategy.The assertions came after amicus curiae Rupinder Khosla, the Congress-led Punjab Government and BJP-led Haryana Government attacked the Centre for complete disarray following oxygen shortfall. They submitted that instead of satisfying the oxygen requirements from nearby plants, the deficit was being fulfilled by transporting it from far-off places.Haryana Advocate General Baldev Raj Mahajan submitted that the delay resulting from oxygen allocation from far-off places such as Rourkela and Jamnagar had led to several deaths in the state.“Whatever has been submitted by the amicus curiae and the advocates-general of Punjab and Haryana, it appears that the residents of these three states (Chandigarh included) are children of a lesser god… Why are you (Centre) being mute spectators and why do you need directions from various courts? We do not understand. Is there a proper strategy or left to the itsy-bitsy of certain officials?” the Bench asserted.Additional Solicitor-General of India Satya Pal Jain said the oxygen allocation was being done equitably to all states without discrimination. He said the Centre had enhanced oxygen supply to 227 MT for Punjab, 267 MT for Haryana and 40 MT for Chandigarh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/reorient-oxygen-supply-for-punjab-haryana-hc-249712

We have shifted a doctor from Talwandi Sabo in place of doctors who have resigned. It is unfortunate that doctors are quitting their jobs when their services are required the most.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/2-more-doctors-resign-at-bathinda-civil-hospital-249613
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Staff crunch, drugs shortage cripple govt hospitals||The two biggest challenges being faced by the state in dealing with the surge in Covid cases are the shortage of staff at government health facilities and the trickle supply of controlled medicines.350 posts of specialists lying vacantThe government is building two 100-bed Covid hospitals in Mohali and Bathinda, but 30% posts of specialists are yet to filled. Almost 350 posts of medical officers in the state health department are lying vacant.While the state government is making all-out efforts to recruit medical and paramedical staff as it prepares to increase the bed capacity by 2,000 beds, it is still dependent on the Centre for the release of the “much-in-demand” biological therapy — Tocilizumab — for critically ill patients.In the past one month, the state has received just 299 doses of this medicine from the Centre and distributed it to all Level-3 facilities. Tocilizumab is widely recommended by doctors for patients with high viral load that leads to cytokine storm in their bodies. As a result, relatives of these patients are running from pillar to post to get the medicine. Its alternatives, too, are not available, though these are not part of controlled supply.“Today, 85,000 doses of Remdesivir have been allocated to us and district committees headed by Deputy Commissioners have been asked to monitor its smooth supply. We are trying to remove the bottlenecks in the supply of Tocilizumab and its alternatives,” said Principal Secretary, Health, Hussan Lal.Almost 64 per cent of the Covid patients on oxygen support are currently seeking treatment in government health facilities (2,040 of total 3,193 are in government hospitals). The government is making efforts to quickly build two 100-bed Covid hospitals in Mohali and Bathinda, but over 30 per cent posts of specialists in the state health department are lying vacant, which raises questions of how these new facilities will be manned.Dr Gagandeep Singh, president, PCMS Association, said almost 350 posts of medical officers in the state health department were lying vacant and it was affecting the services during the pandemic.“Till recently, there was no medicine specialist in Kapurthala and Muktsar and doctors from other districts were deputed there. In Bathinda, which is witnessing a surge, two medicine specialists have resigned and only two are there to deal with the patient load. The posts of epidemiologists are vacant in five or six districts, besides anaesthetists and staff nurses,” he said.Aware of this, the government is going ahead with a recruitment drive beginning Saturday, besides asking final-year medical and nursing students to help deal with the patients, besides seeking private volunteer doctors and paramedics on board.“As many as 250 posts of specialist doctors are to be filled, for which walk-in interviews are to be held, beginning Saturday,” confirmed Hussan Lal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/staff-crunch-drugs-shortage-cripple-govt-hospitals-249619

The Covid-induced lockdown has made it difficult for him to sustain his family of seven.“I am returning empty handed for a fourth day in a row. I don’t even have money for bus fare.

Despite remaining without work due to the pandemic since last March, the landless labourers have adequate wheat at their houses.Despite opposition from upper caste, Dalits at various villages have produced wheat and divided the crop as per their share.“Like past this year also each family has received 500 kg of wheat from joint farming. We urge the state government to promote the concept of joint farming to save Dalits from starvation as many upper caste people have been trying to take reserved land under the names of dummy candidates,” said Charan Singh, a member of the Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC) from Balad Kalan village.This year 228 Dalit families have taken 93 acres of reserved land from the total village common land of 280 acres on annual lease at Balad Kalan village. They have not only produced required wheat for themselves but also selling the extra produce.At Bharo village, 169 Dalit families have taken 28 acres and are cultivating crops.“A majority of labourers are without work and only joint farming is our source of food as each family in our village has received 4 quintals of wheat by joint cultivation,” said Krishan Singh, a villager.The story is same in many other villages of the district and the Dalits have demanded transparency in the auction of reserved lands from village common lands.“Officials have been creating problems during the auction of reserved land. The government must look into the matter as joint farming is the only ray of hope for Dalits during these difficult times,” said Mukesh Malaud, president, ZPSC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/joint-farming-a-boon-for-dalits-in-trying-times-249647

MLA and Youth Wing state president Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer inducted the leaders into the party.Taking a dig at Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Hayer said instead of fighting for chair and power, the Captain-led Congress government should focus on people amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said traders and businessmen in the state were facing difficulties and going through tough times. “If imposing a lockdown is necessary, then it is fine; but the Captain government must think about the people who are the worst hit due to this. The government should support them and at least provide them financial assistance,” he added.The AAP leader said it had been over a year since the outbreak of Covid, but the Modi-led Central Government and the Captain government failed in making adequate arrangements and facilities in the health sector to tackle the situation.

08-05-2021||Patiala||Scrap faulty purchase pacts, engineers tell powercom||The PSEB Engineers’ Association has written to the top brass of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) suggesting improving the working of the PSPCL and taking remedies to “save consumers” from increasing power bills.For the review of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with independent power producers (IPPs) up to 2020, the PSPCL has surrendered unutilised power worth more than Rs 4,000 crore. “The per-unit cost from these IPPs has been increasing almost on yearly basis. Moreover, these IPPs are finding loopholes in the PPAs and have been indulging in litigation resulting in higher power cost to the consumers of the state. The overall impact of all such litigations will be around Rs 20,000 crore over the next remaining 20 years of the agreements,” states the letter.“Long-term exclusive PPAs with the IIPs should be cancelled and like other projects power should be procured only as per actual requirement of the corporation at market competitive rates from these IPPs,” said general secretary of the associationAjay Pal Singh Atwal.“Further, to bring down fuel cost, Pachwara Coal mine needs to be made fully operational. If the captive coal mine allotted to the PSPCL in 2015 is made operational, the PSPCL will save Rs 600 to 700 per tonne of coal on account of cost difference only. Actual savings will be more than this,” reads the letter, a copy of which is with The Tribune.The load curve of Punjab has a huge variation within day time as well as during the year. In summer months, the energy consumed goes up by 120 per cent in comparison to winter consumption. “Even during the day, there is a lot of difference in demand at peak and off peak. To flatten this curve, lowering night tariff in industrial, domestic and commercial in winter months, extending the concept of incentive-based tariff on higher consumption beyond threshold limit in off-peak periods to all categories, can help,” states the letter.The PSEB engineers’ association further says that in line with ‘Pani Bachao Paise Kamao’, incentives can be offered to those AP feeders opting for night supply. Industrialisation will also help in a big way to flatten the curve. “This benefit may specifically be provided to the steel and furnace industry at Mandi Gobindgarh and bicycle industry at Ludhiana,” states president of the association Jasvir Singh Dhiman.“The corporatisation of the erstwhile board into corporation was to enhance its working and to keep it free from bureaucratic processes. Whereas there seems to be a move by management to refer almost everything to Punjab Government rules and regulations, this is a step backwards. It is suggested that the management should consider simplifying rules and regulations and enhancing the efficiency of the corporation instead of referring to Punjab Government regulations at every instance,” claims the association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/scrap-faulty-purchase-pacts-engineers-tell-powercom-249654

It cannot shut its doors for justice-seekers,” the association said.It added the Bar executive committee was extremely concerned about non-listing of matters, especially habeas corpus petitions, anticipatory bails, regular bails, suspension of sentence, stay matters and other matters involving violation of fundamental rights.“More than 300 written complaints and numerous oral complaints have been received in the office of the executive committee regarding wrongful rejection of mentioning and use of pick and choose policy in allowing limited cases,” the resolution stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-bar-body-seeks-cjs-transfer-249655
