16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM stresses need to propagate ideology of Guru Tegh Bahadur||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday underscored the need to propagate the ideology of Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur to promote values of peace, harmony and secularism. Taking part in the deliberations during a webinar organised by KS Raju Legal Trust on the topic, “Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur, the Epitome of Resistance Against Genocide and Conversion of Hindus and Sikhs under Islamic Rule in India”, the CM said the secular character enshrined in the Constitution of the country is a shining example of “unity in diversity”. The Sikh Guru preached the concept of “Sarbat Da Bhala” (welfare of all) to create a harmonious society, where people, regardless of colour, caste, creed, race and religion, can live together in peace and harmony, he said.The chief minister spoke about various events planned by his government to commemorate the 400th Parkash Purb of the Sikh Guru. His government has initiated several development projects, including the conservation and development of the jail at Bassi Pathana where the ninth Sikh Guru, along with his supporters, was imprisoned by Noor Mohammad Khan Mirza for 40 days while he was reportedly on his way to meet Aurangzeb, he added.

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir seeks financial aid for kin of Covid-19 victims||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday asked Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to recognise the “humanitarian crisis” unfolding in Punjab due to the pandemic and take immediate relief measures, including providing financial aid to those who have lost their kin to Covid-19.Badal demanded Rs two lakh compensation to families who have lost their members to Covid-19, a monthly pension of Rs 6,000 to those left orphaned in the pandemic and a monthly cash assistance of Rs 6,000 to poor families for a period of six months.Asking the chief minister to spare a thought for those who had been hit by Covid-19 as well as the impact of the lockdown on the poor, skilled workers and traders, the SAD president said, “It is heart wrenching that the government has done nothing by way of giving relief to any section of society for more than one year despite claiming to have spent Rs 1,100 crore on Covid care.”“I appeal to the chief minister to mitigate the sufferings of various sections of society which have been worst hit by the pandemic on an urgent basis or else we will witness another tragedy unfolding before our eyes,” he said.Badal, in a statement here, said the Congress government should immediately announce a financial assistance of Rs two lakh to all families who had lost their earning members.He said simultaneously a monthly pension of Rs 6,000 per month should be provided to Covid orphans till they attained the age of maturity.“Such children should also be offered free education up to post graduation level,” he added.Asserting that it was unfortunate that the chief minister had failed to give any relief to people who were being fleeced at the hands of private hospitals, Badal said, “It has already been pointed out how private hospitals are charging Rs 2.50 lakh to Rs 5 lakh for Covid treatment. Similarly, there is a free for all as far as life-saving drugs and injections are concerned. He said it was high time that the government moved in and provided relief to the common man.“The government should bear the entire cost of treatment for patients with an annual income of less than Rs 10 lakh in private hospitals,” he said.Badal said poor families were the hardest hit due to the continued lockdown in the state.He said the government should provide monthly cash assistance of Rs 6,000 to all BPL families for a period of six months to help them tide through the crisis.He said taxi and auto owners should also be given an allowance of Rs 6,000 per month for the next six months.He said the compensation for Covid-19-infected registered labourers should be increased to Rs 3,000 from the present Rs 1,500 and in case any member of their family was infected the compensation should be increased to Rs 5,000 instead of the present Rs 3,000.He said it was unfortunate that even the meagre compensation amounts announced for registered labourers by the government had not been processed till now.The SAD president also stressed the need to provide debt and other interim relief to traders and industrialists.He said the periodical lockdowns imposed by the state had dealt a crushing blow to trade and industry.“The government should provide a short-term interest subsidy to this sector to allow traders and industrialists to meet their operational expenses. This sector should also be provided free power for a period of four months to compensate for the losses suffered by them during this difficult phase,” he said.Badal also requested the chief minister to give relief to the common man by waiving power and water bills.

It should ensure vaccine distribution across all states and union territories through clinical establishment for proper vaccination of the 18-44 age group.Capt Amarinder pointed out that he had even earlier suggested that in view of the modalities of supply chain management, it would be operationally and financially most expedient if the entire procurement and supply of vaccine is done through the Union Government for all age groups, including persons in the 18-44 group where states have been allowed by the Centre to directly procure the vaccines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-must-procure-vaccines-for-whole-country-capt-to-pm-253413

The district administration is making tall claims on paper but on the ground, the situation is quite grim.Government hospitals don’t have a single level-3 bed and private hospitals are charging hefty fee, leaving poor patients in the lurch.A city-based doctor said, “Daily expenses of level-2 and level-3 patients at a private hospital are around Rs 40,000-50,000 per day and no receipts are being given.”Even delay in giving permission by the district administration to Dr Vitull K Gupta’s Kishore Ram Hospital, which he has given to NGO Naujawan Welfare Society for the free treatment of poor patients, has invited criticism.AAP MLA Prof Baljinder Kaur said, “Not allowing Kishori Ram Hospital to give free treatment to Covid patients is a demonstration of the Capt government’s insensitivity towards poor.”Bathinda Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan said, “We have already instructed the hospitals and IMA to charge as per the state government orders. Nobody can charge more than that from Covid patients and if anyone is doing so, strict action will be taken against them.”On the nod to Kishore Ram Hospital, he said. “The hospital has given me the list of manpower today, so by tomorrow, we will give it the approval.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/charging-rs-40-000-a-day-pvt-hospitals-fleece-patients-253415

Consequently, officials had to organise a testing camp at the village today.The health officials collected 121 samples there. However, villagers are still scared to come forward for testing.Dr Davinderjit, Senior Medical Officer, Bhadson, said, “Six villagers have already died of Covid. We are regularly conducting tests. However, people are still afraid to come forward. There is social stigma and fear of hospitalisation in rural areas.”The officials said the six patients who died of Covid were hospitalised only after their health deteriorated. The patients had not undergone Covid tests before they were hospitalised, said the officials.One of the villagers said, “The panchayat is now making announcements at the gurdwara asking people to get tested and vaccinated. Earlier, we took it lightly.”Sources in the Health Department said a majority of the villagers who died of Covid were taking treatment from registered medical practitioners (RMPs), who had no expertise of Covid treatment. “These RMPs are taking advantage of villagers’ fear of going to hospitals,” said a senior official.Taranveer Singh, Sarpanch, Ajnauda Kalan, said, “Earlier, villagers were showing a lackadaisical attitude towards Covid precautions.

16-05-2021||Gurdaspur||Blame game over shifting of ventilators from Gurdaspur||An unsavoury situation has developed with Gurdaspur MP Sunny Deol’s personal staff objecting to the shifting of four ventilators from the district to the Ludhiana Civil Surgeon’s office.The MP had given two such machines from his MPLAD fund, while the other two had been donated by Dubai businessman Surinder Pal Singh Oberoi during the first wave of Covid in March last year. In extreme cases, a ventilator becomes essential to keep a patient alive.On May 6, the Ludhiana Deputy Commissioner wrote to his Gurdaspur counterpart seeking four ventilators as these were lying “unused”.Acting promptly, Gurdaspur DC Mohammad Ishfaq and Civil Surgeon Dr Harbhajan Ram made arrangements to shift the ventilators to Ludhiana.The machines, sources say, were lying in a state of disuse because of shortage of ‘critical care staff’ needed to manage these. While the MP is recuperating in a US hospital following a shoulder injury, his staff started pointing fingers at the district administration over the move “despite the fact that the number of Covid patients was showing an increase across the state and not in Ludhiana alone.”Minutes after Deol’s PA Pankaj Joshi made this accusation, Ishfaq clarified he had taken the consent of both Deol and Oberoi in writing. He also made it clear the machines were shifted “on a temporary basis”. Dr Satnam Singh Nijjar, Chairman, Gurdaspur Planning Board, had facilitated the DC’s conversation with Oberoi, who is in Dubai. Oberoi, while speaking to The Tribune, confirmed the DC had taken his permission. Minutes after Joshi’s had levelled the allegations at a specially convened press conference, Ishfaq clarified his position through a press release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/blame-game-over-shifting-of-ventilators-from-gurdaspur-253421

16-05-2021||Amritsar||Congress stalwart Bhatia dies of Covid at 100||Congress stalwart and six-time Amritsar MP Raghunandan Lal Bhatia passed away after a brief illness here late last night. Bhatia was to turn 101 on July 3.He was hospitalised after testing positive for Covid. He is survived by son Ramesh Bhatia and daughter Saroj Munjal. His body was cremated with full state honours by following the Covid protocol today.Survived two terror attacksMaking his foray into politics by a turn of fate, Bhatia had an illustrious political career, serving as the Minister of State for External Affairs in the PV Narasimha Rao government. He also remained the Governor of Kerala (2004 to 2008) and Bihar (July 2008 to June 2009).Born into a business family, Bhatia began his political career after the demise of his brother Durgadas Bhatia, who was the sitting MP from Amritsar. He successfully won the 1972 bypoll and repeated the feat in 1980, 1984, 1991, 1996 and 1999. It was cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu, parachuted by late mentor Arun Jaitley from the Amritsar seat during the 2004 General Election, who ended his electoral innings.After his exit, it took one-and-a-half decades for the Congress to make a come-back in Amritsar, with Capt Amarinder Singh winning the seat in 2014.Bhatia began his political career as a Communist activist, which worked to his advantage later when he contested the elections from the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat on a Congress ticket.In the 1970s and 80s the Communist parties had a sway over several Assembly seats here due to a large number of textile, fan and carpet factories, which had employed a large number of people. His another brother Sham Sunder Bhatia was associated with the RSS, while his fourth sibling, Dr JL Bhatia, was a TB specialist.Bhatia’s demise evoked emotive remarks from politicians cutting across party lines. Many Congress leaders from the region called him their political mentor. His political style of keeping a clean image in public won him goodwill.Congress MLA Rajkumar Verka, recalling the contribution of Bhatia, said his service was utilised in resolving bilateral matters with Pakistan and China. Then Prime Minister AB Vajpayee had utilised his services to hold parleys to defuse tension with China.BJP leader Lakshmi Kanta Chawla said she had cordial relations with Bhatia. She had gone to congratulate him when he turned 100 last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-stalwart-bhatia-dies-of-covid-at-100-253423

The deceased was earlier admitted to the Jalandhar Civil Hospital from where she was referred to the Amritsar Medical College. An ambulance carried the patient to Amritsar, where she remained admitted in the surgical ward,” he said.However, Dilip denied the claims, saying not only doctors in Amritsar told him on May 9 that his daughter was positive, but also shifted her to Covid ward on the third floor. He returned to Jalandhar in a private ambulance after borrowing money.He said the video was shot when he returned with the body and went to the cremation ground with his son to perform the last rites. A daily wager, Dilip said he didn’t understand Punjabi and the hospital staff in Amritsar didn’t guide him. “Even the ambulance driver asked me to pay Rs 6,000-7,000 to reach Jalandhar,” he said, adding: “The hospital staff said they provide ambulance only between 9 am and 6 pm. After pleading multiple times, a private ambulance driver agreed to drop me for Rs 2,500.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-help-man-carries-daughters-body-on-shoulders-in-jalandhar-253425

He had also been the granthi of Sri Harmandir Sahib. He was around 70 years old.Giani Harpreet Singh, officiating Jathedar of Akal Takht, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur and Giani Raghbir Singh, Jathedar of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, expressed sorrow on his demise.Bibi Jagir Kaur said with untimely demise of Jathedar Vedanti, the Sikh community had been deprived of a Panthic personality who had the intense linguistic knowledge of Gurbani.“His demise has created a vacuum in the Sikh Panthic circles. He spent his entire life preaching Gurbani grammar and guiding new learners about the interpretation of the Gurbani.

While many have welcomed it, others have said there was no need of it.Locals are elated and hopeful that the district status will bring required development to their area. “A district status will bring the required development to our area. Though it is late, we are hopeful that it will help us,” said Salim, a Malerkotla resident.But political opponents are not convinced. “The CM has proved that his party has been working only to divide residents under the name of caste at the cost of thousands of crores. There was no need to make Malerkotla a district and we would have appreciated had the CM took pains to provide basic facilities there,” said Randeep Deol, Sangrur district president of the BJP.SAD spokesman Winnerjit Singh Goldy said the creation of a new district was not required at this time, but development must be ensured in all areas. “The Punjab Government has failed to provide basic amenities in various districts and now, the creation of another district will not help the party in any way,” said Goldy.Malerkotla MLA and Cabinet Minister Razia Sultana said the declaration of a district status for Malerkotla would bring the required development in the area.“We are thankful to the Chief Minister for accepting a long-pending demand of area residents,” she said.Meanwhile, the local administration is yet to receive an official confirmation and officials continue to report to the Sangrur DC. “We have not received any official confirmation as yet. Since Friday, Saturday and Sunday are holidays, we expect it on Monday,” said Malerkotla SDM Simarpreet Kaur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/district-status-cheers-malerkotla-residents-oppn-unimpressed-253432
