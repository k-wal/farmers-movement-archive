All three were lodged in the Koratine barrack which houses cells for inmates. The police were investigating how they managed to scale a 10-feet inner wall and then the outer wall which is over 12 feet in height.“The trio managed a hole in the cell wall and later managed to scale the other two walls, without being noticed”, sources inside the jail said. “We came to know about the escape in the morning when during change of guard one of the jail guard notices the hole in the cell wall”, they added The missing convicts who allegedly fled from the jail include Sher Singh Son of Village Vanike, Amritsar, Inderjeet Singh Dhiana of village Ranipur Komboa in Kapurthala and Jaspreet Singh Noopi of village Dhadi in Roopnagar. Out of the three, Sher Singh was deported from the United Kingdom to serve the rest of his sentence in a drugs case, in which he was sentenced to 22 years behind bars. “He was in Patiala jail for over two years”, said a top cop. “There is a hole which they made through the wall of their cell, not the outer wall. We are searching the jail premises as well”, said a senior official. Patiala SSP Vikramjeet Duggal confirmed the arrest of Inderjeet Singh and said raids are on to nab the other two escapees too.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/patiala-jail-breach-one-arrested-out-of-the-three-who-escaped-248935

After detailed deliberations, it was decided to reduce the deferral period from 28 to 14 days subject to the condition that the donor conforms to other norms for blood donation.In the blood bank at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital here, against the average monthly donation of 1,400-1,500 units of blood, just 450 to 500 units were being received for the past month.“To avoid being caught off guard, we are approaching NGOs to ask the people to donate blood before getting the jab,” a source said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/now-donate-blood-after-14-days-of-jab-248922

This is despite the Punjab Government making a Covid-negative report or a vaccination certificate mandatory for entering the state. Of the total 1,052 Covid patients admitted to 62 private hospitals, 561 are from outside the district.Balwinder Singh from Panipat, who has brought his mother here, said, “No oxygen beds are available in Delhi-NCR or Haryana. I was fortunate to find one in Jalandhar.”Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said he was aware patients from faraway places were seeking treatment in Jalandhar. “We can’t turn away any critical patient. It will be inhuman to ask anyone on life support to furnish any certificate,” said Thori.About oxygen availability, he said they were getting 7 to 10 MT (700 to 1,000 cylinders) of the life-saving gas daily. “We have asked to raise the quota to 12 to 14 MT as the demand is increasing. About 80 per cent of our L2 beds are occupied. We are making arrangements to deal with the emerging situation,” he added.Dr BS Johal from a private hospital said they were receiving 40 to 60 distress calls daily from outside Punjab. “Though Jalandhar has long been known as a hub of medical tourism, the caseload from other states has increased manifold during the pandemic,” he said.Dr Harnoor Singh Pruthi from another private facility said most of his patients were from Delhi. He, however, wondered where would Punjab patients head in case the state faced a Delhi-like crisis.62 covid care facilities||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/critical-covid-positive-patients-from-delhi-haryana-up-rush-to-jalandhar-248734

Traders from other states have stopped visiting their farms due to which their produce has started rotting. Left with no option, many farmers have started dumping their damaged produce in the fields or on roads.Farmers Naib Singh and Satnam Singh say they have grown capsicum this year, but are now unable to sell it due to which the produce has started rotting.From Punjab, capsicum is supplied to Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, etc. However, traders from those states could not visit Punjab this season due to the imposition of a lockdown, they said.The Punjab Government should allow traders from other states to visit their farms so that their produce was not damaged, they said.Even last year, the farmers had to bear losses of around Rs 1 lakh per acre. This year, the government should help them out of this trouble as incurring losses for the second consecutive year would be extremely difficult for them, they said.“If the situation doesn’t improve, the farmers will not go in for crop diversification. It is high time the government takes steps to help farmers,” said Gurmeet Singh, another farmer.Mohinder Singh Bhainibagha, district general secretary of the BKU (Dakonda), said traders should be allowed to visit capsicum growers or they would dump their produce outside the office of the Deputy Commissioner concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-induced-lockdown-no-buyers-punjab-farmers-dump-veggies-248743

For the purpose, Justice Sibal set a month’s deadline.Justice Sibal asserted furnishing false sureties at the time of release of an accused on bail clearly amounted to interference in the administration of justice. It was a menace, which continued to be rampant despite issuance of directions by the High Court in December 2011 in the case of “Rajinder Kumar versus State of Haryana”. The same was required to be put to an end.“Such inquiry, subject to following of Covid-19 protocols, be conducted at the earliest, in accordance with law and a report in this regard be furnished to this Court before the adjourned date,” Justice Sibal added.The case has its genesis in an FIR registered by the police on a complaint filed by the tax authorities at Ludhiana, inter alia alleging that the petitioner, by creating 23 fake accounts, had raised fake invoices of Rs 393 crore. The petitioner was then nominated as an accused and arrested.The trial court in January granted bail to the petitioner, subject to furnishing of two sureties of Rs 1 crore, each along with a bank guarantee of Rs 50 lakh. The trial court accepted the same and ordered the petitioner’s release. It was later revealed that both the sureties, whose aadhaar cards were produced before the trial court, had actually not consented to stand sureties. They had also not provided documents regarding their properties, which were produced before the trial Court. Accordingly, an FIR for cheating, forgery and other offence was registered under Sections 170, 199, 200, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 474 and 120-B IPC was registered against the petitioner.His counsel contended that the petitioner was falsely implicated and had no role to play in the arrangement and production of the sureties, which were managed by his counsel. Before parting with the order, Justice Sibal stayed the petitioner’s arrest subject to his taking part and cooperating in the inquiry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/probe-false-sureties-bail-bonds-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-248612

The Punjab Finance Minister has sought discussions in the GST Council on several issues in order to make a mid-course correction in the GST system. The central government is also reluctant to appoint a vice-chair from the states and operationalise the Dispute Redressal Mechanism five years after a constitutional amendment.There was no discussion at all in the GST Council on substantive changes in rules, like restricting tax credits, by a committee of officers (the GST Implementation Committee) that was actually meant for mundane matters. Without political oversight, the harassment of tax-payers has taken an entirely new dimension. “For example I fail to see any reason to demand GST from a recipient in a long supply- chain for a possible sin committed by someone with no connection whatsoever with the recipient,” he wrote.The Punjab Finance Minister also sought transparency in GST data because there is little information as to whether the revenue inflow during a month relates mostly to the preceding month or are arrears.The GST Council, he wrote, should discuss whether GST should be exempted on Covid-related items, if interest rates under GST law should be on a par with the market interest rate and relief to most-impacted sectors such as aviation, hotels, commercial reality and retail. The GST Council also needs to discuss whether there should be amendments to allow donations of Covid goods without denying tax credits on inputs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/why-no-gst-meet-for-6-months-punjab-finance-minister-to-centre-248613

It is really unthinkable and unbelievable that such an active and healthy person like him will leave us in such a sad way,” Singh said in his condolence message.The former PM remembered Malhotra as one of his closest friends for the past six decades and said, “Malhotra was an eminent academician, an excellent administrator and a very good human being who was a champion in the field of social research. He founded the CRRID in Chandigarh. One can well say that through CRRID he was able to put Chandigarh on the international map on issues of economy, agriculture, banking, resource mobilisation, health and international relations.” Recalling Malhotra’s urge for peace between India and Pakistan, the former PM said Malhotra “persuaded to forge” an academic link between Panjab University, Chandigarh, and Punjab University, Lahore.“An intense votary of peace between India and Pakistan and good neighbourly relations, Malhotra wanted the two universities to hold online classes for each other’s students. His services to the nation, especially Punjab, will always be remembered by all who happened to come in contact with his work,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rashpal-malhotras-services-will-always-be-remembered-says-manmohan-singh-248614

Everyone waited with fingers crossed till the life-saving gas from Punjab did not reach here,” he said.While the Oxygen Control Room of Punjab checked on their own supplies and availability of tankers to ferry the gas in a short span, the matter was escalated by the Panchkula DC with V Umashankar, Principal Secretary to the Haryana CM. He, in turn, took up the matter with Punjab Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan at whose intervention it was decided to spare some oxygen from Patiala for Haryana, as Punjab had enough stock to last till noon today.“The decision to divert the supply was taken keeping in view the extremely sensitive situation and to save lives, but the problem was arranging the tankers to ferry oxygen and filling of these tankers. Once the tankers were requisitioned, the problem then arose that a small quantity (2.5 MT) of oxygen cannot be filled in the available big tankers because of air pressure issues. We then filled 4.5-MT oxygen in the tankers and rushed those to Panchkula, which took 2.5 MT, with a promise to return it today,” confirmed Rahul Tiwari, in charge, Punjab’s Oxygen Control Room.Late-night crisis in Panchkula||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-lends-helping-hand-to-neighbour-saves150-lives-248619

As a result, critical Covid-19 patients (level-3) requiring ventilator support are either being referred to Government Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, or private hospitals in the city, where they are coerced to spend lakhs of rupees for treatment.Department officials said both government-run hospitals and private hospitals were working to treat Covid-19 patients. The private hospitals have required medical infrastructure to treat level-3 patients so the decision was taken with the aim to save maximum lives. But the ground reality is that in the absence of required medical infrastructure and expertise, the private hospitals are charging exorbitantly. Adesh Hospital, Delhi Heart Hospital, among others, have been given the 29 ventilators.Meanwhile, the mini ICU facility has been lying locked at the Civil Hospital since it was established four years ago. During the first wave of the pandemic, six ventilators were installed at the district hospital but in the absence of experienced staff, these could not be put to use and the mini ICU had to be locked later.Talking to The Tribune, Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon, Civil Surgeon, Bathinda, said, “These ventilators were given to the private hospitals on their request which they submitted to the district administration. We do not have the required medical infrastructure and experienced staff to operate ventilators as of now. We are working together with private hospitals to treat the patients.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/short-on-staff-punjab-health-department-gives-29-ventilators-to-private-hospitals-248620

They are trained at government hospitals but when it is time to serve, they move on to greener pastures. These two doctors (out of total four at medicine OPD) were discharging their duties at the forefront to contain the virus, detect and diagnose Covid-19 patients in the district with one of them entrusted with the role of district nodal officer for Covid-19. The development has not only put additional burden on the existing staff, but also likely to affect the treatment being given to patients.Dr Jayant Aggarwal and Dr Ramandeep Goyal have tendered their resignations. A senior functionary hinted that many other doctors and staff were planning to quit.Citing personal reasons for resigning, Dr Goyal said: “It has nothing to do with Covid-19. I had applied for resignation even six months ago.”Sources said though doctors were quitting apparently due to high stress levels amid massive workload, some were calling it quits to earn more money in private hospitals as compared to fixed salaries paid by the government.Taking a strong view of the matter, Civil Surgeon Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon said: “It is quite unfortunate that doctors are quitting at a time when their services are required the most. They are trained at government hospitals and when there is time to serve, they move on to greener pastures as per their convenience. For now, we have shifted a doctor from Talwandi Sabo hospital to serve in place of those who have resigned.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/under-stress-2-doctors-at-bathinda-civil-hospital-resign-248621

Besides, a gap of 45-60 days has to be maintained between the two doses.Now, the vaccination has started for people between 18 and 44 years. This age group is probable blood donors.Looking at the paucity of blood, the doctors and the blood bank authorities have appealed to the people to donate their blood before being vaccinated against Covid.In Amritsar, there is an acute shortage of AB, A and B group for the past few months. Against the requirement of 600-700 units per month, there is a stock of just 200 units. Incharge of Blood Bank, Civil Hospital, Amritsar, Dr Sardeepak Singh Riar said in the ongoing second wave of the pandemic, blood donation camps could not be held due to lockdown and misconceptions about Covid spread.“This has negatively impacted thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia patients as their requirement of blood transfusion cannot be met. Besides, the gynaecology, delivery and accidental cases require blood in emergent situations,” he added. He said earlier 20-22 units of blood was issued daily in Amritsar district, but now we could not provide more than 10-12 units. “We have requested the NGOs to send the donors directly to us. We are also encouraging our employees to donate blood. I myself have donated blood,” he added.The situation is same in Tarn Taran blood banks. Dr Rekha Rana, incharge, Civil Hospital, said they had been facing shortage of A, O and AB blood groups. The district has a total requirement of 300 units per month, whereas at present they are left with just 62 units of blood at the civil hospital.Bhagat Pooran Singh Blood Donation Society, Patti, used to organise 24 camps a year, but failed to do so in the past one year.Deferral period cut to 14 days after jab||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/covid-hits-blood-donation-in-punjab-stock-in-banks-depleting-fast-248624

The minimum deaths were reported between the age group of 11 and 30, which was less than 5 per cent.Principal Secretary Hussan Lal said the second wave was completely different. “It is worrying that young and fit individuals are losing lives due to Covid,” he said.Last year, during the first wave, the trend in Covid mortality was completely different as just 10 per cent deaths were among healthy individuals. An initial audit of deaths carried out by the state’s expert group among the victims revealed that total 77 per cent were over 50 years of age and suffered with serious underlying illnesses like end-stage kidney disease and cancer, HIV, besides uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure. Chronic illnesses like heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity were major associated illnesses as contributing factors in the remaining 23 per cent of cases.Besides, it has also been observed that a large number of Covid patients are approaching the hospitals late for treatment. Of the total victims of Covid, around 2 per cent died at their homes without getting any medical attention.

06-05-2021||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Farmer unions to protest against lockdown in Punjab on May 8||Farmer unions from Punjab, which have been agitating against the central farm laws, on Wednesday said they will hold street protests against the coronavirus lockdown on May 8 in the state and urged people to defy the restrictions.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border protest site, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal alleged the government has imposed a lockdown to hide its failure to handle the coronavirus situation and wants to weaken the ongoing farmers’ movement.He was speaking on behalf of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the agitation against the Centre’s three agri-marketing law.“The 32 farmer unions of Punjab have decided to protest against the lockdown on May 8 (in Punjab) where our field workers will come out on streets and ask people to open their shops and not follow the lockdown,” Singh said.Like several other states reeling from the COVID surge, Punjab has imposed extensive curbs, in addition to measures like a weekend lockdown and night curfew till May 15.“The three black farm laws were also made during the lockdown last year. Lockdown is no solution. It only results in losses to the economy and unemployment. This government is just hiding its failures under the garb of lockdown—like how they have failed in providing oxygen, beds and other medical facilities to patients,” Rajewal claimed.The 78-year-old leader said that he would also push for a “nationwide protest against lockdown” in the next meeting with the SKM leaders.Meanwhile, over a thousand farmers on Wednesday headed towards the Delhi borders from Beas, a town near Amritsar, to join those protesting against the farm laws.Kisan Sangharsh Committee State secretary Gurbachan Singh Chabba said he along with other farmer leaders including Sawan Singh Pandher has set off for the national capital with the group, which includes women and children.He said farmers assembled at Beas from different villages of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts in Punjab.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, with their main demands being the complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for the minimum support price on their crops.So far, there have been 11 rounds of talks between the protesting unions and government, but the deadlock has continued as both sides have stuck to their stand.In January, the government had offered to suspend the farm laws for 12-18 months, which was rejected by the farmer unions.The Supreme Court stayed the implementation of  the laws till further orders and set up committee to resolve the impasse.The SKM leader on Wednesday also urged people to join the farmers’ protest to strengthen the movement.“Since the harvesting season is almost over. We are asking at least one family member of farmers and farm labourers to come and join us in the protest. We expect a large number of people coming from May 10 onwards,” he added.The farmer leader said they are always ready for dialogue but the government has to “stop maligning the farmers” and initiate the talks with “good intentions and in a good environment”.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.
