Farmers’ tents, trolleys and other vehicles have been permanently there for the last five months in long queues. The pattern of farmers coming back after the harvesting season will now continue,” it added.The farmers’ outfit said that the government was “promoting privatisation” even at a time when “thousands of people have lost their lives due to the mismanagement of the public health system”.“The government should increase investment in education, health and agriculture sectors. Along with taking guarantee of the purchase and remunerative price for the crops of the farmers, the government should make a law on MSP and repeal the three anti-farmer laws immediately,” it said.Delhi reported 319 more COVID-19 fatalities and 12,651 new cases on Monday, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent.

Alas ! We are all still awaiting justice. #JusticeDelayedisJusticeDenied #Bargari,” said Sidhu in a tweet.On Monday, Congress Partap Singh Bajwa, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi and Gurpreet Singh Kangar had huddled at Randhawa’s residence here.They had expressed concern over the alleged delay in action.A few days ago, some legislators had also held a meeting with Navjot Singh Sidhu.A meeting of the MLAs belonging to the Scheduled Castes category was called by minister Charanjit Singh Channi at his residence here on Tuesday.As many as 12 Congress legislators and two ministers, including Channi, were present.After the meeting, Congress legislator Raj Kumar Verka said the meeting was not called against the CM.“We are with CM Amarinder Singh,” asserted Verka.He said the meeting was held to review pending issues related to the Dalit community. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/honour-your-promise-on-sacrilege-cases-bajwa-to-amarinder-251373

11-05-2021||New Delhi||Disinfection drives, serving 'kadha' in langars among safety measures taken by farmers to keep virus at bay||From conducting disinfection drives to serving immunity-boosting 'kadha' in langars, farmers protesting at Tikri and Singhu borders in the national capital against the Centre's three agricultural laws are taking new steps everyday to keep the deadly coronavirus at bay.Delhi reported 319 more COVID-19 fatalities and 12,651 new cases on Monday, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent."We disinfected 17-km of the protest site at the Tikri border. And will do it again in the coming days as well. We have been taking all preventive measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, including distributing masks and sanitisers to the protesting farmers," Roop Singh of Bharat Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) said on Tuesday.Singh claimed that the farmers have not got any support from the government in fighting against coronavirus, and that all measures taken to curb the spread of the virus at the Tikri border have been taken by them only.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for almost six months, demanding a repeal of the three agri reform laws enacted by the central government in September last year.According to farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar, each and every langar at the Singhu border is being sanitised regularly and to improve the immunity of protesting farmers, 'kadha' is also being served on a daily basis."The langars operating round-the-clock are being sanitised regularly. To improve the immunity of farmers, they are being served with 'kadha' as well. Also, there are vaccination camps in the vicinity and whoever wants to get vaccinated is free to get the jab," said Kohar from Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers' unions spearheading the stir."We, from our end, are neither forcing anyone to not have it or have it, this is their personal choice," he said.The Centre has been maintaining that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/disinfection-drives-serving-kadha-in-langars-among-safety-measures-taken-by-farmers-to-keep-virus-at-bay-251295
11-05-2021||New Delhi||Suvinder Vicky breezes past another 'Milestone'||He remembers the never-ending days of learning how to drive a truck -- from negotiating traffic, parking it, to the exact way it is boarded by professionals. "The details were important. In fact, even the seat had a hard cushion. Then came the part of ensuring that I was not 'acting'. Everything had to be in a certain undertone contrary to the loud image of truck drivers portrayed in most films. The audience was to be trusted too --- that they would understand the pauses. Adopting a certain body language and conveying with the eyes... It was a fantastic experience," smiles actor Suvinder Vicky, who played the lead role of the truck driver 'Ghalib' in Ivan Ayr's recently premiered film 'Milestone' on Netflix, for which he also won the award for Best Performance at the 31st Singapore International Film Festival last year.The movie, that premiered in the Horizons section at the Venice International Film Festival in 2020, and went on to be screened at the Busan International Film Festival and Pingyao International Film Festival, maps the life of a truck driver who recently lost his wife.Rich in metaphors suggesting stillness in movement and constant decay, Ayr, who made 'Soni' before this, brings forth a certain tenderness to the grilling life of the protagonist whose truck has clocked five lakh kilometers. Interestingly, while the central character is named Ghalib, his new assistant is called 'Paash'' (a major poet killed by Khalistani militants). There is also a cameo by poet Aamir Aziz ('Sab Yaad Rakha Jayega').Also read:Though Vicky has been seen in several Hindi and Punjabi films including 'Udta Punjab', 'Kesari' and the series 'Paatal Lok', it was Gurvinder Singh's 'Chauthi Koot' that proved to be a turning point in his career, with critics acknowledging his intensity and grace. "It was a whole new experience for me. I had never worked on anything quite like that before. Singh has his own distinct style. He does not speak much and prefers his characters to convey through long silences. Every day was a whole new experience for me."Enjoying all the praise coming his way ever since the movie premiered on May 7, Vicky smiles, "My phone has not stopped ringing. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Ayr. I am glad people from across the globe are receiving it well."A pass-out from Punjabi University's Theatre Department, the actor who is seen in both mainstream and realistic cinema believes that they are equally challenging. "For me, it is important to approach it with all honesty and give it my best. In case there is something I do not want to do, I say a clear no. Not just films, I have also done more than 30 music videos." Ask him if the Punjabi film industry has done justice to his talent and the actor says he has no regrets, "I have had the fortune of working with directors like Manmohan Singh, Manoj Punj, Pankaj Batra and Anurag Singh. If I had not done films in this industry, people like Gurvinder and Ivan would not have approached me. --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/suvinder-vicky-breezes-past-another-milestone-251264

The government had given an ultimatum to the protesting employees to join work by 10 am today or their services would be terminated.Around 1,600 joined work today. The remaining 1,400 failed to report to duty by this evening, prompting the government to issue their termination orders.Acting under the Disaster Management Act, the National Health Mission Director said the strike had posed a threat to the lives of people amid the ongoing Covid pandemic, so the services of the employees had been terminated.The district civil surgeons had been asked to recruit voluntary staff to replace the sacked employees.Those terminated include auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), nurses, data entry operators, Ayurvedic medical officers, community health officers (CHOs), multipurpose health workers, etc.A majority of the employees sacked belonged to Jalandhar district (318), followed by Tarn Taran (182), Gurdaspur (177), Fazilka (113), Ferozepur (108), Hoshiarpur (99) and Pathankot (89). In 10 districts, including Barnala, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Mansa, Moga, Mohali Muktsar, SBS Nagar, Ropar and Sangrur, all employees joined work before the deadline.The strike had adversely affected the ‘Covid prevention drive’, especially in the rural areas of the state. Due to the weeklong absence of CHOs, ANMs, etc. from health and wellness centres, there had been a spike in positivity and death rates as they played a key role in sampling and tracing of suspected patients.Considering the medical emergency, state Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had urged the agitating NHM employees to resume their duties by Monday morning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1-400-striking-health-staff-fired-in-punjab-251043

The current wedding season from April 20 to May 30 has again been hit due to lockdown restrictions.From selling vegetables to working as a daily wager, the impact of successive lockdowns during wedding season has hit the big fat Punjabi wedding industry hard. The industry has suffered losses and thousands of those involved in the business have either returned to their states or are selling vegetables to survive.“For past over a year, I have managed only three functions and now I earn daily to feed my family of three. Last month, my daughter contracted Covid and I spent all my savings on her. This has been one of the worst phases of life,” Singh said.“Mounting debts and no work has forced many of my fellow workers to return to their villages in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” he said.The re-imposition of night curfew and limit of 10 persons at weddings in the state, has again hit the wedding industry. Already thousands of functions have either been cancelled/ postponed or have taken place with minimal celebrations.The Marriage Palace Association said it had suffered huge losses due to the cancellation or postponement of functions during the past four seasons and now, with the fresh restrictions, they were forced to cut down on manpower. “This will eventually lead to more job losses as limited guests means fewer men needed,” a stakeholder said.Prince Sidhu, a wedding planner and caterer, said: “From over 50 functions per season, I managed barely 10 since April 2020. Though last year I paid my labour and cooks, I had to spare them now as I was unable to pay a contingent of 36 persons without work.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/amid-2nd-wave-big-fat-wedding-biz-hit-yet-again-251072

With the Covid-19 cases rising steeply, the increased demand for fruits has sent the prices through the roof.Apart from wholesale market, rates of fruit in markets in the city, including Indira Market, Canal Market, Rose Garden and near the bus stand, have skyrocketed.Fruit vendors who have put up their vends outside big private hospitals in the city are fleecing buyers as there’s no check on them. Harmeet Singh, a city resident said, “Since there is no price mechanism and barely any check, fruit vendors are minting money at the expense of people’s helplessness. It’s for the administration to keep a check on undue fleecing of buyers and take action against vendors charging exorbitantly.”Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan did not respond to numerous attempts being made to contact him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-check-fruit-sellers-fleece-buyers-251079

In just about a month, the number of cases being heard has drastically dipped to less than 150, with just about 16 judges holding the court, from nearly 46 judges hearing about 2,510 cases in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Unprecedented pendency owing to covidTo make the matters worse, certain category of cases, such as the regular second appeals, are hardly being decided. Working at nearly half its strength with 46 judges against the sanctioned posts of 85, the High Court is currently facing an unprecedented pendency of 6,77,231 cases, including 2,89,594 criminal matters involving life and liberty. No less than 2,31,637 cases are pending between one and three years. Another 97,797 cases are pending between three and five years.In the absence of new appointments, impending retirement of three judges this year and lack of physical hearing, the situation is expected to worsen. The only other High Court with pendency more than the Punjab and Haryana High Court is Allahabad with 7,90,220 matters awaiting adjudication.The summary of cases listed for May 10 makes it clear that about 149 matters were listed before 16 judges. On April 9, no less than 2,512 cases were listed before 44 judges. As many as 193 cases were placed before one judge on that date.The scaling down of listed cases has not gone down well with the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association. “The High Court is the custodian of Constitution and protector of fundamental rights. It cannot shut its doors for the justice seekers,” the association said in a resolution, adding that its executive committee was concerned about non-listing of matters, especially habeas corpus petitions, anticipatory bails, regular bails, suspension of sentence, stay matters and other matters involving violation of fundamental rights.Just about 72 hours later, the HC today carried out certain changes, making it clear that the procedure of “mentioning” may be done away with in case of first anticipatory bail pleas filed before the High Court after exhausting the remedy before the sessions court, the habeas corpus petitions and the protection pleas.The HC has its reasons. It has all along been making it clear that the decisions have been taken to ensure the safety of the judges, advocates, staff and the litigants after taking into consideration the surge in cases with the second wave being more infectious.Its apprehensions may not be ill-founded. Punjab and Haryana Bar Council chairman Minderjit Yadav said more than 170 advocates were believed to have died due to Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/justice-system-in-limbo-as-hearings-slashed-by-courts-251094

While many of the witnesses are tired of making repeated rounds of police offices, others have not received any support or protection from intimidation,” he alleged. There are over 100 witnesses in the Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases.One of the key witnesses, Surjit Singh, died in January 2020 under mysterious circumstances. Another key witness, brother of a deceased in the Behbal Kalan case, allegedly turned hostile.Two months back, the then SIT had raised the issue of witness allurement, alleging that a complainant in the FIR of Kotkapura firing incident was offered a job by SGPC officials to make him turn hostile in the case.The old SIT had demanded protection for witnesses as most of them come from under-privileged class of society while all the accused are influential and highly powerful. Hence, the witnesses should be provided adequate mental and physical protection to ensure fair trial of the cases, the SIT had demanded at that time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-justice-for-6-years-victims-kin-reluctant-to-assist-new-sit-251097

Ministers Brahm Mohindra, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot termed Sidhu’s statement an act of gross indisciplineBittu said if the CM as Home Minister could not take on the Badals, there were other capable persons who could be given the charge of the department. Terming Sidhu’s statement an act of gross indiscipline and an attempt to undermine the Congress government in the state, the three ministers said his comments could no longer be dismissed as rantings of a disgruntled member of a democratic party.Open rebellion was damaging the interest of the Congress at a time when Assembly elections in the state were less than a year away, they said, adding the failure to take action against Sidhu now could trigger unrest in the party’s state unit, which would be fatal for the Congress, which had suffered major electoral blows in the recently concluded polls in five states, the ministers warned.Amid the political churning within the party, leaders in the Chief Minister’s camp throughout the day made backdoor efforts to pacify the enraged ministers and other leaders. CM’s close associate BIS Chahal also went toRandhawa’s house.The party leaders who are pressing upon the government to punish the perpetrators at the earliest today took a serious note of the statement by the family of Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who was killed in police firing at Behbal Kalan in 2015, that they would not cooperate with the new SIT set up by the Congress government and accused AG Atul Nanda of failing to put up correct legal defence in the High Court. The rebel group is learnt to have sought time from the party high command on the issue.Questioning the statement issued by the three ministers seeking action against Sidhu, MP Partap Bajwa said: “I have a lot of respect for my esteemed colleagues with whom I have worked as PPCC chief. They should clear their position weather they wanted action against the perpetrators of sacrilege and subsequent police firing that killed two people.” Undeterred, Sidhu again hit out at the CM, tweeting: “Nefarious intentions are evident, no HC stopped you in 4-1/2 yrs! When DGP/CPS appointments are set aside, orders are challenged in higher courts in matter of hours. Now, first you attack the HC, then from backdoor accept same orders to deflect people’s attention.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/3-ministers-seek-action-against-sidhu-251098

He has continuously been hiring special counsels from New Delhi at high costs to the public exchequer,” said Bajwa.“We have reached a crossroads both in state and party.

Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said of the total DBT of Rs 49,965 crore transferred directly into the accounts of farmers across the country for procurement of wheat this rabi marketing season, Rs 21,588 has gone to those in Punjab and about Rs 11,784 crore to Haryana.Speaking to mediapersons, Pandey said both Punjab and Centre worked together to bring in the change. He also screened videos of “satisfied Punjab farmers” to make his point. Responding to a question on somewhat different “ground realities” and “pressure” on farmers due to strong ‘arhtiya links’, Pandey said: “No change is very smooth, but this change has been much beyond our expectations, smoother. Both Punjab Government and the Centre worked together to ensure that. Arhtiyas also realised their commission is intact, and that the government is committed to providing it to them.”Nationwide Rs 49,965 crPunjab Rs 21,588 crHaryana Rs 11,784 cr“They (arhtiyas) may be having arrangements with farmers but what the government is paying to farmers is all going into their accounts. These are just a few videos, the FCI and state agencies have hundreds of them. We have all the database (of Punjab farmers receiving DBT), which can be cross-checked”.According to the government data, as of May 9 Punjab procured 128.66 LMT and Haryana 80.76 LMT wheat. So far around 337.95 LMT has been procured, benefitting 34.07 lakh farmers against 28.15 lakh on the same date last year across the country.
