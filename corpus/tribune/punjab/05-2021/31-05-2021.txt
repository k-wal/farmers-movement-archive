31-05-2021||Mumbai||Punjab Mail, India's oldest train that served Britishers, turns 110||The oldest running long-distance train of the Indian Railways, Punjab Mail, connecting Mumbai-Firozpur -- originally linking Bombay with Peshawar (now in Pakistan) -- turns 110 on Tuesday, Central Railway officials said here on Monday.The Punjab Limited as she was called then, is a little over 16 years older than its more glamorous counterpart Frontier Mail, though its origins are rather vague.She steamed out of Bombay's Ballard Pier Mole station - which was the hub of the erstwhile Great Indian Peninsular Railways (GIPR), that later became the CR.Based on a Cost Estimate paper of 1911 and a complaint by an irate passenger in October 2012 about "the later arrival of the train by a few minutes at Delhi" station, the CR concluded that the Punjab Mail made her maiden run on June 1, 1912.To begin with, there were the P&O steamers bringing in the mail, and excited officers of the British Raj along with their spouses, coming to their first postings in colonial India after a 13-day long sea voyage from Southampton to Mumbai Port.Since the British officials held a combined ticket both for the sea voyage to Bombay and then onward inland journey by train to their place of postings, after disembarking they would simply board one of the trains from here bound for Delhi, Calcutta or Madras.The Punjab Limited used to run on fixed mail days from Bombay to Peshawar covering 2,496 km in around 47 hours along the Great Indian Peninsular route, via Itarsi, Agra, Delhi and Lahore.At that time, it had only 3 passenger cars with a total capacity of 96 travellers, three for postal goods and mail, and was the fastest running train in the British India.The passenger coaches were all corridor cars in first class, dual berth compartments, and well appointed with lavatories, bathrooms, a restaurant car, a compartment for the luggage and servants of the British officers.Later, from 1914, the Punjab Limited started originating and terminating at the Bombay VT Station, now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus Mumbai and a UNESCO World Heritage site.Today, the journey time of Punjab Mail, hauled by electric engines, has come down significantly, covering the 1,930 km between Mumbai CSMT-Firozpur Cantt in 34 hours 15 minutes.Compared to the original 6 cars of the Punjab Limited, Punjab Mail now has 9 air-conditioned coaches, 6 sleeper coaches, 5 general second class coaches, a pantry and a generator van.By mid-1930s, it also started catering to the Indians on the move in Third class cars, it got the first airconditioned coach in 1945, from May 1976, it was hauled by diesel engines, and by 1980s with electric engines as a large part of the trunk routes on the IR network got electrified.From December 2020, the Punjab Mail started its journey with the German-designed Alstom LHB GmbH's Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches which give more safety and a pleasant travel experience to the passengers.

31-05-2021||Mohali||Housing department halves non-construction penalty||Punjab’s Department of Housing and Urban Development has announced it would halve its non-construction penalty—a move it hopes would encourage people to begin construction on their plots.A non-construction charge is a penalty charged by housing authorities for not starting construction on plots developed by government and development authorities within a specified period.The department also replaced its previous half-yearly method of calculating these penalties with a monthly one. It hopes these new changes would encourage people who were forced to sell their properties because of the high penalties to begin construction.These new changes are applicable to plots of residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial nature as well as to housing societies and private builders.  A spokesperson from the department said an amendment was made in the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Act, 1995.Owners of residential and other properties must pay the penalty on the prevalent reserve price of plots or sites in the vicinity without any interest. For commercial sites, however, this penalty would be charged on the basis of the auctioned or the allotment price.Any delayed payment would attract compounded interest at 7 per cent per annum. The new penalties will come into force retrospectively from April 16, 2021. Old charges will continue to apply before this date, the spokesperson said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/housing-department-halves-non-construction-penalty-261236

31-05-2021||---||Punjab and Haryana High Court: Act against prosecutrix for  U-turn in rape case||Chandigarh, May 30In a significant judgment liable to change the way complainants take a U-turn after levelling allegations of rape, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asked the state of Punjab to proceed against a “prosecutrix” who retracted from her complaint after appearing before the trial court.“In her complaint to the police, the prosecutrix had raised specific allegations of rape against three persons. However, while appearing before the trial court, she has completely resiled from her complaint. In light of this, the state is directed to proceed against the prosecutrix for having lodged a false complaint in accordance with law,” Justice Deepak Sibal ruled.The judgment, liable to go a long way in preventing false implication or retraction under coercion or enticement, came on a petition filed by an accused seeking anticipatory bail in a case registered in March 2020 for gang rape and criminal intimidation under Sections 376D and 506 of the IPC besides the provisions of the IT Act, at the B Division police station, Amritsar.The prosecution’s case was that the prosecutrix lodged a complaint with the police that a woman, who used to study with her, introduced her to a person and they developed a friendly relationship.During the course of the friendship, the prosecutrix went to the person’s residence to run an errand for her mother, but was raped. He then clicked her obscene photographs and started blackmailing. He, rather, took her to different places and had sex with her after blackmailing.On several occasions the petitioner, who was the other person’s friend, also raped the prosecutrix after blackmailing her. He, along with another co-accused, also took obscene photographs of the prosecutrix.Appearing before Justice Sibal’s Bench, petitioner’s counsel GPS Bal contended that the prosecutrix, while appearing before the trial court, exonerated him. The prosecutrix deposed that the accused in the case, including the petitioner, never raped her. She also refused to recognise the other two accused.Appearing before the Bench, the state counsel acknowledged the fact that the prosecutrix and her parents had not supported the prosecution’s case, but he opposed the grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioner on the ground he had gang-raped her.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-act-against-prosecutrix-for-u-turn-in-rape-case-261047
31-05-2021||---||No more ‘patasha parsad’ and ‘siropa’ at Golden Temple, activists fume||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, May 30The discontinuation of the age-old tradition of offering ‘patasha parsad’ and ‘siropa’ in the Golden Temple by the SGPC has irked Sikh activists who sought intervention of Akal Takht.Like ‘karah parsad’, the ‘patasha parsad’ holds significance in Sikh religion. It is believed at the time of initiation of Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh, the Panj Pyare stood before the Guru for amrit sanchar ceremony. It was then that the Guru’s wife brought ‘patashas’, which were put in an iron bowl and stirred with a two-edged sword by the Guru to make amrit, the nectar of immortality.As the tradition goes, in order to honour someone, the ‘patasha parsad’ along with ‘siropa’ and ‘sehra’ (garland) is presented after they pay obeisance in the sanctum sanctorum. Generally, when the devotees offer ‘rumala’, the priest offers ‘patasha parsad’ as a special gesture.The ‘parsad’ is distributed to other gurdwaras too. Unlike the ‘karah parsad’, it is a non-perishable item that can last long and beneficial for devotees who come from far-off places and take it back home for family members. But, for the past few years, the SGPC had started offering ‘pinni parsad’ at the temple for its long shelf life.Yet, the withdrawal of ‘patasha parsad’ and ‘siropa’ custom has not gone down well with the Damdami Taksal supporters. Spokesperson Prof Sarchand Singh has submitted a letter to Akal Takht officiating Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, urging him to make SGPC restore the practice. “What was the logic behind stopping the Sikh tradition that was prevalent during Guru’s period? The Golden Temple is the supreme religious destination for Sikhs from all over the globe. It was a violation of Sikh rehat maryada and we urge Jathedar to intervene,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-more-patasha-parsad-and-siropa-at-golden-temple-activists-fume-261046

The appointment of ADCs would be made from IAS/PCS officers not below the rank of Joint Secretary.Questioning the rationale of appointing the 22 ADCs (Urban Development) in the under-staffed civic bodies, an official said earlier each of the Deputy Director was looking after nearly 30 civic bodies, whereas now each ADC would be looking after six to seven civic bodies.

Sources in the police department said the SIT could neither make any further recoveries, nor establish who pocketed the profits made from the illegal sale during the 2020 lockdown. “There is still no clue on the political patronage to the accused, who manufactured illegal liquor, and the assets and investments made from that sale,” said a top cop.Much before the liquor tragedy in the Majha region in August 2020, which killed over 110 persons, this was one of the first cases in the state that highlighted the illicit liquor trade. The illegal unit in Ghanaur was run from a cold store and was operating at full capacity since the lockdown. The accused were bottling liquor in Royal Stag, Masti Malta, Lajawab Sofia and Raseela Santra bottles, which are sought after liquor brands in the region. The distillery was using ethyl alcohol (ENA), which is used to manufacture sanitisers.In May 2020, the police arrested Dipesh Kumar, said to be the kingpin who set up the illegal distillery and a daily wager, on the first day of the raid. Later, Congress-backed Khanpur Khurd sarpanch Amrik Singh and other accused presented themselves to the police.The police investigation suggests that the distillery did a good business during the lockdown. Amrik’s wife is a zila parishad member, affiliated with the Congress. Later, in another raid a few months later, Dipesh was again arrested in another illegal liquor haul in Rajpura.“We could make no financial recoveries from them, or any profits earned by them,” said Ghanaur DSP Jaswinder Tiwana, adding: “The challan against the six accused was presented in the court before I joined and now they are on bail.”Sources say despite confessions by Dipesh during the police remand regarding excise and local cops taking bribes and meeting him personally, the issue wasn’t probed in detail. “Even the on-counter sale of the accused, who already owned government-auctioned liquor vends, could not be established,” they said.The scam, according to the Opposition parties SAD and BJP, runs into several thousand crores of rupees, with direct link of certain MLAs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/year-on-ghanaur-distillery-case-headed-for-quiet-burial-261025

Even the tariff charged from government for rural water supply has been increased (both fixed charges and energy charges), which would lead to increase in power cost to them by 15-20 paisa per unit.The tariff charged from charitable hospitals has been increased by 35-40 paisa per unit. But in spite of this cross subsidy, say sources in the power department, the revenue shortfall cannot be met.Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had initially said the cumulative gap for 2021-22 would be Rs 9,807 crore. There is additional burden on the state power utility — Rs 1,750 crore to be paid as washing charges (dues and interest) to the private entities running the thermal plants at Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo and Rs 1,450 crore to be paid to their employees as hike in salaries and arrears after the new Pay Commission has been announced. Together, the existing gap and the additional burden should demand meeting additional revenue requirements of Rs 13,007 crore.“The defaulting amount from the government towards payment of power charges (Rs 2,279.71 crore), too, has not been taken into account,” says Jasvir Singh Dhiman, president, PSEB Engineers Association.Unpaid subsidy another worry||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/tariff-sop-likely-to-cause-revenue-loss-to-punjab-261016

Last year it was 1,679.88 feet.Data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on May 27 reveals that departure from the past 10-year average of water storage is minus 59 per cent for dams in Himachal and minus 34 per cent for Punjab. The current storage in the reservoir at Bhakra is 0.524 billion cubic metre (BCM), which is eight per cent of its total capacity of 6.229 BCM. The storage was 22 per cent at this time last year.The current storage at Pong is 14 per cent as compared to 48 per cent last year, while at Thein it is 34 per cent against 51 per cent last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhakra-level-dips-output-cut-by-20-261009

In all, 17 per cent of the total applicants succeeded in getting the senior tag.No less than 113 advocates had initially applied, but one of the candidates died during the process. The remaining 112 applications were scanned by the “permanent committee for designation as senior advocates”.The committee, comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha, Justice Jaswant Singh, Justice Rajan Gupta, Punjab Advocate-General Atul Nanda, Haryana Advocate-General BR Mahajan and Additional Solicitor-General Satya Pal Jain, also interacted with the candidates. It eventually came out with a list of 27 candidates, which was placed before the full court for approval.The list, however, did not contain the names of applicant-advocates Sant Pal Singh Sidhu and Hemant Bassi, who were recommended for elevation by the collegium headed by then Chief Justice Krishna Murari, who was later elevated as a Supreme Court judge. The other two members, Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, retired last year. The list failed to find full court’s ready approval. The judges not only voted on the names of 27 shortlisted candidates, but also “ticked” against those of left-out applicants they considered deserving. There was, however, no interaction with candidates mentioned in the left-out list.Bassi and Sidhu did not find a place even in the final list; though advocate Baljit Kaur Mann’s name was included from the left-out candidates after a majority of judges favoured her designation as senior. Nine other shortlisted applicants — Pardeep Singh Poonia, Lokesh Sinhal, Sharmila Sharma, Divya Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Ankur Mittal, Raman Kumar, Sunish Bindlish and Naresh Inder Singh Boparai — were excluded. The developments come just about two years after former Chief Justice of India RC Lahoti said the greatest shortcoming in the system was that the deserving were not appointed, while several others appointed did not deserve to be elevated.CJI Lahoti was addressing a national conference on “Public Accountability of Judicial System”, organised by the Association of Retired Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of India.Speaking at the event, former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court Justice SS Sodhi referred to the role of caste, religion and political affiliations in the appointments.Chief Justice Sodhi asserted there were quotas for Punjab and Haryana in the High Court. And then, there were quotas for service judges and lawyers. Also, there was a quota for the reserved categories. “Besides all this, there are also women to be considered for appointment.” While the list has been finalised, advocates believe this is not the last to be heard on the issue.High Court picks 19 out of 112||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/just-17-of-applicants-get-senior-advocate-tag-260927
