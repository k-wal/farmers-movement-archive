Singla said that the union government should provide required Covid vaccines to all states before taking decisions on examinations of class XII students.Singla said that there was a dire need for vaccinating the students and teachers as well as the health, safety and security of both students and teachers was of utmost importance. The cabinet minister said that the examinations of only selected and essential subjects may be held in each discipline and question papers may be of lesser duration. He said that due consideration may also be given to pre-board examinations and internal assessment.While raising the concerns of students and parents, Mr. Vijay Inder Singla said that the examinations should not be conducted until the safety of all stakeholders will be ensured. He added that as there is every possibility that the students appearing in class 12 would be late in getting admission in the higher educational institutions. He said that the Government of India should issue directions to all universities and colleges to cope with the time loss of students and added that the higher education institutions should be asked to reduce the syllabus of the course which would also reduce the mental pressure of students.“The students as well as their parents are not to put any hardship. The students taking admissions in the higher education institutions after undergoing class 12th examinations would not be required to undergo all the semesters in the next course. For example, 8 semesters course may be reduced to 7 semesters which would help in reducing mental pressure on students and will also motivate them to perform with more confidence in higher education,”  Singla said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-seeks-vaccination-for-students-appearing-in-class-12-board-examination-258293

They demanded a financial package if they were not allowed to resume operations.“Gyms and fitness centres were the first to be closed, but were not allowed to restart operations. The government is allowing liquor shops to open, but not gyms,” said Parmod, president Bathinda Gym Association.Gym Association legal advisor Sukhdeep Dhillon said, “We have to pay exorbitant rent for gyms and several trainers have become jobless. I request the government to allow reopening gyms or provide a relief package.”They said gym owners have to pay rent, loans, EMIs and salaries to the trainers and staff members. How does the government expect us to bear all these expenses in addition to other household expenses when gyms have been closed for a long time and even last year as well most of the period, gyms were closed, so losses are mounting, they added. Hoteliers under the banner of Punjab Hotel Association also staged a symbolic protest by holding placards in Bathinda on Tuesday.Satish Arora, president Punjab Hotel Association, said “Due to massive losses since March last year, large numbers of eateries, restaurants and hotels across the state have already been shut, with many more on the verge of closure. The owners of such outlets have been finding it difficult to pay rent, salaries of employees, power bills and other fixed expenses with no income during the lockdown period.”Further, he said it had become extremely difficult to survive in the absence of financial compensation.He sought a suitable package for the hospitality sector to cover losses incurred during the lockdown period. He said the hospitality sector cannot survive on take away or home delivery as it has high committed expenditure.JS Gill, a bar owner, said, “Advance bar licenses were paid to the excise department and the government has now no support system for our bar industry. Keeping the bars closed have overburdened us with such high building rentals, staff salaries, maintenance bills, power bills and so many other miscellaneous expenses too.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gym-owners-hoteliers-stage-protest-in-bathinda-demanding-they-be-allowed-to-open-258280

He also called for giving a monthly pension of Rs 6,000 to all families who had lost their bread winners to Covid besides free education to Covid orphans as well as waiving off power and water bills for all sections of society for a six-month period.The SAD president was addressing a press conference here after welcoming independent SGPC member and former Congress Secretary Surjit Singh Tugalwal into the party along with his entire team. He also announced that Tugalwal would be given the prestigious post of Vice-President in the SAD.While speaking of the need for speedy vaccination, Mr Sukhbir Badal said Capt Amarinder Singh should not look at the centre alone for vaccines but should use State funds to source them quickly on the pattern of the Shiromani Committee, which had procured Covaxin doses within one week of placing the order.He said even a corporation, like the Mumbai one, had purchased vaccine doses worth Rs 600 crore to vaccinate the entire city in one go.“If need be, the chief minister should call an emergency meeting of the state cabinet to clear the proposal for speedy procurement of vaccine doses,” he said.Badal said simultaneously the government should make necessary preparations to cope with an expected third Covid wave.“The state needs to order at least 2,000 ventilators and install them within three months along with hiring the necessary staff to man them”. He said this was of utmost importance because 17 out of 22 districts did not have ventilator facilities.The SAD president also maintained that Punjab could fight the war against Covid effectively if the chief minister and all the state ministers led from the front.“Sadly, this has been missing till now and that it why Punjab has witnessed 4,000 deaths in the last three months alone,” said Badal, requested the central government not to levy GST on vaccine, saying it should not try to earn money from the sale of vaccines. He also called for doing away with GST from ventilators and life saving drugs needed to treat Covid.Speaking on the completion of six-month period of the Kisan Andolan tomorrow, Badal said he had urged the party rank and file to hoist black flags to demand repeal of the three Agricultural laws as well as show solidarity with protesting farmers. He called upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to adopt an intransigent attitude towards the farmers by putting conditions for further talks with them and requested him to hold direct unconditional talks with the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sukhbir-badal-asks-cm-to-make-allocation-for-purchase-of-vaccines-worth-rs-1-000-crore-258262

What we look like, how we dress, what we eat and how we live makes us no less Indian."We are proud to be a state in the Union of India where even in the interior most we greet each other with a 'Jai Hind' and primary school children even in the border villages sing 'Saare Jahaan se Achha, Hindustan Hamara' with pride, he said in his official twitter handle."The deputy CM sought an unconditional apology from the YouTuber for his remarks."I strongly condemn this racist and arrogant act of Mr Paras Singh (Bunty). Every Arunachalee and every right thinking Indian must condemn such prejudiced views. He must apologise unconditionally to the people of Arunachal Pradesh.@PemaKhanduBJP @KirenRijiju @ninong_erring," Mein added.Singh had apparently made the comments while reacting to a letter written by Ering to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wherein he had sought a ban on the relaunch of PUBG Mobile as Battlegrounds Mobile India.The Pasighat East MLA, when contacted, said he would soon file a case against Singh.Meanwhile, the All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (AAPSU) issued a statement to say that the people of the state are "greatly hurt" by the remarks."Such incidents are not isolated ones and have been happening time and again in various parts of the country."It is really distressing that even after over 70 years of the country's independence, people from the state and the northeast region in general still face humiliation in other parts of the country, whenever they go there for work or study," the joint statement by AAPSU president Hawa Bagang and general secretary Tabom Dai said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-pubg-gamer-booked-for-using-racial-slur-to-address-arunachal-mla-on-youtube-258188

While Patiala has the highest achievement with 51 per cent of the targeted vaccination during this period, it is followed by Mohali at 49 per cent, Ludhiana 47 per cent and Faridkot 46 per cent.As many as 11 districts are lagging behind in the vax drive with an average achievement from 15 to 25 per cent of the target fixed by the Health Department. In rural areas, the mistrust is a result of a weak campaign, as villagers feel the vaccine has side-effects.“Taking the services of teachers, panchayats, health and ASHA workers, we are putting our best efforts to dispel unfounded fears. More and more people in the rural areas have started coming forward for vaccination in the past week,” said Vimal Setia, Deputy Commissioner, Faridkot. “Against our daily vaccination target of 5,085 in the district, it remained at 1,581 in the past one month (from April 20 to May 23) but the last three-day average of vaccination in the district is about 2,500 daily due to an intensive campaign in rural areas,” said Sanjay Kapoor, Civil Surgeon, Faridkot. We have already vaccinated about 1,07,401 people out of the total population of about 6.20 lakh in the district, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/panchayats-teachers-pitch-in-to-bust-myths-on-vaccine-in-faridkot-district-257947

Even the price of oxygen concentrators is too high, which everyone can’t afford. So, the administration has started this service to help them,” said an official.Disclosing this here today, Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan said to get the oxygen concentrator machine, it would be necessary for the treating doctor or the hospital to give an undertaking that the family members of the patient had been provided complete information about operating the machine. “In case of any difficulty, monitoring the machine will be the responsibility of the doctor or paramedical staff of the hospital,” he clarified.Srinivasan said: “To procure the machine, a refundable security of Rs 10,000 will have to be deposited with the District Red Cross Society.”For further information, one can contact District Secretary Darshan Kumar on 98726-66803 and senior assistant Vidya Sagar on 98145-99501.“Normally, people need oxygen concentrators for a few days or a week or two, but they have to spend a lot to purchase a new one.The bank will ease the pain of such patients and their family members,” the Deputy Commissioner said.Information gathered by The Tribune revealed that a month ago, an oxygen concentrator that normally costs about Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 is now being sold for Rs 70,000 to Rs 85,000.

Experts suggest it could be a “superspreader”.Experts warn that at this crucial time when the number of positive cases just started to decline, any “large gathering could turn fatal”. But the farmer unions are adamant with thousands camping in Patiala.Sources in the farmer unions suggest the members had already mobilised cadres in villages in the Malwa belt to show numbers. “Announcements have already been made and ration and other items have been loaded in vehicles to be moved to Patiala on May 27, a day before the dharna,” they said.Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said: “The farmers should defer their protest as the second wave is not over yet. There is a huge risk of the spread of virus due to such large gatherings.”He said they could hold testing and vaccination camps at the protest site, if allowed by farmers.On Sunday, CM Capt Amarinder Singh had urged farmer unions not to act irresponsibly, considering the total support the government had extended all these months to them on farm laws. BKU general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said: “The CM should instead answer where is the Rs 1,000 crore allocated to the Health Department and why all available ventilators in Punjab are still non-functional. He should answer why out of 2,010 Level-3 beds, only 550 are in government facilities. Government hospitals have one bed per 55,455 persons and people are dying, especially in villages.”He said the dharna would be held to expose the government on hundreds of unfilled vacancies in health sector and how the poor were being fleeced in the name of treatment. DC Kumar Amit said neither permission had been sought for the dharna, nor any such permission could be given. “We are trying to hold meetings with the farmers, urging them not to hold the protest when the virus spread is at its peak,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-to-go-ahead-with-3-day-dharna-doctors-flag-concern-258003

The tariff order, to be applicable retrospectively from April 1, is expected to be announced within this week.While domestic consumers are expected to get relief in the form of reduction in tariff, there is unlikelihood of any hike for the industrial and commercial power consumers. Sources in the power department told The Tribune that there could be 25 per cent reduction in tariff (per unit) for domestic consumers, reducing the cost of each unit by anything between 50 paisa and Re 1. Almost each year, industrial and commercial consumers have been subjected to a hike in tariff of average 10 per cent.The tariff for domestic consumers varies between Rs 4.49 and Rs 7.30 per unit, for industrial consumers between Rs 5.98 and Rs 6.41 per unit and for commercial consumers between Rs 6 and Rs 7.29 per unit. Last year, because of the pandemic, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) had reduced the tariff for domestic consumers consuming up to 300 units by 25 paisa to 50 paisa per unit and the tariff for small shopkeepers and industry had remained unchanged.However, this year Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had proposed a hike in tariff of over 8 per cent in its annual revenue requirement (ARR) sent to the power regulator in December 2020. But being an election year, the high power tariff is expected to be a major poll issue, the power utility apparently under pressure from the government has now sent a revised ARR, asking the regulator to reduce the tariff.A crucial meeting of the PSERC will be held tomorrow to give a final nod to the new tariff order prepared by the commission after getting the revised ARR report from the PSPCL.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/domestic-power-tariff-likely-to-be-reduced-in-punjab-258024

One third of the migrant workers are illiterate. The survey also found out that the monthly income of 58.65 per cent of the sampled migrants was less than Rs 8,000. Only 14.36 per cent earned between Rs 10,001 and 15,000. It found out that 55.90 per cent of the migrants were found engaged in unskilled manual work, 33 per cent in skilled manual work and only 5.62 per cent in economic activities.He said the policy to facilitate migration and save them from exploitation had remained inadequate even in normal times.

We strongly oppose the move of the SGPC to make films on Gurus. It is an irony that the Akal Takht jathedar was included in the panel. As part of the 400th birth anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur had conceptualised a project to make films on the life of the ninth Guru and the little-known Sikhs who were associated with the Gurus during that era, including Baba Makhan Shah Lubana, Bhai Lakhi Shah Vanjara, Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Sati Das, Bhai Dayala and others. A list of 12 films was made and five scripts were prepared.For the purpose, it was decided to form a panel which included Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, and Takht Kesgarh Sahib Jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh, to prepare and approve the scripts for making religious films in future too.But the move has been opposed by Sikh Federation activist Prof Sarchand Singh, who has submitted a complaint at the Akal Takht secretariat.He has cited the SGPC’s resolution dated February 20, 1934, that speaks against making films on historical anecdotes of Gurus, followed by other resolutions dated August 7, 1940 and May 30, 2003, which prohibited anyone to portray themselves as Gurus, Panj Pyare and Sahibzadas.“It is a pity that the SGPC itself is violating its resolutions. We strongly oppose the move of the SGPC to make films on Gurus. It is an irony that the Akal Takht jathedar was included in the panel. When the jathedar of the highest temporal seat would be involved in it, where can one submit his complaint? We demand the SGPC should withdraw its move,” he said.Legally, Akal Takht cannot intervene in movies as these come under the Central Board of Film Certification, but the backdrop of the idea was to keep an eye on the movies related to the Sikh religion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-move-to-make-films-on-gurus-stirs-row-258040

25-05-2021||Chandigarh||After Moderna, ‘Pfizer’ says no to Punjab||American multinational Pfizer has refused to deal directly with Punjab government, an official said on Monday—a development that comes after another American pharmaceutical, Moderna, similarly refused any dealings directly with the state government.Moderna and Pfizer have similarly turned down deals with the Delhi government under Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. In both cases, they’ve said that they deal only with the central government.Punjab’s state Nodal Officer for the vaccination programme Vikas Garg, a senior IAS officer, said Pfizer’s communication made it clear that they dealt with federal governments across the globe for Covid vaccinations and that they no saw reason to change the policy.  "Pfizer is working with Federal Governments across the world to supply its Covid-19 vaccine for use in National Immunization programs. Our supply agreements at this time are with National Governments and Supra-national organizations with allocation of doses and implementation within the country being a decision that Governments take based on relevant health authority guidance. This approach Pfizer has followed across the world," he said quoting Pfizer’s response.As dwindling vaccination stocks hit its vaccination programme, Punjab government under Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has been trying to explore the possibility of procuring vaccines directly. Garg claimed that apart from Pfizer and Moderna, Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson had also been approached to explore the possibility of floating global tenders for Covid vaccines.The state, he said, is yet to hear from Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-moderna-pfizer-says-no-to-punjab-257756
