The test was conducted on December 19, 2018, and the result was declared on January 5, 2019. The final answer key was released on January 17, 2019, after the declaration of result.One of the questions was on and hydropower and the other on culpable murder not amounting to murder.  “The instant writ petition is allowed to the extent that the questions deserve to be deleted from the question paper and marks will be accordingly calculated,” Justice Fateh Deep Singh asserted.The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after a petition was filed against the Union of India and other respondents by Nikhil Kaushik through counsel G.S. Phull. Justice Fateh Deep Singh asserted the respondents holding the entrance test were supposed to ensure that all the answer keys were correctly given. They could not hide under the garb that the fault was of the examinee.The wrong answer keys were misleading the candidates and could not adjudge their intelligence. “Had they been correctly given, it would have put the examinee to a balanced view of the likely correct answers… The conduct of respondents smacks of vindictiveness, arrogance and which has resulted in illegality thereby prejudicing the case of the petitioner and similarly placed candidates,” the court said.Justice Fateh Deep Singh added wrong answer keys caused immense prejudice necessitating intervention by the court due to transgression of constitutional rights enshrined by virtue of Articles 14 and 16 of Constitution of India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-hc-orders-nta-to-delete-questions-from-ugc-net-exam-for-junior-research-fellow-over-wrong-answer-key-248578

I have suspended SHO Phagwara. Such misbehaviour will not be tolerated at any cost and those who indulge in it will have to face serious consequences. https://t.co/terAynz6ao  The nearly 100 vendors in the area had been resulting in crowding which could not be allowed in view of COVID-19 pandemic.The SHO, instead of getting challans issued or taking some action, kicked the cart of a vendor, a video of which was recorded.The SSP in the order said, “As a member of a disciplined force, such behaviour is against service rules and is unwarranted. Under the supervision of DGP Punjab, Punjab Police has been working on the forefront of the war against COVID-19 for over a year now and has served the people of Punjab with dedication.

Oxygen refilling units will not be covered by the special status.With this decision, the units (both old and new) will become eligible for 100 per cent exemption from Change of Land Use (CLU)/External Development Charges (EDC), Property Tax, Electricity Duty, Stamp Duty and Investment Subsidy, by way of reimbursement of GST up to 125 per cent of Fixed Capital Investment made in the land and machinery.Notably, the status of thrust sector to oxygen production units has been conferred under clause 10.6 of Chapter-10 of Industrial & Business Development Policy, 2017 and subsequently as per clause 2.22 of Detailed Schemes and Operational Guidelines, 2018.The Cabinet took the decision to help the state cope with the emergent situation arising out of acute shortage of oxygen in view of the increased case load due to unprecedented Covid pandemic in the state.For the week ending May 4, the state had average positivity rate of 11.6 per cent, with case fatality rate of 2.1 per cent, from a sample size of 74 lakh.Currently, the daily oxygen allocation to Punjab stands at 195 MT from outside the state: Inox plant at Baddi (60 MT), Air Liquide plant at Panipat (20 MT), Air Liquide plant at Roorkee (15 MT), Linde plant at Dehradun (10 MT) and Inox plant at Bokaro (90 MT).However, only 140 MT is actually being supplied from these plants on a daily basis, with shortage of tankers hampering lifting of oxygen especially from Bokaro.Two additional tankers made available by IOCL have not been unutilised due to technical/compatibility issues. Further, despite repeated requests, Linde & Air Liquide are not releasing their committed quota.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-approves-thrust-sector-status-for-oxygen-production-units-248536

For the state government, SII has only indicated that the availability of Covishield will be known in about four weeks’ time, he added.The meeting was informed that in the circumstances, vaccination in 18-44 age group could not be launched in government hospitals, nor was there any clarity on when the process could begin.Meanwhile, the cabinet approved one-time relaxation in Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Rules, 1964 for transfer of 5 acres of Panchayat land in Mohali to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for establishment of National Institute of Virology for North Zone. The Institute has been sanctioned by the central government on a proposal by the Punjab government.The cabinet authorised Mohali DC to complete all necessary formalities for transfer of the land in Mullanpur Garibdas village in block Kharar in district SAS Nagar (Mohali). Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan said construction for the institute would start by the end of this year.Notably, there is no provision in the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Rules, 1964 for gifting panchayat land to the Central Government, but Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides that the power to make rules includes the power to amend or relax the rules.The cabinet noted that the institute will be for the welfare of the inhabitants of Punjab, the cabinet noted.

As lives of 250 odd COVID-19 patients were in danger because of shortage of oxygen at the General Hospital in Panchkula, Punjab decided to divert some of its supply to the state and thus saved a catastrophe from taking place.The issue is important in wake of the constant sparring among states over oxygen supply, including the “war” between Punjab and Haryana, where the former had earlier accused the latter of not allowing it to get its sanctioned oxygen supply from Panipat.It all happened around 11 pm last night when facing a severe shortage of oxygen, Panchkula Deputy Commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, contacted the Oxygen Control Room of Punjab government, requesting for 2-2.5 metric tonnes of oxygen, as they had just two hours of supply left.He reportedly made a case of how lives of over 200 persons on oxygen support in the hospital could be at risk if they did not get the supply on time.Ahuja, while confirming this, said that since supply from Roorkee was delayed to Panchkula, they sought Punjab’s help, and the neighbouring state helped promptly.While the Oxygen Control Room of Punjab checked on their own supplies and availability of tankers to ferry the oxygen in a short span of time, the matter was escalated by the Panchkula deputy commissioner with V Umashankar, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Haryana.He in turn took up the matter with Chief Secretary Punjab Vini Mahajan, at whose intervention it was decided to spare some oxygen from Patiala for Haryana, as Punjab had enough stock to last till noon today.“The decision to supply oxygen was taken, but the problem was arranging the tankers to ferry oxygen and filling of these tankers. The tankers were quickly requisitioned but the problem then arose that a small quantity -- 2.5 MT of oxygen cannot be filled in the available big tankers because of air pressure issues. We then filled 4.5 MT of oxygen in the tankers and rushed it to Panchkula, which took 2.5 MT of oxygen, with a promise to return it today,” a senior official in Punjab’s Oxygen Control Room told The Tribune.It was around 1 am that the oxygen was finally supplied to the Panchkula General Hospital, and everyone heaved a sigh of relief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-comes-to-haryanas-rescue-as-it-supplies-timely-oxygen-to-panchkula-hospital-248533
05-05-2021||New Delhi||Manpreet Badal demands immediate convening of GST Council meeting||Punjab Finance Minister and Congress leader Manpreet Badal has demanded immediate convening of a GST Council meeting for a serious mid-term correction on tax issues.In a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said he is writing on the GST issue when the country is in the middle of battling the new wave of COVID which is more devastating in many ways than the one before.“With interest rates down by close to 200 basis points, shouldn’t we cut down interest rates under GST law (as also under other tax laws),” he asked in his letter.“I have been particularly persuaded to write this letter because there has been no meeting of the GST Council for the last six months even though council’s own rules drafted in terms of Article 279A of the Constitution provide for holding at least one meeting every quarter,” he said.Badal said the GST revenues constitute nearly 50 per cent of the tax revenues of states, while this percentage for the Centre is nearly half of that. States have a voting share of 75 per cent in the GST Council.“However, failure to hold any constructive consultation with states for so long in such critical times makes me wonder whether the Centre has usurped all the power of states putting the spirit of cooperative federalism, that formed the very foundation of achieving consensus on the epic reform, on the back burner,” it said.He also pointed that the Centre had not appointed a vice chair to the council from among the states.With taxpayers’ offices shut and staff working from home, how should the information needs of the department authorities during enquiries be met without physical contact, he asked.“How do we provide relief to sectors most impacted by COVID e.g. MSMES, aviation, hotels, restaurants, entertainment, commercial reality, retail? Do we need to make amendment in law to allow donations of goods for COVID without denying tax credits on inputs used in their manufacture or purchase?  Whether an amnesty scheme is needed to condone delays in payment of taxes during COVID period,” he asked.Badal said some issues that require urgent discussion in the context of COVID are whether GST should be exempted on hand sanitizers, face masks, gloves, PPE kits, temperature check equipment, oximeters, ventilators and the like.The Punjab finance minister said a number of provisions have been enacted in recent times through the route of subordinate legislation (rules) bypassing both the GST Council as well as the legislatures.“It is the basic principle of justice system that substantive rights of a person cannot be taken away except by a due process of law. The recent amendments in GST Rules (like restricting tax credits) have far reaching implications and have been made without even of an iota of discussion in the council,” he said.Badal also highlighted that harassment of taxpayers has taken an entirely new dimension with officers resorting to threats of arrest, provisional attachment of productive assets and freezing of bank accounts without any established norms.These provisions, that were enacted primarily for fly-by-night operators, are increasingly being misused against law-abiding businessmen with demonstrable capabilities built over decades and in situations where they may have indulged in no misdemeanour whatsoever at their end, he claimed.“How do we reduce litigation in our courts challenging the vires of the statutory provisions of GST laws? I’m informed it is difficult to repair a bad tax system if not done in the formative years,” the Congress leader asked.“The promise of assured compensation does provide a ready catalyst for such a mid-course correction for some more time,” he said, adding that the clock is sure ticking and India eagerly awaits the GST of which people all dream.

He said, “Salaries of over 2,000 teaching and 1,500 non-teaching officials of 136 aided colleges have not been credited after February.”Secretary, higher education, VK Meena, said, "They raised their demands with our office. We have prepared a proposal and sent it to the home department. The Chief Minister's Office will take a decision." He said the GNDU is an autonomous body which can take its own decisions.Responding to the matter of salaries, Director, Public Instructions (Colleges), Paramjit Singh, said the grants were not disbursed due to changes in budget allocation. “Also, some colleges have not submitted the grant utilisation certificates of last year which is mandatory. Now, we have decided to block the grant of those colleges and will disburse the grants of remaining colleges in a week.”The teachers said they would wear black badges on May 5 and 6 as a mark of protest for work from home orders. “If no response comes, the agitation will be intensified,” they threatened.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pcctu-demands-work-from-home-threatens-protest-248527

All documents and notings are digitally signed and thumb marked on a biometric device to ensure that work is not passed on to another. Information on Acts, rules, master plans, tender/auction notices/dues of property owners/property details will all be available through a single website. The software can be easily configured for any new service, any department, as at the core all government processes are similar.This unique online portal would ensure completely paperless functioning, from application to the final output, in a time-bound manner. Input forms have been carefully designed in a simple format to enable an average citizen to understand and fill it. The documents to be submitted are mentioned at the top of each application, along with the steps of its processing and time to be taken at each level. The entire organisational hierarchies have been mapped in the software, with posting updation at each position.The action at each level is time-bound and limited to authorization, and no intermediary level can raise a query to the applicant or return it, which is currently the main reason behind delays and harassment of citizens. Pendency at each level is flashed to all higher levels automatically, and every application is sent and processed in parallel to all concerned departments viz. finance, estate and engineering, thus saving processing time. Data is 256 bit encrypted, under digital signatures of the Chief Administrator and one more officer, and hence cannot be tampered with.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-launches-single-window-online-citizen-portal-for-property-services-248522

The petitioner’s case was that a video clip, uploaded on Facebook and YouTube by a journalist, was in fact edited in a manner that it gave one-sided version. The conversation between the petitioner and the reporter was not intended to hurt the religious sentiments of any community.Seeking anticipatory bail, his counsel contended media’s role was “very responsible towards nation building”. But a wrong message was given by the reporter to make sensational news by adding his own content.He added the place where the petitioner made the speech was situated in a Circuit House. It was not accessible to the public. The recording was made by the reporter. As such, he himself was the perpetuator of the offence, if any.Taking up the matter, Justice Sangwan asked Punjab Director/Additional Director, Bureau of Investigation, to file an affidavit on the duties of a reporter as a citizen. The officer was also asked to specify whether the reporter himself was an instrument in perpetuation of the crime as uploading the clip on social or electronic media may amount to promoting disharmony or hatred.The officer was also asked to specify whether the original video could be termed as a hate speech and whether the edited clip, with his comments as catalyst, amounted to hate speech.Justice Sangwan also directed the officer to look into the investigation as well as the reporter’s role after he uploaded the clip on the social media.

05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Panel for doing away with special pay||While the state government has hailed the report as a major bonanza for the employees and retirees, the Sixth Pay Commission has “recommended abolition of all types of special pay and any add-ons in the basic pay by any nomenclature”.This means special pay scales revised by a Cabinet sub-committee, formed by the previous Akali-BJP government in 2011, have been recommended to be set aside and the new pay scales to be implemented now will be based on the scales and grade pay recommended in the Fifth Pay Commission in 2006.“If this is done, it will be unacceptable. But we have yet to examine the report,” said Sukhchain Khera, convener, Sanjha Mulazzam Manch, an umbrella body of government employees.Almost 70% of the state government employees had been given enhanced pay scales in 2011, over and above what was recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission of 2006.Certain allowances of employees have also been rationalised in the recommendations, which could lead to heartburn amongst employees. Thakur Singh, convener, Punjab Government Pensioners Joint Front, said the pension has been revised by multiplying the previous scale by 2.59, which would give them lesser benefit in hike as compared to even Class IV employees. “Also, the 25 years in service criteria fixed for the pensioners to get 50% of last pay drawn as pension, was not in consonance with the central pay commissions, where the minimum service criteria is 20 years. These anomalies will have to be dealt with,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/panel-for-doing-away-with-special-pay-248272

This has irked his colleagues, who said it was not the one-off incident.As per the duty roster of May, Dr Rajan Singh of the surgery department, who is currently under treatment, has been assigned duty on the second floor of the Covid ward at Rajindra Hospital.His colleagues said many infected doctors had been assigned Covid duties as immediate bosses (heads of the departments) were not consulted while making rosters.A doctor said: “Our friend is in the ICU and putting him on duty before he recovers is inhumane on the part of the authorities. They (people at the helm) are not aware of their own staff. How can they be expected to take care of patients?”A head of the department requesting anonymity said: “All doctors under me are performing Covid duties, while doctors of medicine, anaesthesia and chest and TB, which are core departments to handle critical Covid cases, have been spared.”Meanwhile, Surbhi Malik, in-charge, Covid isolation, said: “It must have been a human error.

The state was facing the prospect of shortage of oxygen beds, he said, pointing out that the Government of India had expressed its inability to even allow Punjab’s local industry to undertake commercial import of LMO from Pakistan through the Wagah-Attari border, which is geographically proximate.Pointing out that Punjab had now been given to understand by the Centre that there would be likely disruption of LMO supply from today from Panipat and Barotiwala, the Chief Minister said this would cause great stress on the already limited oxygen availability in the state, thus causing a medical emergency, including risk of loss of life for the large number of patients who are in critical condition and on regular oxygen support. The disruption should be avoided, he said, adding that, if necessary, the state must be compensated immediately from a nearby additional source.Status of life-saving gas||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/state-gasps-for-oxygen-capt-seeks-pm-shahs-urgent-intervention-248282

Over 20 per cent have not opened fully after the first lockdown. The remaining 50 per cent have been operating with losses and revenue below 50 per cent of the pre-Covid levels,” said Arora.He said the norms on gatherings for hotels, banquets, and open venues should be made in commensurate with the size of the venue. He also requested that except in case of a complete lockdown or in containment zones, hospitality establishments should be allowed to function by following SOPs and protocol. Arora said many owners had shut their outlets as sales dwindled, while expenses remained the same.He said employees associated with the hospitality industry were now looking for jobs in other sectors as they did not see it as a sustainable employment opportunity following the losses in the past one year. Already reeling from the effects of the previous lockdown, the hospitality sector is staring at another crisis due to the second Covid wave.“Either allow us to operate normally by following the SOPs or shut the industry permanently,” said Arora.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/losses-mounting-let-us-function-hoteliers-248283

Disclosing this here today, District Magistrate Sandeep Hans said the stadium would be a temporary jail till the prohibitory orders remained in force. Since the jails were already overcrowded, it was almost impossible to send the violators in the jails.  However, the basic purpose of the temporary jail was to ensure that Covid did not spread and tame those who were violating the prohibitory orders.  Meanwhile, a police officer said at least 25 violators had been sent to this temporary jail during the past 24 hours. At least 40 FIRs had been registered for violation of prohibitory orders in the past one week, he said.  Hans has exhorted people to stay indoors in the larger interests of society. He added that the violators of curfew would be strictly dealt with. Social distancing would be ensured at the temporary jail complex, he added. The DM said daily night curfew had been imposed from 6 pm to 5 am and weekly curfew had been imposed from 6 pm on Friday to 5 am on Monday within the limits of the district.  But still some people were seen roaming outside instead of sitting in their houses. Therefore, the district administration was forced to convert indoor stadium into jail to keep such violators in the lock-up, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/stadium-converted-into-jail-for-violators-248285

He sold groundnuts at the Jalandhar railway station and whitewashed houses in Delhi. Later, he joined Panjab University, Chandigarh, as a clerk and did MA (public administration).Remembering Malhotra, former Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra said: “Rashpal, whom I had known for over six decades, was an intrepid soldier. He made valuable contribution to furthering the national cause and almost single-handedly established CRRID.”Malhotra served at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (Shimla) between 1965 and 1970. After working with a cycle factory (RMI) at Rajpura, he joined Mahindra & Mahindra as its general manager. However, research continued to be his first priority and he began his dream journey of setting up the CRRID in 1978. He started his work from a garage in Sector 21, Chandigarh. The institute shifted to its current campus in 1983.Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh described Malhotra as a distinguished academic, able administrator and a fine human being who played a pivotal role in bringing socio-economic development to the northern region.He served as the Executive Chairman of CRRID and a member of the Board of Governors of Pushpa Gujral Science City. He was also a member of the Senate of Punjabi University, Patiala, and Panjab University, Chandigarh.Known for his organisational skills, Malhotra worked in close quarters with Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, PV Narasimha Rao and Dr Manmohan Singh. He, in fact, got Dr Manmohan Singh as the Chairman of the governing body of the research institute.Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said: “Rashpal Malhotra, a low-profile troubleshooter for Indira Gandhi and a confidant of Pranab Mukherjee, Dr Manmohan Singh and PN Haksar, was a wonderful man.”Among his last important academic works was a seven volume publication on “Cooperative Development, Peace and Security” in collaboration with former CRRID Director Dr Sucha Singh Gill between 2011 and 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/a-noted-scholar-with-humble-beginnings-248287

He further said while there was a severe shortage of medicines and oxygen across the state, about 300 ventilators provided by the central government to Punjab were gathering dust in the hospitals. Dr Ravjot said despite the prior warning of the second wave, the Capt Amarinder government failed to recruit more doctors, medical staff and nurses and ensure ventilator systems in the hospitals.He further alleged the mortality rate of Covid victims in Punjab was 2.4 per cent, which was much higher than the national rate. Dr Sanjeev Sharma said the pace of vaccination in Punjab was also very slow.Dr Charanjit Singh Channi said Captain Amarinder Singh had handed over many government ventilators to the private hospitals and the private hospitals were charging Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh from the Covid patient for treatment, which was intolerable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/govt-has-failed-on-health-front-aap-248294
