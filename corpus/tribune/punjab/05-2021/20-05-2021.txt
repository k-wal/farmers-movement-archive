Before that, a two-member panel comprising former Judge SS Saron and ex-DGP Chander Shekhar submitted its report to a Cabinet sub-committee headed by then Urban Local Bodies Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on March 27, 2019. But no action was taken against the encroachers. No department even acknowledged to The Tribune that it had the report.Chander Shekhar report of 2019Some contents of the report made public earlier said influential persons, including politicians and police officials, were the main beneficiaries of the illegal sale of encroached land.This month, Vigilance authorities registered two FIRs as regards encroachment and multiple sale of village common land at Majrian and Seonkh villages in Mohali district.These cases pertained to encroachment of 3,700 acres, whereas the Chander Shekhar report had claimed that over 6 lakh acres had been encroached upon.Retired DGP Chander Shekhar said the investigation report was submitted to the Cabinet sub-committee in March 2019 and later to the Ministry of Revenue through the Secretary, Revenue Department, vide an email in June the same year.However, officials of the Revenue Department feigned ignorance about the report. Revenue Minister Gurpreet Kangar said he was not aware of the report. His officials also could not confirm its whereabouts. Officials in the Chief Secretary’s office said in case any report was received, it must have been forwarded to the Revenue Department.Chander Shekhar started working on the issue of encroachment of village common land on the periphery of Chandigarh in 2007. The Punjab and Haryana High Court asked him to probe allegations levelled by a DGP-rank officer against another DGP of encroaching upon the government land.In fact, Chander Shekhar submitted 12 reports between 2008 and 2010 mentioning that around 50 politicians and police officials were beneficiaries of various benami deals. The court then formed Justice Kuldip Singh Commission for probe.When the Amarinder Singh government came to power, it formed a Cabinet sub-committee under then Urban Local Bodies Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu to initiate action. However, recommendations of the Sidhu committee seemed to have been forgotten after his portfolio was changed when he alleged at an election rally that Capt Amarinder and the Badal family protected each other.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/6-lakh-acres-encroached-in-punjab-but-no-action-on-report-255571

They later approached district health officials, requesting them to provide the medicine.Talking to The Tribune, Amandeep Verma, Zonal Licensing Authority for Drugs (Malwa), said: “Amphotericin injection is currently not available in any of the private or government-run hospitals or chemist shops in Malwa region. We have written to higher authorities to supply the drug at the earliest. There has been a sudden increase in demand for the drug after black fungus cases started surfacing lately. As and when we will get the supply, the drug will be provided to patients.”Doctors say Covid patients who suffer from diabetes or remain on oxygen support and those who are administered excessive steroids are more vulnerable to the infection. “If not treated in time, patients can even die,” a doctor said. The infection is learnt to have added to the mortality rate of Covid patients lately.Bathinda Civil Surgeon Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon said: “Amphotericin is not available at present and we have informed the higher authorities. As and when it’s made available, it will be used to treat patients.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/as-black-fungus-cases-spike-drug-shortage-creates-panic-in-malwa-255581

Health experts said the vaccination target was dependent on the supplies from the Centre as on some days, they were left with no doses.“The rate of vaccination is low in rural areas. Villagers are reluctant to get themselves inoculated. The issue has been taken up at meetings of the task force on several occasion and a plan has also been chalked out to motivate residents. However, the current challenge is the unavailability of jabs,” said a health department official.Even if doses for an entire village are received, it will take three months to inoculate residents in view of a mandatory gap between the first and second doses.“However given the supply, it will be next to impossible to vaccinate the entire rural Punjab by December-end”, said officials.Secretary, Health, Hussan Lal said, “Both free and paid doses are arriving, but the supply is irregular”. “It all depends upon vaccine availability to inoculate nearly three crore people in the state. It may take six months or even more,” he said.“The top priority is to vaccinate elderly and those with co-morbid conditions. But with limited supply, even this is a challenge for our teams”, said a health official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/vax-scarcity-hits-drive-in-rural-areas-of-punjab-255448

Paediatricians and epidemiologists have sought exclusive wards for children.Experts said unlike mild infections or no symptoms, as was the case during the first Covid wave last year, several children are exhibiting symptoms now.“The reasons behind the surge can be lax behaviour, more transmissible strains or more awareness about testing. But a noticeable medical difference in the second wave is that infected children are more symptomatic now,” said a senior doctor.Experts say as the virus has mutated and the chances of further mutation cannot be ruled out, it can affect children in the coming days, especially if they share treatment wards.“Timely preparedness is the need of the hour to prevent Covid-19 mortality among children and for that dedicated LII and LIII facilities should be earmarked in government and private healthcare centres,” said another senior doctor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/assn-seeks-separate-wards-for-ve-kids-255451

The government should review its decision that has hurt the Sikh sentiments,” he said.The jathedar had returned from abroad and visited the kin of former Akal Takht Jathedar Joginder Singh Vedanti who died recently.SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said, “Based on one incident, the sanctity of the community cannot be put at stake. The kirpan is sacrosanct to the Sikh community. It can never be equated with a knife or a dagger.” She said the education minister did not have any discussion with Sikh community leaders except for having an online meeting with two Sikh members, upon which a ban was imposed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kirpan-banned-in-australian-schools-akal-takht-fumes-255471
