26-11-2020||---||Quit party if you want to air grievances in public: Amarinder||Chandigarh, November 26Rejecting charges of the Congress lacking inner-party democracy, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday said anyone was free to take their grouses to the party chief or the working committee but internal party issues should not be raised on public platforms.“If you’re a Congressman you can go to the party president or the Congress Working Committee with any problem you may have with the party functioning. But you should not go out to air your grievances. If you want to do that, you can leave the party,” said Amarinder, amid reports of public dissidence.The Chief Minister said he had learnt this lesson from late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when he was a member of Parliament from Congress. Indira had told him that internal party matters should remain within the party, and this still holds true for the Congress, he added.He pointed out that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had not penalised anyone who had raised a voice of dissent but had, in fact, made then members of various committees, in true spirit of democracy, to bring in reforms.Rejecting the suggestion for change in party leadership in the light of the Bihar election results, Amarinder said Sonia will remain the leader as long as she wants, after which the new leader will be elected. There was no need for change at this juncture, he said, adding that one should read too much in the Bihar poll verdict.Pointing out that victory and defeat were part of the process of an actual democracy, which India fortunately has, the Chief Minister quipped that unlike the American democracy, India has true democracy, with political ups and downs a part and parcel of it. He recalled the time when BJP had only two seats in Parliament. The Congress could come back into power in 2024, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/quit-party-if-you-want-to-air-grievances-in-public-amarinder-176214

Catering to power demand during November, when the festival season was in full swing, was also of utmost importance”, he added.DPS Grewal, Further Director (Distribution), said PSPCL had arranged power from outside the state by way of procurement through power exchanges and also full power was availed from its quota of share in the Centre sector power stations. “PSPCL arranged maximum power of 2,600 MW aggregating 1,606 Million Units at Rs 3.09 per unit from power exchanges and quantum of 1,435 MW power aggregating 392 MUs at Rs 3.05 per unit from portal,” he stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/thermal-plants-resume-ops-175797

Procurement under minimum support price (MSP) would also continue.In a status report placed before the Bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli, it was stated on behalf of the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare: “During a dialogue, the Union Government clarified the relevant provisions of the enactments and stated that these are to serve the interest of farmers and will provide additional trade channels, while APMCs will continue to function unhindered. It was categorically stated that procurement under MSP will continue”.Resolve matter: courtThe assertion, at a time when farmers are marching towards Delhi to protest the farm laws, failed to find favour with counsel for one of the farmers’ organisation Baltej Singh Sidhu. He said public sector undertakings were now excluded from the definition of purchasers under the new Acts and alleged assurances regarding MSP were merely verbal.Appearing before the Bench, Punjab Advocate-General Atul Nanda said, “let’s not bleed our own state or country.” Nanda said the Punjab Government had designated three Cabinet ministers for past two months to engage with protesting farmers. The state government convinced the protesters to allow movement of goods and passenger trains and the protesters were peaceful.The Bench observed tremendous loss had been suffered by Punjab. Agitation was not a problem, but blockage of road and railway traffic could not be condoned, it said while verbally observing that it would under the circumstances be forced to pass harsh orders for evicting the protesters.
