But now we just want to go home," said Sanju, one of the members of the family."Our group comprises 10 women, an equal number of men and 14 kids. We came to the Ajmer Sharif Dargah for the first time to offer prayers on March 21. Our return tickets were booked for March 24; however, all trains got cancelled in the wake of the lockdown. We arranged for money by requesting our family members in Ludhiana to deposit some amount in our accounts."But now, that money too has been exhausted. Hotel JC Palace has provided us free lodging while the Chishti Foundation has been providing us food thrice a day free of cost. We are thankful to them for all their help. But now we want to go back. It's been over a month now. We have kids, two infants and 12 children ranging from 3 years to 12 years, who are finding it tough to eat rice every day," Sanju told IANS.Narrating her tale of misery, Sanju's aunt Manto Devi said, "My husband, whom I had forced to come with me, has assaulted me several times, blaming me for bringing him here. I had requested him to come along to offer prayers; however, now each day I am being subjected to his abuses. Our kids are refusing to eat what is being served to them. There is complete chaos here. We are staying in a hall here, and depression, anxiety and loneliness are killing us as no one knows for how long we will have to stay here."Sanju said, "We have now requested donors to give us ration kit and have started cooking in the same hall as a stove has been arranged by the philanthropists. However, it's equally dangerous for all of us to stay here in one hall, cook and sleep at the same place. Also, the ever increasing number of Covid-19 patients is also giving us sleepless nights." Ajmer has crossed the 100-patient mark, reporting 114 Covid-19 cases so far. Eight new cases were reported on Saturday."I request Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to look into the issue," Sanju said, adding that the family had come to pray for boosting their business avenues in the long run, but is stuck in the wake of this unseen calamity.Meanwhile, Syed Salman Chishty, hereditary custodian, Ajmer Sharif Dargah, and Chairman, Chishty Foundation, made a humble appeal to Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and the CMO to coordinate the return of the pilgrims staying at different hotels and guest houses around the Dargah.Speaking to IANS, he said around 4,000 people from different parts of the country are stuck in Ajmer. They had come here for 'ziyarat', but have been stranded following the snapping of transportation facilities."Although the Dargah Committee, among others, has been supplying basic food and other essentials to the pilgrims since March 20, the pilgrims now want to go home more than anything else. We request to the Chief Minister and the CMO to make the necessary arrangements for their return as soon as possible, in compliance with the Central government guidelines. We look forward to hear from the officials soon," said Syed Salman Chishty.

Posting the first message, Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said, “Dear Anil, you are an inspiration to the entire Punjab Police. Your dedication to duty, your selfless service and your ceaseless acts of humanitarian goodness have endeared you to the entire State of Punjab. Your sacrifice in the line of duty will continue to motivate us for all in the relentless fight against this terrible disease. You have become a beacon for us all in the Punjab Police. May your soul Rest In Peace.”The digital ‘Remembrance Wall’ also has a live map of Punjab where visitors can click on every district for live updates and videos on the work being done by the Punjab Police personnel in the service of the people of Punjab.The Punjab Police, besides losing ACP Anil Kohli, also suffered a major setback when the hand of ASI Harjit Singh was dismembered while on duty in Patiala last Sunday, in an incident that grabbed national headlines.“Our force has been under tremendous pressure ever since the curfew was clamped in the State. But our officers have done a commendable job in terms of both maintenance of law & order and the huge humanitarian effort by serving over 7 crore, 60 lakh meals in 4 weeks to the poor and underprivileged people of Punjab, especially the homeless, daily wage workers and migrants from different states of the country, working in close association with various social and religious institutions.

25-04-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt issues advisory on usage of air-conditioning in hospitals, residential||The Punjab Government on Saturday issued advisory regarding the use of air-conditioning in residential, commercial and hospitals in the wake of COVID-19 pandemics.Giving details, here, an official spokesperson of the Punjab Government said that with the onset of summer season in the past few weeks, concerns with regard to the safety and usage of air conditioners and coolers etc, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemics have been raised.The air-conditioning systems generally work on the principle of re-circulating the air inside the room and in the current COVID-19 situation, there are apprehensions that the air conditioning poses a threat to other people especially in large facilities such as malls, offices, hospitals, health centres etc.The state has therefore decided to come up with an advisory to allay all such apprehensions and concerns with regard to safety and usage of Air conditioning/coolers etc, in different settings.Divulging about the guidelines for usage of air conditioning in various settings, he said that in resident application recirculation of cool air by room air-conditioners must be accompanied by outdoor air intake through slightly open windows and exhaust by natural ex-filtration.The room temperature should be set between 24-27 degrees celsius and the relative humidity should be maintained between 40% to 70%.The air-conditioners should be serviced often so as to keep the filters clean.Exhaust fans can be installed in the rooms containing a large number of people so as to create a negative pressure in the room and ensure the entry of fresh air in the premises. The circulated air inside the room should be vented out frequently.Talking about the evaporative and desert air cooler he said that tt is advisable to prevent dust entry and maintain hygiene.Evaporative cooler tanks must be cleaned and disinfected and the water drained and refilled frequently. He said that the evaporative air coolers must be cleaned and disinfected at regular intervals.The water tank should be emptied and then wiped gently with a soft cloth, sponge and warm water to eliminate moldy residue that may have built up since the previous cleaning.The tank can also be washed with mild soapy water and then flushed out with clean water. He said that for the cooling pads and air vents, a mixture of 50-50 water and vinegar should be used to soak and rinse the pads and the vents. Evaporative coolers must draw air from outside to ensure good ventilation.The spokesperson, further, said that fans should be operated with windows kept partly open. If an exhaust fan is located at a nearby location then it must be kept running to exhaust air for better ventilation.Revealing about commercial and industrial facilities, he said that the best action to limit the risk of spread of COVID-19 infection through air is to ventilate the indoor environments with outdoor air as much as possible. Mechanical ventilation systems and air conditioning systems, which provide ventilation, can perform this function more effectively than simply opening the windows, because they improve the quality of the outdoor air with filtration.If fresh air is not provided, it is advisable to introduce a fresh air duct attached to a central inline fan filter unit and distribute the fresh air by grilles into the space or near the indoor units in case of multiple cassette or multiple hi-wall units.He added that in healthcare facilities, the probability of spread of infection is higher especially in COVID-19 wards or isolation centres. It is therefore recommended that the air-conditioning system in these facilities should be isolated and different from rest of the hospital or the building so as to prevent the re-circulation of air which may be containing the droplet nuclei having virus.He said that in certain settings, where a separate air conditioning is not possible/feasible, exhaust air is likely to contain particles carrying the virus and hence a suitable technique should be deployed to prevent the spread of infections.The treatment of exhaust air can be done by HEPA filtration or by chemical disinfection of the exhaust air from COVID-19 patient room by bubbling the exhaust air through a “Diffused air aerator tank” (preferably of non-metallic material) holding a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. He said that exhaust Air can also be treated by exposing it for 45 minutes to a temperature of 75o Celsius to inactivate the SARS-CoV.Due to the possibility of presence of active viral particles on the exhaust systems, it is advised to follow suitable personal and environment protection protocols during any maintenance activity on the exhaust system.He added that in resource constrained settings, certain make-shift Isolation enclosures can be designed to provide the necessary protection from the COVID-19 viral particles. This could be a temporary makeshift cubicle or tent constructed out of a skeleton structure (of plastic or metal) and plastic sheet or canvas covering.He also said that a quarantine centre shall be well ventilated and preferably be maintained at a negative or neutral differential pressure. When mechanical ventilation is resorted to, it shall be a once through system (non- recirculatory system) that provides a “clean to dirty” (towards the patient and away to the exhaust) air flow pattern.“The offices use different types of air conditioning, ie, Window/ Split air conditioners to centralized air conditioning to coolers during summer seasons and the employers are advised to refer to relevant section in this advisory depending upon the type of air conditioning installed in their offices”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-govt-issues%C2%A0advisory-on-usage-of-air-conditioning-in-hospitals-residential-76182

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown no paediatric surgeon was available at the civilian hospitals in Pathankot.Major Adil Abdul Kalam, surgical specialist at Pathankot Military Hospital performed the intricate and challenging operation of opening up the abdomen of the new born baby who was on a ventilator, repairing the tears in intestine and creation of stoma for diverting the stools. This is for the first time in the Armed Forces Medical Services wherein such an intricate operation on a newborn is done at a zonal hospital with no paediatric surgeon, paediatric anesthesiologist or neonatologist being available.The operation was performed in emergency, which if delayed by even a few minutes, could have resulted in exacerbation of multi-organ failure, leading to death. The doctor said it was an extremely challenging and stressful task to manage the case in the absence of super specialty facilities.Performing intricate surgery in the intestines of the newborn with associated septic infection was technically arduous and gruelling but the team of doctors and nurses effectively carried out the surgery. The baby is no longer on ventilator, tolerating breast feeds and is on the way to healthy recovery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/army-doctors-perform-rare-surgery-on-day-old-newborn-under-challenging-conditions-76177

In line with the recommendations for routine use of sanitiser during COVID-19 crisis and guidelines of WHO, the university has prepared a cost-effective alcohol-based hand sanitiser.Dr Vinod Dumka, Head of the Department, said COVID-19 pandemic is a real-time deadliest threat to present-day global society. Best strategy at the moment is to strictly observe social distancing and frequent sanitisation of hands for breaking the spread chain of the virus. Due to immediate high demand, hand sanitisers, which were very expensive also, soon became out of stock. It was, therefore, imperative to develop an effective as well as cost-effective hand sanitser which can be made locally and is user-friendly.Dr Dumka said the cost of GADVASU Hand Sanitiser is only around Rs 120 per 400 ml against Rs 250 to Rs 400 for various commercially available brands. While the university product is much cheaper, it is equally effective, he said.Dr Parkash Singh, Dean, Veterinary Science College, said that during lockdown, GADVASU is continuing its essential activities, including emergency services at Veterinary Hospital, diagnosis and treatment of seriously sick animals, management of animal farms. While strictly following social distancing and sanitary precaution guidelines, a good number of scientists, clinicians, staff and workers are involved in these duties. ‘GADVASU Hand Sanitizer’ being used by the staff is proving highly effective in containing the spread of infection.Dr AS Nanda, Vice-Chancellor, congratulated the scientists and staff of the university for being innovative. He hoped that this initiative will help relieve pressures of high demand for commercial hand sanitisers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ludhianas-gadvasu-comes-up-with-cost-effective-hand-sanitiser-76156

However, villagers claimed that the act was not implemented in letter and spirit, therefore, how could the villages be self-reliant?Gurmeet Singh, a member under the Pind Bachao Punjab Bachao, said that as per the act one-third of the state budget should be allocated for rural development which is further distributed to each village making them independent from political leaders.He said, “Even so many years after the act came into existence, the villages are not self-dependent. Reason: the Panchyati Raj Act was not implemented in its true spirit.

The river quality is being monitored at 10 locations, from Talwara to Harike.The presence of heavy metals and pollutants as well as decreased flow due to less discharge from the dam are the main reasons for the poor water quality of Budha Nullah.“The water pollution is high in Budha Nullah for the past many years and a drop in discharge of chemicals from Ludhiana industrial units during the lockdown has not made any major difference to the already poor quality of water in the nullah,” said PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg. The oxygen level, however, has improved during the lockdown period.Budha Nullah remains a cause for concern for the PPCB, which monitors the Sutlej starting from upstream Nangal to downstream Hussainiwala under the National Water Monitoring Programme on a monthly basis.“Currently, only domestic wastewater is flowing into Budha Nullah, which carries wastewater of Ludhiana city. Due to the lockdown, no industrial waste is being discharged. Accordingly, the flow in Budha Nullah has decreased from 600 million litres a day to 475,” said PPCB chairman SS Marwaha.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/drop-in-industrial-waste-budha-nullah-still-dirty-75731

A team of senior Punjab Mandi Board officials from Chandigarh had visited the grain market and after taking stock of the situation directed the market committee officials to stop issuing passes amid concerns over social distancing.Sandura Singh, a farmer from Gulabgarh village, said: “We are facing huge problems as passes are not being issued as there is no space in the grain market to unload produce. The government should ensure prompt procurement.” Another farmer, Kuldeep Singh from Teona, said: “I had hired 10 trolleys to move harvested crop from the field to my house.With no passes, I have to bear losses on account of the rent of trolleys.” A commission agent said: “The delay in procurement has affected the cycle of farmers, which may delay the sowing of cotton in the region. With late procurement, payment will get delayed, which in turn will affect the purchase of seeds and fertilisers.”Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Minister for Food, Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs, said: “There is record arrival of wheat in mandis. As on Thursday, 7L metric tonne of wheat had arrived across the state. There is a delay in lifting as we are facing shortage of labour and poor transportation facility.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/glut-in-bathinda-grain-market-farmers-refused-passes-restive-75729
