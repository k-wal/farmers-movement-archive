03-02-2021||Mumbai||‘Har jagah tu bolna hunda,’ says Diljit Dosanjh as Kangana Ranaut questions his ‘RiRi’ song, says ‘apne 2 rupay banane hain’||Actors Kangana Ranaut and Diljit Dosanjh were involved in another Twitter spat on Wednesday with the “Queen” star criticising the singer-actor’s special song dedication to pop star Rihanna for her support to farmers’ protest, and the Punjabi artiste telling the actor to “not bore him”.The pair was involved in an ugly fight on Twitter in December when Dosanjh had taken Ranaut to task for misidentifying an elderly woman protester as Bilkis Bano, the septuagenarian who had attracted international attention for her participation in the anti-CAA protests.The fresh round of war of words between the Punjabi celebrity singer-actor and belligerent Bollywood star started over Rihanna’s post on Tuesday in which she called out the internet shutdown in areas near the protest sites on Delhi borders. 2 Rupees 😂 Apne Wali Job Mainu Na Das.. Gana Tan half An Hour Ch Bana Lene An Asi..Tere te Banaun Nu Jee Ni Karda Mint tan 2 Hee Lagne an.. HAR JAGHA TU BOLNA HUNDA.. Ja Yaar Bore Na Kar .. Kam Kar Apna .. https://t.co/jWOIOkoRoE  “Why aren’t we talking about this? #FarmersProtest,” the 32-year-old singer wrote, while sharing a CNN news article with her 100 million followers on Twitter.After Rihanna lent her support to farmers, an impressed Dosanjh decided to release his latest track, dedicating it to the international star for her gesture.The 2.16 minute-long Punjabi number draws its title, ‘RIRI (Rihanna)’, from the Grammy-winning artiste’s nickname.The song acknowledges Rihanna’s Caribbean roots, with the opening lines describing the singer as a “beautiful woman from Barbados” with “shining, bright eyes” who “spreads colours” all around her.Ranaut, who was among the first Indian celebrities to slam Rihanna for her post, labelling the protesting farmers as “terrorists” and the pop star “a fool”, mocked Dosanjh in a tweet, claiming that he had been planning it for a while.“He also needs to earn a rupee or two. Since when have you been planning all this? It takes at least a month to release a song, and libru (liberal) want us to believe, it’s all organic. Ha ha,” she wrote on Dosanjh’s post.The Punjabi star took the bait as he replied, “Two rupees, don’t tell me my job. I can make a song in just half an hour. I can make one for you in two minutes but I don’t feel like doing it.”         Ley Koi Tukk Banndi aa Teri ...Na Koi Ser Na Pair .. Rab Ni Banida Hunda.. Main Nahi Karne Dungi 😂Tu Kon an Yaar...

Please go away and don’t bore me,” he said in chaste Punjabi.To this, Ranaut declared that being a “patriot” is her only job as she called Diljit a “Khalistani”.“Your words don’t make any sense. Who are you to say you won’t let me do (my work)? Go away. No one is talking about you,” Dosanjh replied.Not one to back out from a fight, Ranaut said Dosanjh was part of the “Canada gang”, whose motive is to divide the country.“Your Canada gang won’t be able to do anything. Khalistan will only be there inside your brains. We won’t let our country get divided into pieces. Do as many riots or strikes you can,” she said.The country doesn’t belong to anyone, was Dosanjh’s prompt reply.“This is not just your country. What has happened to you? Who told you this? The country belongs to everyone.  India is ours as well. You go away and don’t bore me,” he said.Ranaut challenged Dosanjh to confirm that he is not a “Khalistani” and doesn’t support the movement.Oh Tera Kalli Da Ni Haiga DESH ... Ki Ho Geya Tainu ...? Kiney Bulekha Pa Ta Tainu ... ?DESH SAREYA DA BHAI... Hosh KAR Hosh ... INDIA SADA V AA BHAI... 🇮🇳✊🏽TU JA YAAR.. BORE NA KAR ... https://t.co/FyBkcM2h87  “Tell me you are not a Khalistani, please say you condemn fringe groups such as Khalistanis participating in protests. If you say this I will apologise and consider you a true patriot,” she said.In his reply, Dosanjh referenced the violence during farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day, saying that the government must take action against those who have done wrong.“You and I will not decide that. You just stretch everything and it doesn’t end. Go away. You bore me a lot,” he said.Also read: Now, Kangana Ranaut attacks Greta Thunberg, calls her ‘dumb and spoil brat’ for supporting farmersKangana Ranaut gifts 4 flats to Rangoli Chandel, other cousins in Chandigarh; here’s how much they costHe further said that he doesn’t require a certificate from Ranaut to prove he is Indian.“She wants me to fight with her the entire day. We are also Indians you are not the only Indian. You get happy by answering to your own questions. I don’t require a certificate from you,” he said.Dosanjh then ended the argument, saying that Ranaut enjoys playing tweet for tweet game.“We have 100 things to do. Anyway, you don’t make any sense...,” his last tweet to Ranaut read.In December last year, Dosanjh, known for “Udta Punjab” and “Good Newwz”, joined the farmers protests at Delhi’s Singhu border and asked the demonstrators to be patient and peaceful in their agitation and requested the government to accept their demands. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/har-jagah-tu-bolna-hunda-says-diljit-dosanjh-as-kangana-ranaut-questions-his-riri-song-says-apne-2-rupay-banane-hain-207379

The milling was still on, but delivery of rice to the FCI was slow due to shortage of gunny bags. A rice miller in Moga said there was an overall shortage of 30 to 35 per cent gunny bags in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cbi-raids-fci-godowns-in-moga-207097
03-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court rejects bail plea of arhtiya couple||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has denied bail to a couple working as commission agents after holding that the court could not lose sight of the fact that hard-earned money “running into lakhs of rupees” belonging to complaint-farmers had been usurped.Justice HS Madaan asserted leniency and misplaced sympathy could not be shown to the petitioners by granting the concession of pre-arrest bail after ignoring the plight of the complainant-farmers. They did hard work and put in a lot of efforts in the agricultural operation, hoping to get reward in terms of good crops and selling the same to earn their livelihood.“If some middleman successfully usurped the price of the crops and is allowed to go scot-free, that shall result in perversity of the justice and would amount to great injustice to the affected complainant-farmers. Both petitioners are stakeholders in the commission agency business and are liable to pay dues of the complainant/farmers,” Justice Madaan added.The accused had moved the High Court seeking anticipatory bail in a case of cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust registered on December 12, 2020, under Sections 420, 120-B and 406 of the IPC at Sadar police station in Ahmedgarh in Sangrur district. It was alleged they purchased kharif or rice crop, but did not make the payment to the farmers concerned although they received the amount deposited by the government for the crops sold by the cultivators.Justice Madaan added the counsel for the petitioners tried to invoke the court’s sympathy by submitting that one of the petitioners was 63-year-old and not keeping good health. He also suffered a paralytic attack in December 2019. The other petitioner was 64-year-old woman not much aware of the business of the commission agency.“However, I am not impressed by these submissions. With serious and grave allegations of fraud and misappropriation being there against the petitioners, their old age or ailments, etc. cannot help them in escaping arrest and custodial interrogation, which in this case is found to be necessary for complete and effective investigation and to recover the misappropriated money belonging to the farmers,” Justice Madaan added before dismissing the petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-arhtiya-couple-207099

State AAP chief Bhagwant Mann said instead of passing a resolution in Chandigarh, the CM should camp in Delhi. “Despite passing resolution to meet the Prime Minister in all- party meeting held in June last year, the CM has not fulfilled his commitment.

03-02-2021||New Delhi||Fresh attempt to evict Sikhs from Shillong neighbourhood||There is no end to Meghalaya government’s effort to evict the Sikh residents of Harijan colony located at the heart of a prime commercial district in state capital Shillong.Gurjeet Singh, a resident of the colony, who is also president of Harijan Colony panchayat, told The Tribune over the phone from Shillong on Tuesday that a move was afoot to transfer the Harijan Colony land to the state government so that it could take steps against the Sikh inhabitants of the area.The Harijan Colony is located on an area which belongs to the traditional chieftain of the local Khasi tribe. According to land laws of Meghalaya, the state government or the Shillong Municipal Board has no right over the Harijan Colony land.More than a century ago, the land was presented to the ancestors of the present Sikh residents of the colony who had accompanied the colonial British troops as sweepers.Previous attempts made by the state government and the Shillong Municipal Board to evict the Sikh residents, mostly of Gurdaspur origin, did not work because the control of the land in question lied with the traditional Khasi chieftain known as Syiem.Official sources said that the present Syiem of the area was all set to sign an MoU with the state government transferring the ownership of the Harijan Colony land to the latter.Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) Chief Executive Member Titosstarwell Chyne has been sent a draft of the MoU. The KHADC made some modifications to the draft which was being sent to the state government for approval, the sources said.Gurjeet Singh, worried by the latest development, said that back in 1954 attempts were made to evict the Sikh residents of Harijan Colony by roping in the local tribal chieftain. However, the court ruled in favour of the residents taking into account the fact that the Sikh sweepers have been living in the area for several generations.A high-level committee constituted by the present state government under Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong more than two years ago to recommend steps for relocating the Sikh residents of Harijan Colony has not been able to submit its report yet as it is unsure whether its recommendation can withstand the scrutiny of the court.An altercation in June 2018 in the colony snowballed into a violent communal clash which paralysed life in the area for days. Residents of the colony continue to live under round-the-clock police vigil.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fresh-attempt-to-evict-sikhs-from-shillong-neighbourhood-206913

He alleged the attack occurred at Jalalabad SDM's office where Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal had accompanied party candidates to file nomination for the MC elections.Romana alleged it was an attack on Sukhbir Badal as his SUV too was pelted with stones. "Sukhbir Badal is unhurt, though attackers opened fire at his bullet-proof car and pelted stones too," Romana claimed.A police official claimed both parties seemed to have had a heated exchange leading to a clash.

Four of our workers are hospitalised," Sukhbir Badal.SAD condemns attackMeanwhile, the Shiromani Akali Dal has condemned the attack. In a statement, SAD spokesman Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said: “It seems there was a premeditated attempt on the SAD president’s life and the Jalalabad police were complicit in this crime as they allowed the attackers a free run. A high-level judicial inquiry should be ordered under the supervision of the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.”Sukhbir later sat on a dharna at Shaheed Udham Singh chowk seeking suspension of SHO Jatinder Singh.  Cong blames Sukhbir for attackCongress MLA Raminder Amla alleged Sukhbir was responsible for the violence, said: “He brought musclemen with him who indulged in violence and opened fire.”Two Congress workers were injured and one has gunshot injury.The Akalis had lost bypoll election from Jalalabad- home turf of Sukhbir Badal- due to which he came there today for winning the MC election by hook or by crook."However, police are yet to register a case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/akali-dal-alleges-attack-on-sukhbir-badal-claims-4-party-workers-injured-in-firing-206888
03-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab all-party meet passes resolution amid AAP walk-out, seeking immediate withdrawal of farm laws by Centre and statutory MSP||Taking a serious note of the “substantial delay” by the Centre in resolving the crisis, Punjab’s political parties, on the call of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, on Tuesday urged the Government of India to redress the grievances of farmers, who have shown exemplary resilience in their continued fight in the most democratic manner, by immediately withdrawing the three farm laws.Condemning the “sponsored violence in Delhi”, the meeting decided that an all-party delegation will go to Delhi to meet the prime minister and raise the issue, along with other matters of concern on the farmers’ agitation.The all-party meeting, convened by the chief minister to evolve consensus on the issue, demanded an appropriate judicial inquiry to investigate the laxity and complicity of those responsible for maintaining peace and order at the Red Fort.Representatives of all parties appreciated the action and position taken by the Kisan Sangarsh Samiti of 40 Kisan Unions, including 32 Kisan Unions from Punjab.The meeting, which was boycotted by the Bharatiya Janata Party, passed a resolution to this effect, even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) walked out over their demand for deployment of Punjab Police to protect the farmers protesting at the Delhi borders, which the chief minister again rejected as unconstitutional.“We talk about more federal powers for the states, then how can we do this?” asked Capt Amarinder as AAP leaders brought up the issue towards the end of the meeting.“What will you do if Himachal Pradesh and Haryana police come to Punjab,” quipped Capt Amarinder.Even as Capt Amarinder remarked that “Your (AAP) chief minister in Delhi can request the Union home minister to provide security there …we can’t do it as it’s not possible constitutionally,” AAP leaders walked out of the meeting.The chief minister, however, stressed the need to fight the battle, which was led by Punjab but had not become a fight of the nation, constitutionally.Chairing an All Party Meeting in Punjab Bhawan on the issue of Central Farmer Legislations and the way forward. pic.twitter.com/UGabYrfHPg  Before the start of the meeting, the leaders observed a two-minute silence and paid tributes to those who had died.Terming the agitation so far as “historic and unparalleled”, though some miscreants tried to sabotage it through untoward incidents at the Red Fort on Republic Day, the resolution meanwhile said these acts “are truly condemnable and need to be probed thoroughly”.However, these should not be the reason to victimise the agitating farmers, farm workers, and others including the media persons, said the resolution, calling upon the Government of India “to take steps to ensure that the farmers and farm workers participating in the agitation are not victimised in any manner”.Through the resolution, the Punjab parties urged the Central government “to withdraw all cases registered against the farmers, farm workers, and journalists, and other peaceful agitators, and release all those detained by the police or any other agencies”.The missing agitators should also be traced and restored to their respective families without any delay, they said.Realising the urgent need to ensure socio-economic security and safety of the farmers and farm workers, the parties sought immediate resolution of the crisis by the Government of India “through dialogue in keeping with the principles of cooperative federalism, respecting the constitutional role of the states and the people as enshrined in the Constitution of India”.They asserted that “we are determined to save and protect the interests of all farmers, farm labourers and the state of Punjab”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-all-party-meet-passes-resolution-amid-aap-walk-out-seeking-immediate-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-by-centre-and-statutory-msp-206884
