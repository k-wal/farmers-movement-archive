The milling was still on, but delivery of rice to the FCI was slow due to shortage of gunny bags. A rice miller in Moga said there was an overall shortage of 30 to 35 per cent gunny bags in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cbi-raids-fci-godowns-in-moga-207097
03-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court rejects bail plea of arhtiya couple||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has denied bail to a couple working as commission agents after holding that the court could not lose sight of the fact that hard-earned money ‚Äúrunning into lakhs of rupees‚Äù belonging to complaint-farmers had been usurped.Justice HS Madaan asserted leniency and misplaced sympathy could not be shown to the petitioners by granting the concession of pre-arrest bail after ignoring the plight of the complainant-farmers. They did hard work and put in a lot of efforts in the agricultural operation, hoping to get reward in terms of good crops and selling the same to earn their livelihood.‚ÄúIf some middleman successfully usurped the price of the crops and is allowed to go scot-free, that shall result in perversity of the justice and would amount to great injustice to the affected complainant-farmers. Both petitioners are stakeholders in the commission agency business and are liable to pay dues of the complainant/farmers,‚Äù Justice Madaan added.The accused had moved the High Court seeking anticipatory bail in a case of cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust registered on December 12, 2020, under Sections 420, 120-B and 406 of the IPC at Sadar police station in Ahmedgarh in Sangrur district. It was alleged they purchased kharif or rice crop, but did not make the payment to the farmers concerned although they received the amount deposited by the government for the crops sold by the cultivators.Justice Madaan added the counsel for the petitioners tried to invoke the court‚Äôs sympathy by submitting that one of the petitioners was 63-year-old and not keeping good health. He also suffered a paralytic attack in December 2019. The other petitioner was 64-year-old woman not much aware of the business of the commission agency.‚ÄúHowever, I am not impressed by these submissions. With serious and grave allegations of fraud and misappropriation being there against the petitioners, their old age or ailments, etc. cannot help them in escaping arrest and custodial interrogation, which in this case is found to be necessary for complete and effective investigation and to recover the misappropriated money belonging to the farmers,‚Äù Justice Madaan added before dismissing the petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-arhtiya-couple-207099

03-02-2021||New Delhi||Fresh attempt to evict Sikhs from Shillong neighbourhood||There is no end to Meghalaya government‚Äôs effort to evict the Sikh residents of Harijan colony located at the heart of a prime commercial district in state capital Shillong.Gurjeet Singh, a resident of the colony, who is also president of Harijan Colony panchayat, told The Tribune over the phone from Shillong on Tuesday that a move was afoot to transfer the Harijan Colony land to the state government so that it could take steps against the Sikh inhabitants of the area.The Harijan Colony is located on an area which belongs to the traditional chieftain of the local Khasi tribe. According to land laws of Meghalaya, the state government or the Shillong Municipal Board has no right over the Harijan Colony land.More than a century ago, the land was presented to the ancestors of the present Sikh residents of the colony who had accompanied the colonial British troops as sweepers.Previous attempts made by the state government and the Shillong Municipal Board to evict the Sikh residents, mostly of Gurdaspur origin, did not work because the control of the land in question lied with the traditional Khasi chieftain known as Syiem.Official sources said that the present Syiem of the area was all set to sign an MoU with the state government transferring the ownership of the Harijan Colony land to the latter.Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) Chief Executive Member Titosstarwell Chyne has been sent a draft of the MoU. The KHADC made some modifications to the draft which was being sent to the state government for approval, the sources said.Gurjeet Singh, worried by the latest development, said that back in 1954 attempts were made to evict the Sikh residents of Harijan Colony by roping in the local tribal chieftain. However, the court ruled in favour of the residents taking into account the fact that the Sikh sweepers have been living in the area for several generations.A high-level committee constituted by the present state government under Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong more than two years ago to recommend steps for relocating the Sikh residents of Harijan Colony has not been able to submit its report yet as it is unsure whether its recommendation can withstand the scrutiny of the court.An altercation in June 2018 in the colony snowballed into a violent communal clash which paralysed life in the area for days. Residents of the colony continue to live under round-the-clock police vigil.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/fresh-attempt-to-evict-sikhs-from-shillong-neighbourhood-206913
