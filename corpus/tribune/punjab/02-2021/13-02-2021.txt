13-02-2021||London||UK media watchdog fines Khalsa TV for violence, terror references||The UK’s media watchdog has imposed a fine of 50,000 pounds on Khalsa Television Limited or KTV in Britain for broadcasting a music video and a discussion programme that was an indirect call for British Sikhs to commit violence and also contained a terror reference.The Office of Communications (Ofcom), the UK government-approved media regulatory authority, issued the order on Friday following its findings dating back to February and November 2019.Its order also includes a direction for the channel to broadcast a statement of Ofcom’s findings on a date and in a form to be determined by the watchdog and also for KTV not to repeat the music video or the discussion programme found in breach of its rules.“Ofcom has imposed financial penalties of 20,000 pounds and 30,000 pounds on Khalsa Television Limited in relation to its service KTV for failing to comply with our broadcasting rules. The 20,000 pounds penalty relates to a music video. The 30,000 pounds penalty relates to a discussion programme,” the Ofcom decision states.On July 4, 7 and 9 in 2018, KTV broadcast a music video for a song called ‘Bagga and Shera’. Following its investigation, Ofcom found that the music video was an “indirect call to action for Sikhs living in the UK to commit violence, up to and including murder”.It also included brief flashes, which, when slowed down, revealed frames of on-screen text. It appeared to be seeking to influence viewers by conveying a message to them or otherwise influencing their minds without their being aware, or fully aware, of what has occurred, which Ofcom found was in breach of its rules of the broadcast.The discussion programme in question was aired live on March 30, 2019, as ‘Panthak Masle’.Ofcom found that the programme provided a platform for several guests to express views which amounted to “indirect calls to action and were likely to encourage or incite the commission of crime or lead to disorder”.“Ofcom also found that it included a reference to the proscribed terrorist organisation, the Babbar Khalsa, and which in our view could be taken as legitimising it and normalising its aims and actions in the eyes of viewers,” it notes.KTV is a television channel broadcasting largely to the Sikh community in the United Kingdom under a licence held by Khalsa Television Limited.Ofcom conducted its investigations after receiving complaints that the music video and discussion programme were likely to “encourage or incite crime or violence”.The music video in question contained an image of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which Ofcom noted “emphasised the video’s narrative of advocating violent action against the Indian state”.The discussion programme, being broadcast in Punjabi, meant Ofcom had to commission an English translation.It said that KTV was notified about the investigation and did not initially raise accuracy issues but later did, resulting in a second translation.It concluded that KTV failed to ensure that material which was “potentially highly offensive to viewers” was justified by the context and, therefore, in breach of its code.On its website, KTV describes itself as an exciting channel, airing a range of cultural, educational and entertaining programmes for audiences of all ages. It says it prides itself in being “completely independent, impartial and honest”. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/uk-media-watchdog-fines-khalsa-tv-for-violence-terror-references-211864

A copter crash at Poonch in Jammu consumed five senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Air Force.Lieutenant General Daulat Singh, General Officer Commanding In Chief, Western Command, Lieutenant General Bikram Singh, General Officer Commanding, 15 Corps, Air Vice-Marshal Erlic Wilmot Pinto, Air Officer Commanding, Western Command, Major General Nalin Kumar Dhirajlal Nanavati, Military Cross, General Officer Commanding 25 Infantry Division, Brigadier SR Oberoi, Military Cross, Commander 93 Infantry Brigade and Flight Lieutenant SS Sodhi were the victims.The generals were en route a reconnaissance mission and the accident impacted a protocol change wherein senior generals of the army were banned from traveling together in future. “This was the first major accident in which Indian Army and Air Force officers lost their lives,” Brig (retd) Onkar Singh Goraya says.A native of the Kahma village in Nawanshahr, Lt Gen Bikram Singh, also famous as the ‘hero of Ladakh’ is all set to get a memorial at his ancestral village (Nanka pind) of Siana (in Nawanshahr). Last year on November 22, Finance Minister of Punjab Manpreet Badal unveiled a statue and laid the foundation stone of a library and museum in his memory there.“In think in the crash we lost a future army chief. He was a hero. The government of Punjab thinks people ought to have a sense of history to get a sense of destiny. We want the future generations to remember him. The government is installing a statue and setting up a library in his memory. We are open to contributions of documents and other memorabilia from the Rajput Regiment and his family as well for the memorial,” the minister says.Lost in obscurity, this revival of his legacy has triggered nostalgia among people. In Jammu and Ladakh, his portraits can still be found in houses, while grocers, dhabas and paan walahs don’t charge money, as a token of respect, from the family whenever they visit and a Jammu committee still fights to get his statue shifted to a more prominent location of the town. A gurdwara at Bikram Chowk (named after him) in Jammu is also graced by his portrait.Brig (retd) Goraya, tells, “The general perception among people was that he saved Ladakh. I was posted as a second lieutenant in the early 60s. The first time I travelled to Kashmir Bikram Singh was the Corps Commander at the headquarters in Udhampur. He was worshipped by most of the Kashmiris because he maintained peace and was apolitical. They were very happy with him and many households had his photographs hung.”Lt Gen HS Panag talks about his departed counterpart. “Bikram Singh had a sterling reputation as a general in Ladakh. People were quite happy to see him. There is no doubt that Ladakh was a much better battle than the one fought in NEFA. However, the withdrawal from Chushul remained controversial.”Twin committees keep him alive||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lt-gen-bikram-singhs-ancestral-village-gets-statue-memorial-and-library-211686

Farmers will march towards Delhi, if needed,” said Tikait, while holding the government responsible for the Republic Day violence.He called upon the farmers to write “Kisan Karanti Yatra January 26, 2021” on their tractor-trailers to spread the message that they would not go back till their demand was accepted.The BKU leader said the new farm laws would lead to the dismantling of the MSP system and exploitation of farmers from whom big companies would procure produce at cheaper rates and then store in big godowns.Without naming anyone, Tikait said attempts had been made to divide the farmers’ stir. “The agitation is pan-India and not limited to Punjab, Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, as is being projected by some,” said the BKU leader.He said farmer leaders would tour various parts of the country and he would also visit Gujarat soon.Tikait alleged that Gujarat farmers were being told not to lend support to the agitation. “We will soon hold meetings in Gujarat and other states,” he added.The panchayat was attended by a large number of people. Farmer leaders, including Balbir Singh Rajewal, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Dr Darshan Pal, Jagjit Singh Dalewal, Harmeet Qadian and Yudhvir Singh, also attended the mahapanchayat.“So far, 228 protesters have sacrificed their lives during the stir. It is shameful that the government is admitting on the floor of Parliament that it has no plans to extend support to the kin of such ‘martyrs’, said farmer leaders.Charuni said the protesters were ready for a long battle as they were fighting for justified demands. He demanded that there should be the guarantee of procuring the produce at the MSP while provision for punishment should be made if the produce was procured less than the MSP.Charuni said they were working on identifying anti-social elements, who were making efforts to join the agitation in order to spoil it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aiming-to-bring-40-lakh-tractors-to-farmers-agitation-tikait-211604

The MP was asked to take up the matter with the state.Dullo told The Tribune that due to a delay in the release of the grant, the future of lakhs of SC students was at stake as private educational institutions were not releasing their degrees. The degrees or certificates were on hold either due to non-reimbursement of the scholarship fee to the college or non-payment of examination fee to the university concerned. In Punjab, the Capt Amarinder Singh government is likely to urge the Centre to reimburse the pending grant on the basis of the revised funding pattern (announced this year). The scheme will remain applicable till 2025-2026.After getting the Cabinet approval, the state will be requesting the Centre to apply the new scheme from retrospective effect till 2025-2026. Under the new scheme, the Centre will pay 60 per cent of the average demand for the past three years, while the remaining will be borne by the state.Barring funds of Rs 34 crore related to OBC students, Punjab has already sent utilisation certificates for the funds released till 2016-2017.Students protest outside Patiala collegePatiala: Defying orders, a government-aided college in Patiala allegedly refused to release the original caste certificates, which the students had deposited under the Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme.

The former CM and 16 others were killed in an explosion outside the Civil Secretariat, Chandigarh, in 1995. Rajoana was sentenced to death in 2007 by a special court. His mercy petition has been hanging fire for more than eight years.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on January 25 given the last chance to the Centre to take a call on his mercy plea. On Friday, it granted additional time after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the President was seized of the matter.“The process has started and the President will take a decision. This is a case where the convict is accused of assassinating a former CM on the issue of ‘Khalistan’,” Mehta told the Bench, requesting it to wait for the President’s decision.As the Bench asked if he could give a time-frame for the decision, Mehta said he could only speak for the government and not the President.On behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi said the convict’s petition had been pending for almost nine years and the case shouldn’t be adjourned for more than two weeks.Citing Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar case, the petitioner has claimed that the “delay caused by circumstances beyond the prisoner’s control mandates commutation of death sentence.” The inordinate delay had caused agony and adversely affected his physical and mental health, Rajoana contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-gets-more-time-to-decide-on-balwant-singh-rajoana-plea-211537

A Division Bench has also asked the state counsel to address the court on the scope of such powers exercised by the commission.The Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh was hearing a petition filed by Harjit Singh and another petitioner against the state and other respondents alleging passing of a re-inquiry order by the commission in a civil dispute.As the case came up for hearing, the petitioners claimed that a respondent entered into agreement to sell with them. Thereafter, he started harassing them to return the money and filed police complaints. An inquiry, conducted by the Garhshankar DSP, found the allegations to be false, after which the respondent filed a civil suit seeking an injunction. It, too, was rejected and an appeal or revision plea against the order was not preferred. Thereafter, the respondent moved the Jalandhar Range DIG. Another inquiry found the petitioners to be innocent. But a re-inquiry was ordered by the commission vide the impugned order.Taking up the matter, the Bench asserted an important question has been raised before the court about the commission’s powers as the dispute appeared to be civil in nature, for which the best remedy was a suit for specific performance. The matter, however, was being adjudicated by the commission.“A query has been put to counsel for the petitioners as well as Sahil Sharma, DAG Punjab, with whom an advance copy of the petition is available, about the ambit of ‘human rights’ and enforcement thereof by the commission and scope of such powers,” the Bench asserted.Accepting the prayer of the parties for additional time to examine the issue and assist the court, the Bench adjourned the matter to March third week. The authority assigned with the re-inquiry task by the commission was also asked to keep the proceedings in abeyance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/high-court-questions-punjab-on-ambit-of-human-rights-211543

The police will be deployed at all 117 booths.SDM Jaspal Singh Brar, at a meeting, told representatives of all parties that polling would be conducted from 8 am to 4 pm and no violation of rules would be tolerated.Sources attributed this “abnormal” situation to the statement of a former SAD minister who reportedly said 500 outsiders would be deployed at booths to prevent rigging. BJP legislator Arun Narang in the presence of state party president Ashwani Sharma was quoted to have said an “army of BJP workers” would be deputed at each booth to prevent rigging.Reacting over the “threats”, PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar at his maiden rally on Thursday said the BJP and SAD, which parted ways, had jointly ruled the MC for nine years and were scared of defeat. Jakhar had told the administration to push out all outsiders from the town after the campaign ended.While the Congress has put up 13 former councillors or their kin in the election, the BJP has fielded only two.

Rahul said 64 per cent of the populace lived in the rural areas, and millions of farmers, labourers and small businessmen were connected to agriculture business. The Congress had been fighting to safeguard their rights, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi had conspired to let a few corporates monopolise the agriculture business, he alleged.“This will ruin roadside vendors also as the contentious laws promotes uncontrolled hoarding, black-marketing in agriculture produce and allied products. Come what may, the Congress will not allow this to happen,” he said.He slammed the central government for implementing “anti-people” policies, highlighting demonetization and GST. He said even laws enacted in the Covid-19 pandemic period were part of the BJP’s plan to benefit a few big business houses that enjoyed Rs 1.5 lakh crore relief in bank dues but migrants were denied even free and comfortable travel facility to reach their native places after the lockdown was announced in March last year.Rahul was accompanied by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and former Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot.

The issue of procurement of wheat by Food Corporation of India from the state in the coming rabi marketing season will be the main point of discussion.Ashu said though the issue of withholding of two per cent of Rural Development Fund by the Centre will also be discussed, their main concern is that each grain of wheat should be procured from the state to quell the dissent amongst the farmers and other agrarian economy related sections in the state.The minister said the issue of making direct payment to farmers would also to be discussed. “While the Centre has been insisting on making direct payment to farmers, and restricting the role of commission agents (arhtiyas), we feel that it is a well-established mandi system and had to be dealt with more sensitively,” he said.This year again, Punjab is facing a severe shortage of jute/gunny bags, required for storing the procured wheat. In the last season, the state had allowed use of old bags because of the shortage.“The state has also not received its subsidy under the National Food Security Act. I am hoping to briefly touch upon these subjects, before a formal agenda for taking the talks forward can be agreed and then worked upon,” said the food minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bharat-bhushan-ashu-to-meet-amit-shah-on-agriculture-issues-today-211533

This is a case where the convict is accused of assassinating a former CM on the issue of ‘Khalistan’,” Mehta told the Bench, requesting it to wait for the President’s decision.As the Bench asked if he could give a time-frame for the decision, Mehta said he could only speak for the Government and not the President.On behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi said the convict’s mercy petition had been pending for almost nine years and the case shouldn’t be adjourned for more than two weeks.Citing Devender Pal Singh Bhullar’s case, the petitioner has claimed that the “Delay caused by circumstances beyond the prisoners’ control mandates commutation of death sentence.” The inordinate delay caused agony and adversely affected his physical and mental health, Rajaona contended.Earlier, the top court had asked the government to decide Rajoana’s mercy petition before the Republic Day but had extended it at the request of Mehta who had said it would not be prudent to decide the matter at this juncture as it could have some repercussions in the present situation.The top court had on January 8 asked the Centre to decide by January 26 Rajoana’s mercy plea.Maintaining that Pendency of appeals by co-accused has no bearing on Presidential pardon granted to a death-row convict, the Supreme Court had on December 4 questioned the Centre over delay in sending proposal to the President for commuting Rajoana’s death penalty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sc-gives-six-more-weeks-to-centre-to-decide-rajaonas-mercy-plea-211375
