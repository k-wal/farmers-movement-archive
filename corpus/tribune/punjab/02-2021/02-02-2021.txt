02-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to pass state amendment bills again to negate central farm laws||With Punjab Governor V P Singh Badnore refusing to send the state amendment bills aimed at negating the three central farm laws to President Ram Nath Kovind, the state government will again bring amendment bills to the central laws.“We will bring the Bills again as the Constitution provides that if Bills are passed twice by the Vidhan Sabha, they have to be sent by the Governor to the President,” said Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh in a statement here.“The governor should not have sat over the Bills. The state was empowered to amend the laws under Article 254 (ii) of the Constitution,” he added.Amarinder Singh had earlier convened an all-party meeting to evolve a consensus on the way forward on the issue of farm laws and farmers’ agitation.Pointing out that the President had refused to meet the Punjab leaders following the passage of the Bills in the Vidhan Sabha on the ground that he had not received the Bills, the chief minister told the all-party meeting that he would seek time again from President Kovind.He said he was also constantly in touch with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the issue of farm laws and farmers’ protests as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Last October, the Punjab assembly had passed four Bills and a resolution to counter the Centre’s farm laws.It had provided for imprisonment of not less than three years and a fine for sale or purchase of wheat or paddy under a farming agreement below the minimum support price.The chief minister underlined the need for early resolution of the crisis and also warned that the threat from Pakistan could not be undermined.“We have to work to resolve this issue before things go out of hand,” he said, adding he knew how many drones, arms and ammunition were being smuggled into the state from across the border.“If anger builds up here, it will be exploited,” the chief minister warned.He said the voice of the people is the strongest in a democracy.“We will have to raise a united voice of Punjab,” he stated, adding if there is no peace here, no industry will come.Slammed the Centre for allegedly penalising Punjab, the chief minister said the Centre still owes the state Rs 13,000 crore of GST, which they have held back along with Rs 1,200 crore of the rural development fund.On the issue of missing people from Punjab since the Republic Day violence in the national capital, Amarinder Singh said 70 of them are in Delhi jails, while 14 of the remaining 19 have been located.As per the information received, five persons from Punjab are still missing, he said, adding all efforts are being made to trace them.The 70-member lawyers’ team of Advocate General Atul Nanda, deputed to help out farmers with free legal aids, are reaching out to those in prison and those facing cases filed against them by the Delhi Police, the chief minister said.He said his government was extending all possible help to the agitating farmers, camping out at Delhi’s borders for over two months now, and also to their families back home.“No effort would be spared to ensure the safe return of all the farmers to their homes in Punjab,” he added.The CM also said that 170 cases registered against farmers during agitations in Punjab were being withdrawn by his government.

02-02-2021||Chandigarh||No tax hike in excise policy||With no increase in excise and other levies, the prices of country liquor are set to remain unchanged in the “Excise Policy 2021-22” approved by the state Cabinet today. The price of the Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) may, however, see marginal increase depending upon the brand.In the policy, the Excise Department has projected to mop up Rs 7,002 crore as excise revenue, as against current year’s Rs 5,794 crore, showing an increase of 20%. Overall, the policy largely focuses on providing relief to retail licencees and to keep buoyancy in the liquor trade.The additional revenue will come through increase in the quota (minimum quantity to be sold by a licencee) of the IMFL, country liquor and beer by 6%, 12% and 6%, respectively.A government functionary said the increase in quota would benefit liquor vends in border areas due to high consumption. For the first time, the department has proposed to impose a quota for foreign liquor in municipal corporation areas and class ‘A’ municipalities.The government has offered a booster dose to the Covid-affected hospitality industry by cutting down on the annual fixed licence fee for bar and hotels by 30%. The fee on the consumption of liquor (assessed fee) has also been reduced. The annual licence fee for marriage palaces has further been reduced by 20%.The policy aims at renewal of the existing vends, subject to lifting of additional liquor by the licencees, ensuring a minimum revenue growth of 12% during 2020-21. The current year’s revenue is expected to be Rs 5,794 crore as against Rs 5,027 crore in the previous year, showing an increase of 15%.Further, the wholesale trade of liquor will be monitored online, replacing the present L-13 wholesale licencees.

The relationship between its Bar and the Bench today took a direct hit with the lawyers’ association not only seeking Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha’s transfer, but also deciding to boycott his court for non-resumption of physical hearing of cases.Rift also surfaced between the HC Bar Association and the Bar Council over the issue of removing Punjab Advocate-General Atul Nanda from the association’s membership.In an out-of-the-ordinary move, the Bar Association’s general house decided to remove Nanda from membership for working against “physical opening of the court and interest of Bar” — a move dubbed by the council as ex facie illegal. Staying the decision, the council said disciplinary action against any Bar member could not be taken without following the drill. A specific agenda with due notice was required to be circulated, if a member’s conduct was to be discussed in the house.Describing the association’s decision as unfair and uncalled for, the Bar Council said Nanda had publicly supported the resumption of physical working.The council also referred to Nanda’s letter dated January 30 giving his consent for appearance of law officers of the State of Punjab during physical hearing of cases. Nanda’s approval is significant as consent of both parties is required for hearing a matter physically. Nanda refused to comment on the issue. But a senior functionary in the AG office said Nanda was in favour of physical hearing.Bar president GBS Dhillon, meanwhile, made it clear the resolution passed during the general house meeting this afternoon on Chief Justice’s transfer and boycott would remain in force until complete opening of physical courts or his transfer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-bar-seeks-cjs-transfer-206629

02-02-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||‘Punished’ for farm stir||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 1Punjab has been “completely ignored” by the Centre in its Budget proposals presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today, drawing sharp reactions from across the socio-economic-political spectrum in the state.Though economists, policy makers and politicians in the state say they would like to believe that the move is not a consequence of the ongoing farmers’ agitation, there are apprehensions that Punjab is being asked to pay a consequent and collective price for the agitation.Just like the Padma awards, where 30% of the awards went to five states going to the polls, the Budget is meant for the ‘ABC’ (Assam, Bengal, Chennai) where polls are due— Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal said as part of this design to punish Punjab, the Centre earlier withheld Punjab’s Rural Development Fund (RDF).“Also, the UAE wanted to set up three food parks in India and had expressed its interest in setting up one in Amritsar. But the three food parks have been allotted by the government to Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. This could be a consequence of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. There is nothing for Punjab or any other northern state in the Budget, which forces us to think that Punjab has been deliberately ignored, while poll-bound states have been favoured,” he rued.Dr Lakhwinder Singh, an economist, said by not enhancing the total agriculture outlay in the Budget, it was clear that the philosophy behind the move was that the agriculture sector continued to grow and show resilience without government assistance in the time of Covid-19. “Since the government is bringing laws favouring mega corporations for investment in trade, infrastructure and direct agriculture production system, the government seems to have left the sector to intervention of market forces,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punished-for-farm-stir-206637

The prolonged struggle will definitely bear fruit,” he said.He blamed negligence on part of the Delhi Police for the unfortunate incident at the Red Fort on Republic Day. The farmers’ organisations welcomed Jagmohan Singh with a cavalcade of 25 bullock carts carrying the national flag.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bhagat-singhs-nephew-backs-protest-in-hisar-206609

02-02-2021||---||Union Budget exposes Centre’s apathy towards common man, farmers: Punjab CM||Chandigarh, February 1Rejecting the Union Budget for 2021-22 as reflective of the BJP-led Central government’s total apathy towards the common man, the middle class and the farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said even the vital sector of defence had not been adequately addressed despite the growing border threat from China and Pakistan, while health allocation was actually down amid the Covid crisis.Trashing the Centre’s claim that the health sector allotment had been increased by 35 per cent, the Chief Minister said the fact was that numbers had been effectively fudged to project a hike by including the Rs 35,000 crore Covid vaccine allotment and the amount set aside for sanitation and cleanliness under the health head.Actually, the budget for health is down 10 per cent, said Amarinder Singh.The Chief Minister also slammed the Centre for the step-motherly treatment meted out to Punjab and other northern states in the Budget, which was designed to cater to the poll-bound state of West Bengal, as well as south India, with a massive infrastructure development allocation for these regions.“The Budget also manifests the Central Government’s persistent efforts to sideline non-BJP states like ours, as well as its anti-federal mindset,” said the Chief Minister, pointing to the gap between the fiscal deficit targets fixed for the Union and States for short and medium term.Aimed at promoting the interests of a few corporates at the cost of the needs and aspirations of the remaining 1.3 plus billion population, the Budget presented in Parliament on Monday by the Union Government failed to address the growing problem of unemployment, which the Covid pandemic had exacerbated, he said.“And did the Finance Minister not find it necessary to even mention constitutional guarantee for MSP, one of the key demands of the farmers battling cold and lathis at the doorstep of New Delhi for over two months now?” Amarinder asked, lamenting the measly 2 per cent hike for the agriculture sector, which had been the only well performing sector for the country amid the lockdown.The Punjab Chief Minister also flayed the Centre’s minimal focus on education, which has seen a massive setback for lakhs of children hit by the digital divide amid the pandemic.“It seems that this government has no care or concern for our soldiers fighting to protect us at the borders, or our frontline healthcare workers and also the teachers who have been pushed to the limits to ensure seamless service in the midst of Covid,” he said.With no tax relief, the beleaguered middle class has also got nothing in this Budget, the CM pointed out, adding that as against 25 per cent for the corporate sector, the middle class will continue to pay 35 per cent plus cess, along with 100 per cent indirect tax on petrol and diesel.The Chief Minister expressed shock over the Centre’s decision to go in for a virtual wholesale divestment of the PSUs and government assets at a time when the economy was in the dumps.This was inexplicable, considering that the RSS had always vehemently opposed such divestment, and also given the Centre’s self-proclaimed thrust on ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, he added.The entire Budget was a big let-down for every section of society, except the big corporates whom the BJP-led Central Government is out to appease at the cost of the interests of the rest, said the Chief Minister.The only somewhat positive note was the increase in the revenue grant for deficit states from Rs 75,000 crore to Rs 1,85,000 crore, he said, hoping that the Centre does not get out of giving Punjab its substantial share on this count.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/union-budget-exposes-centres-apathy-towards-common-man-farmers-punjab-cm-206404
02-02-2021||New Delhi||Twitter restores accounts linked to farmers’ protest after blocking these for hours||Twitter on Tuesday restored most of the accounts that were blocked after the government asked microblogging platform to take action against 250 handles and posts for containing ‘false and provocative content’ related to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.These included accounts of Kisan Ekta Morcha, BKU Ekta-Urgahan, Tractor2twitr that have thousands of followers and have been actively involved in the ongoing protests.According to sources, the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) had directed Twitter to block around 250 tweets/Twitter accounts that were making ‘fake, intimidatory and provocative tweets’ on January 30 with hashtags accusing the Modi government of planning farmers ‘genocide’ without any further substantiation.This blocking was done at the request of the Ministry of Home Affairs and law enforcement agencies to prevent any escalation of law and order in view of the ongoing farmer agitation, the sources said.The sources said incitement to genocide is a grave threat to public order and therefore, MeitY ordered blocking of these Twitter accounts and tweets under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.When contacted, a Twitter spokesperson said if it receives a “properly scoped request” from an authorised entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time.”“Transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression, so we have a notice policy for withheld content. Upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we will promptly notify the affected account holders (unless we are prohibited from doing so eg if we receive a court order under seal),” the spokesperson added.However, Twitter did not provide details of the accounts/tweets that were blocked.Upon searching for accounts, including Kisan Ekta Morcha (@Kisanektamorcha) and BKU Ekta Urgahan (@Bkuektaugrahan) -- a message saying “account has been withheld in India in response to a legal demand” was displayed.However, these accounts were restored by the evening.Besides these, several other individual and organisation accounts, including one of a media outlet and another of a senior functionary of a separate entity, were also withheld, even as debates started on social media over the development.The development comes in the wake of violence in Delhi on January 26 during a tractor parade of farmers, protesting against the three new central agriculture laws.The Delhi Police is currently probing the Republic Day violence, wherein it has lodged multiple FIRs and booked, among others, several farmer leaders leading the protests at the national capital’s borders since November-end. FIRs have been lodged against some journalists as well. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/twitter-restores-accounts-linked-to-farmers-protest-after-blocking-these-for-hours-206392
