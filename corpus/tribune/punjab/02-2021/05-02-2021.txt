The regional parties are against it.He demanded fixation of MSP as per the recommendation of Swaminathan Commission, and be linked to the Price Index.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ss-dhindsa-joins-opposition-chorus-in-rajya-sabha-against-farm-laws-208338
05-02-2021||New Delhi||Partap Bajwa seeks time-bound judicial probe into R-day incidents||Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Friday fervently appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal the contentious farm laws and show statesmanship, noting that Modi had the opportunity to come out strong like Sardar Patel.“You have twice been the prime minister. Now is the time to be a statesmanlike Sardar Patel. Come, let’s all go to the Delhi Borders. I will come with you. Tell the farmers you brought the laws to benefit them but that you are ready to repeal if they feel otherwise. Don’t make it a prestige issue,” the former Punjab Congress chief said in a 15-minute speech during the ongoing debate in Rajya Sabha on the President’s address to Parliament.Bajwa accused the Centre of pushing the farm laws through a “back door” in Rajya Sabha last September. He said the government threw to the winds all parliamentary conventions and constitutional rights of MPs to seek division.“Today the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and UP have lost trust in you because you rushed the law through deceit. What was your hurry to enact the ordinances? You wanted to favour some corporates. That’s why you hastened the laws through the Parliament. The farmers don’t trust your intentions now,” he said.The MP asked the government to delineate the technical difference between suspending the laws for one and a half year and repealing them.“You say you’re ready to suspend the laws. How are the two things different? If you can suspend the laws for a year and a half why can’t you repeal them? Reenact the laws after comprehensive stakeholder consultation,” he suggested.Condemning the Republic Day violence the Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab alleged conspiracy in the January 26 incidents and demanded a time-bound probe by a sitting SC judge into how a section of protesters was allowed to enter Delhi before the time earlier agreed upon with the police.“Who allowed a section to deviate from pre-planned routes?” He asked.Bajwa also recalled the execution of ninth Guru Teg Bahadur for the cause Kashmiri Brahmins.Bajwa said the community had always made sacrifices for the country.“You will teach us nationalism?” he asked, expressing anguish at a section of farmers being labelled as Khalistanis and anti-nationals.The Congress leader questioned the Delhi police act of preventing opposition MPs from meeting the farmers at Ghazipur yesterday asking, “What kind of a democracy is this?”Earlier he accused the Centre of attempts to crush the farmers’ agitation by barricading the protest sites and denying basic facilities to farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/partap-bajwa-seeks-time-bound-judicial-probe-into-r-day-incidents-208332
05-02-2021||New Delhi||NIA arrests hawala operator from Punjab in narco-terror case||A day after seizing Rs 20 lakh and 130 cartridges, the NIA on Friday arrested hawala operator Manpreet Singh from Punjab in connection with a narco-terrorism case involving Hizbul Mujahideen, officials said.An National Investigation Agency (NIA) official connected to the case told IANS: "The agency arrested Manpreet from Amritsar, where he had been residing for the last three months in a rented accommodation." He said that Manpreet will be presented in a Special NIA court to seek his custody.The development comes a day after the NIA conducted searches at the premises of Manpreet in Amritsar and Gurdaspur. The accused is a close associate of co-accused Ranjit Singh aka Cheetah and Iqbal Singh aka Shera.The case relates to the arrest of Hilal Ahmad Shergojri -- an overground worker of Hizbul and close associate of terror outfit's then commander Riyaz Ahmed Naikoo -- who had visited Amritsar to collect funds for terror activities in Jammu and Kashmir.The Punjab Police had seized Rs 29 lakh along with a truck from the accused on April 25 last year.The case was re-registered by the NIA on May 8 last year. The NIA has since filed charge sheet against 11 persons in the Special NIA court in SAS Nagar adjoining Chandigarh in the case."Investigation revealed that Manpreet had involved in transporting heroin, drug smuggling proceeds and weapons in his car as per directions of accused Ranjit and Iqbal," another NIA official said on Thursday.The official said that Manpreet had delivered Rs 35 lakh and weapons to charge-sheeted accused Bikram Singh aka Vicky, a relative of Ranjit, in March last year."During searches conducted on Thursday, Rs 20 lakh, 130 live rounds of 9 mm pistol, mobile phones, pen drive, a bunch of polythene bags used for packing heroin, a Hyundai Verna car, a two-wheeler, documents related to properties, and other incriminating documents were seized from the suspect's house," the official had said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nia-arrests-hawala-operator-from-punjab-in-narco-terror-case-208322
05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Facing protest, BJP contests 29% seats||Amid reports of BJP leaders facing opposition from supporters in view of the ongoing farmers’ stir, the party has fielded 670 candidates across 2,302 wards in eight municipal corporations and 109 municipal councils and nagar panchayats of the state going to the polls on February 14.A total of 15,305 candidates, including 10,193 Independents, have filed their nomination papers.The ruling Congress has fielded 1,652 candidates, followed by the SAD (1,526), AAP (1,155) and the BSP (102). Going by the data released by the State Election Commission, the BJP has fielded candidates on 29 per cent of the seats. On the other hand, the Congress has fielded candidates on 72 per cent of the seats, followed by SAD (66 per cent) and AAP (49 per cent).This makes the grass-roots political bout — the first since the farmers’ stir began against the central farm laws — a four-corned contest as the BJP is going solo after the SAD walked out of the alliance.In the wake of anger in the state against the BJP, the Congress and other parties supporting the farmers’ agitation claimed the elections would be a mini-referendum on the central farm laws. The BJP, on the other hand, is trying to counter the narrative by mobilising its voter base in areas such as Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, Bathinda, Rajpura, Abohar, etc.Sources in the Congress said though the party was fighting all seats, in some municipal councils and nagar panchayats, candidates had filed papers as Independents due to political reasons.In case of the BJP, candidates were reluctant to contest on the party symbol due to farmers’ stir and were contesting as Independents, mainly in the Doaba region. “A true picture will emerge on February 5, the day of withdrawal of papers,” said officials in the commission.The officials said 3,218 candidates had filed nominations for eight municipal corporations — Bathinda (417), Abohar (388), Batala (420), Hoshiarpur (343), Moga (577), Pathankot (336), Mohali (419), and Kapurthala (319). Apart from this, 11 candidates had filed nomination papers for ward No. 37 of the Amritsar Municipal Corporation.They added 400 members would be elected to eight municipal corporations, while 1,902 would be elected to 109 municipal councils/nagar panchayats in the state. As many as 20,49,777 male, 18,65,354 female and 149 transgender voters, totalling 39,15,280, are eligible to exercise their franchise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/facing-protest-bjp-contests-29-seats-208028

In the 2015 civic body polls, the party had put up an impressive show by winning 19 out of the 31 wards.However, things have changed drastically over the past few years, especially after the demise of former state BJP chief Kamal Sharma, who wielded both respect and support amidst party rank and file here, in 2019. Later, two-time BJP MLA Sukhpal Singh Nannu got embroiled in some controversies due to which he could not maintain strong rapport with supporters.The latest farmer agitation has further added to the party’s woes as several leaders, including sitting councillors, have switched over to other parties, further eroding the party base.A few months ago, the BJP high command had deputed ex-ADGP Rajinder Prashad Mittal, who had joined the party after retirement, to consolidate the party base in the border district. Mittal has been meeting senior BJP leaders in the district to revive the party functioning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/exodus-leaves-party-in-lurch-208029

They stopped the protesters from entering the residence of the BJP leader.

Sharma, who is a former councillor, has again filed his nomination papers to contest the local body poll.He alleged some miscreants had torn his posters and banners pasted by him in his ward for campaigning. “My face was also blackened on the posters/banners,” he alleged.He said the BJP had given a written complaint to the district administration against the miscreants but it had not taken any legal action against them. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/moga-saffron-party-chief-manhandled-208030

NRIs are not only sending monetary help, but also sending necessary articles and some have even descended down to support them.Dr Harkawal Singh, who recently migrated to Canada, said he was pained to see the state of affairs in India. “So many farmers are dying due to cold and being a doctor I thought there is nothing above medical aid that can be given to the protesting farmers. I landed here in Delhi and went straight to the Singhu border where I held a medical camp for one month. After meeting my relatives for 4-5 days in Punjab, I will be going back. I am always there for the people of my country and have shared my number with people here so that they can consult me online in case they have any problem,” he said.Migrating to a foreign land 12 years ago did not make her alien to the problems faced by farmers back in her motherland. Pained at the thought of farmers sitting out in the biting cold, Gurmehak Sekhon Ghuman, born in Punjab, is not only sending support but also holding protests in the US.“My heart bleeds at the mere thought of farmers braving the cold. We are holding peaceful protest in the US in their support. In all the years I have lived here, I have never seen Indians coming together with tremendous passion and unity of opinion for one cause and that is to protest against the three agricultural laws passed by the Centre,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-dearth-of-nri-help-farmers-stay-strong-208032
05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Over 400 academics want laws repealed||A large number of scholars under the banner of the Academician for Farmers on Thursday expressed concern over the suffering of protesters in Delhi and demanded that the three laws be abandoned without any further delay.More than 400 scholars, in a joint statement, said farming as a profession was at the heart of civilisation. “A major positive feature of India’s farming communities is that a large number of farmers own land from which they derive their livelihood. In fact, farming is the activity on which the livelihood of 50 to 60% of Indians depends.”Dr Arvind from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, said the three laws were aimed at bringing in fundamental changes in the way farming would be done in the country and they pose a major threat to the community across India.The academicians said the proposed “commodity market model” for farming was not viable for India for several reasons. In particular, the small and middle farmers will be hit hard in this process, as they are the ones with little or no wherewithal to collaborate with the corporate sector.The scholars demanded that the government should launch a nationwide debate starting at the village level, involving stakeholders from all sections of society, before framing the laws and policies that would help the farming community and other marginalised sections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/over-400-academics-want-laws-repealed-208033

Fearing damage in other areas in coming days, the Agriculture Department has started efforts to contain the disease spread.“I have taken 13 acres on annual lease in Ubhawal village and sown mustard on it. But for the last 10 days, plants have been shriveling and not bearing any fruit. It’s ripening time and if my crop does not grow now, I will have to plough it all and it will cause me losses worth lakhs,” said Gurmeet Singh, a farmer from Akoi Sahib village.The shriveling of mustard has given tension to other farmers, who have demanded quick action toprevent the spread of the mystery disease.“Farmers are already under huge debt and if the disease spreads, it will cause more heavy losses and they will have to acquire loans. Officers concerned are working to detect the reasons, but the state government should also announce any special scheme to compensate the farmers,” said Satwant Singh, another farmer from Ubhwal village.Senior Agriculture Department officers disclosed that after getting information about damage to the crop, a team led by Chief Agriculture Officer, Sangrur, along with Krishi Vigyan Kendra Kheri visited Ubhawal field. The team examined the 13 acres and have put the crop under observation till Monday to ascertain the nature of the disease.“We have been taking the required steps and have put the crop under observation till Monday. The attack has been in patches. Our teams are also visiting other villages of the district and getting a feedback to know whether the residents are facing a similar problem,” said Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal, Chief Agriculture Officer, Sangrur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/mysterious-disease-ruins-mustard-crop-208041

Talking to The Tribune, neurosurgeon Dr Sorabh Gupta said: “After I came to know from my staff members that Jagseer is the same guy who was injured while participating in the tractor parade, we decided not to charge him for the treatment. At least this much we can do for the farmers of the state who have been protesting unrelentingly for their just cause. We also learnt that Jagseer comes from a financially deprived family so we decided to treat him for free.”Jagseer said: “I am grateful to the doctors and staff who not only took good care of me but also didn’t charge me for the treatment. Initially they did charge some money, but as soon as they found out, they treated me for free. I am deeply touched with the empathy shown by them and we all should learn from such noble gestures.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/man-lathicharged-in-delhi-treated-for-free-in-bathinda-208042

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||CBI gives sacrilege case files to police||Within months of the Akalis walking out of the Union Government, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday finally handed to the state the police papers relating to the sacrilege cases, which Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh said clearly exposed that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had been scuttling the process to prevent its complicity in the cases from being revealed.Probe will expose SAD’s complicity: CMThe SAD’s complicity in the 2015 cases and its subsequent efforts to scuttle a fair and free probe would now be exposed with the completion of the SIT probe, CM Capt Amarinder said, asserting that all those found guilty would be identified and punished under the lawThe documents and files relating to the cases were handed over to the state police hours before the deadline set by the Punjab and Haryana High Court for the CBI to do so was to expire. Notably, the Director, Bureau of Investigation, had written to the CBI Director on January 18, 2021, to return the entire record to the state police without any further delay after the withdrawal of the investigation of sacrilege cases from the CBI and consequent return of the entire record, including evidence gathered in cases transferred to the CBI on November 2, 2015.Capt hiding his failures: AkalisThe Chief Minister termed it a victory for the state government and an endorsement of its stand that the CBI had, all these months, been trying to scuttle the investigation by the special investigative team (SIT) of the Punjab Police at behest of the SAD, which was a part of the ruling NDA at the Centre till September 2020.“It is clear now that Harsimrat Badal, as a Union Minister, had been pressurising the central agency to obstruct the SIT probe by refusing to hand over the case files as she knew that her party’s role in the entire affair would be exposed once the police take the investigation to its logical conclusion,” said Capt Amarinder.The SAD’s complicity in the 2015 cases and its subsequent efforts to scuttle a fair and free probe would now be exposed with the completion of the SIT probe, he said, asserting that all those found guilty would be identified and punished under the law. Nobody would be spared, irrespective of their political affiliation or position, he added.Pointing out that his government had withdrawn consent to the CBI to probe the cases as far back as in 2018, after the Vidhan Sabha unanimously resolved to do so, the Chief Minister said the SIT was also constituted then to take over the investigation. The central agency had, for more than two years, been persistently refusing to hand the case files back to the state, he said, adding that the agency, which had earlier filed a closure report in the matter, went on to constitute a new investigative team in September 2019 with the clear and obvious aim of preventing the state government from conducting its own impartial probe, he added.The incidents of sacrilege occurred between June and October 2015 following theft of the sacred Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara in Burj Jawaharsinghwala, Faridkot, and discovery of torn pages from the holy book in Bargari, Faridkot. They caused widespread discontent and outrage amongst members of the Sikh community. These incidents led to large-scale protests and agitations in October 2015.

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab eyes Rs 1,000 cr by curbing smuggling of liquor||Without increasing the price of liquor, the Punjab Government is hoping to maximise its excise revenue by a whopping Rs 1,000 crore. This is being done on the assumption that Punjab will continue with its drive to stop cross-border smuggling of liquor.In the ongoing financial year, after the hooch tragedy at Amritsar in July, the government has been successful in enforcing the law by controlling liquor smuggling from outside the state as well as checking the pilferage from the distilleries located within Punjab. This has helped the state almost meet its target of excise collection, despite the fact that liquor business remained suspended from April to mid-June.The Excise Policy 2021-22, which was announced by the government on Monday, has fixed the revenue to be earned at Rs 7,002 crore, mainly from additional sale of licit Punjab-made liquor (PML) and Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL).This year, the government had targeted earning Rs 6,250 crore from excise collections. “By the end of March, our excise collection will be between Rs 5,800 and Rs 6,000 crore. This year, we have provided for concessions ranging from 5 to 10% to those contractors who lift additional quota of the PML and IMFL. As our enforcement becomes more effective through raids using decoys and technology-based checks on trucks carrying liquor from distilleries, we arehopeful that the revenue will see a massive jump,” says A Venu Prasad, Financial Commissioner, Taxation.Excise officials say buoyed by the success of the ‘Operation Red Rose’, an exercise conducted by the Excise Department to check smuggling fromMay 17 last year, they will continue with the crackdown on smugglers and illegal liquor bottling units.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-eyes-rs-1-000-cr-by-curbing-smuggling-of-liquor-208054

If that’s not possible, external examiners can be selected from a different university in the state. These examiners have to be physically present at the exam venue.In case of states having all medical colleges under the same university, the institutions may engage external examiners from any other college under the State Health University, reads the advisory sent by NMC secretary Dr RK Vats.Earlier, the NMC had received representations from medical universities across the country expressing difficulty in getting external examiners for the conduct of exams given the travel restrictions imposed due the pandemic. The representations had sought relaxation in the existing norms for conducting exams regarding the appointment of external examiners.Earlier, the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences avoided involving internal examiners as they were often “biased” in evaluating the answer-sheets of students. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/norms-eased-for-external-mbbs-test-examiners-208057

Both of them are mentally unfit.On Thursday, Chanderappa was elated to see his son Manju Nath and other relatives who came to take him home, while Chitra, who also tells her name as Manjit Kaur, wasn’t fortunate enough to have her family here. So, Pingalwara members decided to hold her back till some alternate arrangement was made to send her home safely.Inderjit Kaur, Pingalwara head, said Chitra was admitted by the Sultanwind SHO on September 30 last year and Chendrappa a day later by the Jalalabad police. At that time, both of them were unable to disclose their credentials due to their mental condition.“During treatment, our counsellors gained their confidence and managed to procure information about their families. Chitra said her father was no more and was left with mother and a brother. Her marriage lasted for around a year. We procured her family picture and she recognised them all. Since, no one from her family came to pick her up, we will send her home under the protection of our team,” Inderjit added.Chitra said: “I heard of Golden Temple and medical facilities in Amritsar. So, I boarded a train and reached here. When I was roaming in streets, a cop caught me and brought me here,” she added.Meanwhile, Gulshan Ranjan, a social worker, said a student of Karnataka’s Gulbarga University helped us locate their families. “The student had come to Pingalwara in 2010 to do internship. We traced his number and sent their photographs to him, which helped him in locating their families,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pingalwara-to-rescue-of-2-lost-karnataka-residents-208060

05-02-2021||Chandigarh||CBI hands over case files related to 2015 sacrilege incidents to Punjab Police||Documents and files related to the 2015 sacrilege incidents have been handed over by the CBI to the Punjab Police, a state government statement issued here on Thursday said.“The documents and files relating to the cases were handed over to the Punjab Police hours before the deadline set by Punjab and Haryana High Court for the CBI to do so was to expire,” it said.“Notably, the Director Bureau of Investigation had written to Director CBI on January 18, 2021 to return the entire record to the state police without any further delay after withdrawal of investigation of sacrilege cases from CBI and consequent return of the entire record including evidence gathered in cases transferred to CBI on November 2, 2015..,” the statement said.The statement said “the CBI on Wednesday finally handed to the state police papers relating to the sacrilege cases”, which Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said “clearly exposed that the Shiromani Akali Dal (earlier part of NDA govt) had been scuttling the process to prevent their complicity in the cases from being exposed”.The chief minister termed it as a “victory” for the state government and an endorsement of its stand that “the CBI had, all these months, been trying to scuttle the investigation by the Special Investigative Team (SIT) of Punjab Police at the behest of the SAD, which was part of the ruling NDA at the Centre till September 2020.” “It is clear now that Harsimrat Badal, as union minister, had been pressurising the central agency to obstruct the SIT probe by refusing to hand over the case files as she knew that her party’s role in the entire affair would be exposed once the police takes the investigation to its logical conclusion,” alleged Singh in the statement.“SAD’s complicity in the 2015 cases and their subsequent efforts to scuttle a fair and free probe would now be exposed with the completion of the SIT probe,” he said, asserting that all those found guilty would be identified and punished under the law.Nobody will be spared, irrespective of their political affiliation or position, he said. Pointing out that his government had withdrawn consent to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the cases as far back as in 2018, after the Vidhan Sabha unanimously resolved to do so, Singh said the SIT was also constituted then to take over the investigation.“The central agency had, for more than two years, been persistently refusing to hand the case files back to state,” he alleged, adding that the agency, which had earlier filed a closure report in the matter, went on to constitute a new investigative team in September 2019 “with the clear and obvious aim of preventing the state government from conducting its own impartial, fair and speedy probe”.The chief minister said that the CBI had allegedly refused to hand over the case diaries “even after the High Court, in January 2019, upheld the state government’s decision, and again, in February 2020, the Supreme Court dismissed CBI’s appeal challenging the HC judgement”.The Punjab and Haryana High Court had last month directed the CBI to hand over all case diaries and papers related to the 2015 sacrilege incidents, including alleged desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, to the Punjab Police within a month.The Punjab government had handed over the probe to an SIT of the state police in September 2018 after the state Assembly passed a resolution withdrawing consent to the CBI to investigate these cases, noting lack of progress in the investigation.The previous SAD-BJP government had handed over three sacrilege cases—theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara on June 1, 2015, putting up of hand-written sacrilegious posters in Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on September 25 and torn pages of the holy book being found at Bargari on October 12, 2015 in Faridkot—to the CBI for probe. Two people, part of the anti-sacrilege protesters, were killed in the police firing at Behbal Kalan in 2015.
