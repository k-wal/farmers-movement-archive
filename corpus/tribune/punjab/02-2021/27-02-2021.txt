I request people to raise voice for his bail as well,” said Kaur during a press conference at Singhu border.A medical examination of Kumar conducted by a Chandigarh-based hospital has found two fractures on his hand and foot along with some broken nail beds on his toe.Kaur’s arrest received global attention after Meena Harris, niece of American Vice President Kamala Harris, tweeted saying the activist was “arrested, tortured & sexually assaulted in police custody”.Kaur, who rejoined the farmers protest at Singhu border on Saturday, said the ongoing movement has space for everyone to contribute, whether it is farmers or workers.Talking about her case, Kaur claimed she has done nothing wrong and that police have no evidence against her.She also accused the police of beating her up in the custody.“They abused me, pulled my hair, slapped me and made me sign papers forcefully. I couldn’t even walk,” she alleged.In her bail plea also, the 23-year-old activist had claimed to have been severely beaten up at a police station after she was arrested by the Sonipat Police on January 12.However, police have denied the charge as “baseless”.

He alleged the project worth Rs 600 crore has been ignored by the Congress government.“Around 800 grill frames are missing from Chheharta to India Gate. A total of 2,900 frames are missing on the entire BRTS route. One frame weighs around 20 kg, thus grills weighing 5,000 kg are missing. Due to the negligence of the government, iron grills worth Rs 30 lakh have been stolen in the last four years,” said Sharma.He urged the Municipal Corporation and the Punjab Metro Bus Society to take stern action in this regard.In February 2018 the Municipal Corporation Commissioner had written to Public Works Department (PWD) to take action against those who are removing the grills of the BRTS corridor. Earlier, Deputy Commissioner had also issued instructions to register police cases against people responsible for breaking the grills. However, no case has been registered till date. The grills can be seen missing from several locations.A few months ago, the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board handed over the BRTS to the Municipal Corporation. Mayor Karmajit Singh Rintu stated that they would streamline the bus metro soon.The social activist also demanded to install display boards, which were non-operational.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/grills-worth-rs-30-lakh-missing-on-amritsars-brts-route-social-activist-218160

Cheema said degrees of students were held up due to non-disbursal of funds for the scholarship. “Because of this, thousands of Dalit students have to leave their studies midway,” he added.“Due to a scam in the SC post-matric scholarship scheme, the condition of Dalit students remains miserable. Due to non-disbursal of the scholarship funds, not only the students but also the condition of colleges has deteriorated,” he said.

It will be open for him to recover the cost from erring police officers, after conducting an inquiry in accordance with the law,” Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan asserted, while admonishing the civil court for its casual approach.Justice Sangwan asserted it appeared that even the court was not deciding two suits pending since 2014, though the same could have been decided in an expeditious manner to avoid financial loss.The assertion came in a case where a police official, in the garb of maintaining law and order regarding a property — subject matter of two pending civil suits — put his own lock before handing over the keys to the munshi/moharrar of a police station to await the decision of the civil court.Justice Sangwan asserted the police authorities, in colourable exercise of the powers, put their own lock on the shop in dispute without any order of the court or authority just to help the respondent-brother. “Thus, action of the police clearly amounts to overreaching the powers of the court, which needs to be condemned strongly”.Justice Sangwan added surprisingly the inquiry report submitted by the Commissioner of Police stated that property was locked with effect from May 2015 by the respondent-brother, although ASI Simarjit Singh had put the lock in July 2017.It was surprising as to how this finding was recorded by the inquiry officer, especially when all four witnesses in clear words had deposed that the petitioner-brother had demolished and reconstructed the shop.Referring to an order passed in July 2015 by the civil court in the suit filed by respondent-brother, Justice Sangwan asserted it was noticed that parties were in agreement that possession was of the petitioner-brother. “Therefore, there was no authority with any of the police official to put its own lock and direct the parties to await the decision of the civil court”.Directing the removal of the locks, Justice Sangwan added the zeal and zest shown by the police authorities to out of the way help the private respondents by exceeding their power and even by overreaching the power and jurisdiction of civil court was apparent on record.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-raps-police-for-acting-beyond-jurisdiction-217945

In Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala, most of the RMOs, pharmacists and Class IV staff have not even been registered for vaccination.Details not sentWhile the first phase of vaccination was completed on Thursday, the letter reached the block centre late. The registration of healthcare workers was closed on February 17Rural medical officers of Koom Kalan block on Wednesday received a letter, asking for the details of the staff to be vaccinated. While the first phase of vaccination was completed on Thursday, the letter reached the block centre late. The registration on the portal for the first phase of vaccination has been completed. The portal was closed for registration of healthcare workers on February 17.There are 17 dispensaries in Koom Kalan block with 14 RMOs, besides pharmacists and other staff.“We never stepped back from our duty and served throughout the pandemic, but it is sad to know that the department forgot us. Asking for the details now when the portal is closed makes no sense,” said an RMO.In Ludhiana district, there are 62 RMOs posted against 109 posts and since the outbreak of Covid, all rural dispensaries were shut for nearly 10 months. There are 1,186 dispensaries in the state that cater to a population of 10,000.Dr JP Narula, state president of the Rural Medical Services Association, Punjab, said RMOs had been given step-motherly treatment by the government. “During the Covid spread, they worked in isolation centres and flu corners but when it came to vaccination, the department cared little about them,” he said.The Health Department registered its staff but ignored rural medical officers, who work under the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat.“The Health Department had the data of the RMOs as they were assigned Covid duties, but still they were ignored. Appreciation letters were given to the staff of the Health Department but not to RMOs,” he said.Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar, Ludhiana Civil Surgeon, said many health workers did not register for inoculation earlier but wanted to get vaccinated now.“The community health centre in the block is responsible for collecting the data of health workers and send us. As soon as the portal is opened, we will upload their data, so that vaccination can be done,” said Dr Kakkar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/on-duty-for10-months-no-vaccine-yet-for-ludhiana-rural-health-officers-217935

Areas in other states, including West Bengal, will also be brought under the ambit of our struggle, he said, addressing a kisan mahapanchayat organised by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) at the same grain market in Padampur of Sriganganagar where Congress former president Rahul Gandhi held a similar programme a few days ago.

We are ready for a long haul. — Rakesh Tikait, BKU spokespersonTikait said the BJP-led NDA government should shun its misconception that it could suppress the movement by misleading people.“Privatisation of the electricity sector would prevent farmers from running their pumping sets in the fields.“Our fight will last very long.

They said the new project would block the access to their fields permanently and also lead to flooding of their land during rains.The protesting farmers initially held a meeting at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Park and later handed over a memorandum to the District Revenue Officer-cum-Competent Authority for the land acquisition, Jaswant Singh.The proposed project includes development of access controlled Ludhiana-Ropar Greenfield Highway starting from Delhi-Katra Expressway (NE-5) near Manewal and terminating on NH-205 at Ropar near Bheora village. A total of Rs 2,792 crore will be spent on the 110-km project. The project, on completion, will reduce travel time between Ludhiana and Chandigarh to less than one hour.

He said in the rally the crucial role of labourers in the fight against the farm laws would be highlighted, and they would be made aware of negative impact of the laws on their lives.Besides issues like oppression of Dalits, mounting debt on labourers, electricity bills, amendments to the labour laws and land distribution would raised, he added.Sewewala feared the farm laws would become a tool to capture the panchyati, saamlat and government land by corporate houses, and end the Land Sealing Act. He stressed this would lead to end of the issue of distribution of the surplus land to labourers and landless.Union leader Harmesh Malri said due to the pro-corporate policies of the government, labourers who were already committing suicides, would further be thrown deep into the crisis.PKMU leader Harbhagwan Singh Moonak alleged the Capt Amarinder Singh government had also failed to fulfil its promise of debt waiver and employment to every house on which it came to power. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-labourers-plan-state-level-rally-in-bathinda-on-march-15-217940
27-02-2021||Rajmeet Singh||Congress to pick OBC leader for post of Punjab party chief?||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 26Amid conflicting reports of the party high command keen on projecting former Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu as the new chief of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC), a behind-the-scene move is in works to project a veteran OBC leader from the state for the coveted party post, it is learnt.Being seen as a move to scuttle rehabilitation of Sidhu in the organisational platform, the logic being given for the move is that it will suit the present caste matrix in the state party unit and will be acceptable to the party high command. At the same time, responsibility for a Dalit leader from Doaba in the organisation is also being discussed.Seniority criteriaGoing by seniority, political acumen and caste matrix, Lal Singh, chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board and a former Finance Minister, could best suit the combination.Cabinet reinductionA Congress leader says there is more keenness to facilitate Navjot Sidhu’s reinduction into the Cabinet as he has already been offered portfolios of choice.Going by seniority, political acumen and caste matrix, Lal Singh, chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board and a former Finance Minister, could best suit the combination. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has been assigning responsibilities to the veteran leader during the last parliamentary elections and during the recently held civic body polls, said a senior party leader.“In the given circumstances, if the PPCC chief is changed, it has to be with the consent of the Chief Minister. There was more keenness to facilitate Sidhu’s re-induction into the Cabinet as he has already been offered portfolios of choice. But he does not want to fall in the previous trap after he left the Cabinet,” said a Congress leader.A proposal in this regard was being pushed by a lobby, including some Cabinet ministers close to the powers-that-be. It could, however, not be confirmed whether the proposal has been discussed with AICC general secretary and Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat, who has been making efforts to bring Sidhu back into mainstream politics. Rawat was not available for a comment.Utterances by Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh, questioning performance of his government, is being seen in the party circles as the reason behind the move to counter the advances of Sidhu and influence Rawat, who had been pushing for an important role for him. Interestingly, Pargat Singh is close to Sidhu and a senior government functionary in the Congress government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-to-pick-obc-leader-for-post-of-punjab-party-chief-217941

The first tranche of this grant — Rs 638 crore — has been received by the state government.5-year revenue deficit grantIn the first year, Rs 7,020.75 crore has been granted to Punjab as a revenue deficit grant by the Finance Commission, which has been approved in-principle by the Centre. In the last Finance Commission report in 2015, Punjab had lost its “debt stressed” tag, thus losing the revenue deficit grant.Other than this, the state has been allowed to go in for additional 2 per cent market borrowings. This translates into an additional borrowing of Rs 12,000 crore allowed to Punjab as part of the Centre’s plan to help the states tide over the financial crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Though this will add to the state’s already unsustainable debt burden, it is definitely going to be a lifeline for the present Congress government, which is often targeted for failing to fulfil the promises made to people ahead of the 2017 Assembly polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/rs-19-000-crore-boost-for-punjab-217943

The administrative judge had, in his speaking order, considered the case fit for reconsideration/ review. But appropriate opportunity was not given to the petitioner and her case was not reconsidered.“The impugned order and the procedure so adopted deserve to be quashed because in spite request by the petitioner, recommendations by the Inspecting Judge, matter returned/ referred by the government for re-consideration, the petitioner was neither given an opportunity of hearing, nor these three facts were brought to the notice of the full court,” the Bench asserted, adding that the impugned order also deserved to be quashed as it suffered from discrimination.The Bench added all three ACRs of the petitioner clearly reflected that she had shown substantial improvement in her work. The HC and other respondents did not place any adverse material, except the fact that she had not achieved the “units” as per norms by disposing of the matters.“The district she was posted in for the first time was a newly created division and the volume of work could not be the only basis much less justified to dispense with her services,” it said. She would be entitled to all benefits, such as continuity in service, seniority, further promotions, arrears of pay and all other service benefits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/decade-on-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-orders-additional-district-judges-reinstatement-217944
