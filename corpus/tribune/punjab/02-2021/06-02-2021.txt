All three parties have announced their candidates. The Congress has dropped some of itstop guns, including former MC vice-president Harinder Singh Kalsi. Naveen Nayyar, sister of former MLA Ashwani Sekhri, has been fielded from Kalsi’s ward, a development, which has created fissures within the party.Notwithstanding the politicking involved while distributing tickets, locals have surely taken a liking to the “unprecedented development initiatives the city is witnessing”.The last MC House was controlled by the BJP whose senior leader Naresh Mahajan remained the president.Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa is the fulcrum around whom all developmental initiatives revolve. The new roads lined with interlocking tiles on both sides and other infrastructure, including construction of three bridges over Hansli drain, have come up after decades of agonising wait.Another factor that is sure to go in favour of the Congress is that the ruling dispensation in Chandigarh is being controlled by the same party. In 2017, barely months after the party was elected to power, the Congress had swept the MC poll of Patiala, Amritsar and Jalandhar with a majority. So much so, the party won a staggering 59 of 60 seats in Patiala. In 2018, the Congress again decimated its rivals by winning 62 of the 95 wards in the Ludhiana MC poll.“You sow what you reap. When the SAD-BJP combine was in power from 2007 to 2017, it swept aside all civic body polls. Now it is payback time. These things are normal in politics and nothing much should be read in them,” said a former MLA.Observers claim that with the party ticking all boxes on the development front and with a favourable dispensation at the top, it will be a tough road ahead for the SAD and the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/in-batala-cong-seeks-to-ride-development-wave-208468

Manpreet, who hails from Teja Khurd village in Gurdaspur, had been living in the rented house on the Loharaka road for the past three months claiming to be a farmer. According to his neighbours, he kept to himself.The house is owned by Mahesh Sharma, who claimed he had submitted the rent deed and other documents to the Sadar police station for further verification. The NIA team also questioned him and the property dealer who brokered the deal.As per information, when the NIA team raided the house yesterday, Manpreet did not open the gates and flushed “something” into the toilet. Following this, the sewerage was dug up inside the house. The NIA suspected he might have flushed narcotics to destroy evidence.Manpreet was reported to be close to drug peddlers Cheetah and Shera, who was arrested in connection with the Hizbul Mujahideen narco-terror module busted by the Amritsar City police in April 2020 following the arrest of over-ground worker Hilal Ahmad Shergojri of the banned terrorist organisation.Hilal, an accomplice of Riyaz Ahmed Naikoo who was gunned down by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, had come to collect funds for nefarious activities in the Valley. The city police had recovered Rs 29 lakh along with a truck from his possession at that time.

Ironically, the move comes after the roll numbers had already been issued to the detained students by the Baba Farid University of Health Science (BFUHS).Authorities should be sympatheticIn the wake of the Covid pandemic, the authorities should be more sympathetic towards students, especially with regard to shortage of attendance. — GMC studentExperts said the students would now face a backlog of six months. It was learnt that one of the subjects that the students were detained for was anatomy — taught by the GMC Principal.One of the students said: “In the wake of the Covid pandemic, the authorities should be more sympathetic towards students, especially with regard to shortage of attendance.” Principal Dr Rajan Singla said the students were detained only after they had been given a chance to improve their attendance.“We held extra classes for them to make up for the shortage of lectures. But they didn’t avail themselves of the opportunity. In addition, they had been given 5 per cent lectures, but still were short on lectures,” he said. To avoid a backlog, the students might get another chance after 40 days of declaration of results, given they improved their lectures and met the attendance criterion, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/gmc-patiala-detains-24-over-poor-attendance-208460

He appealed to the people of the state to stay united against mischievous elements.Attempts being made to alienate stateEfforts are underway to make Punjab a disturbed state and alienate it. I appeal to the people of the state to stay united against mischievous elements. Sunil Jakhar, PPCC presidentSlamming the statement of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in the Rajya Sabha today, Jakhar said the Contract Farming Act 2013 was brought out by the Akali-BJP government. He said this was the first such law that had the provision of penalising the farmers opting out of the contract and due to stiff protest, this law was not implemented.He accused the Union government of putting the food security of the nation at stake just to please foreign companies. He saidthe prices of wheat would rise exponentially if the food security of the country was compromised.Calling the BJP’s “Tiranga yatra” a ‘danga yatra’, he said the Centre was simply inciting people in the name of this yatra. “Those who are organisng the yatra hardly have any names to recall from within the party other than those of Veer Savarkar or Deen Dyal Upadhaya who gave their lives for the nation.

At a recently held all-party meeting, a resolution sought immediate withdrawal of the farm laws and the statutory MSP. The meeting also adopted a resolution to condemn “sponsored” violence in Delhi, calling for a judicial probe into laxity/complexity of those responsible for law and order at the Red Fort.At least three Punjab government officials have been camping in Delhi to provide inputs to the state government on the farmers’ stir.

Notably, 66-year-old Gurjant Singh, who had been going to the farmers’ agitation at the Jeeda toll plaza in Bathinda, had caught pneumonia and died on January 28.Talking to The Tribune, Inderjit Singh, son of the deceased, said, “Today was his bhog ceremony but no one from farm unions or the Khet Mazdoor Union came to mourn his death. While his death has left us in despair, what’s more disappointing is the complete ignorance by unions which otherwise have put forward demands of compensation with the administration,” Singh, who used to work as peon at a private academic institute in Bathinda, said.Jora Singh Nasrali, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union state president, said, “I got a phone call from the son of the deceased today but before that, the matter was not in my knowledge.

We are doing this to substantiate our case in the court.”The lawyers have also appealed to the public to provide them the video clips of the tractor parade if they have any. Verka alleged the unfortunate incident at the Red Fort was the result of politcial conspiracy. Later on, protesters were randomly picked up and implicated in criminal cases.“The fact is 95 per cent of tractor parade passed off peacefully. However, to cover up their incompetency in handling the ruckus created in and around the Red Fort area, over 120 protesters were booked in various police stations and later sent to the Tihar jail. On January 27, the police commissioner himself admitted that 19 protesters were arrested and 59 others detained. This implied that the illegal detention of protesters was in his knowledge,” he said.“Ironically, those who went to Delhi police stations to enquire about their missing relatives were also detained and booked for no valid reasons. Their families were also not informed within 24-hour span, which was against the violation of Supreme Court guidelines,” the PHRO lawyer further said.Meanwhile, the lawyers under the banner of All-India Legal Fraternity for Farmers have decided to organise a dharna at the Delhi Police headquarters on February 8, contesting the arbitrary action of the Delhi police against the protesters and journalists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/lawyers-collect-proof-of-r-day-violence-208452

Growers want MSP for kinnowBabber showed concern that in spite of the low price, more than 65 per cent orchards were yet to be sold and the crop had already ripened.Tajinder Singh, Deputy Director (Horticulture), said the reason for the low price was bumper crop of Nagpur orange, which dissuaded traders from entering the market in Fazilka district.“Farmers feel that the kinnow mandi in Abohar is proving to be a bane for them as traders and exporters do not go to the orchards and buy the produce from the mandi at cheaper rates,” Babber said.According to the information gathered by The Tribune, bumper kinnow crop is another reason for low price as the yield of 150-200 quintals of kinnow per acre has been recorded. As per a report sent by the Horticulture Department to the state government, Covid pandemic is another reason for the dismal disposal of the fruit.“Kinnow was sold for Rs 10 per kg even a decade ago but surprisingly the price has come down, leaving farmers upset. If the situation remains the same, farmers would not be able to realise the input cost and may have to uproot the orchards,” said Ajay Wadhwa, a horticulturist of Diwan Khbera village who has cultivated kinnow in 48 acres.“If the government wants to boost diversification, it has to include kinnow to the list of MSP,” said another traditional grower Vijay Setia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/kinnow-price-drop-raises-worries-of-fazilka-growers-208454

The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online. It's crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all," it tweeted.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for over 70 days, demanding a complete repeal of three central farm laws.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the farmer unions protesting the farm laws, on Friday said there would be no 'chakka jam' in Delhi on February 6 even as it asserted that peasants in other parts of the country will block national and state highways for three hours but in a peaceful way.The SKM had earlier this week announced this nationwide chakka jam on Saturday, saying that farmers would block national and state highways for three hours in protest against the Internet ban in areas near their agitation sites, harassment allegedly meted out to them by authorities, and other issues.Multiple rounds of talks between the Government and the farmer unions have remained deadlocked. The protests at the Delhi borders for repeal of the three contentious agri laws that was enacted in September last began on November 28.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said any protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse."The Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector. These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming," the MEA said in a statement on Wednesday.In a strong response to the remarks made by foreign individuals and entities, the MEA on Wednesday said the "temptation" of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments is "neither accurate nor responsible".
