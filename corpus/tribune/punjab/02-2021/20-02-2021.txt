20-02-2021||Peshawar||Pakistan: KPK government to restore 19th century Sikh gurdwara||The provincial government in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has taken custody of a 19 century gurdwara built during the reign of Sikh ruler Hari Singh Nalwa, to renovate and open it for devotees.Presently, the Sikh gurdwara in Mansehra district is closed and acts as a makeshift library, officials said.The provincial Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department has recommended the local government to take up the restoration proposal with the Evacuee Property Trust Board (EPTB) in Lahore.The EPTB is a statutory board that manages religious properties and shrines of Hindus and Sikhs who had migrated to India following the partition.Hari Singh Nalwa (1791–1837) was the commander of the Sikh Empire. He is remembered for the battles in Kasur, Sialkot, Attock, Multan, Kashmir, Peshawar and Jamrud. Over 56 buildings, including forts, towers, gurdwaras and tanks, are said to be built under his direct supervision.

Describing it as impermissible, the High Court asked the police chiefs of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to prepare and circulate within three months SOPs for probing such cases.“There cannot be any charity or laxity by the banks at the expense of tax payers or investors. It is common experience that banks do not generally waive even a single penny, not to speak of any part of principal or interest, to an honest borrower who makes re-payment as per re-payment schedule, but waive substantial amounts under ‘one time settlement’ or ‘compromise’ in lok adalats in favour of the defaulters,” Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi asserted.The Bench also directed Chief Secretaries of the two states and UT to examine the matter as a substantial number of bank frauds involved execution of mortgage deeds on the basis of forged revenue record or omission/deletion of relevant entries regarding earlier encumbrances.Directions were also issued to the Chief Judicial Magistrates to monitor investigation in bank fraud cases where it was pending for more than a year before passing appropriate orders for proper probe. Such cases were to be tried by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate as far as possible, Justice Tyagi ruled.Punjab, Haryana and UT District and Sessions Judges were further directed to ensure subordinate judicial officers complied with statutory provisions, fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence and constitutional morality.Referring to affidavits by Punjab, Haryana and UT Directors-General of Police, Justice Tyagi observed the documents showed delay in bank fraud probe.

He said this action clearly demonstrated the ‘anti-minority’ stance of the Modi Government.

This is because the Punjab Government had increased reservation for women in urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions from the existing 33 per cent to 50 per cent.Due to this, 25 wards had been reserved for women in the Bathinda civic poll. Former councillors and famous political leaders of various political parties, who themselves wanted to contest the poll, were forced to field their women relatives for the election.Of the 25 women councillors, only three — Santosh Mahant and Kamlesh Mehra of the Congress and Sherry Goyal of the SAD — have been active in politics while the remaining 23 are first-timers. Kamlesh Mehra and Sherry Goyal have won for the second time from ward Nos. 49 and 7, respectively, while Santosh Mahant won for the third time from ward No. 21.In most of the wards, women fought the elections as mere dummies as their election campaigns were managed by the male members of their families.Even in the election publicity material, the pictures of their husbands or other male relatives could be seen in almost every ward.The husband of one such woman councillor said the reservation was not by choice but was forced on them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/23-women-first-timers-in-bathinda-mc-214828

Owing to the rise in the number of cases, the state health department has directed the civil surgeons to ramp up testing in government schools.Dr Rajesh Bhasker, state nodal officer, said, “In Ludhiana, one school reported 42 cases. Some clusters of positive cases were reported from Patiala too. We have already scaled up testing and directed the civil surgeons to test school staff regularly.”As per the sources, practices of wearing of face masks, regular handwashing and maintaining social distancing were being flouted by students and staff. In Patiala, staff members in many schools were seen without masks. Some close contacts of Covid-positive patients continue to hide the information and keep coming to school, thereby, posing risk of spreading the infection. The education department officials said they had asked the school heads to inform them about students and staff members showing Covid symptoms, so that they could be isolated.Harinder Kaur, District Education Officer, Patiala said, “Not only the teaching cadre, but also the non-teaching staff is being tested. We have been shutting schools, where positive cases are being reported, as a precautionary measure.”Virkam Dev, a school teacher, said, “We should refrain from blaming teachers or students for not following the guidelines. The government should make efforts to spread awareness because we have already reached the stage of community spread.”The Tribune found that in the absence of any vigil or issuing of challans by the authorities, people don’t wear masks in public places, including wedding ceremonies.

All such practices are required to be condemned,” Justice Kshetarpal said, while hearing three petitions filed against the Union of India and other respondents. The issue before Justice Kshetarpal was whether the High Court should entertain writ petitions against orders passed under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, by the Punjab State Dispute Redressal Commission, particularly when statutory remedy of appeal was available before the National Consumer Dispute Resolution Commission (NCDR). Section 27 lays down the penalties, including imprisonment.For PGI fundThe cost shall be deposited in the ‘Poor Patients Welfare Fund’ of the PGIMER, Chandigarh. — Justice Anil Kshetarpal, High CourtJustice Kshetarpal said the petitioners filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court, but filed a writ petition in the High Court before its listing. The petitioners gave an undertaking to withdraw the petition filed before the Supreme Court.Justice Kshetarpal observed the court after considering the submissions of the petitioners’ counsel found no substance therein. Referring to a judgment by a coordinate Bench, Justice Kshetarpal asserted it has already held that entertaining a writ petition would not be appropriate for the High Court in view of the statutory remedy of appeal. Justice Kshetarpal said the court, in any case, did not find that the proceedings before the State Commission were without jurisdiction. It had the power to proceed under Section 27, if the order passed in the complaint has not been complied with. As such, the proceedings before the State Commission could not be said to be “wholly without jurisdiction”.Justice Kshetarpal said the NCDRC would decide holistically the plea sought to be taken in the writ petitions. Disposing of the writ petitions, Justice Kshetarpal relegated the petitioners to the alternative remedy available before the NCDRC. “The writ petitioner(s) in all three writ petitions are burdened with a cost of Rs 2 lakh to desist such attempts,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/hc-slaps-rs-2-lakh-costs-in-forum-shopping-case-214841

TNSHe said farmers from Haryana and Punjab would reach the Singhu and Tikri border only on a rotating basis as the harvesting of rabi crop was around the corner.Asked whether mahapanchayats in the state would be stopped forthwith or those already announced would be held as per schedule, Charuni said if an event had already been announced, the organisers could go ahead with the plan. “But there would be no more such rallies,” said the farmer leader.Rattan Mann, state president of the BKU headed by the Tikait brothers, however, said farmers’ bodies were getting huge response in mahapanchayats and there was no question of discontinuing these events.“BKU leader Rakesh Tikait is to address a mahapanchayat at Kharkhoda in Sonepat on February 22. Another such event was announced today at Yamunanagar for February 28,” said Mann. He said mahapanchayats had provided a new lease of life to the farmers’ agitation and there was no question of discontinuing these events.Farmers in the Jat heartland of Haryana had started holding mahapanchayats after Rakesh Tikait’s emotional outburst at Ghazipur in the aftermath of the January 26 tractor parade. Meanwhile, some political observers are viewing Charuni’s announcement as a counter move to stop Tikait’s growing popularity among farmers in Haryana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-more-mahapanchayats-in-haryana-punjab-charuni-214877

There are households which do not own property other than in the areas within the lal lakir and are thus at a disadvantage when it comes to monetising or realising the real value of the property.Under the mission, the right of record of properties within the lal lakir in the villages of the state will be prepared with the cooperation of the Government of India under the SVAMITVA Scheme. This will enable mapping the land, households, habitation and all other areas falling within the lal lakir.The SVAMITVA Scheme was handled by the Rural Development and Panchayats Department, but on the directives of the CM, it will now be transferred to the Revenue and Rehabilitation Department.In another significant decision, the Cabinet gave approval to ‘The Punjab (Welfare and Settlement of Landless, Marginal and Small Occupant Farmers) Allotment of State Government Land Rules, 2021’ in order to make allotment of encroached lands to unauthorised small and marginal farmers on the basis of a rational criteria by sale of land at a predetermined price. This will ensure a fair balance for the occupants who have been in possession since long, and for the government to get its due revenue in respect of the unauthorised occupation and also settle long-pending litigation.The new rules will provide a mechanism for the receipt and process of the applications to be received under the Act. The eligible person under the Act will apply to the allotment commissioner, who will issue an allotment letter after seeking a report from the patwari with due diligence. The allotment letter will be issued on the payment of 25 per cent of the total allotment price and the rest of the 75 per cent payment will have to be paid in lumpsum or in six equated instalments.In case of default in payment of 25 per cent of the allotment price, the letter will not be issued and the allotment will be revoked. In case of default in payment of the instalments as per the allotment letter, the payment will be allowed to be made along with 6 per cent interest on delayed payment within three months of the final payment due. After the payment of the entire sum, the deed will be registered in the name of the farmer.The Cabinet also approved the administrative report of the Industries and Commerce Department for the year 2017-18.Promotional quota for clerical staffConceding a long-pending demand of the clerical cadre of the School Education Department, the Cabinet agreed to amend rules providing 1% promotional quota to clerical staffBill to set up Amity varsity in MohaliThe state government has said it would table a Bill in the Budget session to establish private self-financed Amity University, which is set to become functional at IT City, Mohali, from this yearPolicy to facilitate news web channelsConsidering the emergence of social media as a powerful medium, the Cabinet cleared the news web channel policy to allow empanelment of news web channels and issue advertisements to theseSpeedy clearance to new industrial projectsThe Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion Act, 2016, will be amended for incorporating provisions for automated deemed approval of regulatory clearances to facilitate industrial projects.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cabinet-nod-to-mission-lal-lakir-in-all-villages-of-punjab-214820

The decision was taken on Friday by the Cabinet led by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.The Council of Ministers approved ‘The Indian Partnership (Punjab Amendment) Bill, 2021’ for the revision of fee for various services as contained in Schedule-1 under Section 71 of the Act, such as registration of firms, updation of records, inspection and copying.A spokesperson of the Chief Minister’s Office said the prescribed fee structure for various services as currently contained in Schedule-1 of the act is too meagre and has become irrelevant with the passage of time, as the existing fee structure has not been revised since the Act came into force in 1932.Under the revised structure, Rs 5,000 would now be charged for making a statement under Section 58 for application registration as against Rs 3 charged earlier.Instead of the existing Rs 1, the revised structure provides for charging Rs 500 each for making a statement under Section 60 for recording of alternations in firm name and principal place of business, for intimation under Section 61 for noting of closing and opening of branches, for intimation under Section 62 for changes in names and addresses of partners, notice under Sections 63 (1) & 63 (2) for recording of changes in and dissolution of a firm, recording of withdrawal of a minor besides application under section 64 for rectification of mistakes respectively, said the spokesperson.Further, Rs 100 each in place of earlier fee of 50 paise would be now charged for inspection of one volume of the register of firms under sub-section (1) of Section 66, for inspection of all documents related to one firm under sub-section (2) of Section 66 regarding inspection of register and filed documents and Rs 20 against previous fee of 25 paise for each 100 words or part thereof regarding copies from the register of firms under section 67 for the purpose of grant of copies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/approval-to-revision-of-fee-for-services-to-firms-in-punjab-214824

Dismissing both applications of the former DGP, the court observed that in the entirety of the afore stated circumstances, the counsels for Saini failed to draw any corroboration to their contentions regarding supplying of copies of the report and file inspection in circumstances where Saini is yet to put in his appearance in court.Saini was summoned to appear before the CJM court on February 18 and he had filed an application for exemption from personal appearance. The court dismissed that application also and issued summons against him for March 26. Saini’s application for anticipatory bail in this case is pending in the court of District and Sessions Court for February 23 for reply and arguments. He had sought the court to adjourn the case beyond February 23.Regarding the dismissal of Saini’s application for exemption from personal appearance, the court observed that summons to Saini were not served as yet and these were affixed on the main gate of his house.

Once the control of the land is entrusted to the state, it will take appropriate steps to move the Sikh residents from the area and relocate them somewhere else in the city.“The Harijan Colony, which is also known as Panjabi Lane, is an extremely congested place located right at the heart of Shillong. It is also unhygienic and dirty. The residents need not fear. There is no question of using force to evict them. They will be relocated in a hygienic area,” Chyne, chief of the KHADC, told The Tribune over the phone from Shillong.The high-level committee, headed by Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong, would call a meeting and give approval to the proposed MoU following which the parties involved will sign it, Chyne said. Land laws prevailing in Meghalaya did not give the state government or Shillong Municipal Board jurisdiction over Harijan Colony. This will change if the land is leased to the government.Gurjit Singh, chief of the Harijan Colony Panchayat Committee, alleged the state was putting pressure on the incumbent Syiem for handing over tribal land to the government. Gurjit Singh said the plot was given to their ancestors in 1853. “We have evidence to prove that the then Syiem of Mylliem gave the plot to our ancestors who came with British troops as sweepers,” Gurjit Singh said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/shillong-sikhs-oppose-move-to-relocate-them-214840

With assistance pouring in from abroad, scales tilted in such a manner that students quit private schools to get enrolled at one of the most sought after institute in the area.Alphabets, numerics and solar system dot beautifully painted walls and ceilings of the school.

Students couldn’t attend classes during monsoon. NRIs completely transformed the school. The new structure was raised and vitrified tiles were used for flooring. From 30 kids, we now have 75 students enrolled in the school. Even students from private schools prefer this institute. NRIs pooled in around Rs 40 lakh to give students a decent place to study.”He said, “Family of Surjit and Sarabjit Singh took the initiative and raised the ground-level of the school by donating around Rs 30 lakh.
