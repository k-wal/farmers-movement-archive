In Haryana CFR is 1.1 per cent, Himachal Pradesh J&K and Chandigarh 1.6 per cent each.Punjab has been continuously figuring on top for the past more than four months. The health officials say that it is because the number of cases had witnessed a sudden dip in January.But independent experts say the number of high deaths is because of high prevalence of co-morbidities. ‚ÄúPunjab has the highest number of patients with co-morbidities. It is a well established fact that Punjab has the highest number of patients suffering with communicable diseases.

However, due to an oversight, the policy had only included war-time gallantry awards and had left out peace-time awards even if those happened to be higher in precedence.Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra and Vir Chakra are classified as war-time medals and are awarded for gallantry in the face of the enemy while Ashok Chakra, Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra are peace-time medals for acts of courage other than in the face of the enemy. The policy was finally rectified in 2017 but the authorities concerned had interpreted the amendment to mean that family members of only those personnel would be eligible who were awarded after 2017 whereas the original policy of year 2000 did not contain any such cut-off date.The rectification of the anomaly remained pending with the government since 2017. In December 2020, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed the government to take appropriate measures and introduce clarity in the policy within a period of three months.The fresh policy issued this week now includes all ‚ÄòChakra‚Äô series awards in its ambit without any cut-off provision as to the date of the award.

One of his bestselling albums is ‚ÄòHusna De Malko‚Äô (1991) that has sold 5.1 million copies worldwide and counting. He also acted in Punjabi films like ‚ÄòPolice in Pollywood‚Äô and ‚ÄòJagga Daku‚Äô.A melodious singer, Sikander was a humble soul. He revered his guru Charanjit Ahuja. ‚ÄúHappiest Birthday to the Maker of Sardool Sikander Mere Ustad ‚Äî Janaab Charanjit Ahuja sahab (your birth day is the biggest blessing of my entire life)‚Äù was one of his last social media posts.Famous folk singer Pammi Bai, who also got trained under Ahuja, calls Sikander‚Äôs demise unfortunate and untimely. ‚ÄúHe was a multitalented singer; his loss leaves a big void in the music world.‚Äù Bai shares how Sikander and his two brothers would go to do kirtan on one bicycle. ‚ÄúSardool would ride the bike, one brother would sit on the cross bar, another behind him and between them they would carry harmonium and tabla ‚Äì all on one cycle. And that he was to be such a hit, speaks volumes about his ability.‚Äù Bai recalls Sikander as a jovial man with characteristic ‚Äòmeethe mazak‚Äô, ‚ÄúOnce we were sitting at Jalandhar Doordarshan studio and a singer sang out of tune, when I exclaimed, ‚Äòwhat was it‚Äô, he goes, ‚ÄúInha de suran naal matbhed ne‚Äô, he was kind, compassionate and outright funny.‚ÄùSikander was married to actor-singer Amar Noorie. He is survived by his wife and sons - Sarang Sikander and Alaap Sikander ‚Äì both of them are carrying forward their musical lineage. His musical legacy would survive in music lovers across generations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sardool-sikander-a-humble-singer-whose-legacy-will-live-forever-217009

Dasuya SDM Randeep Singh Heer said the loan waiver was applied twice by Jagtar Singh and his son Kirpal Singh but it was not waived as the concession was only for those having less than 5 acres of land. He said Jagtar Singh in 2018 transferred one-acre each to his sons. They then applied for the loan waiver again, but since at the time of taking the loan, Jagtar Singh had seven acres of land and Kirpal had none, so the applications were not approved again. ‚Äî OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/loan-of-dasuya-farmer-son-duo-was-not-waived-sdm-217011
