Now fearing their arrest on February 9 when they have to appear before the court here, both police officers want to avail the benefit of anticipatory bail.Alleging he has been implicated in the present case, earlier on January 29, Saini had moved an application in the court of Judicial Magistrate here for the inspection of the case which the court had rejected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/behbal-kalan-firing-case-ex-dgp-saini-former-ig-umranangal-move-court-for-anticipatory-bail-207961

SFJ was outlawed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in July last year.Pannun has since been sending phone-recorded messages, mainly from California, to officials, politicians and the civil society. Congress and Akali Dal leaders from Punjab have called him a paper tiger and point out that the call for a referendum flopped so badly that it had to be “postponed”.However, the MEA did not answer whether India had sought extradition of alleged Khalistani terrorists from Canada and the US where demonstration before Indian embassies and consulates have been aggressive and intimidatory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/legal-request-issued-to-us-against-sikhs-for-justice-mea-207956

If it is not possible then the medical colleges/universities can select the external examiners from a different university in the state. These external examiners have to be physically present at the venue of the examination.In case of states having all medical colleges under the same university, the State Health University, medical colleges may engage external examiners from any other college under the State Health University. Such external examiners should be physically present during the examination, reads the advisory, sent by NMC secretary Dr RK Vats.Earlier, the NMC had received the representations from medical universities across the country, wherein the universities had expressed  difficulty in getting external examiners for conduct of exams due to restriction in travel imposed due to the pandemic situation. The representations had sought relaxation in the existing norms for conducting the exams regarding the appointment of external examiners.Earlier, the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences in Punjab  avoided involving internal examiners as they were often biased in evaluating the answersheets of their students. It is alleged that  to get the favour of internal evaluators, some PG students run after them and even offer them gifts. Sources say sometimes teachers who are annoyed with students over something deliberately fail them in the final examination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nmc-eases-norms-on-selection-of-external-examiners-for-mbbs-exams-207918

Stating this today, Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said the bank had launched a loan restructuring scheme for the defaulters who could not pay their instalments in the past few years because of their distressed financial position.  He further said a provision had been made under the scheme that if a borrower paid 20% of his outstanding amount at the time of restructuring, the entire penal interest outstanding in his account would be waived. Moreover, the borrower would be eligible for a subsequent loan if he regularly paid 1/3rd of the restructured loan amount. Randhawa further said the bank had also decided to provide a six-month moratorium to standard loan accounts on unpaid loan instalments due for repayment during the peak of disruptions caused by Covid-19 pandemic i.e. March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. This would provide a relief to the borrowers who could not pay their instalments in this period and these would be deferred by six months in such a way that the residual tenure of loan account would be shifted, revealed the minister. Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Vikas Garg, said the bank had also extended the ongoing scheme of waiver of penal interest till March 31, 2021. Under the scheme, the entire penal interest outstanding in the borrower’s loan account is waived if he repaid the entire defaulter amount or closes his loan account. This scheme was launched in October 2020 and about 4,000 farmers have benefitted from the scheme and availed a relief of about Rs 1.23 crore. “At present of 89 PADBs, only 30 PADBs are advancing fresh loans to the farmers. After the revision of the bank’s audit classification norms, now the number of such banks which can advance fresh loans will go up to 70, enabling more farmers to avail financial assistance from the PADBs,” said the Registrar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/agricultural-bank-launches-loan-recast-scheme-207631

Such priority list would be prepared department-wise and it would not be deviated from. The payments would be released only in accordance with the instructions issued in this regard.The Chief Secretary would ensure circulation of the order to all departments, local bodies or instrumentalities of the state for following the directions in letter and spirit.As and when a representation or notice was received from a contractor or supplier for release of the undisputed amount, the authority concerned would be bound to inform him of the priority number within 10 days.Justice Kshetarpal asserted a large number of writ petitions were filed in the High Court claiming non-release of payments to the contractors for quite a while. At one stage, the state government admitted financial crunch in the state.“It appears the situation still continues. No doubt, the state or its instrumentalities have no discretion to not pay the contractors or suppliers after their work or supplies have been completed,” he said, stressing normally the courts were reluctant to interfere in the state’s financial matters.

Trashing AAP’s claim of the video being doctored, he said, “How can one believe them after their continued theatrics over the farm laws and the farmers’ agitation, including their walk-out from yesterday’s meeting?Citing the alleged presence of AAP Punjab member Amrik Micky at the Red Fort during the violence of January 26, the Chief Minister said there was no doubt now that the party was hand in glove with the BJP in the conspiracy to destabilise and sabotage the farmers’ peaceful agitation.“What have they done to help or support the farmers all these months?” Capt Amarinder asked, adding that the string of AAP actions in recent weeks clearly proved that their sympathies were not with the farmers but with the BJP and their crony capitalists. “Why else did the Kejriwal government in Delhi notify the implementation of one of the black farm laws in November last? Why else have they allowed the national capital’s roads to be dug up and the farmers’ protest sites barricaded like fortresses, instead of exercising their powers since the control of the city roads lies with the Delhi Government and not with the Centre?” asked the Chief Minister.“It is ridiculous that a party which cannot stop its own property from being taken over in this shocking manner, in a state where it is in power, should walk out from a pro-farmer meeting in Punjab demanding that our police should go to their state, against all rules and laws,” Capt Amarinder said.The Chief Minister also took a dig at Kejriwal for taking more than a week to release the list of farmers thrown into the Tihar jail.Video doctored, delete it: KejriwalReacting to a video being shared by CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s media adviser stating that the Delhi CM supports the central farm laws, AAP national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said the party would take legal action in this regard. “This is a doctored video… If Captain Amarinder does not withdraw this video immediately and apologise, I will take legal action against him,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-actions-not-pro-farmer-cm-207636

Describing his achievement, he said, “Never give up. Just strive for the mark set before you. Even after three unsuccessful attempts, I didn’t lose hope and cleared in the fourth attempt.”Coming from a humble background, he got his initial education in Tarn Taran, completed his LLB and LLM from GNDU and became a member of the Tarn Taran Bar Association.

During my stint as a public prosecutor, I felt dejected after observing the tedious legal implications due to which justice would not be delivered or get delayed many times.

Ultimately, I was successful in achieving my goal,” he said.His proud father, Waryam Chand, a painter, could not ask for more as his son would occupy a judge’s chair now.Hailing from Mohalla Guru Ka Khu, Waryam runs a painting shop opposite the old Tarn Taran judicial complex.
