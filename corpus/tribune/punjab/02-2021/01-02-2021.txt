01-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab okays excise policy for next fiscal, plans to mop up over Rs 7,000 cr||The Punjab Cabinet on Monday approved the state excise policy for 2021-22 with a projected target to mop up Rs 7,002 crore as against the current year's expected revenue of Rs 5,794 crore, showing an increase of 20 per cent, an official said here.The excise policy has been largely focused on providing relief to retail licensees and to keep buoyancy in liquor trade, a spokesperson of the Chief Minister's Office said in a statement here.The policy aimed at the renewal of the existing vends, subject to lifting of additional liquor by the licensees, ensuring a minimum growth 12 per cent in revenue during 2020-21, he said.The revenue of the current year is expected to be Rs 5,794 crore as against Rs 5,027 crore of 2019-20, showing an increase of 15 per cent, he said.The spokesperson said the Excise Department during 2020-21 is slated to garner around Rs 300 crore over and above the budgeted target of Rs 5,578 crore."If successful, the government would be able to jump from Rs 5,073 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 7,002 crore in 2021-22, an increase of whopping 40 per cent in two years," he said.The Excise Department proposes to collect the additional revenue by increasing the quota (minimum quantity to be sold by a licensee) of Punjab medium liquor by 12 per cent, Indian-made foreign liquor ( IMFL) by 6 per cent and beer by four per cent over last year, respectively.The department has proposed to impose a quota for foreign liquor in municipal corporation areas and 'A' class municipalities, he said.The excise policy has been formulated specially to give relief to those sections of society which are affected negatively due to COVID-19, he said.The annual fixed licence fee for bars in hotels and restaurants has been slashed by around 30 per cent, he said, adding that the annual licence fee for marriage palaces has also been reduced by 20 per cent.The government has not increased the incidence of taxes on country liquor thereby maintaining the last year liquor prices for the consumers, he said, adding that there will be no increase in the sale price of liquor.The state government has also decided to place a moratorium on setting up of new distilleries, breweries or bottling plants, he said.It decided no new letter of intent (LoIs) will be issued for establishing manufacturing units in the current year. The government has also made it mandatory for the LoIs issued for setting up of a bottling plant to complete their project by March 31, 2023, the spokesperson said.

01-02-2021||London||Scotland Yard celebrates first-ever Sikh female police officer||Scotland Yard on Monday celebrated the 50th anniversary of Karpal Kaur Sandhu joining its ranks as the first South Asian and Sikh female police officer, paving the way for others to follow in her footsteps.Police Constable (PC) Sandhu served the Metropolitan Police in London between 1971 and 1973 and has been dubbed as a “true pioneer” for police forces across the UK.“PC Karpal Kaur Sandhu was a true pioneer and ahead of her time. I have no doubt that her decision to join the Met Police in 1971 was a brave one and she would have faced considerable challenges along the way,” said Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball.“As Britain’s and the Met’s first Asian female officer, Karpal paved the way for so many others who have gone into policing since 1971. Fifty years to the day after PC Sandhu joined the Met, I am pleased that we are able to remember her life, her career and the legacy she has left policing,” she said.The National Sikh Police Association UK joined forces with the Met Police Sikh Association for a special virtual event in memory of PC Sandhu on Monday.“Today, together with representatives from the Met’s Sikh Association, Met police officers and staff and the wider Sikh community, we remember Karpal’s special contribution to policing, as the UK’s first female Asian and Sikh police officer,” said Ravjeet Gupta, Chair of the Metropolitan Police Sikh Association.“Karpal was an invaluable ambassador for the Met who helped break down barriers with London’s communities and will always be remembered for being a trailblazer of her time,” said Gupta.PC Sandhu was born to a Sikh family in Zanzibar, East Africa, in 1943 and came to the UK in 1962, where she got a job as a nurse at Chase Farm Hospital.She joined the Met in 1971 at the age of 27, where she served at Hornsey police station before moving to Leyton in east London.“I’m so proud of my mother, and her legacy as the UK’s first female police officer from an Asian and Sikh background. It’s wonderful that 50 years on she is remembered, and is an inspiration to generations of new female police officers joining the Met,” said Romy Sandhu, Karpal Kaur Sandhu’s daughter.At a time when there would have only been about 700 female officers in the Met, she was both the first female Sikh and female South Asian police officer in the UK.Writing in a report at the time, her Chief Superintendent said that she was “proving invaluable with our dealings with the immigrant population and she is also assisting other divisions in this work and also in teaching police officers Asian dialects”. He added that she was “energetic, intelligent and conscientious” and enjoyed playing hockey and driving.The Met Police said that PC Sandhu passed away in “tragic circumstances” in November 1973 and sadly, the force lost a promising officer who had a bright future.Sandhu, aged 30, was killed in an altercation with her husband, who was reportedly opposed to her career choice and was later sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder in 1974. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/scotland-yard-celebrates-first-ever-sikh-female-police-officer-206449
01-02-2021||Chandigarh||Bar Council stays Punjab Advocate General's removal from HCBA||The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana on Monday stayed the removal of Punjab Advocate General Atul Nanda as a member by the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), terming it "extremely unfair, unjust, harsh, and uncalled for".It also stayed the removal of some other members of the Bar, finding it "in derogation of the HCBA rules".An emergency meeting of the Bar Council discussed at length the HCBA's decision removing Nanda as member through a resolution, and found the action to have been taken "in an arbitrary manner".The meeting was called after the bar association removed as members all lawyers who appeared in court on Monday despite a strike call.Earlier in the day, the association had passed a resolution removing Nanda on grounds that he had "continuously worked against physical opening of the court".In clause 'E' of its resolution, it held that "Atul Nanda, Advocate General, Punjab, has continuously worked against the physical opening of the court and has acted against the interests of the Bar and is dismembered from the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association".The Bar Council, however, held that "the resolution 'E' is ex-facie illegal and passed in violation of the prescribed procedure in the relevant rules of the HCBA and as such the house unanimously resolves to stay the resolution 'E' of the HCBA that is part of resolution number 1988/2021 HCBA dated February 1 with immediate effect".It reiterated unanimously that Nanda's conduct "has always been appreciable and exemplary, especially whenever the interest of advocates is involved".Nanda himself expressed surprise at the "unilateral and arbitrary resolution" of the association, saying "the decision to commence physical hearing rests with the administrative committee of the high court and not with me".He said the courts were closed for physical hearing keeping in the mind the Covid-19 threat, "which is far from over and the world is still battling the crises".He further said he had given consent for physical appearance of the counsel for Punjab. Incidentally, the Supreme Court has also yet not opened for physical hearing.The Bar Council, after elaborate discussion during its meeting, "resolved that on one hand, the council fully supports the resolution regarding opening of physical hearings and strongly stands with the High Court Bar Association on this" but "all the members were of the view that the decision taken by the HCBA, is extremely unfair, unjust, harsh and uncalled for".The Bar Council members further noted that as recently as January 3, Nanda addressed the house consisting of all the Presidents and office bearers of all bar associations of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh at Law Bhawan in Chandigarh, where he had supported the resolution of the house for resumption of physical hearing of cases.The Council also stayed the removal of some other Members, noting that it was "passed in complete derogation of the HCBA rules i.e Rule 10 (d) and Rule 11, as neither the proper notice for the meeting was given nor the minimum  quorum, as required, for such meeting was complete"."The disciplinary action against any member of the Bar cannot be taken without following the drill of relevant rules," the Bar Council resolution noted, adding "a specific agenda with due notice is required to be circulated if  the conduct of a member of the HCBA is to be discussed in the house".Angered over the non-resumption of physical hearing in the High Court that has been snapped since March last owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the HCBA, in an unprecedented decision, also unanimously announced to boycott the court of the Chief Justice and also sought his transfer.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bar-council-stays-punjab-advocate-generals-removal-from-hcba-206446

It buries its head in the sand, and rather than help solve the crisis that the NDA created. What about MSP," Badal asked in a tweet.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at the Delhi borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the new farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops.The Punjab minister claimed that instead of doubling income from agriculture, it will reduce the earnings by half.Badal further said that the budget was “silent” on unemployment.                       “Unemployment figures are skyrocketing due to NDA's pandemic mismanagement,” alleged Badal adding, “But the Budget is silent on this issue, leave alone to tide over the crisis.”He further claimed that the Budget was “silent on the travails of the middle class.”       “Middle classes get nothing except increased costs of petrol and diesel. Hopes of the middle classes of relief after suffering from a once-in-a-century pandemic have been shattered,” he said in another tweet.“Entire north India has been ignored. Why? Because it is not going to the polls! States that are going to polls are given sops. Just like the maximum Padma awardees came from five states going to polls,” Badal claimed.The Punjab FM said the Budget was “silent” on revenue generation.“How will the NDA raise revenue? Should the people expect another surreptitious and clandestine attempt to raise revenue on the sly,” he asked.Badal alleged, “The Budget seeks to sell India's precious assets. One thing is clear. The Union Government wants to sell more and more of government assets.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/union-budget-silent-on-agricultural-unrest-ignores-entire-north-india-manpreet-singh-badal-206411

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Iron bars hooked between barriers, cement poured in to create makeshift wall at Singhu border||Workers under the watch of police personnel on Monday were seen hooking iron rods between two rows of cement barriers on a flank of the main highway at the Singhu border to further restrict the movement of protesters agitating against the new farm laws at the site.Another portion of the highway at the Delhi-Haryana border is practically blocked now as a makeshift cement wall has come up there.A worker drilling rods in cross-formation between two rows of solid barriers said, “The other flank was done yesterday. Cement is to be poured in the space between the barriers on this flank to make a makeshift wall”.The move comes days after the violent clashes between some protesters and police on January 26 during the tractor parade by the agitating farmers.The section of the highway at the Singhu border, which has been the epicentre of the farmers’ protests for over 60 days, had also seen a clash recently between farmers and a group of people who claimed to be local residents.On Monday, the Delhi side of the Singhu border saw a sparse crowd of protesters while the Haryana side was dominated by vociferous speeches denouncing the new farm laws and clarion calls to infuse a new sense of solidarity in the agitation after the Republic Day incident.Security personnel from the paramilitary forces, RAF and CRPF, were seen in relatively less numbers compared to the past few days but a large number of police personnel manned the stretch spanking a mile from the protest site.Besides the makeshift wall on the highway, a small trench was also dug up earlier across an inner street a little off the highway and cement barricades put up on both the sides.The protesting farmers and leaders at a tent, however, showed no signs of being cowed down and asserted that “these barricades put up around us can’t cage our spirit”.All of them alleged that on January 26, “a conspiracy was made to malign this movement” and “defame it”, and more such attempts are being made while asserting that the agitation has “come out stronger” now.Balwinder Singh Sirsa, a farmer leader from Sirsa, Haryana, exhorted people to not get demotivated by what happened during the January 26 incident, as it was “orchestrated by some people to denigrate the movement”.A woman protester from Haryana, addressing a huge gathering from the dais, said the alleged conspiracy on that day has “failed to weaken this movement” and has rather injected “a new lease of life” in it.Randhir Singh, 85, a farmer from Haryana, also addressed the gathering saying “I have worked with legends Mahendra Singh Tikait and I know how Jat movement was weakened few years ago”.“What happened on January 26 was a conspiracy. It was not done by farmers but all was part of a smear campaign bring run to defame the movement,” he alleged.“We are not terrorists or Khalistani. We are fighting for our rights. Attempts are still being made to defame and weaken us. But Tikait’s tears have awakened the farmers of Haryana, UP, and other states,” he said.

They were lodged in Tihar jail.Various organisations, including the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO), have offered to fight legal battle on their behalf.A preliminary list of around 40 persons, hailing from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and UP who were arrested by the police has surfaced, including eight from TootrianWala village (Moga), seven from Bangi Nihal village (Mansa), two each from Hazura-Kapura Colony (Bathinda) and Gandhuan village and Budhlada tehsil (Mansa), one each from Asa Buttar, Gidderbaha, Muktsar and Fazilka, and Tehsil Dharamkot (Moga).“We are trying to know the credentials of those who were detained by the police. We have procured a list of 33 persons. I appeal to those families who are still in dark about the whereabouts of their kin to contact us with their credentials,” DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said.PHRO lawyers Sarbjit Singh Verka and Jagtar Singh Sidhu said their teams were active at Delhi borders enquiring about missing persons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/efforts-on-to-trace-missing-protesters-206095
01-02-2021||---||AAP seeks police protection for farmers, Capt says not possible||Chandigarh, January 31 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab co-in charge Raghav Chadha on Sunday wrote to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, seeking police security for the farmers sitting on the Delhi borders. However, the Chief Minister rejected the request, saying it was “arbitrary, absurd and irrational”.    Chadha, in his letter, stated it was astonishing that the CM had not paid heed to the threat of physical violence and attack from ‘BJP goons’ on the ‘annadatas’. “Our farmer brothers and sisters are at a daily risk of being physically attacked by the BJP goons. They have been exposed to violence for the past few days owing to the BJP’s machinations,” the letter read. Chadha said the AAP asked Capt Amarinder to deploy the Punjab Police personnel in sufficient numbers to surround the protest sites. “This protection to the farmers is absolutely essential in the light of recent attacks on them,” Chadha said. Reacting to the letter, the CM said the AAP had clearly lost all sense of Constitutional and legal propriety. He said as per a Union Home Ministry directive and a Supreme Court order, the Punjab Police couldn’t stay in another state for more than 72 hours even for a protectee, which the farmers are in any case not. “So, this would mean that even if I sign an order today declaring some, if not all, farmers out there as protectees, (which is really neither feasible nor realistic), that would mean the Punjab Police can only be with them for 72 hours and not more.”  Reacting to the CM’s statement, Chadha said: “Deploy the Punjab Police for at least 72 hours. In the meantime, get exemption from the Home Ministry.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/aap-seeks-police-protection-for-farmers-capt-says-not-possible-206098

But in reality, the richness of Punjab farmers is a misconception. The financial position of marginal and small farmers is even worse as they struggle to meet their subsistence consumption requirements. The farm sector laws may further deteriorate the farmers’ income and may pull a majority of the marginal and small farmers towards poverty," says Punjab Agricultural University’s Vice Chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon.“A perception is being created that protests are an effort to protect the MSP and its beneficiaries who are only 6 per cent of the total farmers of the country and largely belong to Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. It is being argued that these farmers are rich who benefit from the MSP and assured procurement and are depriving their poor brethren from other states of the benefits of market efficiency likely to be brought by these laws,” he said further. The question here is that these farmers are so rich that they do not need any price assurance and government support ?According to NABARD Survey of 2016-17, an average farming household in Punjab earns Rs 23,133 and that in Haryana Rs 18,496 per month. The per capita monthly income of these households comes out to be Rs 4,449 and Rs 3,490 only. Is this income sufficient to term these farmers and their dependents rich? asks Rajinder Singh Sidhu, Registrar, PAU.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-farmers-being-rich-a-misconception-pau-vc-206109

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha will also unveil its nationwide programme tomorrow in the wake of the happenings, including arrests, following the January 26 Delhi violence.At the same time, observers are also sensing “hint of differences” among various groups that are now part of the movement. The presence of political leaders at the Ghazipur protest site is also being frowned upon.In today’s ‘mahapanchayat’ in Baghpat, where leaders of several khaps supported the Ghazipur agitation, BKU president Naresh Tikait was not present.Much is also being read in some of his statements in past 24 hours.A day after PM Modi said his government was just a “phone call away” for talks with them, Naresh Tikait said farmers respect the dignity of the Prime Minister and do not want him or the government or Parliament bow down to them.“Prime Minister should ensure that the self-respect of farmers is protected…a middle way should be found…and talks should be held,” Naresh Tikat was also quoted as saying.Calling for a “respectful solution”, the brother of Rakesh Tikait whose tears virtually changed the shape of the agitation, however, also said they will not “agree to anything under pressure”.Tikait said the government should release those arrested after the January 26 Delhi violence and prepare a conducive environment for talks.Speaking to the media at Singhu, representatives of the 32 Punjab unions said they will not make the first move (for talks with the government). “Unions are ready for talks but the message should come from the government; the government should make atmosphere conducive for talks; the three laws should be repealed and a law for MSP formulated,” is what Punjab unions broadly said.While observers are sensing “differences” between various ‘khaps’ in Western UP, the presence of political leaders at Ghazipur is also being viewed as contrary to the collective decision of SKM.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal today met Rakesh Tikait and assured him of all the support in the ongoing farmers’ protest against the three farm laws.Meanwhile, prominent Gujjar leader of western Uttar Pradesh Madan Bhaiyya has extended his community’s support to the BKU and also slammed BJP’s Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gujjar, who has been accused of “inciting and orchestrating violence” at the Ghazipur protest site on January 26, though Nand Kishor has denied the allegations.Prime Minister Modi yesterday said his government’s offer on agri laws made to protesting farmers “still stands” and the Centre was just a “phone call away”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/series-of-mahapanchayats-farmers-agitation-gains-ground-despite-pms-offer-206021

I gave the movement everything. I sat with the crowd for so many months, did everything with them. You didn’t see that,” he said in a Facebook Live he did on Sunday.He claimed he felt “abandoned by everyone”, including Bharatiya Janata Party Member of Parliament Sunny Deol, for whom he campaigned in the 2019 general elections and who has since disassociated himself from Sidhu.See video here“You’ve singled out one person and called him a traitor. Why? Five lakh people---several leaders and singers---at the Red Fort. But you’ve singled one person out,” he said.“Our people hoisted the Nishan Sahib on an empty flagpole at the Red Fort to awaken the government. Nobody took a stand then. If they had, if they’d asked the government to wake up, asked them to give us what is our right, the fortunes of this movement would have been bright,” he said.He also said he’s been on the streets “without food” since, and even went back to Patiala two days ago, where the police tried to “trap him”.“I’m not afraid of arrest," he said. "Even Bihari migrant workers are far better than us Punjabis, who have at least given me shelter and food. I am left alone."Punjabis don’t know how to write history, he said."We only know how to mark death anniversaries," he said.He also accused people of sullying his father’s reputation and threatened to “settle scores” with them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/delhi-violence-ive-been-abandoned-says-deep-sidhu-206012

This is also to disrupt basic supplies like food and water.In a release, SKM said, “Despite multiple attempts of violence by police and government, farmers are still debating on three farm laws and MSP. We regret to share the sad news of the death of one more protester from Maharashtra who took part in the Shahjahanpur struggle today.
