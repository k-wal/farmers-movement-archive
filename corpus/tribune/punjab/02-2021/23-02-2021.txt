Such posters are irrelevant as farmers have been staging a peaceful protest by exercising their constitutional rights....“We will oppose the conspiracy to end the protest with these kinds of threats and warnings,” the SKM said in the statement.In the posters, the police have not given any deadline to the protesting farmers to vacate the area.On its part, the Delhi Police said it is a “routine” process.“The posters were pasted at the border area after the protest started. It is a routine exercise. Police have conveyed to them through posters that they are sitting in the jurisdiction of Haryana and they are not allowed to enter the national capital unlawfully,” a senior police officer said.Thousands of protesters had clashed with the police during a tractor parade called by the agitating farmer unions on January 26.After police permitted the rally, many protesters deviated from the agreed route and reached the Red Fort on tractors. They entered the monument and some of them even hoisted religious flags at the ramparts.The government has projected the three farm laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehensions that these laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has maintained that the MSP and mandi systems will continue and will also be strengthened.

With the Assembly elections are less than a year away, Finance Minister and Bathinda urban MLA Manpreet Singh Badal would not like to annoy anyone and try to placate all sections in the city.It seems that in the elections to the posts, all equation pertaining to caste, the trans-railway line area, women and youth representation will be taken care of. The Congress is planning to strike a balance among experience, new comers and women councillors.Senior councillor Jagroop Singh Gill, who has won for the record seventh time, is a front-runner and the likely candidate for the mayor’s post. Moreover, Gill is respected by all councillors in the party and earlier also, he had headed the Bathinda municipal council twice.With 50 per cent reservation for women members in the MC this time, the party can consider women candidate for the post of senior deputy mayor and may opt senior Congress leader Ashok Pradhan for the post of deputy mayor. If the government reserves the mayor post for woman in Bathinda, councillors Raman Goyal, Parveen Garg and Pawan Mani could be the choice. Even the senior councillor’s master Harmander Singh, Sham Lal Jain and Santosh Mahant can also be considered.

23-02-2021||Saurabh Malik||Basic objective of property regulation Act defeated: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 22Just over five months after the Punjab and Haryana High Court asserted that it was inexplicable how the Punjab Government was allowing unauthorised constructions to be regularised, a Division Bench today asserted the question for the state to consider was repealing the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act (PAPRA).Holding that the basic objective of the Act stood defeated with regularisation policies, the Bench also gave the state counsel the liberty to seek instructions from the Punjab Chief Secretary before assisting the court on the issue.The Bench, during the course of hearing, was told that a policy dated October 18, 2019, allowed regularisation of unauthorised colonies/construction. As the case came up for rehearing, the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh asserted the court was required to be assisted on the issue whether the policy promulgated by state government in 2018, under which a number of persons had taken benefit, was sustainable under the provisions of PAPRA.“In such a situation, a question would arise if such a policy is permitted to be notified from time to time, would it not be advisable to repeal the Act known as the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulation Act, 1995, as the policies defeat its purpose,” the Bench asserted.The Act, among other things, was enacted to regulate colonies and property transactions, and to provide for registration of promoters and estate agents. The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after a petition was filed by Mohinder Pal Singh against the state of Punjab and other respondents for directions the authorities to act in accordance with the provisions of PAPRA and to ensure that illegal colonies were not allowed to come up.The counsel for the petitioner submitted any promoter desiring to develop land into a colony was required to seek prior permission from the competent authority as per of the provisions of the Act. An application was later filed by the applicant/petitioner-in-person to withdraw the writ petition, but the Bench made it clear that the prayer for withdrawal would be considered only after the affidavit was filed by the state counsel.Papra deals with regulating colonies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/basic-objective-of-property-regulation-act-defeated-hc-216249

The daily average of cases in January was between 200 and 250. However, in the past 15 days, the average of cases rises to between 350 and 400. In the last three weeks, besides 153 deaths, a total 5,377 cases have been reported.The main reason behind the surge is lax attitude of people towards social distancing and masks. Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon, Civil Surgeon, Bathinda said, “There has been a slight increase in the cases as compared to the last few weeks. We have been keeping a regular watch and conducting sampling on a routine basis. We also appeal to people to take all precautions to avoid catching the virus.”In Patiala, the big concern is that some schoolteachers have found positive. Civil Surgeon Satinder Singh said they had issued directions to all schools to follow Covid norms.Amritsar has noticed an increase in the number of Covid cases in the past three days. The district has reported 117 cases, 30 per cent of the total 392 reported this month. The increase was first noticed when the authorities reported 35 cases, including a Congress MLA and around 20 members of his extended family. The MLA had returned from Delhi after attending a function of his daughter marriage. The health authorities stated that earlier this month, on an average, 15 cases were reported daily. The mortality rate had also come down.On Monday, the state reported 389 cases, including 15 deaths.

They are “officially” clueless as to who pocketed the profits.With four FIRs and cases against landowners from where illegal sand was missing, the two departments are yet to identify the actual mafia kingpins.Except for names of aged landowners in two of the four FIRs, the police have not identified any big fish who plundered, ferried and sold the illegal sand worth crores.Sources said following pressure from senior cops, an FIR against the same mafia was earlier registered in August and later in October 2020 and the work came to a standstill. “With farmers busy with protests against the farm laws, the mafia, in connivance with local cops, became active in the area again and no one dares to report,” a villager said. He alleged that the Shambhu police was reluctant to act on their complaints. More than half a dozen villages adjoining Ghanaur are witnessing unbridled sand mining. Villages of Rajgarh, Nanhera, Chamaru and Bathonian, apart from a couple of others, are the “hotbed of unlawful mining”.Meanwhile, when asked as to how much financial damage the mining mafia has caused in Ghanaur and Rajpura, Assistant Mining Officer-cum-SDO (Drainage) Raghav Garg said they were yet to calculate the total loss. “We have issued notices to the landowners and will fine them after the notice period is over,” Garg added.Ghanaur DSP Jaswinder Tiwana said efforts to identify the real mafia, was still pending. “I will ask the SHO, Shambhu, to expedite the probe in all illegal mining-related FIRs and identify the accused who made profits or who sold this sand.

Thanking the people of the state for their overwhelming support to the Congress in the recently concluded civic elections, Amarinder Singh said the mandate was a vindication of the pro-people policies of his government.Pointing out that while the Congress won 1,410 of the 2,206 wards (64 per cent), the Chief Minister said that all opposition parties had been decimated because of their "anti-people and vicious negative agendas".He lambasted the earlier Akali-BJP regime for ignoring the development of the urban areas and expressed confidence that the launch of these projects will drive sustainable progress in these regions. The Chief Minister said that he was particularly delighted to lay the foundation stone for the Rs 721 crore surface water supply scheme for Amritsar city, his erstwhile Parliamentary constituency.

23-02-2021||Mansa||Vets protest reduced pay scale in Mansa||The Punjab State Veterinary Officers’ Association (PSVOA) has been holding indefinite protests in Mansa against the reduced salary of newly recruited veterinary officers (doctors).  The state, via notification last month, had reduced the salary of newly recruited veterinary officers from Rs 56,100 to Rs 47,600 per month. The district-level executive committee members of the PSVOA said the Punjab and Haryana High Court had given pay parity to the veterinary officers with that of the medical officers serving in the health department, but by recruiting new officers on reduced salary, the finance department had violated its own regulation of giving 7th Central Pay Commission scales to the employees. “Our employees diligently rendered services during the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic last year. The veterinary officers contribute to the GDP by increasing the milk, meat and egg production. We demand that the letter issued by the finance department should be withdrawn and the pay scales should be fixed according to 7th Central Pay Commission. Otherwise, we will intensify the protest in the coming days,” the members said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/vets-protest-reduced-pay-scale-in-mansa-216242

23-02-2021||Naina Mishra||Crowding, complacency led to surge in Covid, says former PGI Director Dr Talwar||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 22Non-adherence to social distancing norms at marriage functions and complacent attitude of the public towards Covid-19 have contributed to a sudden upsurge in the cases of infection in Punjab, said a former Director of the PGI, Dr KK Talwar, who is also the Health Adviser to the Punjab Government.Recently, some students and teachers also tested positive for coronavirus in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Ludhiana, and other districts. This prompted the health authorities to check for a new strain of the virus.Dr Talwar said the Punjab Government had sent some samples for genome testing to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi, to check for the possibility of another strain of the virus. “We will check whether the new strain, if any, is more infectious to children as many students have tested positive of late in government schools. These children may not be severely symptomatic but can transmit virus to other people.”“Crowding has started in Punjab as so many marriage functions took place this month with social distancing norms going for a toss. This may have contributed to the virus spread as well. We have increased testing in Punjab and contact tracing. We will impose some restrictions to control the spread,” he said.Punjab is among the five states in the country to witness an upsurge in daily Covid cases over the past week, recording a 47.30 per cent jump in 24-hour infections between February 14 and 20.Re-infection unlikely behind increase in infections, says virologist from the PGIRuling out the possibility of re-infection in Punjab, Dr Mini P Singh, Department of Virology, PGI, said, “It is too immature to say that the surge is caused due to a new variant of coronavirus without conducting any molecular analysis. It is unlikely that that the surge is due to re-infection because there are only a few hundred of cases till date. If re-infection was so rampant, why did it not happen in September?”Chandigarh, too, sees surge in casesFrom 131 cases in the week ending February 14, the UT saw 187 cases in the week ending February 21 — an increase of 42%. From 123 cases on February 13, the active caseload rose to 205 on Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/crowding-complacency-led-to-surge-in-covid-says-former-pgi-director-dr-talwar-216143

23-02-2021||Chandigarh||Capt Amarinder to lead Congress in 2022 Punjab polls, says PPCC chief Jakhar||Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar on Monday said Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh would lead the party in the 2022 assembly polls, as the people of the state had reposed their faith in his leadership with their landslide verdict in Congress’ favour in the recent civic polls.While participating in the event for the launch of various developmental projects worth Rs 1,087 crores by the chief minister, under the Smart City and AMRUT schemes, Jakhar said, “The Congress party’s sweeping victory in the civic polls has not only revalidated Capt Amarinder’s leadership in the state but was an endorsement of the faith of Punjabis in his future leadership also.”He said the state Congress had already launched mission “#Captainfor2022”, and the next elections would be fought under his leadership.Lauding the chief minister, Jakhar said Capt Amarinder had led the state in very difficult times and the people were well aware of his massive contribution.“Punjab is perhaps facing its worst ever crisis – COVID-19, farmers’ unrest due to the black farm laws, coupled with an unfriendly Union government – and only Capt Amarinder Singh had the vision and leadership qualities to the steer the state out of it,”  he said. Lambasting the Union government for its step-motherly treatment to Punjab, Jakhar said the Centre had resorted to all kinds of measures, including economic blockade, to punish the state for supporting the farmers’ agitation.He said the federal structure of the country was under extreme threat under the BJP-led Central government. He also questioned the recent decision of the Union government to refuse permission to a ‘jatha’ to go to Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and accused the Centre of being biased against the state.While complimenting the chief minister for launching projects aimed at development of urban areas, Jakhar said there had been a growing though incorrect perception that this government was only working for the rural areas.He said though Punjab is an agrarian economy, the massive development works that have started in the urban areas would dispel this perception.Jakhar also urged the chief minister to ensure that the Congress manifesto for 2022 should promise making Amritsar — the ‘Guru ki Nagri’ — an iconic city.“Amritsar should be made as one of the best cities in the world on the lines of the Vatican,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/capt-amarinder-to-lead-congress-in-2022-punjab-polls-says-ppcc-chief-jakhar-216095
23-02-2021||Chandigarh||AAP to hold ‘Kisan Mahasammelan’ in Punjab’s Moga on March 21||Punjab’s main opposition party AAP on Monday said it would organise a ‘Kisan Mahasammelan’ in Moga district on March 21 in support of the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s contentious agri laws.Party’s national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be invited to attend the event, it said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s border points for nearly three months to press for the repeal of the three agri laws enacted in September last year and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP).“The AAP has decided to hold a ‘Kisan Maha Sammelan’ at Bagha Purana in Moga on March 21 in order to further strengthen the ongoing farmers’ agitation,” party MP Bhagwant Mann said.He said farmers from across Punjab will be invited to participate in the event.“We want Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to take part in this ‘mahasammelan’,” he added.The Aam Aadmi Party has been vocal about its support for the farmers’ agitation. Kejriwal is set to address a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut on February 28 in support of the protest.Mann, flanked by AAP’s Punjab unit in charge Jarnail Singh, co-incharge Raghav Chadha and MLA Harpal Singh Cheema, said the Centre should withdraw the three farm laws and provide a legal guarantee on MSP.The government has said the new farm laws will benefit farmers by freeing them from the clutches of the middlemen and ushering in new technology in the sector.However, farmers say these legislations will remove the safety net of MSP and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.
