It will have an annual intake of 1,500-2,000 students, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-approves-mission-lal-lakir-in-all-villages-214732
19-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||No further ‘exemption’, Centre tells Punjab, Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 19The Centre has asked Punjab and Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers from the coming procurement season and stated that “no further relaxation on this account will be accorded”.Both the state governments have been seeking time for implementation of direct online payment initiative.“The government is regularly pursuing with state governments of Punjab and Haryana for ensuring direct online payment into farmers’ accounts since 2015-16.“However, both the state governments have been routinely approaching the Centre for granting exemption/seeking time for implementation of direct online payment initiative,” said the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs.“The Centre has therefore, directed the State Governments of Punjab and Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers through e-mode from upcoming season and that no further relaxation on this account will be accorded,” said the Ministry.With the decision coming amid the ongoing farmer agitation against the three farm laws, officials said the e-mode predates the legislations and that “the government has no intention to eliminate arthiyas in Punjab and Haryana and no directions have been issued to eliminate arthiyas from the mandi system”.The e-mode of payment will ensure that all value chain participants, including farmers, arhityas, mandis, etc, get their payments directly instead of getting paid through another value chain participant like arhitya paying the farmer. This ensures transparency and benefits all. This is not a replacement of the current APMC system, it said.According to officials, “In Punjab, MSP was paid to the farmers through arthiyas, and in Haryana, FCI made the payment directly to farmer’s bank account through online mode, whereas state agencies made payment of MSP to the farmers partly through arthiya and partly directly to farmer’s account through online mode as per the option given by the farmers in e-Kharid portal.”“Digital mode of financial benefit transfers or payments by government agencies to beneficiaries has been highly successful and appreciated tool of transparency which has been instrumental in eliminating leakages in delivery of benefits. E-mode of payment has already been adopted partially by Haryana and Punjab. For example, a part of payment for this paddy procurement was done through e-mode,” it saidThe Centre has released a record Rs 1,25,217.62 crore so far this year and Rs 2,97,196.52 crore more will be released during this financial year towards food subsidy of which Rs 1,16,653.96 crore has been reflected in the PFMS towards Punjab. In respect of Haryana, the sum amounts to approximately Rs 24,841.56.This apart, procurement through bio-authentication of farmers has also been introduced in Uttar Pradesh, the Ministry said, adding that Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh are also keen to adopt bio-authenticated procurement which will ensure transparency and help in tracking the end-use beneficiary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/no-further-exemption-centre-tells-punjab-haryana-to-ensure-online-payment-to-farmers-214728
19-02-2021||Bathinda||Bathinda MC poll: Congress, AAP votes up; SAD down||The farmers’ issue and the resultant rift with the Bharatiya Janata Party seem to have cost Akalis the civic body elections in Bathinda.The Akalis, who won Bathinda in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, appeared to have ceded ground yet again to Congress, which came back strong in the civic body elections after it lost the seat in 2019 in a closely contested race in the general election.Aam Aadmi Party, which is the principal opposition party in the state legislature after the 2017 elections, appeared to have made some gains these elections, although it still remained a distant third. Congress got 63,633 votes these elections—almost as much as the votes it got for assembly elections in 2017—against SAD’s 37,183 and AAP’s 17,883. For comparison, the Congress got 63,942 votes in 2017, AAP came second with 45,462 and SAD trailed at 37,177. The 2019 election however saw SAD upset Congress’s applecart---SAD polled 63,558 against Congress’s 59,815,   and AAP’s 9,329.These civic body elections also saw Congress and SAD in a direct contest in most wards. AAP gave a tough fight in eight wards—2, 15, 16, 24, 32, 33, 38, and 40—and came second there. Among AAP’s candidates lost in a close battle was Mandeep Kaur Ramgarhia from Ward 33, who lost with the lowest margin.SAD’s former ally BJP meanwhile continued to struggle, coming a distant second in just two wards—35 and 49.Congress candidate Kamlesh Rani beat BJP’s Shama Rani lost by 633 votes in ward 49 and Congress’s Raman Goyal beat BJP’s Seema Arora by 1,134 votes in ward 35.Four wards—12, 21, 29, and 42—saw independents giving a tough fight to the winning candidates.Political experts claim SAD’s perceived dithering in taken a stand over the farmers’ issue may have cost them the elections. Another reason could be SAD’s parting of ways with the BJP over the issue, causing a fall in their votes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bathinda-mc-poll-congress-aap-votes-up-sad-down-214705
19-02-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet approves jobs for kin of 4 minors killed in Maur Mandi bomb blast||The Punjab government has approved special provisions in the rules to provide government jobs to one of the family members or kin of each of the four minors killed in the Maur Mandi bomb blast of January 31, 2017.The decision was taken on Friday by the Council of Ministers at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh.It was decided at the Cabinet meet to grant special provision to provide jobs, on compassionate grounds as per the educational qualifications of one member each of the families of the deceased—Japsimaran Singh 15-year-old son of Khushdeep Singh, Sourav Singla 14-year-old son of Rakesh Kumar, Ankush, 11-year-old son of Gian Chand and Ripandeep Singh, 9-year-old son of Kala Singh.The existing rules did not provide for employment in state service on compassionate grounds for a minor deceased.With the Cabinet decision, the relevant rules or policy have been relaxed to provide jobs to a member each as per their educational qualification in Bathinda district or adjoining districts against direct quota vacant posts as a special case (without treating it as a precedent).The jobs provided by the state government are in addition to the financial grant of Rs. 5 lakh each to the families of each of the deceased persons. The injured have got Rs. 50,000/- each from the Chief Minister’s Relief fund.It may be recalled that seven persons were killed and 13 injured in the bomb blast incident at Maur Mandi in Bathinda district.The state government had earlier provided government jobs to the next of kin of two deceased, namely Harpal Singh, 40-year-old son of Teja Singh and Ashok Kumar 35-year-old son of Babu Ram, as per the existing policy, since both were the breadwinners of their families.In Ashok Kumar’s case, his minor daughter, Bago, an 11-year-old, was also killed, but since one member of the family has already been given a job, Bago has not been included in the special provision approved on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cabinet-approves-jobs-for-kin-of-4-minors-killed-in-maur-mandi-bomb-blast-214697

19-02-2021||Saurabh Malik||One-time settlement period can be extended, says High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 18Ending a legal controversy generated by two conflicting judgments over extending time period to pay the remaining one-time settlement (OTS) amount, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the extension was permissible in case of a deserving and bonafide borrower.The High Court in the case of ‘Anu Bhalla and another versus District Magistrate, Pathankot’ had held that it was permissible for a court to extend the time period for payment of settlement amount in deserving cases. But a Coordinate Bench of the High Court, in “M/s Milkhi Ram Bhagwan Dass versus District Magistrate”, decided on December 23, 2020, had taken a diametrically opposite view to hold that the claim for extension was not maintainable at the hands of the borrower.The Bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu asserted that it did not subscribe to the Milkhi Ram case judgment. The Bench asserted that the judgment placed solitary reliance on an Allahabad High Court verdict. This, the Bench asserted, could not be treated as a correct position of law to completely foreclose a borrower’s rights.The Bench added the Allahabad High Court judgment could not be interpreted to lay down an absolute principle of law that extension was impermissible beyond the last date of OTS, as was sought to be culled out in Milkhi Ram’s judgment.The Bench added: “Rather the principle, which can be culled out from the judgment, is that multiple extensions cannot be granted to a borrower to make the payment of OTS amount, which was one of the observations in Anu Bhalla’s case and we too subscribe to the view.”It further asserted that all portions of banks’ OTS policies, providing for extensions, would be rendered unsustainable, if the Milkhi Ram judgment was to be applied. The judgment in Milkhi Ram was per incuriam or lacked due regard to the law or the facts and was much less a binding precedent.“We find that the Anu Bhalla judgment lays down the law more elaborately and accurately after discussing the judgments of the Supreme Courts as also the previous judgments of a Division Bench of this court. It lays down the principle in tune with the principles culled out in the judgments…,” the Bench observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/one-time-settlement-period-can-be-extended-says-high-court-214380

If the government tries to create hurdles, be prepared to set the crops on fire,” he said.“Farmers will harvest the crops to keep their annual quota of grain at home and then destroy the rest. We will harvest the crops and continue our agitation at the same time,” he said.He asserted that the government was mistaken if it thought that farmers would return home and the agitation would end in two months.Accompanied by BKU leaders Gurnam Singh Charuni and Yudhvir Singh, Tikait addressed ‘mahapanchayats’ at Kharak Punia and Balsamand villages.“We are out to change the scene across the country. We need one month to correct the powers that be. We will not return without course correction of the ruling party. Farmers in West Bengal are also in crisis and we will have to fight for them as well,” Tikait said.“Refuel your tractors and be ready facing Delhi’s direction. You can get a call to move at any time as that will be decided by the committee of farmer unions,” he said.Tikait said after Haryana, they would hold panchayats in other parts of the country, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. He said farmers had earlier given a call for a tractor rally in Delhi and the next time, they would go to the national capital with their agricultural implements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farm-stir-wont-slacken-during-harvesting-tikait-tells-centre-214334

Following a call given by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, farmers organised protests at over 100 spots in both states. The nationwide protest was also staged at some places in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. However, in many states, it was a low-key affair.The Railways claimed there was a negligible impact, although some trains were stopped by officials as a precautionary measure.“Not a single case of stoppage of train by the agitators was reported in most zones. The stir passed off peacefully,” a spokesman said.Sukhdev Singh Kokri of the BKU (Ugrahan) said their activists blocked rail traffic at 22 places in 15 districts.

Sud even faced protests wherein dung was dumped at his house following which he had also lodged an FIR against several farmers.Sud said, "I don't think farmers’ stir was a big factor in the local bodies’ election. AAP and SAD had been backing farmers from day one. They would have triumphed. The parties used farmers to garner political mileage.

I request that as a special gesture, the Centre could reconsider its decision and allow the jatha to leave for Pakistan on February 21,” she said.Meanwhile, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Thursday said the denial of permission to the jatha was the result of arrogance of the Centre and a direct fallout of the farm stir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/respect-sentiments-allow-jatha-to-pak-sgpc-chief-to-pm-modi-214376

While farmers under the banner of the Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee observed the ‘rail roko’ protest near the Kala Bakra railway station, BKU activists blocked trains at the Jalandhar railway station.Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee president Harsulinder Singh said 700-800 persons, including farmers and labourers, protested to support the farmers in their struggle. “Around 472 organisations have been protesting at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders, but the central government has turned a blind eye towards their genuine demands,” said Harsulinder.In Bathinda district, members of various farm unions blocked railway tracks at different locations.Farmers under the banner of BKU (Ugrahan) blocked tracks on the Bathinda-Jind railway line near Bhai Bakhtaur village, Bathinda-Ambala line near Bhucho Mandi, Bathinda-Ferozepur line at Goniana Mandi and Bathinda-Bikaner line in the Sangat mandi area.“From the obdurate stance adopted by the central government, it is clear that it wants to forcibly impose the anti-farmer laws on us. But with the massive support for the farm agitation both in the country and overseas, spirits of the farming community are quite high and we will not leave Delhi borders until the government revokes these laws. We exhort each and every section of society to extend their whole-hearted support to the movement,” said Harjinder Baggi, a farm union leader.In Mansa, farmers and other organisations joined hands to take part in the ‘rail roko’ agitation. BKU (Ugrahan) leader Ram Singh Bhaini Bhagha said: “We got a massive response to the ‘rail roko’ stir and people from all walks of life, including a large number of women, participated in the agitation. Now we have given a state wide call for a massive kisan-mazdoor rally in Barnala on February 21.”The rail traffic, to and from Rajasthan, was affected as farmers and trade union activists on Thursday blocked the Sriganganagar-Abohar-Bathinda track for four hours by staging a dharna at the Abohar railway station.Sarpanch Union president Manoj Godara said the Union Government had been callous to farmers and labourers, who had been camping at the Delhi border for the past three months. On the call of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, farmers and workers had decided to stage a dharna at the local station from 12 pm to 4 pm, he said.The protesters, who carried the banners of Krantikari Farmers Union, All-India Kisan Sabha, Dehati Mazdoor Sabha, Bhartiya Kisan Union, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti, PSPCL Technical Services Union and other organisations, shouted slogans against the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders.Farmer leader Subhash Godara said the “anti-farmers” laws would benefit the corporate houses. If these laws came into force, it would destroy not only the farmers, but also the labourers, artisans and the working class. In Muktsar, a large number of farmers today squatted on railway tracks to lodge their protest against the central government. Notably, the train service has been suspended in Muktsar since the outbreak of Covid-19. The farmers’ protest lasted for nearly four hours.(With inputs from Abohar & Muktsar)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/farmers-mobilise-support-on-tracks-214362

They have not allowed the Sangrur administration to shift the EVMs from Lehra to Sangrur and demanded “rectification” of results. The truck laden with EVMs is also stuck in the protest. “Since the start of the election process, officers have been working as puppets of Congress leaders. In the morning, the candidates of Lehra Vikas Manch (LVM) from ward Nos 2 and 8 were declared winners and officers said they would give certificates later. But around 3.30 pm when winners were celebrating and distributing ladoos, officers declared them losers,” alleged LVM convener Varinder Kumar Goyal. After receiving information about the change in results, locals reached the counting centre and started protesting. They also intercepted the truck laden with EVMs. The appeals of senior police and civil administration officials have failed to convince the protesters. Local shopkeepers also kept their shops closed on Thursday to express solidarity with the protesters. “How the winners can be declared losers after just a few hours? It has been done on the directions of local Congress leaders who have lost base in Lehra. Being the local MLA, it’s my responsibility to ensure justice. Officers can’t go anywhere,” SAD’s Parminder Singh Dhindsa told the protesters. “Some candidates were declared losers after being declared winners. Congress leaders have misused power in all 15 wards to ensure victory of their candidates,” said Jasbir Singh Kudni, AAP leader from Lehra. Sangrur DC Ramvir said senior officers of the district were trying to convince residents to lift their protest. “Results were declared after following mandatory procedure. If anyone has any problem, he can challenge the election,” the DC added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/poll-outcome-reversed-locals-protest-outside-counting-centre-214363

In view of the pro-people policies of the state government, the voters had shown their confidence in the government. He said, “The Punjab Government will continue its urban development work on a war-footing and will win the Assembly elections in 2022 just like the civic elections.”  Cooperation Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had emerged as the real ‘captain’ and an undisputed leader of the state.  Health Minister Balbir Sidhu said the rejection of the SAD, AAP and BJP was a clear sign of the things to come. He said the demand of farmer unions to repeal the farm laws was not being taken seriously by the Modi government and the SAD had firmly supported these laws before breaking the alliance with the BJP, due to which the people of Punjab wiped out these parties in the polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/poll-verdict-shows-whos-the-real-captain-say-ministers-214364

We need one month to correct the powers-that-be. We will not return until course correction of the ruling party. Farmers of Bengal are also in crisis and we will have to fight for them as well,” Tikait said addressing a "mahapanchayat" at Kharak Poonia village of Hisar.The new agriculture laws will ruin the economy of the small, marginal as well as big farmers, he said, adding that the private firms will take control of the fields in the guise of contract farming.Read also Rail roko: Farmers sit on tracks in Punjab, Haryana, stopping trains at stationsNegligible impact of ‘rail roko’ call on train services: RailwaysTikait said the government should not be under the impression that the movement against the laws will end as farmers will go to their villages to harvest their crop.“Even if you have to set your standing crop on fire, you should be prepared for it. The government should not harbour this impression that farmers will return home. We will harvest crops and continue our agitation at the same time,” he said addressing a "mahapanchayat" at Kharak Poonia village of Hisar."There will be no 'ghar wapsi' till then," he said.Tikait also asked farmers to be ready for the next call of the unions spearheading the stir.“Keep your tractors filled with fuel and facing towards Delhi's direction. You can get a call to move at any time, that will be decided by the committee (farmers unions),” he said.Tikait said after Haryana, they will be holding panchayats in other parts of the country, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.While earlier farmers had given a call for a “tractor rally” in Delhi, Tikait said the next time, they will go to the national capital with their agricultural implements.Addressing the gathering, Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni alleged, "If new agricultural laws are implemented, crops will be purchased at arbitrary prices and farmers will be forced to even sell their land."Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws will pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.
