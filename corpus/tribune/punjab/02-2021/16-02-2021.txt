Songs like Pecha Pe Gaya Centre naal, Kisan Anthem and Ailaan were heard playing all throughout Tuesday morning.Besides this, several people were flying kites to celebrate the kite festival.  A huge crowd was seen flying kites with farmers. Slogans like “No Farmers, No Food” and “Kisan Ekta Zindabadd” were heard.A resident of Bathinda, Rupinder Singh, said: “Music is the essence of Punjabi festivals, every year they keep loudspeakers on the terrace and play the trending songs. This year, songs on farmers' agitation are trending as Kisan Anthem and Ailan as in their cars also they listen to them, due to today as well they played these songs only on the loudspeakers”.Hydrogen filled balloons were in high-demand. The skies were colourful with bright kites and balloons.Meanwhile, balloon sellers had a good-sale day. They were spotted at different junctions, selling a single balloon for Rs. 20.While buyers weren’t too happy with the price, the sellers said on routine days people barely purchase balloons, and that on such festivals, they get to sell them in large numbers.However, a seller was seriously injured with a balloon gas cylinder blast at Paras Ram Nagar on Monday late night.

The child got 25 stitches.He was identified as Yuvan alias Yuvi of Basant Vihar. The incident took place when he was standing outside his house, and out of nowhere a Chinese string came and entangled his neck.Relative of the victim, Ashish Bansal, said: “His niece was standing out of the house, when the Chinese string entangled his neck, and by the time his family members came to know about this, the string had already injured his neck. He was immediately taken to a private hospital where she got 25 stiches, and a one-hour operation was done.”Besides Yuvan, a number of people have been injured because of the Chinese string, but no step was taken in order to stop the manufacturing or sale and purchase of such strings. Birds have also lost their lives because of kite-flying.Earlier, the district administration had also banned the sale and storage of China-made metal zinc-laced string, but due to lack of supervision of authorities, shopkeepers continue to sell them. Several raids have been conducted, and stock were seized, but it was all in vain.Due to mismanagement, the sale of Chinese string continues.Notably, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had imposed to complete ban on the sale, storage, production and transportation of the Chinese string which is often used for flying kites. Despite strict orders, the strings are being sold like hot-cakes in markets.The NGT had also ordered the registration of cases under the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act (1960) and Environment Protection Act (1986) and Wildlife Protection Act (1972) against those resorting to production, storage or selling of the deadly Chinese string, which is made up of plastic, synthetic and nylon material.Traditionally, special strings are made for kite flying.These strings are made out of thin cotton thread—which is treated with a paste of glue and finely powdered glass to make it strong—whereas Chinese thread is made of nylon, with a metal coating giving it extra sharpness.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/6-year-old-boy-gets-25-stitches-after-chinese-string-cuts-the-neck-in-bathinda-213230

Along with boys from my village, I am working on a daily wages basis," Shekhar Sharma, a resident of Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh, was employed at the airport but returned home during the Coronavirus pandemic, after he was sacked. Left to his own devices, he has found employment in the farmers agitation, albeit on a daily wages basis."I worked at the airport for the past three years, but in the Corona period, the company sacked me," he added. "There is no other earning member in the house and I have to take care of my mother and brother." Sharma isn't an aberration. Many other people like him are earning a living thanks to the farmers' agitation, which is going on at Delhi's borders for more than 80 days. Although there is no shortage of volunteers at the site of the agitation, with thousands chipping in at community kitchen for langars, for some people, the farmers protest is a means to feed hungry mouths who depend on them.On each agitation site, meals are being cooked for hundreds of farmers. Thousands of people are cooking food, but the help of the workers and labourers is also being taken on a payment basis.The scene is similar at the Ghazipur border, where farmers themselves are preparing langars, but some tasks are being outsourced to others who are paid on a daily wages basis."I've been present in the farmers agitation for the last one month, earning Rs 300 every day by cutting vegetables and washing dishes," says Ashok a resident of Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh. "Our contractor pays the eight-member team of cooks on a daily basis," adds Ashok.Bulandshahr's Chandrapal also earns Rs 500 every day by cooking and washing utensils for farmers from morning till dusk. "I've been here for the past 15 days and came here searching for employment," says Chandrapal.Since December 21, Anjul Kumar, is also working on a daily wages basis, earning Rs 500 every day. Though he also works back at the village, he has joined his other friends to work here.Farmers have been protesting on the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against three newly enacted farm laws.The 11 rounds of talks between the Government and the farmers ' organisations have remained inconclusive so far.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/not-just-to-protest-people-are-joining-farmers-agitation-also-to-earn-a-living-213167
16-02-2021||New Delhi||SGPC seeks fresh count of gurdwaras in Pakistan||The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has sought a fresh count of the number of gurdwaras in Pakistan following a controversy.The SGPC -- Sikh's single largest representative body in the world, has asked the Pakistan government to conduct a fresh count of gurdwaras to bring an end to the confusion created by Pakistan's Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) and the ruling party's Member National Assembly (MNA) Ramesh Kumar Vankwani.Talking to the media, spokesperson of ETPB, Aamir Hashmi said there were 105 gurdwaras in Pakistan out of which 18 were functional while the other gurdwaras were involved in some or other kind of litigation and were closed.Sources, however, said land grabbers in connivance with some officials of ETPB had encroached upon the gurdwara buildings and their properties whose cases were pending in courts.Contradicting the claim of ETPB, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's MNA Vankwani claimed that there were 588 Gurdwaras in Pakistan and not 105 as claimed by ETPB . However, he agreed with the ETPB's claim that 18 gurdwaras were open and functional.Blaming ETPB for usurping the gurdwaras of Pakistan allegedly by keeping the Sikh diasporas in dark and in cahoots with some of the Sikh leaders of Pakistan, including the office bearers of Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC), Vankwani alleged that ETPB had deliberately hidden the actual number of Gurdwaras since its officials had been sheltering the land sharks who had encroached upon gurdwaras and were also siphoning off the funds received from Pakistan government for the development of gurdwaras.Lahore based historian Iqbal Qaiser who has also authored a book titled 'Historical Sikh Shrines in Pakistan', claimed that there were 135 historical gurdwraras in Pakistan that were directly related to Sikh Gurus whereas the total number of gurdwaras exceeds 300.Surprised over the confusion on the number of gurdwaras in Pakistan, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur appealed to Pakistan government to immediately hold a fresh count of gurdwaras in Pakistan, including historical and those constructed before and after India-Pakistan partition in 1947.Notably, Pakistan has granted pilgrimage visas to visit only six of its historical gurdwaras, including Gurdwara Nankana Sahib, Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Gurdwara Sacha Souda Sahib, Gurdwara Rohri Sahib and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib."We are of the view that there are around 250 gurdwaras in Pakistan but now Pakistan's ETPB and its MNA are giving a different number of gurdwaras which is worrisome for us and we want Pakistan government to hold a fresh count of gurdwaras," said Jagir Kaur.Vankwani went on to allege that ETPB had constituted PSGPC as a frontal body to 'make a deal of religious properties of Sikhs' through it. "PSGPC's Sikh leaders are on the payroll of ETPB and they issue statements in favour of ETPB so that Sikhs living in India or other countries don't get suspicious of ETPB's activities," Vankwani alleged.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/sgpc-seeks-fresh-count-of-gurdwaras-in-pakistan-213164

16-02-2021||Nitin Jain||IPS officer Dr Pragya Jain goes beyond call of duty, comes to aid of minor rape victim||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, February 15In a rare display of humane face of the police and moving beyond the call of duty, a woman IPS officer turned mother of a minor rape victim here recently.After the mother of the special child, suffering from Down’s Syndrome, abandoned her at the hospital, the ADCP, Dr Pragya Jain, stayed with her to take care of her meals, medicines and other requirements, besides providing her counselling and moral support.The case had hit the headlines last week after the police had cracked it within hours with the arrest of the victim’s teenaged brother as the main accused. However, not believing the police theory, the victim’s family members and their neighbours had resorted to protest and even went to the extent of pelting stones and attacking the cops on duty, alleging that the minor boy was “falsely implicated”.It was on February 10 that the seven-year-old girl was taken to a local hospital by her mother, alleging that she had been raped at a school, where she was a kindergarten student.However, when the police sought the details of the incident from her, the victim’s mother disappeared from the hospital and left her daughter to fend for herself.“Since the child was in acute pain and feeling alone, I could not hold myself from staying back with her at the hospital to render my services beyond the call of my duty,” the 2017-batch IPS officer told The Tribune here today.A native of Baraut in Uttar Pradesh, the ADCP, Special Branch and Community Affairs, here, who is also holds a dgree in the bachelor of homoeopathic medicine and surgery, remained awake throughout the first night when the rape survivor could not sleep in the hospital.Having run her own clinic in Delhi for seven years before cracking the UPSC exam in 2016, Dr Jain provided meals, medicines, other requisites and facilities, besides moral support to the special child during her stay in the hospital.The Ludhiana Commissionerate Police, led by the Commissioner of Police Rakesh Agrawal, also arranged counselling by availing the services of the child protection officer to bring the rape survivor out of the trauma and agony through which she was passing through.“We traced out the case and the accused turned out to be none else but her own 13-year-old brother. We are providing counselling to the victim girl with the help of the Child Welfare Committee and Social and Child Welfare Department, besides arranging her monetary help with the help of the NGOs,” said the Ludhiana police chief.Though the victim’s mother initially alleged that the crime took place at the school, the police investigations laid hands on the CCTV cameras installed on the way to and fro the family’s home and school.After scanning a number of CCTV footages recovered on the narrow lanes of the route, the police nailed the lie of the victim’s mother when a footage showed the girl coming hale and hearty from school to her home with her mother on the day of the incident. However, another video clip captured from the CCTVs revealed that the woman was carrying the child in her lap from home to hospital after the incident.Taking a cue from the clinching evidence in hand, the investigation officers interacted with the minor child about the incident and her statement corroborated the police theory.No sooner had the police registered the case and took into custody the victim’s teenaged brother, than the family and their acquaintances resorted to protest by blocking vehicular traffic.As the police continued to take care of the rape survivor abandoned by her family at the hospital, a rumour was spread about the child’s death, which turned the protesters violent.If her humanitarian services to the rape survivor were not enough, the ADCP, on hearing the violent protest, led a police team to pacify the protesters by telling them that the child was recovering well and was being given best possible medical aid and services at the hospital.“Not ready to listen, the mob started pelting stones at our team. As the bystanders, including women and children, were at risk, we saved them at a great risk to our own safety,” revealed Dr Jain, who headed the operation to control the mob.“As per the CP’s directions, care of the victim is our topmost concern. We ensured the child protection officer was involved since the moment she started receiving medical aid. Considering the special status of the kid, suffering from Down’s Syndrome, she was provided counselling and best possible facilities,” the ADCP added.To further allay the apprehensions of the family and ensure fair investigation, the Commissioner of Police has formed a three-member special investigation team (SIT), comprising JCP City Deepak Pareek and ADCPs Dr Pragya Jain and Rupinder Kaur Sra. Agrawal has directed the SIT to thoroughly investigate the matter and submit its report at the earliest.Taking cognisance of the matter, the Punjab State Commission for Protection of Child Rights Chairman Rajinder Singh also met the victim recently and directed the police to give her custody to the family. He also directed the district administration to arrange the compensation to the victim through the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) at the earliest.Mother abandoned child at hospitalAfter the special child was left abandoned by her mother at hospital, ADCP Dr Pragya Jain takes care of her meals, medicines, counselling etcOfficer pacified violent protestersIf her humanitarian services to the rape survivor were not enough, the ADCP, on hearing about a violent protest, led a police team to pacify the protesters by telling them that the child was recovering well and was being given best possible medical aid and services at the hospital. Not ready to listen, the mob started pelting stones at the team. As the bystanders, including women and children, were at risk, the police team saved them at a great risk to its own safety.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/ips-officer-dr-pragya-jain-goes-beyond-call-of-duty-comes-to-aid-of-minor-rape-victim-212929

Once toll collection resumes only then we will be able to implement it,” said a senior NHAI official.Toll collection in 25 toll plazas, including both public-funded and BOT (built, operate and transfer) and on national highways (NHs) in Punjab have been directly or indirectly affected due to farmers’ protests since October last year. It is worth mentioning that members of different farm unions forced all 51 toll plazas across Haryana and Punjab to close, giving a free pass to motorists.However, the official said except Punjab and Haryana, FASTag would be made compulsory from Monday midnight across the country where the operations had not been disrupted.The government said the complete migration to FASTag would help promote fee payment through the digital mode, reduce waiting time and fuel consumption, and provide a seamless passage through the plazas.Vehicle owners can buy FASTag for their vehicles at certain toll plazas across the state by producing identification and vehicle registration documents. They can also buy it online on e-commerce portals and on the websites of certain banks such as HDFC Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank, etc.Customers can recharge their FASTag digital wallet using Internet banking, credit and debit cards or UPI.Multiple options for rechargeCustomers can recharge their FASTag digital wallet using Internet banking, credit and debit cards or UPI.

A reasoned order was required to be given by the board, if the bail was to be declined. Justice Jaishree Thakur also directed all boards across Punjab, Haryana and the Union Territory, Chandigarh, to record the reason for declining bail and the circumstances leading to such a decision.Justice Thakur added the decision would be founded on the basis of social investigation report submitted by the probation officer concerned in accordance with the performa contained in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016. Any other material available before it would also be taken into consideration. But it would not be merely on the basis of case records and the final probe report filed under Section 173, CrPC, by the investigation officer. In her detailed order, Justice Thakur asserted the court came across numerous cases where orders declining bail to the juveniles were being passed by the JJ Boards in a mechanical manner, being wholly influenced with the gravity of offence and the manner in which the alleged offence was committed by the child in conflict with law. The approach of the appellate courts was hardly any different. Justice Thakur asserted the SC and various HCs had time and again reiterated the well settled position of law that gravity of offence was immaterial in deciding bail application. A juvenile was required to be released on bail mandatorily unless the exceptions carved out in the JJ Act were made out. Justice Thakur said the exceptions included a reasonable ground for believing that the release was likely to bring the juvenile into association with a known criminal and his release would defeat the ends of justice. He directed the circulation of the order’s copy to all juvenile justice boards in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh for compliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/record-reason-for-bail-refusal-jj-boards-told-212873
