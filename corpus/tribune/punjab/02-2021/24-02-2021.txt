State by itself has not been given any right to move the SC under Article 32 under any circumstances.“The state of Uttar Pradesh is not competent to file the petition as it is neither a citizen to whom the right is conferred and neither it has any fundamental rights which are violated and therefore can be enforced by this court. The very basis of the writ petition filed by Uttar Pradesh is faulty and fallacious and deserves to be dismissed,” Punjab government told the top court.The submission was made in response to a plea filed by Uttar Pradesh seeking a direction to Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari to district jail Banda.It has also sought a direction to transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the extortion case in Punjab to the special court in Allahabad.Ansari is lodged in district jail Rupnagar in Punjab since January 2019.In its affidavit filed in the apex court, Punjab had referred to the medical condition of Ansari and said he had been undergoing treatment at jail hospital as well as other hospitals from time to time since January 2019.While referring to the medical condition and advice of doctors, it has said that custody of Ansari “could not be handed over to the state of Uttar Pradesh due to the specific advice of the medical officers/medical board/specialists” from time to time.

However, the cadre controlling authority of various categories of para-medical staff under the Directorate of Medical Education & Research remained under the control of the Health & Family Welfare department, with the official staff of Grade-3 and Grade-4 in Directorate of Health and Family Welfare having common seniority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/common-cadre-of-punjab-health-family-welfare-and-medical-education-research-depts-to-be-bifurcated-216947

He said that while 3000 permits were being handed over today, while another 8000 would follow through the rest of the year, taking the total to be distributed by the end of the year to 11000, generating both direct and indirect employment.Amarinder directed the Transport Department to create a user-friendly online facility within the next three months for receipt and processing of applications of all bus permits to make the system far more transparent and eliminate corruption.These novel initiatives will go a long way in providing smooth rural connectivity and seamless delivery of citizen centric services, said the Chief Minister, lambasting the previous SAD-BJP regime for issuing illegal permits to chosen people without due publicity or adherence to legal procedures and rules.Recalling that his government had promised cancellation of all illegal bus permits to ensure that genuine people get the benefit of the scheme, Amarinder said under the transparent system adopted by the Transport Department, a public notice for mini bus permits was issued for the first time ever in newspapers.People were encouraged to apply online without any hassle, and as many as 12,384 applications were received.Congratulating Transport Minister Razia Sultana and the officers of the department, Amarinder said that they had set the ball rolling to achieve five-fold objective to create employment opportunity for rural youth, make travel safer for women and children, ensure vehicular traffic safer for travellers and pedestrians, and reduce vehicular pollution and door step delivery of government services.The fast-paced changes in technology, where transport had now reached the Mars, necessitated new initiatives, he said, adding that Vehicle Location Tracking (GPS) Device Project, launched at a cost of Rs.15.50 crore would make travel safer for women and children in public transport vehicles.He disclosed that 100% such devices had already been installed in PUNBUS Buses and 50% in PRTC buses, which would be fully covered in the next six months. Razia said the GPS system would be installed soon in private buses too.The Chief Minister also referred to the state-of-the-art Command Control Centre at State level and 4 Regional Centres to track the vehicles, and said this would facilitate handling of panic button alerts by any woman/child, online challan for over-speeding vehicle without HSRP fitment, absence of valid insurance & Pollution certificate etc.On the occasion, the Chief Minister also laid the foundation stone of the Institute of Driving and Traffic Research (IDTR) Kapurthala at a cost of Rs. 22.50 crore under Mission ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgaar te Karobar’, with training capacity of 20,000 drivers annually to impart quality training to rural youth, and thus generate employment avenues as skilled drivers within the country and abroad, besides creating qualified trainer base for drivers and instructors of other training institutes. He said the instituted had been planned during his previous tenure and he was happy that it had been realised now.The upcoming training institute, to be managed by Tata Motors, would be equipped with camera based Innovative Driving Testing System (IDTS) to assess the driving skills of the candidates.The institute, having residential accommodation for 75 participants, would also have driving simulators with motion/static platforms.The Chief Minister also laid the foundation stone of Vehicle Inspection and Certification Centre, Kapurthala at a cost of Rs. 17.16 crore with the aim to safeguard the passengers and pedestrians, besides reducing vehicular pollution.The Centre, with capacity to inspect 72,000 vehicles annually, would test the road worthiness of vehicles before driving, among other important features such as online appointment for vehicle testing, replacement of visual inspection with automated sensor based testing equipment, automatic inspection report after completion of inspection report without any human intervention.He pointed out that Punjab witnessed a gradual decline in parameter of road accidents per lakh population from 23.9 against national average of 36.9 in 2016 as compared to 21.7 and 34.9 respectively in 2018.Likewise, road deaths per lakh population in Punjab have also come down from 11.6 against national average of 17.4 in 2016 to 11.3 against national average of 16 in 2018.While inaugurating home delivery of driving licenses and Registration Certificates (RCs), the Chief Minister said that Punjab is the first state in the Country to implement this unique system. He stated that a Centralized Card Personalization Centre (CCPC) has been established at Chandigarh, where all smart card based driving licenses and RCs would be centrally printed before being home delivered.Earlier in his welcome address, Principal Secretary Transport K Siva Parsad said the doorstep delivery would be instrumental in checking corruption and elimination of illegal touts and agents. He said now citizens would no longer be required to visit transport offices to collect documents and this would ultimately decrease the work load in Regional Transport Authorities (RTAs) and SDM offices.PPCC president Sunil Jakhar termed today’s initiatives the fulfilment of the party’s promise, and lauded the Captain government for the remarkable job done by it despite all odds. Transport was a major business and revenue earner for the state, extending from Amritsar to London to Mumbai, but in the previous decade it had been taken over by the Badals, who monopolised the business despite being custodians of the people’s faith, he said, underlining the need to destroy the chain.Prominent amongst others who were present on the occasion included; Member Parliament from Fatehgarh Sahib Dr Amar Singh, Punjab Youth Congress Barinder Singh Dhillon, Industries & Commerce Minister Sunder Sham Arora and Food, Civil Supplies & Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-cm-announces-open-ended-mini-bus-permit-policy-for-rural-youth-with-no-deadline-for-applying-216945
24-02-2021||Chandigarh||Jobs to kin of war heroes: Punjab removes anomaly affecting peace time medals||In a move that resolves a long pending anomaly related to grant of benefits to the kin of posthumously decorated armed forces personnel, the Punjab Government has extended the benefits to the families of those awarded peace time gallantry medals before 2017.The state government had instituted an “Honour and Gratitude” policy in 2000, offering government jobs to families of posthumous gallantry awardees as per their qualifications.However, due to an oversight, the policy had only included war-time gallantry awards and had left out peace time awards even if those happened to be higher in precedence. Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra and Vir Chakra, are classified as war-time medals and are awarded for gallantry in the face of the enemy, while Ashok Chakra, Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra are peace time medals for acts of courage other than in the face of the enemy.The policy was finally rectified in the year 2017, but the authorities concerned had interpreted the amendment to mean that family members of only those personnel would be eligible who were awarded after the year 2017 whereas the original policy of the year 2000 did not contain any such cut-off date.The rectification of the anomaly remained pending with the government since 2017.In December 2020, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had directed the government to take appropriate measures and introduce clarity in the policy within a period of three months.The fresh policy issued this week now includes all ‘Chakra’ series awards in its ambit without any cut-off provision as to the date of the award. The applicant, however, needs to be within the prescribed age limits for the job that he or she is applying for.Sources familiar with the matter said that although the number of affected applicants may not be very high, the rectification of the anomaly is a huge morale booster both for past and future cases and indicates the commitment of the government in resolving such issues, adding that the policy was amended well before the time provided by the High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/jobs-to-kin-of-war-heroes-punjab-removes-anomaly-affecting-peace-time-medals-216936

24-02-2021||New Delhi||Punjab 'shamelessly' protecting gangster Mukhtar Ansari, UP govt tells SC||The Punjab government is “shamelessly” protecting gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, lodged in Rupnagar district jail in connection with an alleged extortion case, by not sending him to Uttar Pradesh to face trial in several cases, the UP government told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy however took note of the submission of senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the Punjab government, seeking adjournment in the matter on personal grounds.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, said he has no objection to Dave’s plea for adjournment.The top court has posted the matter for hearing on March 2.During the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Ansari, said that he (Ansari) was “small fry” being cornered by the “might of the state”.To this, Mehta said, “You (Ansari) are such a small fry that a state (Punjab) is shamelessly protecting you.”          Ansari is lodged in district jail Rupnagar in Punjab since January 2019.The UP government also filed written submissions in the top court stating that transfer of Ansari’s custody was meticulously planned and raised a strong suspicion of conspiracy to delay the proceedings before the Special Judge (MP/MLA), Allahabad.The state government said it has “locus standi” to seek transfer of case pending before Judicial Magistrate Mohali, to the court of Special Judge (MP/MLA) Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, as UP is “party interested” under Section 406 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Power of Supreme Court to transfer cases and appeals).“There is no specific provision for transfer of an under trial prisoner under Code of Criminal Procedure or Jail Manual still this Court can pass an order of transfer of Respondent No. 3 (Ansari) to District Jail Banda, Uttar Pradesh considering the facts situation of the present matter by exercising jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,” the UP government said.It said Ansari’s fallacious plea that he does not want to come to the state as his life is under threat, is contrary to the plea of Punjab which contends that the accused is unable to travel due to medical reasons.The conduct of Punjab is evident from the fact that neither Ansari has applied for default bail in past two years nor the Punjab police have filed the charge sheet even after two years of lodging the accused in jail, the UP government said.“It is further appalling that Mukhtar Ansari has been operating his illegal activities in the state of Uttar Pradesh from within the jail maintained by the State of Punjab,” it said.“The transfer of Respondent No.3 (Ansari) is imperative from District Jail Roopnagar, State of Punjab to District Jail Banda, Uttar Pradesh and the appearance securing through video conferencing would not serve the purpose in view of the fact that the attendance could not be secured at several occasions in past, as a result the Special Judge (MP/MLA) Allahabad is not able to complete the trial expeditiously,” the UP government said.It also told the apex court that contention of Ansari that he has risk to his life is unsustainable and cannot be a ground for not handing over his custody.“Ansari had been safely lodged in the Banda Jail in Uttar Pradesh for 15 years duly protected by the Jail authorities and given full medical and health care. The State of Uttar Pradesh is duty bound to provide all safety and protection to accused and as such the alleged fear of Ansari is imaginary, ill founded and deserves to be rejected,” it said.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by Uttar Pradesh seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari to district jail Banda.It has also sought a direction to transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the extortion case in Punjab to the special court in Allahabad.In its affidavit filed in the apex court, Punjab had referred to the medical condition of Ansari and said that he had been undergoing treatment at jail hospital as well as other hospitals from time to time since January 2019.While referring to the medical condition and advice of doctors, it has said that custody of Ansari “could not be handed over to the state of Uttar Pradesh due to the specific advice of the medical officers/medical board /specialists” from time to time.

24-02-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Centre, state faceoff over direct payment to farmers||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 23The Punjab Government and Centre are heading for a face-off on the issue of making direct payment to farmers for the upcoming rabi marketing season.Even as the issue remains unresolved, the arhtiyas, through whom the payments are traditionally made to farmers, have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from April 1. While the Centre is insistent that the payment for purchase of wheat crop from the farmers will be made directly to them through an electronic transfer into their bank accounts, the state government wants that the payments be made in the accounts of the arhtiyas who in turn will transfer this payment into the farmers’ bank accounts with each payment being recorded in the Public Finance Management System.A meeting to sort out the issue was held between officers of the state government and the Centre in Delhi in the evening today, but the stalemate continues with both sides refusing to budge. Official sources have told The Tribune that a subsequent meeting to try and resolve the issue would again be held later this week.Punjab Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told The Tribune that they have pleaded with the Centre that direct payment to farmers should be optional. “Farmers themselves do not want the direct payment and are okay with the payment coming to them through the arhtiyas. Just as in the case of Haryana, Punjab should be allowed to make it optional,” he said.This year, Rs 24,400 crore is estimated to be transferred to farmers in the state for purchase of 132 lakh tonnes of wheat. Officials in the state government say that restricting the role of arhtiyas could create multiple problems in a well-established procurement and mandi system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/centre-state-faceoff-over-direct-payment-to-farmers-216702

A scuffle ensued and the petitioner tried to pacify the situation but to no avail, it said.The petitioner alone was caught and arrested by police officials.
