It is  30 for SC/ST/OBC and 35 for Persons with Disability (PWD). The sixth round of counselling to fill the vacant BDS seats in Punjab will start on February 17.A general category student scoring a minimum 113 marks out of 720 in NEET – 2021 will be eligible for the admission. An SC/OBC student with 87 marks and a disabled student with 99 marks will also be eligible for admission.Baba Farid University of Health Sciences has allowed the relaxation in eligibility as per the orders of the Supreme Court.As per reports, after more than 7,000 BDS seats remained vacant, some dental colleges approached the Dental Council of India (DCI) to relax the eligibility criteria.In  a letter dated December 28, 2020, the DCI  proposed to the Central government that the percentile for admission to BDS course in dental colleges should be lowered by 20 points for each category but the government declined the suggestion.The Centre refused to lower the eligibility criteria saying that 7.71 lakh candidates were found to be eligible for filling up 82,000 MBBS and 28,000 BDS course seats in the country. For each vacant seat, seven candidates are available, it said.The government also said that there were 2.77 lakh dentists registered with the Dental Council of India.Taking into consideration the availability of 80 per cent of dentists, there is one dentist for every 6,080 persons which is better than the WHO recommendation of 1:7500, it said.The dental colleges approached the Supreme Court, however, to get the relief, saying the cut-off percentile was lowered last year also.In Punjab, there are total 15 dental colleges, including two government dental colleges in Amritsar and Patiala. These colleges have 1,140 BDS seats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/baba-farid-varsity-relaxes-eligibility-criteria-to-fill-496-vacant-bds-seats-210958

An electronic media organisation through an RTI had asked for names of farm bodies with which the government held discussions on the bills. But the RTI information commissioner said it has no record. Whose words we believe? Minister or RTI...”He said if farmers remain angry like this, it would have an impact on the economy.Further, Ray said the ruling party had promised in its 2014 election manifesto doubling of farmers’ income in five years, adding the deadline was later extended to 2022.He asked whether the government would be able to achieve this target in one year.Farmers’ protests at various Delhi borders have entered the third month. Eleven rounds of discussions held so far between the Centre and protesting farm bodies have failed to break the deadlock. The government has offered some concessions including suspension of the laws for 18 months, which farmers unions have rejected.Meanwhile on January 12, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the farm laws for two months and appointed a panel to look into the issue.

The University is in a severe financial crunch and the officials seem to be doing nothing about it”, an official said.PUTA president Professor Nishan Singh Deol said: “The University non-teaching ad-hoc employees’ extension was to be discussed in the syndicate which has been postponed. The teaching and non-teaching faculty’s promotions have been done, but there are waiting for their letter under the Career advancement scheme, but that is also pending. They are not issuing the letters since four months.”He said the GPF amount to be disbursed with the employees’ monthly salary was also pending.Professor Nishan Singh Deol said: “The University VC Ravneet Kaur has not visited the University campus in a month, this has led to creation of a gap among the administration and the faculty as many matters are left unresolved.”Students who participated in the protest said the University is planning to increase their course fee and has already increased the fine for late submission of library books.“We are against both the decisions. The University should also not levy GST on various services it provides as they are part of an academic institution and its services”, Sandeep Kaur, state Committee member of Punjab Radical Students’ Organisation.The professors and teachers said they will intensify their stir in the coming days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/puta-burns-effigy-of-punjabi-varsity-vc-punjab-government-over-grants-210893

For effective water management, uninterrupted supply and its distribution, the valley will be equipped with the canal water supply and necessary fully functional arrangements such as underground service reservoir, and pumping machinery, including water treatment plant, by December.To support operations of the units within the valley, round-the-hour common utilities such as streetlights, internal electricity distribution system and other allied works will be completed by January next. The park will also have green spaces and scenic landscape in line with the global best practices.To ensure environment safety, encourage zero liquid discharge and to reduce operational cost burden, the PSIEC was providing critical shared facilities such as the sewage treatment plant (STP) and the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) for the industrial units inside the park as per the development plan of the hi-tech valley.The park has direct connectivity with Ludhiana-Chandigarh NH-05 through an under-construction four-lane approach road, which will be completed by this month. “This connectivity will provide seamless logistics ease to the industrial units within the park,” the officer said.Ludhiana being a commercial hub of north India and densely industrialised district of the state was always a preferred destination for both global and local investors. The establishment of the industrial park was evident testament of receptiveness of the state government to the industry feedback and timely implementation of required policies and decisions on ground. The valley will provide impetus to the flourishing business-friendly ecosystem across all sectors.Investment opportunityTo attract global and local investors to the valley, country’s top performing state investment promotion agency, the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (Invest Punjab), has been aggressively reaching out to the investors to attract investment in the valley by highlighting the vast investment opportunities in the state.“As proven in leading economies of the world, focusing on the development of industrial infrastructure by the government has always been instrumental in harnessing the investment and sustainable development of the economy,” the officer said.Preferred destinationLudhiana being a commercial hub of north India and densely industrialised district of the state is always a preferred destination for both global and local investors.

We will continue to protest until the farm laws are revoked,” he told the media at the Shambhu toll plaza here today.Farmers’ disallow half-naked marchJhajjar: Farmer organisations Wednesday decided not to allow youths to take out half-naked protest at Tikri border against the three farm laws. Youths daily organise such march at the main protest site to mark their protest. “The decision has been taken keeping the cold weather conditions in mind and protecting them as the agitation is likely to go on for long,” said a farmer leader, adding the number of farmers’ death due to cold at Tikri and Singhu borders was increasing with each passing day. TNSChaduni further said, “The agitation is going in the right direction. There are no factions and we all are fighting together. The Centre has no intention to repeal the laws. It is of the view that the agitation will come to an end automatically, but the Centre is mistaken.”He made it clear there was no time limit for the agitation. “The Centre has introduced agri-business laws to benefit corporate houses, and not the farm laws.

After its launch in 2019, where the first participant was Padma Shri poet Surjit Patar, continuous series of events featuring many upcoming and eminent poets were organised.The latest edition, held in virtual mode, featured young poet and activist Amy Singh. Amy is known for her unique and much-acclaimed literary initiative Dak to Lahore, where she wrote letters addressed to General Post Office Lahore, as a peace initiative. Talking to Prof Gurupratap Khairah, an academician and writer, Amy said she wrote her first poem at a tender age of six. “Later, I encouraged the poet inside me and continued to write and read to mother and grandmother and take suggestions from them,” she added.But things changed for good with ‘Dak to Lahore’. The simplest of trigger for the initiative, Amy shared, was when a popular eatery in Chandigarh changed its name from Lahori Dhaba to Lucknawi Dhaba amidst Indo-Pak tensions in the December of 2016. “This move made me think about the reason and emotions behind such hostility when most of our generation does not even know people from across the border. So, I decided to write an open letter addressed to General Post Office Lahore and later when I uploaded it on social media, it became viral. That’s when more people joined in from across the border and it became a movement,” she shared during interaction.Her second attempt to build literary temperament has been cross-connection poetry in which she wants to bring poetry out of books and rooms. She has been reading poetry at several public spaces in Chandigarh, including Sector 17 plaza, gardens, at intersections and many have joined her. “I never cared much for criticism and will continue to write fearlessly,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dak-to-lahore-fame-amy-singh-talks-about-her-poetic-sinews-210687

These community science clubs have been established in rural belt by the government schoolteachers and are affiliated to the VIPNET programme (Vigyan Prasar NETwork) started in 1998 by the Central Government with an objective of providing a fillip to the science clubs movement in India. Under the programme, any individual with a scientific bent of mind can form a network to weave all science clubs, societies, organisations to promote scientific activities.Sanjeev Sharma, a science teacher from Government Senior Secondary School, Jabbowal, has been running Infinity Science Club at his school, working with a group of 20-30 students to develop ideas that have won accolades at the National Science Congress. Leading their project of turning agricultural waste into biofuel, he and his team of students have developed a solid biofuel using parthenium plants (better known as congress grass). He said the project also provides us opportunity to recycle the waste paper and filthy water from RO filters.He had earlier worked on a project to turn agricultural waste into ethanol. “The motive behind our science club is to encourage and engage students as well as local community to adapt to a scientific way of life. We mostly do projects in the field of agriculture science,” says Sanjeev.Another teacher, Pankaj Sharma, who runs a village science club at Bhoewali, too, has been encouraging kids to think out of the box. Recently, Arshdeep Singh, one his students and a son of a daily wager, won the Inspire Award from the Department of Science and Technology for developing a prototype of a low-cost air purifying system. Pankaj says that it’s important to build scientific temperament not just in youth, but also local communities. “If we have to move towards an inclusive sustainable society, then we have to understand the basic concepts of science and implement them in our lifestyle,” he says. Pankaj has been running the club for past 10 years. He is helped by the local village community to generate resources for his club.While Sanjeev and Pankaj work with senior kids, Ritu Gagan, a science teacher from Government Elementary School, Patalpuri, Majitha, is running the only primary science club of the district in her school. Her students fall in the age bracket of 4-7 years. “I start with basic concepts of science like magnetism, evaporation and other simple techniques that I make them learn through various activities. I have made a small kitchen garden in my school to teach kids about organic farming. I often engage their parents in the process of learning as well,” she shares. Ritu has been running VIPNET approved science programmes in her club. “I have 40-50 students and they all come to my class eager to learn. I believe we need to build scientific minds, not political ones for the country to progress,” she adds.All of these science clubs are self-funded yet they prove a point. “There are lot of judgements and misconceptions about government school teachers and education. But, the reality is very different. We work with kids who come from such backgrounds where education is not a priority. The drive we see in them to rise above their means…is incredible. Our effort is to turn them into thinkers, innovators and not just degree holders,” Sanjeev resolves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/science-clubs-run-by-amritsar-based-teachers-become-hotspot-for-budding-scientists-210690

The police are also hesitant, fearing backlash from farm unions.Senior PSPCL officials said recently, their teams were attacked in villages of Sangrur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Ferozepur and Mansa and a majority of them were now reluctant to carry out raids against power theft and defaulters. “Many farmers own cars and are even holding functions but refuse to pay the power bills, claiming that they are busy with the agitation in Delhi. If our teams go to check their connections, they attack us,” said a PSPCL official.Moreover, with the state government too going easy against the defaulters, the PSPCL is now being pushed towards bankruptcy. “The polls are approaching in many villages and farmers warn us of dire consequences if we accompany the local power officials. If the PSPCL officials want security, there needs to be clear directions in writing from our department,” claimed a DSP-level officer.“The PSPCL has failed to plug loopholes in divisions, causing 60-70% loss against 12-15% in areas, including Bhikiwind, Patti, West Amritsar, Bhagta Bhai Ka and Bhagapurana. What is making matters worse is that the losses have started increasing in recent years. Huge losses result in increased tariffs and financial loss to the PSPCL,” said Bhupinder Singh, retired deputy chief engineer, PSPCL.“Power theft is estimated to cause a revenue loss of Rs 1,500 crore annually, which if saved can reduce the average tariff by 35-40 paisa per unit in the state,” reads a petition submitted by Bhupinder Singh to the PSERC, highlighting discrepancy between the audited power and the revenue account of the PSPCL.PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Prasad confirmed that the collection had declined due to the farmers’ agitation and increased power theft incidents. “We are educating farmers as paying bills is mandatory to meet our expenditure. There were instances when even the local police didn’t cooperate with us. But after the intervention of senior officials of the police and the PSPCL, security is being provided to our teams checking power theft,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pspcl-faces-losses-as-farmers-refuse-to-pay-bills-210645

He is the one who would earlier talk about farm reforms. No farmer is against the country. The people of Punjab can never do anything to harm the dignity of the Tricolour.”Bittu also claimed that “these people are the ones getting Khalistani funding”.When Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi asked him to explain the remarks by senior Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury that the BJP was behind the Republic Day violence while he was accusing Yadav of it, Bittu said that was because of the involvement of Deep Sidhu with BJP MP Sunny Deol.Joshi accused Bittu of “misleading the people of the country”. Objections were raised when Bittu claimed that the new laws said the ‘mandi system’ would be done away with. There was commotion when the Punjab MP made a personal remark against Union minister Anurag Thakur, who countered him on his statement. Accusing him of  misleading the public, Thakur said, “Where is it mentioned in the laws that mandis will be closed? Nowhere do they say that the mandis will be scrapped. They first misled the Punjab farmers and now are misleading the country.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/yogendra-yadav-incited-farmers-ravneet-bittu-tells-lok-sabha-210391
