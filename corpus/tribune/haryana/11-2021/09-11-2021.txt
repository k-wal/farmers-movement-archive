Now, these pumps have become a resting place for paramilitary personnel, while their owners say they will have to explore other sources of income if the entire highway is not opened soon for four-wheelers which are their main source of revenue.The Tikri Border Petrol Pump Association claims the five pumps have suffered a revenue loss of over Rs 6.5 crore in the past year, while more than 80 employees working there have lost their livelihood. Similar is the situation with other shops located on the stretch where barricading has been done.“Though all five petrol pumps are closed, every pump has to bear fixed expenses of over Rs 1 lakh every month, including employees’ salaries, electricity charges and other taxes, without any income. We had submitted a memorandum to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission to get a monthly bill of Rs 40,000 waived, citing the prevailing situation, but to no avail,” said Anup Gupta, coordinator of the association.Gupta said their pumps were catering to requirement of petrol, diesel and CNG of a large number of people from Bahadurgarh and surrounding areas of Delhi before the farmers protest. Now these people were compelled to get fuel for their vehicles from distant places. The losses would keep increasing if the highway was not cleared soon. Not only pumps, several other shops located at the barricading point had also been shut, he claimed.Darshan Singh, manager at New Haryana Service Station, said over 100 employees were working at all these five filling stations before the farmers’ protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/tikri-fuel-stations-suffer-rs-6-5-crore-loss-in-a-year-335845

The report would be submitted to the High Court shortly,” he told The Tribune.Besides Parmar, other SIT members who carried out the questioning included SSP Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar, DSP Lakhvir Singh and inspector Dalbir Singh.The focus of questions was the unsolved case of the theft of a bir of Guru Granth Sahib on June 1, 2015, from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala. The second FIR was regarding the pasting of posters in different villages amounting to sacrilege of Sikh holy book. The third was on throwing the ‘angs’ of the holy book at various places.”In the latter two cases, the SIT has already submitted challans, accusing a number of dera followers for carrying out the sacrilege incidents. The key accused Mohinder Pal Bittu was killed by other inmates in a Nabha Jail over his role in the incidents. Later, a CBI inquiry team had absolved the dera followers of the charges, saying there was no conclusive evidence against them. However, the Punjab Government had not accepted the CBI closure report on the incidents and decided to carry out an investigation by the Punjab Police.It has been alleged the dera men stole the bir and later tore the pages in order to take revenge from Sikhs for defamatory actions and speeches against dera head.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sacrilege-punjab-sit-grills-dera-head-gurmeet-ram-rahim-for-7-hrs-335856

With no curbs despite the city being a pollution hotspot, it has left the residents worried.“Hundreds of tonnes of such waste has been dumped in open places in Greater Faridabad (also known as the Neharpar area) despite the imposition of the graded response action plan (GRAP) by the Ministry of Environment to keep a tab on pollution during the winter season,” says AK Gaur, a resident of Sector 85 here. Claiming that the rubble and waste had been dumped in the open on the sides of almost all roads and in the open spaces, he said, the violations had been going on despite the measures announced to improve cleanliness in the city. Alleging that not a single violation has been penalised till date, Pramod Manocha, president of the Greater Faridabad Residents Welfare Association (GREFA) said the area had become a favourite spot for rubble and garbage dumping giving the localities a messy and shabby look.Open spaces bear the bruntHundreds of tonnes of such waste has been dumped in open places in Greater Faridabad despite the imposition of the graded response action plan by the Ministry of Environment to keep a tab on pollution during the winter season. —AK Gaur, Resident, Sector 85Plan to recycle wasteA plan is afoot for a project to recycle and reuse the construction waste for making products like interlocking tiles and manhole covers at Khori village in the district. —Ombir Singh, Superintending engineer, MCFTulinder Katoch, another resident, said hundreds of tonnes of waste material was being dumped in the open. He said rubble was thrown on the side of the several kilometers-long road running parallel to the Agra canal and in open spaces. He said this had not only been hazardous to the environment, but also posed danger to commuters as the waste had occupied the portions of the roads. He said despite the announcement of penalising the violators, the problem remained unresolved, as the authorities were yet to earmark the spots for dumping the construction waste. Satinder Singh, a retired defence official, said improper disposal of waste, dusty road conditions and lack of cleanliness had led to a sharp rise in air pollution, which he said needed immediate attention. Ombir Singh, Superintending Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Faridabad(MCF), said that a plan was afoot for a project to recycle and reuse the construction waste for making products like interlocking tiles and manhole covers at Khori village in the district.
