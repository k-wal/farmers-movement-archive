03-11-2021||Deepender Deswal||Abhay Chautala’s narrow victory in Ellenabad a concern for INLD: Experts||Tribune News ServiceSirsa, November 2The outcome of the bypoll in Ellenabad has stirred a debate on the impact of the farmers’ agitation in political terms. Though the byelection was caused due to resignation by Abhay Singh Chautala in support of the farmers’ demand for the withdrawal of three farm laws, his victory margin got significantly reduced despite the call by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders to vote against the BJP candidate.Resignation a mistakeIt was a mistake by Abhay to tender his resignation which nobody will dare to repeat in future under similar circumstances.— Ram Mehar Singh, Jamal VillageProminent SKM leaders Rakesh Tikait and Gurnam Singh Charuni had held meetings and road shows in Ellenabad a couple of days before the polling to urge people to “teach the BJP a lesson’ in the bypoll. So much so that Tikait made ample indications in favour of the INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala, while urging the electorate to “return the favours with additional items to someone who had relied on the Samyukta Morcha at a meeting in Nathusari Chopta village of Ellenabad segment”.However, Abhay’s margin had narrowed down to 6,730 votes compared to his previous victory of 11,922 votes over BJP nominee Pawan Beniwal. Political experts stated that the poll outcome had shown sharp polarisation of voters for and against the BJP. Evidently, urban voters in Ellenabad voted vehemently for the BJP as its candidate won in three rounds of counting from Ellenabad town.“Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala’s painstaking efforts in cutting down his uncle to size helped Kanda get votes in rural Punjabi belt and Paintalisa (chunk of 45 villages) as well,” said a political observer, adding that an evident caste polarisation had helped both Abhay Chautala as well as Kanda.“Caste fault lines make it a direct contest between Abhay and Kanda. Significantly, Abhay has improved his tally of votes. He polled 65,992 votes. He had got 57,055 votes in 2019 in a triangular contest. That’s the reason behind trailing of Pawan Beniwal of the Congress to poor third position, with a mere 20,904 votes,” stated the expert.The poll experts said the result had been a dampener for the INLD’s bid for revival, which was reduced to just one seat in the Assembly in 2019 following a split in the party. “After the release of party supremo Om Prakash Chautala from jail, the INLD was eyeing to claim its lost ground in Haryana riding on the farmers’ agitation. This was also the idea behind Abhay’s resigning from the Assembly,” stated an expert.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/abhay-chautalas-narrow-victory-in-ellenabad-a-concern-for-inld-experts-333601

However, it is a big deal for a BJP candidate to get a huge number of votes.” To a question regarding the results of byelections in HP and Bengal, he said, “We will analyse these results.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/people-have-rejected-abhay-chautalas-agenda-says-anil-vij-333602

The local administration, in a bid to call communal truce, formed a committee, having a Sub-Divisional Magistrate, an Assistant Commissioner-level police officer, members of Hindu and Muslim communities and social organisations, to decide the final list of spots where Friday namaz prayers would be offered in the city.“The committee will take decisions after consulting all stakeholders and taking consent from local residents. Namaz can be offered at any mosque, Idgah or a private place,” the statement read.“We have cut down the number of public areas being used for namaz and in reviewing other sites by talking to local residents and both communities. We will peacefully resolve the issue,” said DC Dr Yash Garg.While the protesting Hindu outfit Sanyukt Hindu Mahasabha has welcomed the move, it has, however, refused to defer or cancel its plans of holding Govardhan Pooja at the namaz site in Sector 12-A. “The pooja will happen as scheduled. It is not against any community but our prayer gathering at public site,” the Mahasabha statement said.Meanwhile, the Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, an NGO, announced the launch of a public awareness campaign that would run online and offline to counter hatred with reason and to counter fake news and false allegations with facts. “A platform will be made available for those who disagree with the current campaign against the Friday namaz and who stand for a united Gurgaon for harmony and progress. We urge all residents to join this campaign to strengthen the spirit of togetherness,” said members of the Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-approval-to-hold-namaz-withdrawn-from-eight-sites-333605

03-11-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram administration cancels permission for namaz at eight designated places||The Gurugram administration said on Tuesday that it was rolling back on its decision to allow namaz in eight places in the city—a development that comes on the back of protests from fringe Hindu groups.The administration has promised similar action in some other places where Hindu groups and locals have raised objections, an official said.IANS identified some of these locations as Bengali Basti Sector-49, V-Block DLF-III, Surat Nagar Phase-1, Outside Khedi Majra village, on Dwarka Expressway near Daulatabad village, Sector-68 near village Ramgarh, Near DLF Square Tower and village Rampur to Nakhdola Road.Apart from this, a committee has also been constituted by the Deputy Commissioner Gurugram to identify the places to offer mamaz, in which Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), members of Hindu/Muslim organization and other social organizations have been included, IANS said in its report.After talking to all the parties, this committee will decide which places will be used to offer Namaz in the future, IANS quoted an official as saying. The committee will also ensure that Namaz is not offered on any road or public place, Subhash Boken, spokesperson of the Gurugram police, said. Also, local people do not have any objection to identifying a place for namaz."Namaz can be offered only at Idgah, Masjid or designated places. Due to the decision taken by the committee in this matter, the brotherhood and social harmony of both the organizations should be maintained for which the district administration is committed. For this the cooperation of both the organizations is also required," IANS quoted Subhash Boken, spokesperson of the Gurugram police, as saying.Both organisations are bound to maintain law and order. Consent from the administration is necessary for namaz in any public and open place, the spokesperson said."Special security arrangements have been made by the Gurugram Police in this regard and the police are keeping a vigil," Boken said, according to the IANS report.The development has come amid fears of shrinking public places for minorities, particularly Muslims, across the country. Fringe Hindu organisations have been spearheading protests against the public offering of namaz in several designated places in Gurugram, particularly Sectors 12 and 47. The protests occur despite explicit sanction for Muslims to hold prayers at these sites—permission that was given the last time such protests disrupted namaz.Public prayers and the subsequent protests have increasingly threatened to spill over during almost every Jumʿah—or Friday—prayers, forcing the administration to send out reinforcements to avoid violence.    Thirty people were detained and booked last Friday for trying to disrupt namaz. The eight places were among 37 designated sites approved by the administration for namaz.--- With inputs from IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-administration-cancels-permission-for-namaz-at-eight-designated-places-333349
