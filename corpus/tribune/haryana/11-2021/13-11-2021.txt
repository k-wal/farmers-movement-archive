The entire budget for the project will be provided by the Haryana Government.“Along with the statue of sage Dadhichi, statues of lord Indra and Vajra will also be installed. It is an attempt to depict the story where Dadhichi sacrificed his life and gave his bones for Vajra. The statues will further increase the attraction of the sarovar. At a later stage, there is also a plan to start a voiceover to narrate the story, relevance and historic value of the statues at the sarovar. Sannihit Sarovar is one of the major ‘tirthas’. A budget of Rs 5 crore has been spent under the Krishna Circuit for the development of the ‘tirtha’”, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/statue-of-sage-dadhichi-to-adorn-sannihit-sarovar-337358

Since I don’t have a two-wheeler and the farmers don’t let three-wheelers cross the barricades hence I have no other option but to carry the vegetables on my head to go to the other side,” he added.Interestingly, security personnel deputed at Tikri have to remain more attentive as compared to earlier situation when the border was sealed completely. “We used to relax at petrol pumps and nearby places at Tikri but now we have to remain alert to keep a tab on people’s movement,” said a security personnel.The personnel have been deployed on the open path at the Tikri border in order to ensure hassle-free movement of two-wheelers. Activists of farm outfits also remain present there to curb the entry/exit of three and four-wheelers.The border was opened for pedestrians, two-wheelers and ambulances on October 30 after the Delhi Police removed the multi-layered barricading from one side of the highway.Farmers’ protestA considerable number of people, including migrant labourers, vegetable vendors, small shopkeepers and those residing nearby, daily cross the border on foot as protesting farmers are not allowing three and four-wheelers to ply there.

13-11-2021||Deepender Deswal||DAP shortage persists in Haryana, demand-supply gap a worry||Tribune News ServiceHisar, November 12Short supply from the Centre during the kharif season, increase in the estimated area of mustard sowing and hike in the raw material for the DAP fertiliser are stated to be the reasons behind the current DAP crisis for farmers across the state.Shortage piled up in OctoberIn October, the Centre allocated 58,650 MT of DAP to Haryana against the need of 1.10 lakh MT. After the state took up the issue with the Centre, 94,000 MT was supplied. — An officialTarget to sow mustard in 6.5L hectaresThe target is to sow mustard in 6.5L ha, but it’s expected to cross 7L ha due to favourable sowing conditions for mustard in rain-fed areas in September, October. — Jagraj Dandi, Joint Director, Agri DeptSources said 2 lakh MT of the fertiliser was given to Haryana by the Centre against the requirement of 3 lakh MT, which has had a cascading effect on the rabi season.“Due to the shortfall of 1 lakh MT of DAP during kharif season, the opening stock on October 1 (start of rabi season) with Haryana was 50,000 MT,” an official said.Sources added that the shortage started piling up in October when the Centre allocated 58,650 MT of DAP to Haryana against the initial requirement of 1.10 lakh MT. “After the state government took up the issue with the Union Agriculture Minister, 94,000 MT of the fertiliser was supplied to Haryana in October,” an official said.However, the gap between the demand and supply is still continuing as per the figures available on the online dashboard of the Department of Fertilisers of the Centre.The figures showed that the overall supply of DAP from October 1 to November 11 has been much above the requirement — against the requirement of 1.5 lakh MT of DAP, 1.91 lakh MT was supplied. However, 1.7 lakh MT DAP was sold till November 11, which is much above the estimated requirement to date.There is still a requirement of 1.29 lakh MT DAP, which will mainly be used in sowing wheat and for further needs till March 31, 2022.Dr Jagraj Dandi, joint director, Haryana Agriculture Department, said: “We have a target to sow mustard in 6.5 lakh hectares, but this area is expected to cross 7 lakh hectares due to favourable sowing conditions for mustard, especially in the rain-fed districts of the state in September and October. The estimated wheat sowing area is 25 lakh hectare.”Farmers maintained that moisture in the soil after rains led them to sow mustard instead of bajra.Sandeep Beniwal, a farmer of Darba Kalan village in Sirsa, said he sowed five acres of mustard and planned to sow another 17 acres of wheat. “I have been standing in a queue in Chopta town for two days with no hope of getting DAP. The queue is getting longer every day,” he said.A state government note mentioned that importers and manufacturers put on hold their imports and manufacturing process during May this year due to hike in prices of the raw material of DAP fertiliser in the international market. Consequently, the country faced a shortage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dap-shortage-persists-in-haryana-demand-supply-gap-a-worry-337365
