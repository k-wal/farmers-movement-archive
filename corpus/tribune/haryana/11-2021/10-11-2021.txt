Haryana federation of university & college teachers’ orgRequisitions for making appointments on C and D posts have to be sent to the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC).For the selection of university registrars, the vice-chancellors have been told to amend the statutes of their respective universities to provide for the creation of a search-cum-selection committee which would have nominees ofthe state government, HPSC and the Haryana Higher Education Council.The same committees will carry out the selection process for the appointment of finance officers, controller of examinations and librarians at the state universities.The VCs have been told to take the necessary steps in this regard within 15 days.The said move of the state government has evoked a strong reaction from the associations of university teachers, who have strongly condemned it.The Haryana Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations has asked the government to withdraw the letter. It has threatened that if the said letter is not withdrawn, the teachers would resort to “total closure” of the state universities. “The state apparently wants to wrest the control of appointments at the state universities.

The scientists claimed that it contained around 150 per cent higher protein in comparison to the conventional ice-cream. It contains 10 per cent protein, of which 70 per cent is whey protein, while the conventional ice-cream available in the market, contained only 4 per cent protein having around 0.8 per cent of the whey protein, they said.Whey protein makes it highly nutritiousIce-cream is the most popular dairy dessert consumed by almost all segments of the population. We have developed this high-protein ice-cream by supplementing it with highly nutritious and muscle strengthening whey protein. Dr MS Chauhan, Director, NDRIThe scientists used whey proteins derived from milk or milk products which was considered as gold standard of protein for professional sportspersons. Whey protein works as an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune boosting, said Dr MS Chauhan, Director, NDRI, after launching the ice-cream, the commercialisation of which is underway.Scientists comprising Dr SA Hussain, Dr Writdhama Prasad, Dr Yogesh Khetra and research scholars Suchismita Roy and Sonam under the guidance of Dr Latha Sabikhi, Dr AK Singh and Joint Director, Academics, Dr RRB Singh, started the research in 2018 and they took three years to get desired results after overcoming the challenges, including maintaining the texture, overrun, melting quality and taste in high-protein ice-cream.“Ice-cream is the most popular dairy dessert consumed by almost all segments of the population. We have developed this high-protein ice-cream by supplementing it with highly nutritious and muscle strengthening whey protein,” said Dr Chauhan while congratulating the scientists. He said this ice-cream could be prepared in any flavour.The developed product does not involve any major changes in the processing line during its preparation, which will make it easy for small, medium and large-scale dairy industries to adopt. The high-protein ice-cream will be costing Rs 3 more than the conventional ice-cream per 100-ml packing. “Protein is an important macro-nutrient and plays a vital role in our body’s growth and development. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research, an adult should consume about 0.8–1g protein per kg body weight for a healthy life; however, the actual value of protein consumption is close to 0.6 g per kg ideal body weight in the age group of 18 years,” said Dr Hussain.“Supplementing whey proteins in highly popular food products will help in addressing the quality protein needs of the consumers’ at a large scale,” said Dr Hussain. “We engineered the colloidal aspects of the ice-cream structure to overcome the quality defects and prepared consumer acceptable high-protein ice-cream which has similar sensory qualities that of a regular ice-cream,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-ndri-scientists-develop-high-protein-ice-cream-336218

Ten among them are working at PGIMS, Rohtak.Though the DMER cited administrative reasons for the postponement of the interview, sources held intense lobbying done by aspirants for the post responsible for it. The aspirants were informed by the DMER about it through email.“With the development, those doctors who were quite confident of being appointed to the post due to their proximity to influential leaders of the BJP and the RSS have suffered a major setback. They did not think about it as the interview was already rescheduled for November 10, while earlier it was to be conducted on November 9,” said a senior doctor at the PGIMS.As per the sources, the development created rumbling among strong contenders for the post, who remained busy the whole day in finding the exact reason for the deferment of the interview at the eleventh hour. The post of Director fell vacant in July following the retirement of Dr Rohtas Kanwar Yadav, who was given extension till October 17.“The postponement of the interview till further orders has also given an indication that the post may be re-advertised to invite applications from those who could not apply due to any reason. The new date for the interview would have been fixed if any administrative reason came in the way of the selection process,” said the sources.Another doctor at the PGIMS said the development was also being linked to a meeting of the executive council of Pt BD Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, to be held soon as some important items pertaining to senior doctors were likely to be placed in it.Lobbying to blame?Though the Directorate of Medical Education and Research cited administrative reasons for the postponement, sources held intense lobbying by aspirants responsible for it||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/interview-for-rohtak-pgims-director-postponed-336210
