Since it is a busy road||Damaged road leading to mishaps in Rohtak city||Abhishek Saini, RohtakHigh-mast tower lights on during daytimeFor the past three months, careless staff of the Nagar Parishad, after switching on the high-mast tower lights, simply forget to switch it off during the day. Two high-mast towers lights, have 50 bulbs of 1,500 W each, so in 12 hours, each bulb consumes 84 units of power. Each bulb/day costs Rs 420.This means, 50 lights in one day consumes power worth Rs 21,000 and in one month, it's about Rs 6.30 lakh. Consumption of so much power without any purpose is a criminal negligence on behalf of the irresponsible staff of the Nagar Parishad and strict action should be taken against them.Ramesh Gupta, NarwanaCovid's adverse impact on educationIt has been well established that Covid-19 virus has badly impacted the national economy and above all damaged the course of education.

According to information, in a letter written to the Director of the Archaeology and Museum Department on November 22, the Chief Executive Engineer of the HSHDB said during the visit of the Deputy Chairman of the HSHDB in Sandhai village, they found some ancient coins.

The government will start the conservation of this ancient monument which is linked to Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib.The Deputy Director of the Haryana Archaeology Department, Banani Bhattacharya, said the state government had declared the building of the fort as protected monument and archaeological site and open areas adjoining the building as the protected area under the Haryana Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964.Bhattacharya said the state government had decided to conserve the site. “Now, the state Public Works Department will prepare the budget estimate and the Archaeology Department will bear the cost of the works,” he said.The ancient fort has been facing decades of official apathy. The people residing in the town are also unaware of the historical importance of the site and the entire place has turned into a hideout for anti-social elements.Bhattacharya said the total area of the fort was about 64 kanal and 18 marla (about eight acres) located in the interior of Loharu town. The fort was built in 1570 by Thakur Arjun Singh as a ‘kuccha’ mud fort and stayed as such till 1800. The fort witnessed two major conflicts and later was taken control of by the state of Alwar. It later became the ‘paragana’ under the state of Ferozpur Jhirka, which was ruled by Nawab Ahmed Baksh Khan in 1803. Then the ‘pucca’ construction of the fort started which turned out to be an interesting blend of three styles of architecture, including Rajputs, Mughals and British styles, stated the notification of the Haryana Government.The Loharu Fort is famously known as the ‘sasural’ of acclaimed Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib who was married to Umrao Begum, daughter of Mirza Ilahi Bakhsh Khan, younger brother of the Nawab of Loharu Ahmad Bakhsh Khan. Though the present generation of residents does not have much knowledge about its history, the culture and architecture lovers maintained that the Loharu Fort was an attraction for heritage experts and should be protected and developed as a tourist spot, so that its historical importance could be preserved.Looking backThe Loharu Fort is famously known as the ‘sasural’ of acclaimed Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib who was married to Umrao Begum, daughter of Mirza Ilahi Bakhsh Khan, younger brother of Nawab of Loharu Ahmad Bakhsh Khan.PWD to make budgetThe state Public Works Department will prepare the budget estimate and the Archaeology Department will bear the cost of the works.

High pollution load due to stone crushers, auto emission and road dust are believed to be the main causes behind the spike.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), in its recent report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in connection with a case, has also disclosed that the pollution load generated by industrial and domestic activities, including transportation, is over the assimilative carrying capacity of the environment in the areas where stone crushers are being operated.As per sources, a total of 21,329 persons suffering from airborne diseases visited various government hospitals in the district in 2011 and the number shot up to 36,211 in 2020. The figure was close to 40,000 in 2018 and 2019.The number of patients is reported to be much higher than the official figure as patients coming to private hospitals had not been included in it, sources add.“Dholera, Khatoli Ahir, Bigopur, Gangu Tana, Bayal, Meghot Binja, Bakhrija, Kultazpur, Zerpur and Garhi are the worst-affected villages due to their close proximity to stone crushers. Many such units are being run in violation of the parameters set to control pollution. As per the norms, the units are bound to install water sprayers to manage the dust extraction, but most of them hardly bother about it,” said Tejpal Yadav of Khatoli Ahir, who is fighting a case against the erring stone crushers in the NGT.He said since the district too had mining zones, hence heavy vehicles that transported the minerals and stones were also polluting the environment badly.“A considerable number of children are asthmatic, forcing the parents to take extra care of them when the stone crushers emit dust. The polluted environment is adversely affecting trees and crops too. Thick layers of dust can be seen on the leaves of trees,” said Krishan of Dulhera village.Meanwhile, Civil Surgeon Dr Ashok Kumar said stone crushers and other industrial units might be one of the major reasons behind the rising number of airborne diseases in the district. “The data has been collected only from government health centres in the district,” he added.Children becoming asthmaticOne or more person at every house in my village has been suffering from respiratory and skin-related diseases due to dust emission.
