Vendors are fleecing customers at their whims and fancy, defeating the very purpose of establishing the Kisan Bazaar. The Market Committee is obliged not only to display and update daily rates but also ensure that customers get correct quality and quantity of their purchase along with telephone number for the complaint and its redressal, if required.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaNirjhar Vatika in Panchkula cries for maintenanceA classic example of wastage of public money can be seen at Nirjhar Vatika, Sector 5, Panchkula, where due to lack of upkeep and regular maintenance, the park is in a deplorable condition. Public money has been utilised to create facilities of lighting, music, seating, etc for park users, but due to lack of concern more than half of lights and speakers installed there are non functional. The walking track made of tiles is damaged due to frequent digging for laying of cables in the park. The evening walkers face problems due to darkness in park, as there is a lurking danger of slithering reptiles there. There is lot wild growth due to non-existent trimming and gardening in the park, especially on the feature created for waterfall on the raised hilltop inside it. A snake of about 3 to 4 feet length was sighted there continuously for two days. The authorities concerned for the maintenance of the park should get up from their deep slumber and get into action.Rakesh Jolly, PanchkulaIs a civic issue bothering you?

The advocate asserts that the same is being done on the basis of Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order which was issued by the SEC from time to time usually before elections which also defined political parties.He asserted that such an order was not in consonance with either the Haryana Municipal Act, 1973 or the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 since both laws have no provision for conduct of municipal elections on the basis of political parties.Also there is no mention in this regard in Haryana Municipal Election Rules, 1978 as well as Haryana Municipal Corporation Election Rules, 1994 framed by the state government for conduct of civil polls, he added.Earlier this year, neighbouring Himachal Pradesh amended its Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 to make provision for elections of MCs in the state on symbols of political parties after which elections to four MCs in the state viz. Dharamsala, Palampur, Mandi and Solan were possible on party symbols of political parties.Symbols of parties cannot be allottedIn the notice, Hemant Kumar, advocate at the Punjab and Haryana High Court, contended that though election symbols can be allotted to contesting candidates by the Returning Officer (RO) concerned from the list of free symbols but the reserved symbols of political parties such as lotus of BJP, hand of Congress, key of JJP and spectacles of INLD could not be allotted since there was no provision in existing state municipal laws||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/notice-to-haryana-ec-on-nominees-contesting-civic-body-polls-on-reserved-symbols-338282

All units were illegal as these had no CTO, CTE or any other approval from the board, he said.Also, the units did not have any effluent treatment plant (ETP) and were discharging effluents directly into the drains, the RO said.The HSPCB had also found 42 illegal denim dyeing units at the Pyau Manyari and Friends Colony in the Kundli area of Sonepat earlier. The HSPCB had served closure notices to these 42 units around two months ago.Violations galoreThe units were found running illegally without no-objection certificate from HSPCB.
