We are celebrating Gurpurab and have got the good news. It’s the power of the farmers and common man that the Prime Minister had to bow down,” said Parminder Singh, another farmer, who said they would not return home until the President signed the repeal bill.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-at-tikri-border-happy-at-repeal-announcement-but-in-no-mood-to-budge-till-formalities-are-completed-340231

The direction came after the Bench took cognisance of the authority’s failure to communicate its decisions, resulting in the filing of petitions.Communication gapParticipants in a large number of cases were being forced to file pleas before the High Court following the failure of the respondent-authorities to communicate any decision on the bid. HC BenchThe ruling by Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa and Justice Vinod S Bhardwaj came on a petition filed by Rameshwar Dass Saini against the State of Haryana and other respondents.He was seeking directions to the respondents, including Vikas Pradhikaran, to confirm the sale of a booth in Panipat in his favour as he was the highest bidder.Before parting with the petition, the Bench asserted it was required to be “pertinently mentioned” that the participants in a large number of cases were being forced to file pleas before the High Court following the failure of the respondent-authorities to communicate any decision on the bid submitted by the highest bidder.“It was only when the bidder approached the court that the respondent-Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran conveyed its decision. It would only be appropriate and in the fitness of things aimed to ensure transparency and fairness in procedure that the respondent-authorities evolve an appropriate mechanism to ensure communication of the decision taken on the bid submitted by the highest bidder,” the Bench asserted.The Bench also expressed the hope that the respondent authorities, in doing so, would not only save the litigant of unnecessary harassment in approaching the courts, but shall also evoke trust and confidence in its action.Referring to the facts of the case, the Bench observed the petitioner’s bid was not accepted as it was, in the opinion of the competent authority, below the reserve price. The Bench added the counsel could not point out any provision under the e-auction policy, which would obligate the respondents to accept the highest bid.“We are of the considered view that in a case of disposal of public property, the question whether the right of a person who has put in the highest bid in the public auction is to be preferred over the right of the public in ensuring that valuable public assets are not disposed of except for a fair price, public interest ought to prevail,” the Bench added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-hsvp-evolve-mechanism-to-convey-info-about-auctions-339908

It exposes the inefficiency of this government,” he said.“Farming and fertilisers are expensive, edible oil is expensive, diesel and petrol are expensive, LPG has become expensive, steel bars and cement are expensive, medicines are expensive, even wood used in cremation ground has become expensive,” he alleged.Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda alleged that the JJP, which won three seats of Jind district out of 10 Assembly seats in the state in the previous elections, has betrayed the faith shown by the people in the JJP. “The electorate of Julana, Uchana and Narwana punished the BJP and voted for the JJP in 2019. But the JJP joined hands with the BJP which is a betrayal of the people of these segments,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/resentment-rife-on-price-rise-bhupinder-singh-hooda-339911

There were several other reasons, apart from stubble burning, like factories, vehicles, construction activities etc responsible for pollution in Delhi and NCR.He said this in response to a question regarding Delhi’s CM Arvind Kejriwal allegations that stubble burning in neighbouring states was also causing air pollution. “The allegations are baseless. I am not denying that stubble burning is not a contributor towards air pollution, but there are several other reasons for this,” said Khattar during his visit to Karnal.On being asked whether the government was planning to follow Delhi’s odd-even formula, Khattar said it would be decided on Friday.About any impact of farmers’ agitation in the UP election, he said it would have no impact on UP.Earlier, Khattar expressed condolences on the sudden demise of veteran RSS leader and businessman of the city Satpal Nagal at his residence.

The dues have been pending since last season.As per rules, payments are to be cleared within 14 days of the purchase of sugarcane. The next season of sugarcane crushing will start on November 23.Ganna Kisan Sangharsh Samiti president Vinod Rana said, “Around Rs 63 crore of the previous season is pending. This includes cash payment of Rs 27.5 crore and Rs 35 crore, for which post-dated cheques have been issued.”He further said this was not the first time that payment had been delayed. “A couple of years ago, the mill authorities had released the dues following repeated agitations. Subsequently, the government had taken control of the ailing private sugar mill, but it, too, has failed to released money on time,” said Rana.“Delayed payment forced farmers to sell off their produce to sugarcane crushers at cheaper rates. Farmers are likely to divert their produce to the Yamunanagar mill and in Punjab, besides selling to sugarcane crushers to get timely payment,” he added.Sub-divisional Magistrate (SDM) Niraj, who is also the mill’s CEO, said: “Farmers have been assured that the cash dues will be cleared by December 31 and the payments of the new season will start from January 1.”Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) district chief Malkit Singh said, “Farmers are being harassed to get their due. This is unacceptable. A panchayat will be convened on January 3 to assess the situation. If the mill fails to fulfil its promise by then, the union will give the call for agitation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/clear-rs-27-5-cr-dues-by-december-or-face-stir-farmers-to-naraingarh-sugar-mill-339912

Politics is not SKM’s domain. The farmers’ outfit will oppose anyone with the political motive,” said Rajewal.He, however, denied any rift in the SKM.Charuni had yesterday called off his outfit’s Tikri march, claiming that he did not want to send out a wrong message in view of the SKM’s “padyatra”. He had also said Punjab leaders were jealous of him because of, what he claimed to be, his popularity.“Charuni’s popularity can be gauged by the fact that only 80 persons assemble whenever he calls a meeting,” said Rajewal.On the SKM’s November 24 march to the Delhi borders, Rajewal said: “The farmers’ outfit will review the decision on the march in the next meeting. The march will be up to Singhu and Tikri borders, not India Gate.”About his statement to the inquiry committee, he said: “I told the commission that I was not in Karnal on August 28. Action must be taken against IAS officer Ayush Sinha for his ‘break the head’ remark.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/samyukta-kisan-morcha-to-show-black-flags-to-gurnam-singh-charuni-in-punjab-339924

According to a notification issued by the state government, doctors intending to enrol in these courses will have to shell out a total fee of up to Rs 16.5 lakh per annum, an amount that stood at nearly Rs 8.85 lakh earlier.The highest tuition fee of Rs 14.02 lakh per annum will have to be paid by doctors wanting to pursue MD/MS in clinical specialties, including general surgery, general medicine, orthopaedics, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, ophthalmology, anaesthesiology, radiotherapy and respiratory medicine.Besides tuition fee, medical students will have to shell out about Rs 2.5 lakh per year by way of other charges. There is also a provision of 10 per cent hike in tuition fee per year for the three-year courses in private medical colleges affiliated to Pt BD Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak.The para-clinical specialties such as forensic medicine, pathology, microbiology and community medicine will carry a total annual fee of over Rs 8 lakh, including Rs 5.52 lakh tuition fee. The annual tuition fee for pre-clinical specialties, including anatomy, physiology and biochemistry, has been pegged at around Rs 6 lakh (Rs 3.52 tuition fee) annually.The notification, issued by Siddhi Nath Roy, Additional Chief Secretary, Medical Education and Research Department, however, has fixed the fee for these courses in government medical colleges much below the private ones.
