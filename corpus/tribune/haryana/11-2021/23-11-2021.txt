"This is bigger than the Vyapam scam," he said.Last week, Nagar and two others were arrested by the State Vigilance Bureau for allegedly manipulating marks of candidates who appeared in the written examination for recruitment of dental surgeons, conducted in September.Nagar is alleged to have demanded and accepted illegal gratification worth crores of rupees.Surjewala said that claims of merit, transparency and no "kharchi parchi (bribe, favouritism)" made by the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana have fallen flat.In addition to the latest scam, there have been 32 more paper leak cases during the last seven years of the BJP-led government in the state, he claimed.This government is playing with the future of the youth, Surjewala said."We demand an investigation by an SIT (in the latest scam) directly monitored by the chief justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court," he said.The Congress leader said that the HPSC and the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) should be disbanded immediately as these have become centres of recruitment scams and new bodies should be formed."We also demand that the HPSC and the HSSC be disbanded without delay so that an independent inquiry can be conducted," he said.Before any new recruitment, a panel of experts should be formed and their recommendations should be made public before being implemented, Surjewala said."We also demand that Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar apologise to the youth of Haryana, who have been befooled by this government for the last seven years in the name of merit and transparency in recruitments," he said.He alleged that the HPSC has become "Haryana Posts Sales Counter" under the BJP-JJP government in the state."We have been continuously raising our voice against the injustice with the youth and all-round corruption prevailing in Haryana job recruitments," he said."While jobs are being sold, papers are being leaked, blank OMR sheets are getting filled after exams and roll numbers are being arranged one after the other to give benefit to favourite candidates, and whatever happens, Khattar sahab keeps making claims of giving jobs on merit and transparency in recruitments," Surjewala said.The Congress leader asked who had given the responsibility of management and maintaining secrecy of all important recruitments to a junior state service officer like Nagar, who had joined service only four years back, while bypassing the IAS level HPSC secretary.The Khattar government has virtually privatised both the recruitment commissions and conduct of examinations in the name of improving recruitment, he alleged."Private companies are preparing papers and private companies are managing the centres. They are issuing roll numbers and conducting recruitment exams. They are scanning OMR sheets and these private companies are preparing results," Surjewala said. ‚Äî PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hpsc-recruitment-scam-surjewala-demands-high-court-monitored-probe-by-sit-341920

The MC, however, adopted a formal resolution condemning the Health Department for its failure to contain the dengue spread.In a meeting of the Health Department chaired by the Civil Surgeon last week, the officials said they had written letters to the MC about the stagnant water in vacant plots and open spaces in the town after the untimely rains. Even the fogging carried out by the MC officials seemed to be merely an eyewash.Meanwhile, Dr Subhash Khatreja, District Malaria Officer, informed the meeting that the stagnant water had resulted in the outbreak of vector-borne diseases in the town. Civil Surgeon Dr Ratna Bharti too had stated that the Health Department had carried out several activities such as house-to-house inspection for the cleaning of water coolers and tanks etc.The MC in its meeting, however, moved and adopted a censure motion on the statement of the Health Department and said apparently it was caught off guard in its preparations to tackle the outbreak of vector-borne diseases after monsoon, which had resulted in the increasing number of dengue cases. The MC said they should complain about the about the laxity of health officials to the higher authorities and demanded action against them.According to the official health bulletin, eight more dengue cases were reported on Monday, taking the tally to 917. Dr Khatreja said 812 patients had recovered from the disease while 102 were still recuperating.

For the purpose of filing a detailed affidavit on the issue, Justice Puri gave the State counsel time till December‚Äôs first week.The accused, Abhishek, alias Monu, had moved the HC through counsel PS Ahluwalia and Shivansh Malik for transferring the probe to the CBI or any other SIT constituted under the supervision of a senior IPS officer. Elaborating, the counsel added that the investigation had not been carried out in a proper and fair manner.Going into the background, they added that the petitioner was a ‚Äúyoung boy aged 20‚Äù. The accusation against him was that he killed his father, mother, sister and maternal grandmother in a single incident.The police lodged the FIR only against him to shield the culprits on the grounds that he was demanding Rs 5 lakh for ‚Äúpersonal purpose‚Äù from his parent and committed the offence and since the same was refused.

It comprised a senior IPS officer, two deputy superintendents of police and CIA in charge. ‚ÄúOn the basis of the investigation, it was found that it is only the petitioner who had committed this offence,‚Äù he added.‚ÄúHowever, on being asked by this court from the State counsel as to whether the SIT has gone into all other aspects with regard to the property dealings of the father of the petitioner, he submitted that he may be granted some time to file a detailed affidavit in the present case,‚Äù Justice Puri observed, while issuing notice of motion on the plea to the State and three other respondents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rohtak-killings-accused-son-suggests-property-angle-hc-demands-affidavit-341584

He got another call on November 18 when the caller identified himself as Jogender Gyong from Kaithal district, who happened to be brother of notorious gangster Surender Gyong who had been killed in an encounter by the police years ago.The accused repeated the ransom demand of Rs 25 lakh while issuing threats to the life of the trader and verbally abused him. The 1.22-minute audio has gone viral on social media. The trader later lodged an FIR in the Hisar city police station. SHO Kaptan Singh said the police had been trying to locate the accused and his mobile number had been traced, but it had turned out to be issued on a fake ID. He said the police had deployed security guards for the trader and promised that the police would soon arrest the accused. ‚Äî TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hisar-traders-threaten-bandh-on-ransom-calls-341596

23-11-2021||The ongoing construction in a haphazard manner and without adhering to norms and regulations has emerged as a major cause of air pollution in the city. Despite tall claims by the authorities||Haphazard construction cause of air pollution||Ajay Bahl, faridabadPathetic condition of road in BhiwaniThe condition of the road in front of the local mini secretariat is in very bad shape. The road has innumerable bumps and potholes are an invitation to accidents. The movement of vehicular traffic also results in raising of dust throughout the day. Due to this, residents of the Old Housing Board are very upset. The people here have demanded that the district administration reconstruct this road at the earliest so that the people here do not have to face any kind of trouble while commuting.Jaikumar Gupta, BhiwaniPoor show by Panchkula MCWith reference to ‚Äú81st to 99th -Panchkula downslide continues‚Äù (Chandigarh Tribune, November 21), it was intriguing to observe that Panchkula has slipped to the 99th position in the Swachh Survekshan-2021, registering a significant fall from last year's 81st in the category of 1 to 10 lakh population. Significantly, from a ranking of 211 in 2017, the city rose to the 142nd rank in 2018 and further advanced to the 71st position the following year. The city administration had 'aspired' to climb to the first position from its 56th position (in 2020) at the national level and overall third in the state. But, the city MC's abject failure to ensure better garbage management, visibly poor services rendered by the private bodies towards door to door collection could be behind its putting up such a poor show. How come that it has been concentrating more on sprucing up its revenue kitty by levying one new charge or the other, yet showing such a dismal performance on ground zero?Vinayak G, PanchkulaWhat our readers sayIs a civic issue bothering you?
