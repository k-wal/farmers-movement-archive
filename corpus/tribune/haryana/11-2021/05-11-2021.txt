Police sources said the assailants attacked the family of a former sarpanch out of an old grudge. One of the four wounded is believed to be critical. The others are stable, said police sources. Six armed assailants came to former sarpanch Gopal Raghav's house at 8.15 pm. A woman was the first to be attacked, but the house pet, a dog, protected her, police sources said. The assailants then forced their way into the house, shot at the occupants, and fled.   Police have identified the chief suspect as Rinku alias Yogender, who allegedly planned the attack. Police have booked Rinku and some others for murder (Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code) and sections of the Arms Act, among other things. Police sources said that the attack was likely an act of revenge for the murder of Rinku's brother Manoj by Sohan Lal, one of the two victims who died of Friday's attack, back in 2007.  Lal and his friends got into a brawl with Rinku's brother at a liquor shop and shot him dead.  Sohan Lal was found eventually guilty of the crime and was serving jail time but was released on parole recently, police sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/diwali-night-attack-armed-assailants-kill-two-wound-four-334339
05-11-2021||Chandigarh||Out of 22 cities with ‘Severe’ AQI, 10 are in HaryanaNoida, Gurugram are the most polluted in the country||Out of 22 cities recording ‘Severe’ Air Quality Index (AQI) in the country post-Diwali, 10 were located in Haryana.“Severe” AQI implies that air quality affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.Out of the eight most polluted cities in the country, four were from the state. This has happened despite a cracker ban in 14 NCR districts, as per the NGT order, and in the remaining districts also except in Panchkula, the ban was imposed based on the last year’s November air quality data.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), from 4 pm of November 4 to 4 pm of November 5 (24-hour average) which included the period of bursting crackers, Noida recorded the worst AQI at 475, followed by Gurugram (472), Ghaziabad (470), Faridabad (469), Greater Noida (464), Jind (462), Ballabgarh (462) and Delhi (462).     The AQI in 0-50 falls in 'Good', 51-100 in 'Satisfactory', 101-200 in 'Moderate' and 201-300 in 'Poor' categories. If the AQI is between 301-400, it is ‘Very Poor’ and causes respiratory illness. If it is above 401, it falls in the “Severe” category and has respiratory effects even on healthy people. Other Haryana cities which included ‘Severe’ AQI included Manesar (458), Bhiwani (437), Rohtak (437), Charkhi Dadri (424), Panipat (413), and Hisar (405).  Besides this, 10 places in the state recorded ‘Very Poor’ AQI, which included Sonipat (400), Dharuhera (383), Narnaul (377), Kaithal (377), Kurukshetra (354), Mandikhera (336), Fatehabad (330), Karnal (329), Palwal (314) and Ambala (301).   “It has largely happened due to the flouting of the ban on bursting of firecrackers. The local administration must have taken action over the flouting of the ban. The winter season is also contributing to the rise in the level of pollution,” S.Narayanan, Member Secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said. There were 228 and 331 stubble burning events in the state on November 4 and November 5 respectively, according to HSPCB. Till today, there were 3,997 events since September 15 as compared to 6,815 last year. There is a fall of 41.3 per cent.   But Haryana has been witnessing continued ‘Severe’ and ‘Very Poor’ AQI for some days.   “Stubble burning is not the sole reason for continued ‘Severe’ and ‘Very Poor’ AQI in Haryana. The bursting of firecrackers will give you a peak for a day or two. Actually, during the winter season, the atmospheric boundary comes down significantly. So, even with the same emissions, the level of pollution increases. The air becomes stagnant. The cloudy weather also contributes to the formation of secondary particles,” said Additional Professor Ravindra Khaiwal, from the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER, Chandigarh.He added, “In Haryana, rise in vehicular density and burning of municipal solid waste has also contributed to pollution in small cities”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/out-of-22-cities-with-severe-aqi-10-are-in-haryananoida-gurugram-are-the-most-polluted-in-the-country-334314
