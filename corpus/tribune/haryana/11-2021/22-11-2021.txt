After Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that the three farm laws will be repealed, industrialists are hopeful that their situation will improve.Paid for bad roadsAs many as 20 per cent industries have been shut down, scores of others shifted from Kundli, and hundreds of labourers moved out in the course of the year-long movement.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at Delhi borders since November 26 last year.The farmers’ protest spread over 8 km from Kundli to the main roundabout of the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) and the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal (KGP) expressways.Subhash Gupta, president of the Kundli Industrial Association, said the Kundli industrial zone was the worst affected due to the farmers’ movement.Of the 1,800 industries in the Kundli industrial area, 20 per cent were shut down and the remaining, which were running from rented accommodations, have been shifted.Gupta claimed farmers had blocked all four entry points to the industrial zone.Dheeraj Chaudhary, an industrialist, said Sonepat was a hub of micro, smalland medium enterprises (MSMEs), but the production had reduced over 30 per cent, which was a big setback.Rakesh Devgun, chairman, Haryana Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Sonepat chapter, and president of the Rai Industries Estate Manufacturers Association, said Sonepat was a hub of MSME units. “It is a hub of stainless steel and auto parts exports and Rai is the biggest focal point for packaging and printing in the northern zone,” he said. As many as 13,000 registered and 7,000 unregistered units are there in Kundli, Nathupur, Rai, Barhi, Dhaturi, Ram Nagar, Liwaspur and Bahalgarh of Sonepat district, he said.Buyers have cancelled export orders as they are unable to reach industries due to road blockades. Besides, the cost of production has increased, with the cost of raw materials, transportation and logistics charges having gone up because of the blockades. Around 30 per cent of labourers have now migrated to Noida, Ghaziabad and other industrial areas, Devgun added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sonepat-industry-suffers-rs-35-000-cr-loss-in-a-year-341307

Besides, RS Verma, Maheshwar Sharma and Pardeep Godara will also retire by next year.Sources said the BJP-JJP government had initiated informal consultations for zeroing in on the probable candidate from among the three officers — Sanjeev Kaushal, VS Kundu and PK Das. Kaushal, currently the Financial Commissioner, Revenue, the post which is considered to be a stepping stone for elevation as the Chief Secretary, is the senior-most officer in the state administration and is being considered as the frontrunner.While Kaushal has sufficient service left with his retirement due on July 31, 2024, Das is set to retire on July 31, 2022 and Kundu’s superannuation is on December 31, 2022.

National Green Tribunal orderIt has been revealed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in its report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in connection with a case filed by a local youth accusing stone crushers of throwing norms to the wind.The report reveals that the total pollution generation due to industrial and domestic activities, including transportation (auto emission and road dust etc), is over the assimilative carrying capacity of the study area in the district.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board has recommended that new stone crushers and non-compliant units may not be allowed to operate. The remaining may be allowed to function, subject to safeguards such as water sprinkling, covering of the conveyor belt to minimise dust generation, paving the roads to curb pollution during transportation and undertaking regular health surveys, said sources.Acting on the report, the NGT has formed a six-member joint committee, comprising officials of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Haryana State Pollution Control Board, District Magistrate, conservator (Forest), nominee of IIT-Delhi with an expertise on air pollution and a pulmonologist nominated by the Director General (Health).

Of these, 56 cases have been confirmed on the ground and over Rs 1.47 lakh as environmental relief has been recovered from the violators - Dr Girish Nagpal, Deputy Director, AgricultureAs per the information, farmers have adopted the in-situ management methods on around 30,000 acres this year as compared to last year’s 5,000 acres.However, a fall has been witnessed in the ex-situ crop residue management. Last year, around 1,500 farmers had sought incentive for not burning residue on around 10,000 acres. But this year, just 236 farmers have got themselves registered for not burning residue on 1,786 acres so far.An official said due to the low availability of balers and the issue of ‘proof of sale’, which was required to get the incentive, a majority of the farmers had shifted to in-situ crop residue management. Meanwhile, Deputy Director, Agriculture, Dr Girish Nagpal said: “A fall has been registered in the number of farm fires this year and the prime reason is the interest shown by the farmers in the in-situ crop residue management. Under this method, the crop residue is mixed in the soil. Around 30,000 acres have been covered so far and it is likely to increase further. In the long run, the technique will improve soil health and the farmers’ requirement to use fertilisers will decrease. The farmers who manage the residue on an individual level should get the bills from the industry/ aggregator/machine operators and produce it to get the incentive of Rs 1,000 per acre for the ex-situ measures.”Deputy Commissioner Vikram Singh, however, said: “Efforts are being made to educate farmers about the ill-effects of burning crop residue. Campaigns are being run at the village level and rallies were also organised by government school students on Thursday to motivate the farmers to not to burn the residue.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ambala-district-sees-rise-in-in-situ-crop-residue-management-341323
