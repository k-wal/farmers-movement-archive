The BJP-JJP had fielded celebrated wrestler Yogeshwar Datt on the Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. However, greenhorn Indu Raj Narwal registered an impactful victory by about 10,000 votes.Similarly, the Ellenabad bypoll was almost a challenge for the ruling coalition when sitting MLA Abhay Singh Chautala tendered his resignation.The Bharatiya Janata Partybrought in Sirsa MLA Gopal Kanda’s brother Gobind Kanda in the party fold and fielded him as nominee. The Kanda brothers — Gopal and Gobind — launched a spirited campaign which was boosted |by the Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala.However, the development plank failed to help the ruling coalition in the by-elections.The Opposition leaders even accused the ruling BJP of resorting to caste polarisation and misusing the official machinery in the elections.“The successive defeats in bypolls must serve as a warning to the ruling coalition. It needs to ponder over the prevailing issues, including infrastructure, employment avenues for youth, industrialisation etc, which can attract people rather than banking on caste combinations and permutations,” the political expert stated.Focus should be on real issuesThe coalition needs to ponder over issues like infrastructure, employment, industrialisation etc which can attract people rather than on caste combinations and permutations. — Pawan K Bansal, political expert||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ellenabad-bypoll-two-defeats-in-two-years-a-setback-to-bjp-jjp-coalition-334090

The couple, under the circumstances, was not entitled to protection.The ruling by Justice Ashok Kumar Verma’s Bench came on a petition filed by a couple for directing the State and its functionaries to protect their life and liberty as they were in a “live-in-relationship” against the wishes of their relations.Justice Verma asserted that the woman, about 23, was legally wedded wife of a respondent. She was living a lustful and adulterous life with the co-petitioner without seeking divorce from her spouse. “Once the petitioner is a married woman, being the wife of a respondent, the act of petitioners, particularly the co-petitioner, may constitute an offence under Sections 494/495 of the Indian Penal Code. Such a relationship does not fall within the phrase `live-in relationship’ or `relationship’ in the nature of marriage”.The offence of bigamy or marrying again during the lifetime of a husband or a wife is punishable under Section 494 of the IPC.Referring to the facts of the case in hand, Justice Verma asserted that the petitioners were not having legal right for protection on the basis of the facts of the present matter as protection being asked may amount to protection against the commission of offence under Section 494/495 of the Indian Penal Code.Before parting with the case, Justice Verma asserted that the petition had been filed just to obtain “a seal of this court on their so-called live-in relationship”.Besides, representation by the petitioners to the police for protection, on the face of it, appeared to be a fake document as no receipt or diary number by the office of the police officer concerned was given or attached.“In view of it, the present petition is dismissed,” Justice Verma concluded. Punishable under lawThe offence of bigamy or marrying again during the lifetime of a husband or a wife is punishable under Section 494 of the IPC.
