In such cases, removal or movement of penetrating rods should be avoided as it may lead to fatal hemorrhage,” Dr Lohchab said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/doctors-at-pgims-rohtak-surgically-remove-two-iron-rods-piercing-youths-chest-332403

The farmers also deployed their volunteers at the entry point to keep a tab on the movement.“The decision to open the border up to 5 ft has been taken keeping in view the problem being faced by large number of factory workers while commuting to Bahadurgarh from Delhi daily on motorbikes and cycles. Among four-wheelers, only ambulances will be allowed to go to Delhi so that ailing people do not have to wait for getting treatment,” said Buta Singh, a Bharatiya Kisan Union leader, after the meeting.Buta Singh maintained three-wheelers of Delhi and Haryana would be able to drop people some distance away from the border, but those would not be allowed to cross the border. Commuters would be able to cross the border on foot to take another auto-rickshaw on the other side, he added.“Four-wheelers are not being allowed over safety concerns. The vehicles may pose a serious threat to life of protesters as three Punjabi women were mowed down by a truck some days ago,” he added.Waseem Akram, Superintendent of Police, Jhajjar, said initially, a 5-ft way at Tikri border had been opened for two-wheelers and ambulances on temporary basis. Further possibility would be looked into.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/tikri-border-opened-for-two-wheelers-332260

This number rose to 721 in 2020, which included 590 men and 131 women, a jump of 76.3 per cent.280 farm labourers ended life in 2020Unemployment was the reason for 27 suicides in 2020 while in 2019 the figure was 13. A total of 4,001 people ended their lives in the state in 2020, which included 3,084 men and 917 women. As the figure in 2019 was 4,191, a dip of 4.5 per cent was noted.The higher the economic status, lesser is the chance for a person to commit suicide.

31-10-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Carriageway on road connecting Delhi to Haryana opened after 11 months||After 11 months, authorities on Saturday opened one carriageway of the road from Delhi to Haryana after barricades were removed at the Tikri border where thousands of farmers have been agitating against the three agri laws.The carriageway was opened following meetings between farm union leaders and the police.The Delhi Police on Thursday evening started removing the barricades and concertina wires it had put at Tikri Border on the Delhi-Rohtak highway.The police had also removed similar blockades on one of the carriageways of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at Ghazipur border on Friday. However, traffic on the stretch has not yet started.Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer) Parwinder Singh said, “We had a meeting with the farmer leaders in the morning and later around 1 pm, the stretch going towards Haryana from Delhi has been opened and the traffic movement has started.“The leaders were saying that the traffic be allowed for a particular timing, however, we have opened the road for 24 hours. The commuters with small vehicles can pass through the road.”Singh said the farm union leaders have expressed apprehension that since their tents are on the road, in case heavy vehicles drive through and hit any of the protesters, a law-and-order issue would be created.“There is no space for heavy vehicles to ply there and that is why, we have decided to now allow such vehicles, including truck and busses on that stretch,” Singh said.A farmer leader said traffic movement were allowed on the stretch on Saturday for the light vehicles, including bikes, auto-rickshaws and cars, and ambulances.The opening of the road stretch at the Tikri border would help thousands of commuters of Bahadurgarh and Delhi as well as those travelling between the national capital and going to Rajasthan from Haryana.While the police removed a large portion of the barricades, wirings and iron nails from NH-9 (the Delhi-Meerut Expressway flyover) at Ghazipur border by Friday evening, the tents and other temporary structures erected by the protesters continued to remain there.Multiple layers of iron and cement barricades along with concertina wires were put up by the police last year. The arrangements were further beefed up after the January 26 violence in Delhi during the farmers’ protest against three new agriculture laws of the Centre.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait had said the future course of the protest would be chalked out by the SKM.BKU office-bearers had said the farmers want to go to Delhi once the barricades are completely removed and are open to talks with the Centre to resolve the situation.BKU spokesperson Saurabh Upadhyay had earlier said, “If the government wants the logjam to end, it should talk to the farmers now and we are ready for it. But if it wants the farmers’ movement to continue, we are determined to prolong it as it has already been 11 months since the protests began.” Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Priyanka Kashyap had said, “The process of removing the barricades from National Highway 9 has started. The temporary barricading is being removed to ease out vehicular movement. However, National Highway 24 was already open for traffic.”Kashyap had said the police have removed the barricades on their end and are ready for vehicular movement.The process to remove the barricades started following the October 21 Supreme Court direction, calling for unblocking of the roads that have remained out of bounds for commuters due to the anti-farm laws protests at Delhi’s border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur.While the protesting farmers have been claiming that the three laws enacted last year are against their interest, the Centre has been maintaining that these legislations are pro-farmer.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, protesting the three contentious laws since November 26, 2020.The Supreme Court had, on October 21, said the farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders have the right to agitate but they cannot block the roads indefinitely.

31-10-2021||Sirsa||80 per cent voting recorded in Ellenabad bypoll in Haryana||By-elections for Haryana's Ellenabad Assembly constituency saw 80 per cent voting as ballots closed on Saturday. The resignation of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Chautala in January to protest the Centre's new farm laws had made by-elections for the seat necessary.The polling began at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm.More than 1.86 lakh voters will decide the fate of 19 candidates, including Chautala, Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal and BJP-JJP candidate Gobind Kanda.A total of 211 polling booths have been set up and 121 of these have been categorised as “vulnerable” and “most vulnerable”, the officials said.Tight security arrangements have been made for the bypoll with the deployment of 34 companies of paramilitary forces and police personnel from different districts.Gobind Kanda, the brother of Haryana Lokhit Party chief and legislator Gopal Kanda, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) recently.Beniwal, who had unsuccessfully contested the previous Assembly polls against Chautala, recently switched over from the BJP to the Congress.Chautala, Beniwal and Kanda are locked in a triangular contest in the Ellenabad bypoll.Beniwal cast his vote in Darba Kalan village in the morning.District Election Officer Anish Yadav said polling is going on peacefully, while a Haryana Police official said strict action will be taken against anyone who tries to disturb the ongoing election process and law and order.The officials said the polling was being conducted according to the COVID-19 guidelines.Chautala had won the Rori Assembly bypoll in Sirsa district in 2000 and the 2010 bypoll from Ellenabad, when INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala vacated the seat to retain the Uchana seat in Jind district—the other constituency from which he had contested the election in 2009 and won.In the 2010 bypolls in Ellenabad, Abhay Chautala won the seat and retained it in 2014 too. He again won from Ellenabad in the 2019 Assembly polls, when he was the lone INLD MLA to enter the House.Winning the bypoll is crucial for Chautala as a loss will deal a body blow to the INLD, which in recent years is reeling under a series of electoral setbacks.A major part of the Ellenabad Assembly constituency is rural with people mostly relying on agriculture.The counting of votes will be taken up on November 2, the officials said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/80-per-cent-voting-recorded-in-ellenabad-bypoll-in-haryana-331962
