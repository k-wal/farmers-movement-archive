This is a tremendous victory for the farmers,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The government will also have to take back the three farm laws, he said.In another tweet in Hindi, Surjewala said, “Now our demands are :- Every grain lying in the ‘Mandis’ should be procured and payment made, guidelines for procurement 2021-22 be issued, in view of unseasonal rains and delay in procurement, the moisture content of the crop should be relaxed up to 25 per cent, compensation for the damage of crop be given within seven days.”Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar met Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey on the issue on Saturday in Delhi. “I am happy that the Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey has accepted our request, and procurement will start in Haryana from October 3,” Khattar, who was flanked by his deputy Dushyant Chautala and Agriculture Minister J P Dalal said after the meeting.Chief Minister Channi, who had taken up the issue during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, said that farmers will be satisfied with the decision as it will ensure smooth and hassle-free procurement.The procurement of Kharif crops - Paddy and Millet- was earlier to start from October 1, but due to heavy rains, the central government had postponed the procurement till October 11 as the moisture content in fresh arrivals was beyond permissible limits.The decision irked farmers and many of them protested on Saturday in several parts of the two states, laying siege to the houses of many ministers, MPs and MLAs.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the agitation against the three central agri laws, had on Friday had given a call for holding protests outside the residences of legislators in Punjab and Haryana.

They even closed the doors of the market committee offices and staged a dharna there.A large number of farmers came with their paddy crop in Karnal grain markets, but were asked to wait till October 11, leading to resentment among them. The farmers also announced to protest outside the CM camp office on Saturday against this order.Farmers fear any weather change might damage the crop in the fields. “Earlier, the government had assured to start paddy procurement of PR varieties from September 25 and later from October 1, but now when we came here with our grains, the government has announced to purchase it from October 11, which is a gimmick with us,” said Shiv Kumar, a farmer who had come to the grain market with paddy.Fear of rainRain is expected in coming days also, so I got my paddy harvested yesterday, but when I came here, I was asked to wait for at least 10 days.

Fearing this trend in coming days, the farmers have been staging dharnas on Delhi borders as the government wants to eliminate the mandi system and also to promote private players,” said Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, member, state core committee (BKU) (Charuni), who led the protest outside the market committee office.The Karnal Arhtiyas Association also extended support to the farmers and joined the dharna. “A large number of farmers have already reached grain markets in the district to sell their crops. Till October 11, around 70 per cent of paddy is harvested.

They refused to unload the trollies of the farmers along with cleaning and threshing. “We will continue our strike till the revoking of the government order of reducing labour rates from Rs12.72 to Rs8.52 per bag.

The Bench has also made it clear that the employer’s subjective satisfaction regarding the work and conduct of an employee, hired on a contract basis, was required to be given due weightage.The ruling by Justice HS Madaan came on a petition by Rakesh Kumar against the state of Haryana and other respondents for quashing order dated April 27, whereby his request for continuation in service was rejected even though his “juniors” were still working.Justice Madaan asserted that the petitioner was admittedly appointed on a contract basis though his contract stood extended from time to time. The stand of respondent – Haryana Welfare Society for Persons with Speech and Hearing Impairment was that seniority list of employees on a contract basis was not maintained. As such, there was no question of retaining persons junior to him.Justice Madaan also took note of the submission that society did not have sufficient financial resources. As such, the petitioner’s services had been dispensed with. Besides, no other person had been employed/hired in his place.“The petitioner does not have any case claiming continuation in service. Admittedly, he was employed on a contractual basis, which stood extended from time to time and when his last contract had come to an end, the same has not been extended. Thus, no cause of action arose to the petitioner to file the present writ petition,” Justice Madaan added.The Bench observed that the petitioner’s earlier plea was disposed of by directing respondent-society to take a decision on his legal notice. The order subsequently passed showed that the petitioner was engaged on a purely temporary/contractual basis. It was clearly mentioned in his appointment letter that his services were liable to be terminated even during the contract period if his work and conduct were found dissatisfactory without notice and assigning any reason. His work and conduct was not satisfactory and he was issued memos. Despite that, he did not improve.“It is not a case of one contractual employee being replaced by another contractual employee. Rather here is a case of the employer being unable to continue availing services of the petitioner on account of financial constraints and furthermore, work and conduct of petitioner was also not found to be satisfactory. This subjective satisfaction of an employer with regard to work and conduct of his employee, who has been employed on a contract basis, is required to be given due weightage in such like matter,” the Bench concluded.

In all, 39 Benches, comprising 45 judges, are currently holding court through videoconferencing and physical mode. As of now, 12 Benches are hearing cases physically.The High Court had shifted to the virtual mode of hearing in March-end last year. Limited physical hearing was ordered to be resumed from February 8, but it had to be suspended as the second wave took in its grip High Court judges, judicial officers in the subordinate judiciary, advocates and staff. The High Court was forced to go back to restrictive functioning from April 19. But all Benches kept on functioning through the virtual mode.Following a “massive surge” in cases, the working had to be restricted further from April 28. But all Benches resumed functioning through the virtual mode from July 28 with the reduction in the severity of the second wave.Amid apprehensions of a third wave, the High Court decided to partially resume physical hearing of cases from September 6, with two Division Benches and 10 single Benches designated for hearing of cases through the physical mode. The High Court at that time made it clear that four single Benches would take up writ petitions and civil matters, while six would take up criminal matters.Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar president GDS Dhillon said the advocates had since long been demanding the resumption of physical hearing of cases. — TNSShifted to virtual mode last yearThe HC had shifted to the virtual mode of hearing in March-end last year.

02-10-2021||New Delhi||Postponement to rule out moisture in paddy: Modi government||With farmers protesting the 10-day delay in paddy procurement, the Centre today said the decision to start the process from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana had been taken keeping in mind the interests of farmers.“Procuring paddy having high moisture is fraught with risk. The rice grain will be vulnerable to shrivelling, blackening, discolouration and infestation. This may result in rejection of paddy at procurement centres and trigger distress sale, causing losses to the farmers,” said officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.They cited a letter from the Haryana Government requesting relaxation in moisture content in view of untimely rains. The moisture problem could be minimised if paddy crop was harvested after 10 days, they said.The officials said the FCI’s regional offices had found paddy samples having moisture ranging from 18 to 22 per cent in Punjab and 18.2 to 22.7 per cent in Haryana against the permissible limit of 17 per cent. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/postponement-to-rule-out-moisture-in-paddy-modi-government-318939
