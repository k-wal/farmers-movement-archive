Neither of the cows was insured, following the discontinuation of the government insurance scheme,” said Dharamvir Dangi, a cattle rearer.Dangi said he had visited the Animal Husbandry Department office many times to enquire about the insurance cover for cattle but every time, he got the same answer that the scheme had not been resumed.Manoj Dhaka, another cow rearer, said the insurance cover of his three cows was set to expire at the end of this month so he was worried as the insurance scheme was no longer available.“A beneficiary had to pay just Rs 100 per livestock to get the insurance cover for one year under the government scheme while private insurance agencies charge more than Rs 3,000 for the same.

He would return in the morning for milking the buffaloes. But on April 30, 2018, he did not return. The complainant’s son, sent to the fields to look for him, returned and told them that the victim was hanging from a guava tree.Justice Gill asserted there was no eyewitness to the occurrence and that the prosecution was relying solely on circumstantial evidence. Although the case was initially consigned as untraced, the statements of four co-villagers were recorded after about three years of the occurrence.The villagers stated they had seen the petitioner going towards the victim’s fields on the night of the occurrence.“The police would certainly have a lot to explain as to why the statements were not recorded earlier though the witnesses are residents of the same village. As far as the medical evidence is concerned, it will certainly be debatable as to whether it is a case of suicide or a case of hanging,” Justice Gill asserted.Before parting with the order, Justice Gill added the ‘last-seen’ evidence in the shape of the statements was required to be examined and scrutinised minutely for its authenticity in context of the other evidence, which may be led by the prosecution.Allowing the regular bail plea, Justice Gill added the challan stood presented and the case was mainly based on circumstantial evidence. In the court’s opinion, it was a fit case for grant of bail.

But the government stands exposed in the case of Lakhimpur killings. Even the Supreme Court is not satisfied with the action,” he said.Reiterating his demand, he said that the Union Minister of State for Home should resign immediately. He said that whatever action has been initiated in the case till now is just an eyewash.Deepender said the Haryana CM’s statement about forming groups to take on the farmers in a party workers’ meeting proved that he has an anti-farmer approach.“Surprisingly, the Chief Minister has sought to put an end to the matter by withdrawing his statement. If he has any remorse on what he had uttered, then he should immediately withdraw all the criminal cases filed against the farmers during the agitation,” he said.The Rajya Sabha MP alleged that he, along with party leader Priyanka Gandhi, went to share the grief of the families of the victims in Lakhimpur but the UP Police illegally detained them and manhandled them.Deepender said the Congress would fight the Ellenabad bypoll unitedly and win it.

The situation has come to such a passe due to unreferred patients making a beeline to the hospital.Sources said the number of patients, who had been admitted to the gynaecology ward, was much more than the number of beds available. As a result, two or three women patients lying on each bed is a common sight here.With only three senior resident doctors working here against the 22 sanctioned posts, consultants have been deployed round the clock to deal with the situation.When contacted, Prof Smiti Nanda, head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology here, said ideally, only the referred patients should be admitted to the PGIMS, but a large number of “unreferred” and other patients were coming to the hospital daily.“We do not refuse admission/treatment to the unreferred patients on a humanitarian ground as most of them are young women in labour. Nonetheless, it puts pressure on the resources,” she said.“This can be addressed if the patients are first taken to the primary or secondary care health centres instead of rushing them to the tertiary centres straightaway,” she added.PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Ishwar Singh, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/staff-shortage-hits-rohtak-pgims-gynae-wards-functioning-322498
