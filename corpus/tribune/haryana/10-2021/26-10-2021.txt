The Bench also made it clear that litigants could not be allowed to drag matters for years by filing vexatious pleas.The ruling by the Bench of Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma came in a case where no less than 35 opportunities were availed by the accused to lead defence evidence in a drugs case. The party, in the process, took about three years for the purpose.The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after the petitioners-accused assailed order dated August 3, 2019, passed by a special court, whereby their application for summoning defence witnesses was dismissed and defence evidence stood closed, vide a separate order of the same date.Their counsel submitted the trial court grossly erred in dismissing the petitioners’ application for summoning defence witnesses and wrongly closed the evidence, denying them opportunity to prove their innocence. The evidence of the witnesses sought to be summoned was necessary for just decision of the case and fair trial to the accused petitioners. Their right to lead defence evidence of their choice could not be thwarted on the flimsy presumption that the petitioners were delaying the decision of the case, it was added.The Bench asserted that it was always, in their considered opinion, a bounden duty and an obligation on the court to counterpoise any effort to unnecessarily and in unjust manner delay and protract the decision of a case. Litigants can’t drag matter for yearsLitigants could not be allowed to drag matters for years by filing vexatious pleas.

26-10-2021||Deepender Deswal||Women shying away from electioneering in Ellenabad's Bagri belt||Tribune News ServiceHisar, October 25The Bagri belt in Ellenabad is still to break the socio-economic shackles for women who are seen only in “ghoonghat” (veil) in this Assembly segment during the campaigning by the political parties.The shying away of women from electioneering, however, does not mean low turnout compared to other parts of the state.The figures of the polling in the previous elections revealed that there is not much difference in the voting percentage of women in Ellenabad compared to other segments. Social activists maintained that patriarchal mindset dominates this region and men take pride in the tradition of keeping the women within the four walls of their houses.A group of four college pass-out girls, during an interaction with this correspondent outside the employment office in Ellenabad, said they were aspiring for a government job. When asked about trends in the bypoll, they failed to recall the names of the candidates in the poll fray. “I aspire to get a government job. My family has also allowed me to complete higher education as I have just passed out MCom from a college in Ellenabad, which is 25 km from my village,” she said, refusing to divulge her name.Another girl standing beside her said she knew the names of Savita Duggal, MP from Sirsa and also voted for him. “We have also heard of Kumari Selja and the Chautala family, which is popular in the region,” she said.Devi Lal, a resident of Dhukra village, said the traditions of social and financial freedom had still not reached this region, which is socially and culturally closer to Rajasthan than other Haryana areas. “People in this region have matrimonial relationships in Rajasthan. Though large land holding and good crop due to irrigation facilities have ushered in prosperity in most of this area, they are still to move forward in tandem with the rest of Haryana socially and culturally,” he added.Balbir Kaur Gandhi, a social activist based in Sirsa, said “ghoonghat” is termed as “gehna” (jewellery) of women and it symbolises honour of family and pride of menfolk. “There has been a lack of an effective social campaign for women empowerment in this region, especially the Bagri belt in Ellenabad, which comprises “paintalisa” (45 villages). “The condition of women is comparatively better in the Punjabi belt though. I had a chance to interact with the women during a social awareness campaign some years ago and realised that they were still to unwind the shackles of patriarchy. Even in urban areas, their involvement in the business and shops is minimal,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/women-shying-away-from-electioneering-in-ellenabads-bagri-belt-329717

The JJP secured 10 seats in the 2019 poll and later cobbled together an alliance with the BJP to form the government in Haryana.Meanwhile, Deepender Hooda, Rajya Sabha member and son of former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, entered the election campaign along with several Congress MLA to give a boost to Congress candidate Pawan Beniwal.Earlier, Bhupinder Hooda had also campaigned in the Assembly segment while state Congress president Kumari Selja had held a series of election rallies in the constituency.Another senior Congress leader from Haryana, who is also Karnataka affairs in charge, Randeep Surjewala is yet to campaign in the Assembly segment apparently due to his preoccupation with the party affairs in Karnataka.Former Chief Minister and INLD patriarch Om Prakash Chautala and Abhay’s father had been campaigning hard for his son in the crucial bypoll where stakes high, especially for the INLD.Face-off between JJP, INLDDushyant Chautala’s campaign against his uncle and INLD leader Abhay Chautala, who is seeking re-election from the seat, will be keenly watched by the electorate and observers as it would be for the first time that JJP and INLD leaders would be face to face in Ellenabad since the 2019 Assembly elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ellenabad-bypoll-cm-to-hit-campaign-trail-tomorrow-329716

Of the total 66 AFLs reported, 42 were not found on ground till Saturday. The department has also recovered environment compensation charge (ECC) of Rs 50,000 in 20 cases.Deputy Director of Department of Agriculture and Farmers’’ Welfare, Ambala, Girish Nagpal, said “Action is being taken against farmers who have been burning paddy residue despite warnings. The farmers have been selling their paddy residue in the form of bales to different firms in Haryana and Punjab. Patrolling is being done by the field staff and regular awareness campaigns have also helped in bringing the number of cases down this year.”“Over 82,000-hectares was under paddy crop this year and nearly 80 per cent harvesting has been completed. The majority of the remining standing crop is of Basmati and the residue of basmati paddy is used in different products hence we are expecting that the number of total farm fires will remain lower even in the coming days,” he added.Meanwhile, Guru Prem, Subject Matter Specialist (soil and water management) at Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Tepla, said, “Farmers have begun understanding that burning of residue results in the loss of plant nutrients and organic carbon of the soil, and thus deteriorates the soil health. Last year, we managed to sow wheat in nearly 2,000-hectare in 10 villages without removing paddy residue and this year we aim to increase the area to at least 2,500-hectares in 14 villages. About 70 per cent quantity of the fertiliser remains in the residue and by mixing the residue back into the soil will decrease the requirement of fertiliser.”“Recently, wheat was sown in nearly 20-acres at Sapera village without removing residue. We have been persuading farmers to sow wheat without removing the residue as it will provide the land with adequate moisture and also a cover to the seeds. Some changes were made in the happy seeder (new-generation planters) to sow the wheat in residue. We have been promoting the happy seeder and mulcher machines, and there has been good response from the farmers, said Dr Amit, Subject Matter Specialist, (horticulture) at KVK, Tepla.Selling residue to firms in Punjab, Haryana Action is being taken against farmers who have been burning paddy residue despite warnings.

26-10-2021||Geetanjali Gayatri||2 years  of BJP-JJP rule: Covid, farm stir kept Haryana government on toes||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 25The Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP alliance government, which turns two years old tomorrow, has spent the better part of its term crisis-hopping and no end seems to be in sight.Soon after assuming power following the fractured mandate of 2019 where no party got a clear majority, the Covid virus came knocking and kept the government on its toes.While the government juggled issues of overflowing hospitals, oxygen shortage and a troubled economy during the Covid-hit months, the alliance struggled out of these trying times. Hardly had the cases started to recede and the government faced another daunting challenge posed by the farmers up against the Centre’s three farm laws. Marching from Punjab right through Haryana, they laid siege at the Delhi borders and continue to camp at Singhu and Tikri.To make matters worse, the movement of the BJP and JJP leaders continues to be very restricted since protests by the farmers follow them wherever they go.The ongoing DAP fertiliser shortage has added to the government’s headache as long queues and short supplies have translated into road blocks and protests in districts of south Haryana.While the alliance, cobbled post-election, remains intact, the Chief Minister, on his part, has tried to micro-manage at various levels whatever challenges his government faced.However, the crises did not hold back the government from taking “big decisions”, including 75% reservation for Haryanvis in private sector jobs up to a certain salary, 50% for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and the launch of the “Meri Fasal Mera Byora” portal to facilitate easy procurement of crops and provide direct benefits of compensation and other schemes to the farmers.Though the notification for reservation of jobs in the private sector is yet to be done for it to come into force, the right to recall elected representatives of PRIs is being seen as another “empowering” decision.State BJP chief OP Dhankar said the Khattar-led government had made direct payment to farmers a reality. Better water management and giving ownership rights to villagers as also to individuals who have leased or licenced municipal houses or shops for 20 years or more are among its big achievements. “Increasing social security, opening 2,000 ‘Har Hith’ stores, providing insurance cover to farmers and arhtiyas during Covid, rehabilitation of children who have lost both parents to Covid, sprucing up health facilities…the list is endless and offers something for every section,” he added.However, the Opposition feels that the government has nothing to showcase in the name of achievement. Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Hooda said the alliance had proved to be a complete “failure” in its two years. “They mismanaged the ground situation whether it was Covid, farm stir, fertiliser crisis or providing security and health services. This alliance was never meant to be and was put together with the sole aim of retaining power. The state and its people find themselves completely abandoned and nobody in the government has the time to listen to them.”Something for every sectionIncreasing social security, opening 2K ‘Har Hith’ stores, insurance to farmers amid Covid, better health facilities… the list offers something for every section. — OP Dhankar, state BJP chiefA complete failureThe alliance failed every challenge & mismanaged the ground situation whether it was Covid, farm stir, DAP crisis or security & health services. They were never meant to be. Bhupinder Hooda, lop||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/2-years-of-bjp-jjp-rule-covid-farm-stir-kept-haryana-government-on-toes-329709
