So, the elements who indulge in black marketeering are spreading rumours of shortage in Haryana. It has created panic,” he stated.The minister said that the government has been working for the welfare of farmers, workers, traders and every section of society.When asked about the outcry over the shortage of DAP by farmers and the distribution of fertilisers in police stations, Dalal said that driven by the misinformation campaign and rumours, farmers have started stocking the fertiliser for further requirement of sowing of wheat.“Farmers should exercise restraint and take DAP only according to the current need for sowing mustard. They will get more DAP at the time of sowing wheat next month,” he stated.He said that Haryana has distributed more fertiliser this year as compared to the past five years. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/black-marketeers-trying-to-project-artificial-shortage-of-dap-jp-dalal-328839

A group of distressed farmers today blocked traffic on the Mahendragarh-Rewari road near Majra Chungi village here for half an hour, while many had to return empty handed from sales counters in Nangal Choudhary and Narnaul towns due to the inadequate supply of the fertiliser.The protesting farmers cleared the road after officials assured them of providing the fertiliser soon. They were enraged over the non-distribution of DAP. An official said 300 metric tonnes of DAP was distributed in the district today. Since the demand was much higher than the supply, the issue persisted, leading to long queues of farmers at the sales centres of the fertiliser, he added.“The demand is likely to come down in the coming days as around 60 per cent of the area of mustard crops has already been cultivated. Moreover, a large quantity of DAP is scheduled to arrive in the district soon,” he added.Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Om Prakash Yadav also raised the issue before Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar during his visit to Dhosi hill in Narnaul town today and asked him to solve the issue by ensuring the adequate supply of DAP.

The farmers who claimed that they were already delayed for mustard sowing said they had no choice but to start sowing without DAP or rely on fertiliser smuggled from other states.“We suffered crop loss with Bajra and now if we delay sowing of mustard we will be ruined. We have no choice but sow without the fertiliser which will affect the productivity,” said Vishnu Raghav, a farmer from a village in Sohna.“My son managed to get me two bags of DAP like fertiliser online. I have brought it at high price from Alwar,” said Mukesh Yadav of Farukhnagar who has not been able to get fertiliser from depot for a week now.The shortage of DAP (diammonium phosphate), a widely used fertiliser, has made farmers of Nuh district a harried lot. They have now started making their children skip school to queue up outside fertiliser stores. In what has left both government and private school authorities in blocks like Tauru, Farukhnagar and Nagina shocked, more and more boys are seeking leave citing purchase of DAP as the reason. Some are even seeking leave as long as a week.“Children are skipping school and parents insist that they need them to queue up for getting fertiliser. It’s not a story of just for one day, but for the last three-four days situation has gotten worse with entire classes not reporting,” said an officiating headmaster of a Tauru based school.With no resolution in sight, farmers have now started queuing up outside shops from the wee hours and many are even sleeping there at night with entire family to save up on more spots.Tokens are being distributed and only five farmers are being allowed at one time in a store and it takes an average of four to five hours for farmers to get a bag of fertiliser.Following recent loot at a fertiliser store in Ateli the local police have stepped up the security of these stores and a major chunk of force is manning the queues to maintain law and order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dap-shortage-gurugram-farmers-go-for-online-substitutes-smuggled-fertiliser-328669
