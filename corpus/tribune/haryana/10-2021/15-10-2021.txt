Hundreds of cases of fever are reported daily at the government and private hospitals, claimed the sources in the district administration.“Deaths of several minor children due to fever in the Hathin subdivision recently have also been perhaps due to the lack of cleanliness and water stagnation,” an official of the Health Department said, adding that the contamination of drinking water supply could not be ruled out as the prime cause of sickness.Though sources hold dengue as one of the factors, the health officials said fatalities could be due to other reasons as no proof linked to the disease had surfaced so far.Claiming that no death due to dengue had taken place, Civil Surgeon Dr Brahmdeep Singh said the authorities of the medical college at Nalhar in Nuh district, where some of the victims were admitted, were yet to ascertain the reasons associated with the death.Revealing that a door-to-door drive was under way, officials claimed that over a lakh houses had been surveyed in the past one and half months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dengue-door-to-door-survey-launched-in-palwal-324787
