17-10-2021||Chandigarh||Shortage of DAP threatens to upset farmers’ Rabi crops sowing plans in Haryana||Panic has gripped farmers across Haryana with severe shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer, the basic nutrient for crops, threatening to upset their plans for sowing of the Rabi crops, especially wheat and mustard.Long queues of farmers wanting to buy DAP have been reported outside the offices  of primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) and other dealers in several districts, including Ambala, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Rewari, Mahendragarh, Charkhi Dadri, Bhiwani, and Hisar in the past few days.With the onset of the Rabi season, the demand for urea, DAP and other fertilizers, which are basic nutrients for Rabi crops, has risen.However, shortage of the fertilizers reportedly due to less import in the wake of spurt in global prices has spread panic among the farmers.Ram Niwas, a farmer from Narnaund (Hisar), said he was finding it difficult to meet his requirements of DAP as sufficient stocks were not available in the market.“I have already prepared the fields for sowing of mustard while these would be ready for the sowing of wheat in the first week of November. However, the inadequate availability of DAP has upset my plans for sowing of Rabi crops,” he lamented.Farmers argued that since DAP had to be sprinkled at the time of sowing of Rabi crops any delay in its supply could have adverse impact on sowing of the crops.Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda alleged that farmers were forced to suffer as the central and state governments had failed to make adequate provisions for the supply of DAP fertilizer.Sources said the DAP requirement for Rabi season in Haryana was pegged at around 2 lakh metric tons  while the supply so far had been about one-third of the demand.The farmers are supplied the fertilizers through about 700 PACS and other dealers.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar yesterday directed the DCs to take immediate steps for adequate supply of fertilizers, including DAP, to the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/shortage-of-dap-threatens-to-upset-farmers-rabi-crops-sowing-plans-in-haryana-325828

17-10-2021||Deepender Deswal||Ellenabad bypoll: Tough task ahead for BJP candidate Gobind Kanda||Tribune News ServiceHisar, October 16BJP candidate Gobind Kanda faces an uphill task in the Ellenabad byelection amid the prevailing resentment among the farmers on the issue of farm laws.Poll code ‘violated’, INLD writes to ECHisar: The INLD submitted a complaint to the Chief Electoral Officer, ‘accusing’ BJP candidate Gobind Kanda of violating the poll code at the behest of the govt. State INLD chief Nafe Rathi said during campaigning, Kanda was creating fear among voters as he was accompanied with a convoy, in violation of the EC norms. He said such misuse of the govt to promote the interests of a particular candidate was violation of the poll code.New to Ellenabad, Kanda had previously fought two elections from Rania Assembly segment as a candidate of the Haryana Lokhit Party, floated by his brother Gopal Kanda.The BJP, however, nominated him as a candidate within a couple of days of his joining the party. “The decision to field him speaks volumes of the party’s strength or weakness in Ellenabad, especially after Pawan Beniwal ditched the party. Pawan had contested the 2019 and the 2014 polls on the BJP ticket and posed a good fight against INLD leader Abhay Chautala,” said a political observer. Pawan is now a candidate of the Congress.With the might of coalition of BJP-JJP behind him, he, along with his brother Gopal Kanda (Sirsa MLA), is leaving no stone unturned to match up rivals Abhay Singh Chautala of the INLD and Pawan Beniwal of the Congress.For Kanda, tackling protests by farmers during his campaign is a tough challenge. He remained in a ring of personal security and was accompanied by a cavalcade of the police and paramilitary personnels due to the protests.Rakesh Kamboj of Kesupura said the farmers’ issue would play a key role in the outcome of the bypoll. “People have the right to stage peaceful protests to raise their issues. The anti-incumbency and anti-farmers sentiments will cost the ruling coalition dearly in the bypoll,” he said.On the other hand, another villager Naresh Kumar of Dhani Jattan said Kanda was given a warm reception in his village. “The protests seem to be staged at the behest of rival candidates,” he said.However, the political experts said the rival candidates were raking up the controversies surrounding Gobind’s elder brother Gopal Kanda in the bypoll. “Besides, Ellenabad is a new segment for him. While definitely, farmers’ resentment too will hurt him,” said an expert.“Electoral management and the use of resources at their disposal too cannot be ignored in the campaign. Besides, the state has its performance and popularity at stake here. A defeat in Ellenabad will hurt the party (BJP) more than the candidate (Kanda). However, if it wins, the BJP will try to change the whole discourse surrounding farmers’ agitation,” commented an expert.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ellenabad-bypoll-tough-task-ahead-for-bjp-candidate-gobind-kanda-325642

17-10-2021||Chandigarh||‘Using’ child in protest: Rights panel dismisses Hooda’s reply||The Haryana State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (HSCPCR) has dismissed the reply of former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on the issue of bringing a child to Congress MLAs’ protest on August 20 and has issued a notice to him and MLA Shakuntla Khatak again.HSCPCR chairperson Jyoti Bainda described Hooda’s reply as “evasive and cryptic” in nature as he submitted that “I am not involved in any of the acts alleged to have been committed therein pertaining to the child”. On the other hand, Khatak submitted that just because “a child was sitting in a rickshaw it doesn’t in any manner amount to cruelty, harassment and public shaming”.Bainda said the former CM’s two-liner response to the commission’s earlier notice “delineates insensitive attitude to the entire unwarranted action” committed by him and the Congress.“Prima facie, it appears that you were the forerunner of the event as can be seen through the press releases. People present on the spot are saying that they were doing it under the leadership of Bhupinder Singh Hooda,” she wrote back to the LoP.“The child was made to sit in a rickshaw by holding a placard for protest and thus was wrongfully restrained in scorching heat and that too in loud slogans shouted around him. Further, he was made to imitate a “child going to exams for cheating”. This is an outrageous act of disturbing psychology of the child,” the chairperson added.She added that Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act prescribes punishment for cruelty to a child for five years and a fine up to Rs 5 lakh. “There is need for sheer contemplation at your end that a child aged 8 is quite in a nascent stage of his life and he doesn’t have sufficient maturity or understanding. In legal parlance, consent given by the child carries no value in the eyes of law...,” she added.Bainda highlighted that the event was organised at the behest of Congress legislators and therefore, it was a political rally. She added that the NCPCR had issued guidelines that children shouldn’t be used for political campaigns.She cautioned Hooda not to take “slipshod dispositions regarding the stated matter as the commission being a statuary body is well-equipped with the legal authority to initiate action” against him. —TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/using-child-in-protest-rights-panel-dismisses-hoodas-reply-325647

Whenever he used to go to a Gurdwara, he would pray for the well-being of his family and the society,” said Jaspreet Kaur.He had no criminal record and there was no report of him being a bad character, the victim’s family said and demanded a high-level probe into the entire episode to bring out the truth.Jaspreet and Raj Kaur said even if it is assumed for a moment that Lakhbir had done something wrong, those who killed him in such a barbaric manner should have given him time to prove his innocence, or they could have handed him over to the police.“At no stage could they be the deciding authority while running their own self-styled court which pronounced punishment and then murdered him inhumanly. Where does the law of land prevail here?” said his grieving sister.His wife Jaspreet Kaur and three daughters aged 12, 11 and eight years live in a small temporary house made of mud and bricks at Cheema Kalan village, around 50 km away from the holy city of Amritsar. His son passed away two years ago.The family was barely managing two square meals a day when Lakhbir was alive and would work in the village fields or in the grain market of Tarn Taran district for his livelihood.“Who will come forward to look after his family now and what about the future of his children..who will help them,” lamented his sister Raj Kaur.Sonepat’s Deputy Superintendent of Police Virender Singh said the total number of accused in the crime could be more than five.“We produced Sarabjit before the court. The accused has been remanded in seven days’ police custody by the court,” he said over the phone.“The accused has pointed to the involvement of four more people in the case and taken their names...we are conducting further investigations in this regard. We have to make some recoveries from the arrested accused including the weapon used in the crime and the clothes he was wearing,” he said.Earlier on Friday, in a video clip that surfaced on social media, some Nihangs were seen standing around the victim with his severed left hand close to his head. The group was heard accusing him of desecrating a Sikh holy book.A case of murder was registered at the Kundli police station in Sonipat in connection with the lynching incident.Around 15 Dalit outfits submitted a memorandum to the National Commission for Scheduled Caste Chairman Vijay Sampla on Saturday demanding stringent action against the culprits.These included the Akhil Bharatiya Khatik Samaj, Akhil Bharatiya Berwa Vikas Sangh, Dhanak Welfare Association and other organisations of Dalit employees and professionals.Political parties across the board have condemned the incident and demanded a thorough probe.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday said that the incident was extremely sad and shameful and demanded that the victim’s family be given compensation.“The brutal murder of a Dalit youth from Punjab at Delhi’s Singhu border is extremely sad and shameful. The police must take the incident seriously and take strong action against the accused persons.“The BSP demands that the Dalit chief minister of Punjab should give a financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh and a government job to the aggrieved family, as was done in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.The Congress had said it was the government’s responsibility to investigate the lynching, while the BJP asserted that anarchic elements are using farmers for their politics.The saffron party on Saturday hit out the opposition party for not raising the issue at the Congress Working Committee meeting.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia questioned if the opposition party stood with the “Talibani mindset” behind the killing.“For the sake of petty and cheap vote bank politics, opposition parties, especially the Congress, will maintain a deafening silence on this key issue.“They will not have the courage to call spade a spade because it does not suit their political narrative,” Bhatia said while also attacking farmer leader Rakesh Tikait for his reported remarks that organisers cannot be blamed for such an incident.The National Commission for Scheduled Castes on Friday asked the Haryana Police to take strict action against those behind the killing of the Dalit man at the farmers’ protest venue.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions is spearheading the protests, issued a statement on Friday distancing itself from the incident and said that it wanted to make it clear that “both the parties to the incident”, the Nihang group and the victim, have no relation with the Morcha.
