But now, new guidelines say that these conditions are of only of advisory nature.The area under paddy in the eight blocks in the previous season was 1,79,951 hectare.Earlier, it was mentioned that the farmers who would diversify less than 50 per cent of their paddy area in eight identified blocks, where water table was greater than 40 metres, would not be eligible for availing any subsidy from the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department.It was also pointed out that for such farmers, paddy would not be procured by the state government agencies. But now, in the new guidelines, there is no mention of this condition.  The May 9 order, which was issued from the Director-General Agriculture to all deputy directors, had also said in agricultural lands of gram panchayats in various blocks, where ground water level was 35 metre, the panchayat would not permit paddy growing in their lands. This condition has been retained in new guidelines.The new guidelines say that famers, who opt for diversification, will get a help of Rs 7,000 per acre in two instalments in the eight identified blocks. The insurance of alternate crops would be ensured from the government's pocket.Meanwhile, the Congress claimed victory over “U-turn” by the government.Earlier, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had threatened state-wide agitation over paddy cultivation restrictions, and Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee President Kumari Selja and AICC communication in-charge Randeep Surjewala participated in a protest in Fatehabad on Wednesday.Selja demanded that the May 9 order of the government should be taken back fully.“When farmers protest on road, only then this government takes its decisions back,” she said.Surjewala demanded an unconditional apology from the government over the issue. He said: “Today is a red-letter day for Haryana’s farmers. An arrogant Khattar government has been forced to reverse its draconian order banning paddy cultivation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/govt-softens-stand-on-paddy-cultivation-restrictions-congress-claims-victory-91169

The authorities had to shut the canteen to avert any untoward incident.The canteen was reopened on May 22 and the registration was being made through phone call. Token for shopping was being given to 100 registered beneficiaries every day in order to check the crowd and to ensure social distancing.Sources said hundreds of people began gathering outside the canteen around 4 am this morning following the information that manual token would be distributed for shopping.More than 500 people reached the canteen up to 8 am and no distance was being maintained by them. Even, many of them were also not using mask, said sources.“The beneficiaries are a harassed lot as a phone number released for registration by the canteen authorities always remains busy. We all are trying to get enrolled for past some days but to no avail. Hence, have come here to receive token manually,” claimed ex-serviceman Satbir Singh.Rishi Dev and Ram Chander, other beneficiaries, said there was no proper system of giving date, time and token to the beneficiaries leading to acute resentment among them.Canteen manager Suresh Kalalia said five phone numbers had been released for registering the beneficiaries for issuing them token for shopping.However, hundreds of people gathered outside the canteen this morning and started raising hue and cry. The police later somehow controlled the situation, he added.“We had to close the canteen around 11:15 am after giving token to few ex-servicemen. Generally it remains open till 2 pm. The canteen has been shut till further orders, following this irresponsible attitude of the beneficiaries,” Kalalia added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/safety-measures-go-for-a-toss-as-ex-servicemen-throng-canteen-91156

During the shutdown, curbs were imposed on weddings, religious places and hotels, causing the demand for flowers to fall sharply. The new season for flower cultivation is about to begin but many growers are finding it difficult to come to terms with the losses.“I had grown marigold, gladiolus and chrysanthemum flowers over five acres at a cost of more than Rs 3 lakh. The harvesting of flowers started in March to meet the market demand in Delhi and various districts of Haryana. Flower supply halted suddenly following the lockdown clamped on March 24,” said Ajit Singh, a farmer from Marodhi Jatan village here.Ajit Singh said he was expecting that the lockdown would be lifted after two weeks but it did not happen. The crops dried up in the field as there was no logic to harvest the flowers without any demand, he added.Raj Kumar, another farmer, pointed out that March, April and May are the peak season for the flower industry because of the weddings, religious festivals and other functions held during this time. “I have suffered heavy loss and will have to borrow money for cultivating the next crop,” he added.District Horticulture Officer Hawa Singh said flower farming was done over 100 acres in Rohtak district. Marigold was the main crop while lily, rose, gladiolus and chrysanthemum were also grown.“The flower growers had sold more than 40 per cent of their crop before the lockdown. The remaining crops dried up during the lockdown as they did not harvest those. Flower crops are cultivated twice a year and the growers used to earn attractive profit in the first season that is from February to May,” claimed Hawa Singh, adding that distressed farmers were approaching his office for financial support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryanas-flower-growers-incur-huge-losses-produce-dries-up-amid-lockdown-91071

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Charred bodies of dead men do tell tales: Court||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the charred bodies of dead men do tell tales. It said the chances of an adult’s body burning beyond a trace were improbable and bones in human ash could still be identified.16-year-old caseRuling came in the 16-year-old case where two domestic and farm help were accused of murdering another before setting his body on fireThe ruling by the Bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu came in a 16-year-old case where two domestic and farm help were accused of murdering another before setting his body afire. The two, Mohan and Raju, had moved the high court challenging the judgment of the Karnal Additional Sessions Judge in June 2005 that convicted and sentenced them to life imprisonment for murder and common intention under Section 302 and 34 of the IPC.Appreciating the assistance rendered by legal aid counsel VK Sachdeva, the Bench observed the burnt bones and ashes weighed approximately 250 gm. The forensic science laboratory report in the matter stated that opinion could not be given regarding the victim’s sex and age, as the bones were too “fragmentary and insufficient”.Referring to ‘A Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology’ by Modi, the Bench observed burnt bones and ashes in some instances were forwarded to the medical officer for inspection, if the police suspected foul play after a body was partially or completely burnt. In an ordinary house fire, the temperature seldom exceeded 1200°C. It was, as such, unlikely that an adult’s body would burn so completely as to leave no trace. If the body was not completely consumed, fragments of bones left would afford sufficient evidence to indicate whether they were of human.The Bench further observed: “The combustion of a body is rarely so complete as to reduce it to ashes. Hence, by shifting the ashes through sieves, fragments of bones can be collected and identified by a careful study. Incineration of an adult human body for the purpose of cremation requires one-and-a-half-hour at 1600-1800 degree Celsius and the resultant ashes weigh about 4-6 kg. Such human ash contains bone pieces which may still be identified,”Besides, fragments of clothing could be found protected even on the “most badly charred body” in folds of skin, flexures of armpits and groins. Traces of jewellery, too, could be found.The Bench added the police did not recover any clothes. In case the victim was wearing clothes, the same could have been intact with the bones. Also, the police did not send the bones for DNA examination. Setting aside the trial court judgment while acquitting the two, the Bench asserted the prosecution failed to prove the case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/charred-bodies-of-dead-men-do-tell-tales-court-90848

The Rohtak depot is running merely four buses with less than 100 commuters as people are reluctant to travel in public transport due to the Covid scare. The Haryana Roadways had resumed its operation from May 15.Two buses with 59 passengers had left for Panchkula and one bus each for Jind and Sonepat with a total of 17 passengers from here on Wednesday, while buses for Jhajjar, Panipat, Fatehabad and Bhiwani were cancelled. Besides, one each bus of Hisar, Sirsa, Gurugram, Jind and Kaithal depot reached Rohtak and a total 67 people boarded them from here.Rohtak depot station supervisor Dharambir said around 15,000 people used to travel in buses daily from Rohtak before the lockdown. The ban on inter-state bus services was also affecting number of passengers as buses of Rohtak depot used to go to Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh before the lockdown, he said.Assistant Sub-Inspector Sumer Siwach said the buses were disinfected before plying while thermal scanning of every passenger was carried out before boarding. Merely four buses were being plied these days due to a few number of passengers, he said. Besides the Covid effect, Haryana Roadways Workers Union State Office Secretary Jai Kanwar Dahiya also held the online ticket-booking system and no stoppage of buses at any point en route, responsible for negligible presence of commuters.“Majority of people do not know how to book tickets online due to lack of knowledge while many use to board the buses from their nearest point. Number of passengers will go up considerable as soon as the buses start halting at different points and ticket will be issued on board,” said Dahiya.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-passengers-220-buses-remain-off-road-in-rohtak-90852

They held a protest in Fatehabad district on Wednesday. TNSHooda said he and his party would take the issue to every farmer in the state and the programme would be announced at a press conference in Kurukshetra. Hooda said he would meet farmers from all areas impacted by the paddy ban, including Kurukshetra and Fatehabad.“The government should factor in the condition of the farmer and the seriousness of the situation. Instead of carrying out new experiments with farming and farmers at the time of a global pandemic, it should focus on providing maximum relief,” he said.“The government should encourage paddy cultivation with the direct seeding of rice method and hybrid seeds. With this, good paddy crop can be got in less time and less water. Even during the Congress tenure, the government faced a challenge of depleting groundwater but we had not imposed any restriction on farmers,” Hooda said, putting emphasis on balancing the interests of the farmers and conservation of groundwater.“We started schemes such as Dadupur Nalvi and Hansi Butana canal projects, reviving Rakhsi river, Khand Nala, building Otu lake in Sirsa and Kotla lake in Mewat.

A procedure has also been formulated in case an official is busy in a meeting or in the middle of some urgent work and can’t take the call from MP or MLA. “If it is not possible to take such a call due to any reason, an SMS must be sent to that effect. The SMS should be followed up with a phone call at the earliest and no later than a couple of hours,” said the instructions.The order stated that if the phone of an elected representative was unanswered or remains unreachable, yet ‘another SMS to this effect must be sent for record’. “It is mentioned that lack of communication between elected representatives and officers is always a matter of concern and is especially important during Covid,” said the order.MLAs first raised the issue of officers not listening to them with Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta during a recent videoconference meeting. Gupta then informed the CM about the same.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/save-mps-mlas-numbers-dont-miss-calls-babus-told-in-haryana-90860

Petitioners Sameer Jain, Sandeep Bajaj, Angad Sandhu, Suvigya Awasthi and Anant Gupta urged the court to strike down the amendment.They said the amendment was with the assumption that everyone practising law in Haryana not only knew Hindi but was also fluent in it. To say that imposition of Hindi was for state’s people and necessary to get justice was “wholly irrational”, they added.They said level of fluency and expertise needed to argue a matter in Hindi was much higher than just a simple understanding of the language. “English is a widely spoken language in our country and precluding its use before various subordinate courts is manifestly arbitrary with no legal rationale and having far-reaching consequences for the people living and working in the State of Haryana,” they said.Contending that the amendment precluded the use of English which was used widely to conduct legal proceedings, the petitioners said, “This has impinged upon the right to freely practice the legal profession and earn a livelihood as guaranteed under Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.”They said imposition of Hindi was not fit for the state as it was an industrial hub and home to multi-national companies, where people from every strata of the society reside and majority of them were not fluent in Hindi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/petition-in-supreme-court-challenges-use-of-hindi-as-official-court-language-in-haryana-90861
