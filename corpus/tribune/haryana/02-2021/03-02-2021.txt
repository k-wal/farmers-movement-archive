The CBI had filed a chargesheet last month against then Sohna ACP Birem Singh, Inspector Narinder Singh Khatana, Inspector Shamsher Singh (now retired) and ESI Subhash Chand for wrongly framing school bus conductor Ashok Kumar.The CBI had approached the Principal Secretary (Home) on August 19 last year and DGP and Commissioner of Police on September 30 for prosecution sanction.Sanction was not granted despite a reminder on January 22. “More than five months have elapsed and the sanctioning authority is yet to wake up from its deep slumber,” observed the judge.The court observed that it appeared that the “sanctioning authority is having a dogged determination not to grant sanction to prosecute the accused owing to the sense of camaraderie and at the same time, it appears to be frightened of the fact that the order of declining the request of the investigating agency may fall short of facing judicial scrutiny”.The judge directed the CBI to send a copy of the order to the competent sanctioning authority “within eight days and compliance of the same be intimated to this court within the next 10 days”. The next date of hearing is February 22.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cbi-court-officers-sleeping-on-prosecution-sanction-207024

As per the complaint, Hari Singh, Raman Bhayana, Narender Bhayana, Om Parkash Panghal and Bijender own a total of 26 kanal near the Civil Hospital.They allegedly formed ‘The Hisar Indian Co-operative House Building Society’ in a bid to establish an illegal colony. They constructed a kutcha road and subdivided the land without obtaining any licence as envisaged under Section 3 of Act.The complainant said the accused caused a huge loss to the state exchequer by not paying licence fee and other charges. On the basis of revenue records, Khasa had also served a show-cause notice on the accused, besides sending restoration order to them.The official said that in the “layout” plan of the colony, the accused demarcated plots and roads and circulated the same among the local people in an attempt to sell plots. “Although illegal constructions were demolished on February 17 last year, the accused continue to carry out illegal activities in the violation of law,” the DTP added.However, Narender Bhayana, who is the brother of Hansi BJP MLA Vinod Bhayana, said he would challenge the FIR against him in the court as he neither owned the land nor was a member of the said society anymore. “I had resigned as a member of the society nearly five years ago,” he added.Panghal also denied his involvement in the case and said he would meet the DTP tomorrow. However, he admitted that he owned a piece of land in the area, which was lying vacant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/five-booked-for-bid-to-develop-unauthorised-colony-in-hansi-207027

The SIT has mentioned how criminals, who make an easy buck by selling illicit liquor, are a part of this nexus.Jadhav, who submitted his report to Rajeev Arora, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) yesterday, briefed Home Minister Anil Vij today.“The ACS (Home) is in the process of studying the report.

It is likely to attract attention and reaction, but that cannot lead to the assumption of the investigating agency having given up its responsibility of a fair probe. The assertion came as Justice Sudip Ahluwalia dismissed a petition by Tausif and another accused in Nikita Tomar murder case.Accused cannot seek reprobeNone of the reliance placed on behalf of the petitioners is having any effect of postulating that the extraordinary power to order further investigation is available to the accused as against the actual victim or complainant’s side. — Justice Sudip Ahluwalia, High Court“It will be apt to observe here that the hype surrounding any so-perceived sensational case in the media at large is certainly likely to attract its own share of attention, public curiosity, discussion and reaction. But that cannot ipso facto lead to any supposition that the investigating authorities have abdicated their responsibility of probing the same fairly or objectively,” Justice Ahluwalia asserted.The Bench made it clear that further investigation could not be ordered at the instance of the accused and this extraordinary power was available to the victim or complainant’s side. The accused had challenged the dismissal of their application seeking further investigation on the grounds that the probe was conducted hurriedly by the police, who submitted the final report 11 days after lodging the FIR.Justice Ahluwalia noted that the submission all through was that the investigation was conducted hurriedly and under public and media pressure. Justice Ahluwalia observed that it was for the aggrieved party to make out a cogent and convincing case, explaining how the investigation was improper.“None of the reliance placed on behalf of the petitioners is having any effect of postulating that the extraordinary power to order further investigation is available to the accused as against the actual victim or complainant’s side,” Justice Ahluwalia added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/media-hype-no-indicator-of-unfair-probe-says-hc-207030
