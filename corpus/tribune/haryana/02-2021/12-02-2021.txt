Other farmer leaders, including Gurnam Singh Charuni, also attended the panchayat.“Kisan mahapanchayats being organised these days are working to connect the people with the farmers’ agitation hence such panchayats will now be organised across the nation to garner more support from other states. Farmers will march towards Delhi if needed,” said Tikait who also held the government responsible for the Delhi violence during the Republic Day Parade on January 26.He called upon the farmers to write ‘Kisan Karanti Yatra 26 January 2021’ on their tractor-trailers to spread the message that they would not go back to their home without getting the farm laws repealed.“This agitation will continue until the Government of India talks to the committee and arrives at an agreement. Till that time, farmers will not return home,” he said.Tikait alleged that farmers from Gujarat were being pressured not to lend support to the agitation.“If anyone from Gujarat wants to come here to support the agitation and if it is found they are coming, police are being sent to their homes,” Tikait alleged.“We will hold meetings in Gujarat and other states,” he said.Tikait also said the “business on hunger” will not be allowed and those wanting it will be “driven out” of the country.Hitting out at the farm laws, he claimed these would lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) and exploitation of farmers, from whom big companies will procure their produce at cheaper rates and then store it in godowns.Big godowns will be built, which will be barricaded on similar lines like the ones near the protest sites at the Delhi borders, he said.Without naming anyone, he said attempts had been made to divide the farmers' stir."They tried to divide us on the lines of Punjab and Haryana, then small and big farmers.“We have said that the three laws are not acceptable to farmers and should be rolled back. But how will they take back these when godowns were built first and laws were framed later.“They did business of temple, religion and feelings. Now, they want to do the business on hunger,” Tikait alleged.Charuni said protesting farmers would win the ongoing agitation in every situation as they were fighting for justified demands hence the agitation would go on until the demands were met. He demanded there should be the guarantee of procuring the produce at minimum support price (MSP) while a provision of punishment should be made if the produce was procured at a price less than the MSP.Charuni said they were working to identify anti-social elements who were trying to infiltrate the agitation in order to spoil it and firm arrangements were being made to prevent their entry.

Besides, they also inaugurated the production of ‘chemical-free jaggery’ and selling of sugarcane in pieces on the premises. A solar panel enabled mobile unit which will be used for cutting eye-buds as well as treating it, was also launched by the director.“The new unit developed can be used anywhere in the centre to save time, energy and labour,” said Dr Bakshi, adding that during off season, the solar system may be utilised for running tube well and irrigation purposes in the fields.Highlighting the benefits of the lab and chamber, Dr Bakshi and Dr Pandey told The Tribune that presently they were facing a challenge of shortage of good quality seeds of sugarcane. “India produces around 350 million tonne sugarcane in around 5.23 million hectares. It produced around 26 million tonnes of sugar during 2020-21. Around 195-lakh tonnes of seeds are required for the country, but we produce very less number of them. The farmers too were used to old varieties for the next production, which was a big challenge for us.

The candidates also staged protests and even went on hunger strike but the government still did not give a joining date,” he pointed out.“The government’s job is to provide employment to the youth, not to snatch employment.

Prior to PGT Sanskrit, this government has taken away the employment of 1,983 PTIs, art and craft teachers and 1,500 Group-D jobs in the sports quota,” he alleged.“The government is engaged in the retrenchment of employees, rather than creating new jobs.

Hence, we demand that the headquarters be set up in the city,” said advocate Kirori Lal Yadav.Yadav said they had recently met Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who had assured them of looking into the issue. However, he said their protest would continue till their demand was fulfilled.He said besides lawyers, representatives of various social organisations, traders and resident welfare associations had also extended support to their protest.On the other hand, Rakesh Mehta, president of the Advocate Chamber Society in Narnaul, demanded the renaming of Mahendragarh as Narnaul district. He also opposed special sitting of the Deputy Commissioner and heads of all government offices of Narnaul in Mahendragarh city once in a week.He said, “A plan is being chalked out to set up an ADJ court in Mahendragarh city. It will be the first subdivision if this happens, otherwise such courts are located at the district headquarters. We are not against it, but want a uniform policy for every subdivision,” said Mehta.‘Rename M’garh as Narnaul dist’A joint delegation of the Narnaul District Headquarter Bachao Sangharsh Samiti and the Haryana Beopar Mandal met Union Minister Rao Inderjit on Thursday and demanded the renaming of Mahendragarh as Narnaul district.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/lawyers-in-mahendragarh-narnaul-press-for-district-hq-status-211062

The Bench noted that it could not be said that the impugned transfer order passed by Haryana was mala fide, discriminatory or in violation of the statutory rules governing the service.The Bench maintained that transfer was an incident of service. The power to transfer was vested in the employer, who was to exercise it as per administrative exigencies keeping in view public interest, unless it involved adverse impact on career or further prospects.“The exercise of power to transfer in the present case could not be said to be against the law, calling for interference by this court in exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution,” the Bench said.The officer, 100 per cent visually impaired, had challenged the order dated May 18, 2020, transferring him from the post of Fatehabad Deputy Commissioner to the post of Director, Swarna Jayanti Haryana Institute for Fiscal Management. Among other things, he had alleged discrimination and violation of Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules.Referring to a reply filed by the respondents, the Bench said it would show that the petitioner had completed the requisite three-year field experience on the post specified, which would make him eligible for consideration for central deputation at the level of Deputy Secretary. The Bench concluded that it did not find merit in the writ petition and, therefore, it was being dismissed.Power to transfer vested in employerThe Bench maintained that transfer was an incident of service.

Tenders for the same will be floated soon,” said a senior civic body official.The MC has also been purchasing recycled aggregates from its Basai plant and plans to start the manufacturing of its own paver blocks, for use in pavements and bicycle tracks, from October 2020.Amid the Covid crisis, the MC, led by Commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, hired a professional agency that cleared empty plots, green belts and Aravalli area of C and D waste.The corporation also managed to collect 6 lakh MT of C&D waste from across the city — the highest not just for the district till date, but the entire NCR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/only-10-construction-demolition-waste-being-treated-in-gurugram-211067
