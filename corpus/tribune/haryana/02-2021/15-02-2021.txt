And despite objections raised and submitted by ruling party local MLA Sudhir Singla, DLF RWA, local councilor RS Rathee, NGOs Gurgaon Citizen Council, I am Gurgaon, etc, the Haryana Government did not cancel the allotment.“Thus, the NGO approached the NGT making a prayer for cancellation of the allotment of protected forest land for setting up petrol pump,” said Jain.A three-member principal bench at Delhi, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Chairperson of the NGT, stated, “In spite of the said stand of the Forest Department, the MCG has failed to take the remedial action to enforce the law. Use of forest land for non-forest purposes is also in violation of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notification dated May 7, 1992 with regard to the Aravalli range”.The NGT directed the Deputy Commissioner and Divisional Forest Officer of Gurugram to submit within two months an action taken report stating as to how the protected forest land was allotted by the MCG for setting up a petrol pump.Rishabh Jain, counsel for Manav Awaaj, said that the Punjab and Haryana High Court in its order dated February 13, 2020 had already prohibited any construction activity on forest land in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in MC Mehta versus Union of India case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/allotment-of-forest-land-for-setting-up-a-petrol-pump-illegal-ngt-212829

Manvinder got multiple bank accounts opened for Kapil and Sajid using fake documents, for which he received a commission. The cheated amount was transferred to Waris’ account,” the officer said.According to the police, the victim had put up a sofa for sale on an e-commerce platform.She was approached by a man who showed interest in making the purchase.To check if the account details shared by her were correct, he initially transferred a minimal amount of money into her account.Subsequently, the man sent a QR code to the seller and asked her to scan it so that the amount fixed under the deal could be transferred to her account but instead, Rs 20,000 got deducted from her account when she followed the instructions of the buyer, a senior police officer said.When she enquired about it, the man claimed that he had sent a wrong QR code by mistake and sent another link to her, asking her to follow the same procedure.But again an amount of Rs 14,000 got deducted from the seller’s account when she scanned the QR code, the officer said.An FIR under the relevant sections of the IPC was registered on February 7.During scrutiny of bank account details and transactions, it emerged that the money was withdrawn from an account registered in the name of Kapil at Agra, the officer said.Police said the gang had duped several others.

Hence, we have had to place a signboard of our village/district outside our camp because co-villagers and other visitors were finding it difficult to trace us amid the crowd of farmers. Now, our acquaintances are easily reaching us with the help of such boards,” said Balwinder Singh, a farmer from Patiala.Lakhvinder Singh from Muktsar said the signboards were also proving helpful to autorickshaws. “A considerable number of farmers from Punjab are daily reaching Tikri by train.

The info given by Bihar, Delhi, UP, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh is alarming with respect to the recovery of smuggled liquor from Haryana. — SIT reportThe SIT had noted that on information sought from various districts regarding FIRs registered in connection with the recovery of 100 or more cartons of liquor from January 1, 2019 till November 19, 2020, details of 372 FIRs were received. Of these, 500 or more cartons of liquor were seized in the case of 72 FIRs.“It is noted with great concern that the local police or the investigating officers could not reach the origin of illicit liquor in 54 FIRs. The SIT has received complaints having allegations of quid pro quo which need further investigation as the same are levelled against liquor mafia, senior bureaucrats and politicians. The nexus may exist in the present scenario as the investigating officers could not reach the distilleries that supplied the illicit liquor,” the SIT said.“Since most of the FIRs involve inter-district and interstate investigations, the local police face jurisdiction problems while investigating the FIRs. Hence, it is recommended the matter to be handed over to an independent agency in public interest. In view of the huge revenue loss to the state by liquor mafia and involvement of public servants, who are duty bound to restrain the same, the matter should be investigated by the CBI,” the SIT said while recommending a probe by the central investigating agency in its report.Meanwhile, the SIT has estimated a revenue loss of Rs 9,519.98 crore in districts having distilleries and bottling plants, especially Ambala, Karnal, Panipat, Sonepatand Jhajjar, due to illegal smuggling of three brands (country liquor, McDowell’s and Signature brands of IMFL) during the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2019-20.The SIT has also noted that around 50 cases of inspection of distilleries are pending in which around Rs 100 crore of penalty could be imposed.The report said an inordinate delay on the part of State Excise and Taxation Department in disposal of pending cases remains unexplained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sit-calls-for-cbi-probe-into-54-firs-of-liquor-smuggling-212478

The hard work of farmers provided support for the revival of the economy,” he said.He said no farmers' organisation had demanded such laws, but the BJP enacted these to benefit capitalists.In Ambala, the INLD leader appealed to the farmers to form village-level committees to strengthen the agitation.He was addressing a Kisan Jan Jagran Sammelan organised at Badhauli village of Naraingarh.Abhay was also accorded the title of ‘Kisan Kesri’ on Sunday for resigning from the Assembly in support of the agitating farmers during the event.Abhay said, “The government has imposed the farm laws in an unconstitutional and undemocratic manner. To put pressure on the government, there is a need to form village-level committees, assign duties and send maximum number of people to the protesting sites. The government has been making strategies to weaken the movement. There is a need to further strengthen the agitation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/form-panels-at-village-level-says-abhay-212485

Earlier, the project had already missed three deadlines.For recharging groundwater, the Karnal Municipal Corporation (KMC) had initiated the project of laying storm water drain lines and installing water harvesting systems along with the intermediate pumping stations under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. Under the project, a Delhi-based company has to lay 37,634 metre storm water drain lines, four rainwater harvesting systems in Jhanjhari, Uchana, Dholgarh and Saidpura and three intermediate pumping stations at Meri Ghati, Saidpura, and Sector 4 here.Project targeted for March 31The project was started on July 21, 2017, and the first deadline was September 2019, but it had to be extended till March 2020. Later, due to the lockdown, it was further extended to September 2020 and then to March 31, 2021. — Satish Kumar, XEN, Karnal MCThe project was started on July 21, 2017, and the first deadline was September 2019, but it had to be extended till March 2020. Later, due to the lockdown, it was further extended to September 2020 and then to March 31, 2021, said Satish Kumar, XEN, KMC.So far, around 31,000 meter drain lines have been laid, while around 50 per cent work on the water harvesting systems of Saidpura and Jhanjhari has been completed. A large chunk of work is yet to be completed on the water harvesting systems in Uchana and Dholgarh.Similarly, the work of installing intermediate pumping stations is also running at slow pace as only 30 per cent work at Meera Ghati, around 15 per cent at Saidpura and 25 per cent at Sector 4 has been completed.The officials maintained that earlier last year, the agency was served notice allegedly for delay in laying the drain lines and installing water harvesting systems and intermediate pumping stations.“After joining the office, I had reviewed the projects. I observed the slow pace of the project due to a delay by the company. I had held a series of meetings with the officials of the company and pushed them to complete it by March 2021, followed by which we are hopeful that it will meet the deadline,” said Vikram Singh, Commissioner, KMC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rs-84-cr-karnal-project-work-tardy-likely-to-miss-another-deadline-212470
15-02-2021||Bijendra Ahlawat---||10 yrs on, nod to shifting of power lines||Tribune News Service Faridabad, February 14 The Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN) has finally approved the shifting of overhead 66 KV lines in the residential area of Sector-3 here after a long wait of 10 years.  The authorities have been charged with sitting over the demand despite protests and representations by residents. The HVPN, in its communication to the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on February 8, has demanded a budget of Rs 41.1 lakh for the re-routing or re-alignment of the power lines.  As the cost of the realignment will be borne by the HSVP since it carved out the colony in 1990, a tender for the work is expected to be released soon, said an official of the HVPN.  Though the demand for shifting was raised several years ago, the matter was formally taken up by the HVPN with the HSVP on December 31 last when it asked the latter to start the re-routing work of the lines. While the HSVP had sought the rough cost estimate in its letter written on January 6, the HVPN on February 8 told the HSVP that an amount of Rs 41.1 lakh is required to be deposited for the work. Rattan Lal Rana, secretary, RWA, said 90 plots having a size of 60 sq yard were carved under the 66 KV overhead line which he said was technically wrong and residents have been seeking its shifting for the past 10 years. As many as six electrocution incidents have taken place, he claimed.  Describing the overhead power line as a constant threat to human life, Subhash Lamba, president of the RWA, claimed that induction caused by lightning during rains had led to severe damage to home appliances in many houses last year. Besides shifting, the department ought to pay compensation for the loss suffered so far, he demanded. “We will start the work of shifting these power lines as soon as the money is deposited by the HSVP for release of the tender,” said ML Garg, Executive Engineer, HVPN, Faridabad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/10-yrs-on-nod-to-shifting-of-power-lines-212471

Don’t farmers know these laws are in favour of big corporates? Business on hunger will not be allowed in this country.”Tikait reiterated that the “panch” (leaders spearheading the stir) and the “manch” (stage) will remain the same.“Whatever decisions are taken by the committee are acceptable to all. Farmers of the country stand behind it,” Tikait said.Farmer leader Yudhveer Singh reiterated the drawbacks of the three agri-related laws and said the private mandi system would abolish the present mandi system.“Contract farming system is against the farmers,” he added.During the interaction with farmers, he announced his support for farmers blocking the railway tracks on February 18.Apart from Tikait, farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal and Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Charuni were also present on the occasion.Rajewal said farmers have been protesting for months but the government is not listening to their demands.Pal said over 200 farmers have sacrificed their lives during the agitation said their sacrifice will not go in vain.Farmer leader Darshan Pal said more than 200 farmers had sacrificed their lives in this protest and assured the farmers that their sacrifices would not go in vain.Balbir Singh Rajewal also hit out the Union Government for not listening to the issues of the farmers.
